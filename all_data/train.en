"We live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first victims of difficult economic times , I think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration ."
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do .
"But I think to set the scene , I want to show — the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a mess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the Guardian newspaper ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration , I should tell you how much it costs ."
So this is a game called &quot; &quot; spot the science budgets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.K. government spend .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year ."
"The science budget is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs ."
And it &apos;s one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob .
It &apos;s about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion .
That funds everything in the U.K.
"from medical research , space exploration , where I work , at CERN in Geneva , particle physics , engineering , even arts and humanities , funded from the science budget , which is that 3.3 billion , that little , tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
"That percentage , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France ."
"R &amp; D in total in the economy , publicly funded , is about 0.6 percent of GDP ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is straight from &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System , &quot; &quot; is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn , after we &apos;d finished filming &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the series ."
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
"So that big sweeping , white sphere in the corner is Saturn , which is actually in the background of the picture ."
"And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus , which is about as big as the British Isles ."
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
"this an unprocessed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , straight from Saturnian orbit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb ."
This is how we visualize that in &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wherever we find liquid water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evidence of liquid , pools of liquid , beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essentially , is maybe that &apos;s a habitat for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a graphic . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
"So it made a very low pass , just a few hundred kilometers above the surface ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space , absolutely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of Jupiter , Europa ."
"And again , we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon , as most moons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the moon Europa , which is a thick sheet of ice , probably a hundred kilometers thick ."
"But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter , and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around , we &apos;ve inferred very strongly that there &apos;s an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa ."
"So below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon ."
"It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s saltwater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined ."
"So that place , a little moon around Jupiter , is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; Are we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; Is there any other use to exploration and science , other than just a sense of wonder ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first Christmas Eve , December 24th , 1968 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by Apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
"A famous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that saved 1968 , which was a turbulent year — the student riots in Paris , the height of the Vietnam War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and Al Gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at TED , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , immovable , kind of indestructible place , but as a very small , fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not often said about the space exploration , about the Apollo program , is the economic contribution it made ."
"I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness , the economic impact of Apollo ."
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 spent on Apollo , 14 came back into the U.S. economy ."
"So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , I think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over ."
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen ."
"See , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms ."
And they saw strange pictures like this .
"What you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn &apos;t just glow like a white light , it just emits light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that &apos;s explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them .
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
"And when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they emit light at particular colors ."
"And so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s atmosphere absorbing light ."
"And again , they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down , jump up and fall down ."
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; helios &quot; &quot; — helios from the Sun .
"Now , that sounds esoteric , and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon , for example ."
"The way that silicon behaves , the fact that you can build transistors , is a purely quantum phenomenon ."
"So without that curiosity-driven understanding of the structure of atoms , which led to this rather esoteric theory , quantum mechanics , then we wouldn &apos;t have transistors , we wouldn &apos;t have silicon chips , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the basis of our modern economy ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful twist to that tale ."
"In &quot; &quot; Wonders of the Solar System , &quot; &quot; we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most distant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms — the same theory that describes transistors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; &quot; our garden &quot; &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the galactic core , which is why it &apos;s shining out so brightly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neighboring galaxies ."
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it ."
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there ."
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
"It sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the Sun ."
"And it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas ."
"And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit , and then it explodes ."
"And it explodes , and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks , and releases , not only energy , but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf ."
"Now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quote that I found — we &apos;re talking about serendipity there — from Alexander Fleming : &quot; &quot; When I woke up just after dawn on September 28 , 1928 , I certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot; &quot; Now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor ."
"And they certainly didn &apos;t intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — serendipity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can reveal quite astonishing things .
"It can also , I think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet ."
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
"But it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings ."
"And if I blow it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
"I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the Voyager spacecraft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scale .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s currently 10 billion miles away from Earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos;re still in contact with it ."
"But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune ."
"And after it visited all four of those planets , Carl Sagan , who &apos;s one of my great heroes , had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Pale Blue Dot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what Sagan wrote about it , just to finish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Consider again that dot ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"On it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives ."
"The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam ."
It &apos;s been said that astronomy &apos;s a humbling and character-building experience .
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
"To me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration ."
"The argument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 1920s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had penicillin .
You could have made it in the 1890s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the transistor .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"Surely , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
"Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s rapidly becoming a hero of mine , Humphrey Davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century ."
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
"Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate , that our triumphs are complete , that there are no mysteries in nature , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
"And it does , doesn &apos;t it ?"
I was clapping . They were clapping .
"Thank you , thank you ."
It &apos;s about time . End sequence . Take one .
15 seconds studio .
"10 , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two ..."
Philip Zimbardo : Let &apos;s tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam &apos;s temptation .
"&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , guys ."
I don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay . One bite . What the hell ? &quot;
And most of them did so without using birth control .
So much for promises .
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation .
"They cannot wait . The others , of course , wait ."
That &apos;s enormous . That &apos;s like a whole set of different IQ points .
"Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters ."
"Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language ."
"But to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China ."
"Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so ."
"I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful ."
"Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence ."
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
"Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way ."
"A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters ."
"You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy ."
"The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers ."
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Person .
"If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; &quot; — This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but I like to think that way . Whichever works for you ."
This is a tree .
Tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radicals .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
"If someone walks behind , that is &quot; &quot; to follow . &quot; &quot; As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd ."
"If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped ."
"He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale ."
"One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods ."
"Three trees together , we create the forest ."
"Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation ."
"Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; &quot; idiot . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic ."
Remember fire ?
"Two fires together , I get really hot ."
"Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames ."
"Set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning ."
"For us , the sun is the source of prosperity ."
"Two suns together , prosperous ."
"Three together , that &apos;s sparkles ."
"Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness ."
"It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night ."
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sunrise .
"A door . Put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt ."
"Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions ."
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
"This person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading ."
"On the left , we have a woman ."
"Two women together , they have an argument ."
"( Laughter ) Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery ."
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
"By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 ."
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
"So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old ."
"So after we know the characters , we start building phrases ."
"For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano ."
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
"This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China ."
"So a sun , origin together , we build Japan ."
"A person behind Japan , what do we get ?"
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
"In ancient China , that means in exile , because Chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains ."
"Nowadays , exile has turned into getting out ."
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"Here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand ."
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
"It can contemplate the meaning of infinity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of God ."
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the greatest mystery confronting human beings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
"And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about studying the brain ?"
"One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior ."
This is what I spoke about in the last TED .
"Today I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain ."
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
"Now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy , in Parma , by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
"For example , if I do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire ."
"If I reach out and pull an object , another neuron will fire , commanding me to pull that object ."
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else performing the same action ."
"So , here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something , but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something ."
And this is truly astonishing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neuron is adopting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?"
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for imitation and emulation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next slide ."
"So , how do you do imitation ? Why is imitation important ?"
"Mirror neurons and imitation , emulation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 75,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and interpret that person &apos;s behavior ."
All of that happened relatively quickly .
"Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system , which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people &apos;s actions ."
"So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations ."
"So , this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian , instead of Darwinian ."
Darwinian evolution is slow ; it takes hundreds of thousands of years .
"A polar bear , to evolve a coat , will take thousands of generations , maybe 100,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another polar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population .
This is the basis . The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization .
"Now there is another kind of mirror neuron , which is involved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch ."
"In other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires ."
"But the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when I simply watch another person being touched ."
"So , it &apos;s empathizing the other person being touched ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m touched in different locations . Different neurons for different locations ."
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
"So , here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy ."
"Now , the question then arises : If I simply watch another person being touched , why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?"
"I mean , I empathize with that person but I don &apos;t literally feel the touch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched ."
"So , empathize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you &apos;ll get confused and muddled . &quot; &quot; Okay , so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch ."
"But if you remove the arm , you simply anesthetize my arm , so you put an injection into my arm , anesthetize the brachial plexus , so the arm is numb , and there is no sensations coming in , if I now watch you being touched , I literally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings ."
"So , I call them Gandhi neurons , or empathy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
"All that &apos;s separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin ."
"Remove the skin , you experience that person &apos;s touch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
"And this , of course , is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connected not just via Facebook and Internet , you &apos;re actually quite literally connected by your neurons ."
"And there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else &apos;s consciousness .
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
"So , you have a patient with a phantom limb . If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom ."
"Now the astonishing thing is , if you have pain in your phantom limb , you squeeze the other person &apos;s hand , massage the other person &apos;s hand , that relieves the pain in your phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged ."
"So , here you have my last slide ."
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
"C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures : science on the one hand , humanities on the other ; never the twain shall meet ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness , representation of self , what separates you from other human beings , what allows you to empathize with other human beings , and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization , which is unique to human beings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe , which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can roll the video that we have .
&#91; The Himalayas . &#93; ( Music ) The flat horizon that we &apos;ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite : unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limited condition ."
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years .
"We maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales ."
"What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see ."
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world .
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do — our main space shows in the dome .
"But what you see here is the result of , actually , internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their graduate work , and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden ."
"This software allows interactive use , so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live ."
"I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , where I live , and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology ."
"And so as we move out , we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies , as we see here , light-travel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essentially backing up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a containment around us — the afterglow of the Big Bang .
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
"We &apos;ll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of containment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be meaningless , in the sense as before time ."
But this our containment of the visible universe .
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see .
"Coming back quickly , we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning , but these are positions , the latest positions of exoplanets that we &apos;ve mapped , and our sun here , obviously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the paths of Voyager 1 , Voyager 2 , Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10 , the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system ."
"Coming in closer , picking up Earth , orbit of the Moon , and we see the Earth ."
"This map can be updated , and we can add in new data ."
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
"But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases , ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon , Titan , which is larger that the planet Mercury , diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase ."
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this .
This software can also be networked between domes .
"We have a growing user base of this , and we network domes ."
And we can network between domes and classrooms .
We &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia .
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school .
"This is an image from Saturday , photographed by the Aqua satellite , but through the Uniview software ."
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
"This is , in fact , right here is the valley of Lhasa , right here in Tibet ."
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
"And just in closing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially ."
We carry that in us .
"And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"And Smith says , how would you respond ?"
How do they differ from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30 , Len was enormously successful ."
"By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader ."
"Second , in play , he &apos;s a national champion bridge player ."
"And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish ."
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
"So , that &apos;s the second path ."
"This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally ."
"Now , OK , you can open your eyes ."
"And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ?"
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
There &apos;s a group of people in Kenya .
People cross oceans to go see them .
These people are tall .
They jump high . They wear red .
And they kill lions .
"You might be wondering , who are these people ?"
These are the Maasais .
And you know what &apos;s cool ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors ."
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty ."
"My mother , my grandmother , my aunties , they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by ."
"( Laughter ) Cool , yeah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12 .
"My day started at 5 in the morning , milking the cows , sweeping the house , cooking for my siblings , collecting water , firewood ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife .
I went to school not because the Maasais &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was denied an education , and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living ."
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a policeman in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
"And whenever he came home , it was a different case ."
My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat .
She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would sell the cows , he would sell the products we had , and he went and drank with his friends in the bars ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by default , everything in my family anyway belongs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dream ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
Teachers looked nice .
"They wear nice dresses , high-heeled shoes ."
"I found out later that they are uncomfortable , but I admired it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just writing on the board — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , compared to what I was doing in the farm ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in eighth grade , it was a determining factor ."
"In our tradition , there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women , and it &apos;s a rite of passage to womanhood ."
"And then I was just finishing my eighth grade , and that was a transition for me to go to high school ."
This was the crossroad .
"Once I go through this tradition , I was going to become a wife ."
"Well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass ."
So I talked — I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out .
I talked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a stigma , people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the ceremony ."
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life .
"So he figured out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; okay , you &apos;ll go to school after the ceremony . &quot; &quot; I did . The ceremony happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of excitement .
It &apos;s a ceremony . People are enjoying it .
"And the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep ."
"The actual day came , and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in . Yes , we danced and danced ."
"We walked out to the courtyard , and there were a bunch of people waiting ."
They were all in a circle .
"And as we danced and danced , and we approached this circle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sisters and a couple of other girls , and as I approached her , she looked at me , and I sat down ."
"And I sat down , and I opened my legs ."
"As I opened my leg , another woman came , and this woman was carrying a knife ."
"And as she carried the knife , she walked toward me and she held the clitoris , and she cut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I bled . I bled ."
"After bleeding for a while , I fainted thereafter ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m lucky , I never died — but many die ."
"It &apos;s practiced , it &apos;s no anesthesia , it &apos;s a rusty old knife , and it was difficult ."
"I was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse ."
We were taken care of .
"Three weeks later , I was healed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon .
"This man was wearing a white t-shirt , jeans , camera , white sneakers — and I &apos;m talking about white sneakers ."
"There is something about clothes , I think , and shoes ."
"They were sneakers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have paved roads . It was quite attractive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I admired that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"Don &apos;t you have a husband waiting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that part ."
"Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This gentleman , he helped me ."
"While I was in high school also , my dad was sick ."
"He got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"Everybody who is my dad &apos;s age , male in the community , is my father by default — my uncles , all of them — and they dictate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman &apos;s College in Lynchburg , Virginia , and I couldn &apos;t come without the support of the village , because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket ."
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost opportunity ."
This should have been given to a boy . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .
There &apos;s a belief among our people that morning brings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there &apos;s good news in the morning ."
"And in the village also , there is one chief , an elder , who if he says yes , everybody will follow him ."
"So I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose ."
"The first thing he sees when he opens his door is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , Dad , I need help . Can you support me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I promised him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went — 16 more men — every single morning I went and visited them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to support me to come to get an education ."
"I arrived in America . As you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found snow !
"I found Wal-Marts , vacuum cleaners , and lots of food in the cafeteria ."
I was in a land of plenty .
"I enjoyed myself , but during that moment while I was here , I discovered a lot of things ."
"I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old , it was called female genital mutilation ."
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation ."
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
Those things made me angry .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my neighbors &apos; girls were getting married ."
"They were getting mutilated , and here , after I graduated from here , I worked at the U.N. , I went back to school to get my graduate work , the constant cry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; As I spoke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is blamed for that ."
"If she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she &apos;s punished ."
She &apos;s beaten .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a safe place . &quot; &quot; As we moved , and I went to talk to the fathers , the fathers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for boys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education ."
"Why can &apos;t they build a school for boys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they agreed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment ."
And they did . They donated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school .
"Angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had ."
"She &apos;s an orphan . Yes , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was older . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade ."
"Angeline had been moving from one place — because she &apos;s an orphan , she has no mother , she has no father — moving from one grandmother &apos;s house to another one , from aunties to aunties . She had no stability in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline ."
"And yes , she was older to be in fourth grade ."
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
"Five months later , that is Angeline ."
A transformation had begun in her life .
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top student when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best student , not just in our school , but in the entire division that we are in ."
That &apos;s Sharon . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s Evelyn . Five months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 125 girls will never be mutilated ."
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them opportunities where they can rise ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we &apos;ve started in our community ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are listening to me because you are here , very optimistic ."
You are somebody who is so passionate .
You are somebody who wants to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wants to see that war ends , no poverty ."
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will follow you ."
Be the first . People will follow you .
Be bold . Stand up . Be fearless . Be confident .
"Move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your community , you are going to change your country , and think about that . If you do that , and I do that , aren &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grandchildren ?"
And we will live in a very peaceful world . Thank you very much .

I have a question for you : Are you religious ?
Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person .
"Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference .
"( Laughter ) Okay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way , shape or form ? Raise your hand ."
"Okay , that &apos;s the majority ."
My Talk today is about self-transcendence .
It &apos;s just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away .
"And when that happens , the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings ."
We talk about being uplifted or elevated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor .
So here &apos;s the metaphor I &apos;m offering today .
"Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms , most of which we &apos;re very familiar with ."
But sometimes it &apos;s as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase .
We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .
"In 1902 , the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience ."
He collected all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exciting to me is this young man , Stephen Bradley , had an encounter , he thought , with Jesus in 1820 ."
And here &apos;s what Bradley said about it .
"( Music ) ( Video ) Stephen Bradley : I thought I saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms extended , appearing to say to me , &quot; &quot; Come . &quot; &quot; The next day I rejoiced with trembling ."
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die .
This world had no place in my affections .
"Previous to this time , I was very selfish and self-righteous ."
"But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could , with a feeling heart , forgive my worst enemies ."
"JH : So note how Bradley &apos;s petty , moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase ."
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .
The world &apos;s many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god .
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature .
Others overcome their self at raves .
But here &apos;s the weirdest place of all : war .
"So many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war ."
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences .
I &apos;m going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray .
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II .
( Video ) Glenn Gray : Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; passes insensibly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becomes &quot; our &quot; and individual faith loses its central importance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy .
"I may fall , but I do not die , for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life ."
It feels somehow uplifting .
This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim .
"Durkheim even called us Homo duplex , or two-level man ."
The lower level he called the level of the profane .
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .
It just means ordinary or common .
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals .
We want to satisfy our individual desires .
We pursue our individual goals .
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change .
"Individuals unite into a team , a movement or a nation , which is far more than the sum of its parts ."
"Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community ."
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
"And once people circle around some sacred object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fight to defend it ."
"Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals ."
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended .
"Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square , which brought down a dictator ."
So let me summarize where we are .
I &apos;m offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred .
So here &apos;s the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?
"Is it a product of natural selection , like our hands ?"
Well many scientists who study religion take this view .
"The New Atheists , for example , argue that religion is a set of memes , sort of parasitic memes , that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff , self-destructive stuff , like suicide bombing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves ?"
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The Descent of Man , &quot; &quot; Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got competition going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of guys on a college crew team .
Within this team there &apos;s competition .
There are guys competing with each other .
"The slowest rowers , the weakest rowers , are going to get cut from the team ."
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport .
"So within the team , their interests are actually pitted against each other ."
And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys .
Maybe he &apos;ll badmouth his chief rival to the coach .
"But while that competition is going on within the boat , this competition is going on across boats ."
They can only win if they all pull together as a team .
"I mean , these things sound trite , but they are deep evolutionary truths ."
Let me illustrate this for you .
"Suppose we &apos;ve got a group of little organisms — they can be bacteria , they can be hamsters ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s suppose that this little group here , they evolved to be cooperative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve doubled in size , you &apos;ll see them split , and that &apos;s how they reproduce and the population grows ."
"We start with just one green , and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food ."
"And in short order , the cooperators are done for ."
The free-riders have taken over .
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has solved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat .
"For example , why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA , totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism .
A superorganism can basically take what it wants .
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .
What I &apos;ve shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history .
"Darwin &apos;s laws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different ."
"It happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple , primitive nests , or hives ."
"And it happened again , even more spectacularly , in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures , they came together around a hearth or a campfire , they divided labor , they began painting their bodies , they spoke their own dialects , and eventually they worshiped their own gods ."
"Once they were all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside ."
"And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation — a force for construction and destruction ."
Look at the people in these photos I &apos;ve been showing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pursuing their self-interest ?
"Or are they pursuing communal interest , which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"Okay , so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way .
"( Music ) ( Video ) Jonathan Haidt : We humans have many varieties of religious experience , as William James explained ."
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves .
"The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected ."
"We are Homo duplex , as Durkheim explained ."
"And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection , as Darwin explained ."
"If it is an adaptation , then we evolved to be religious ."
"I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects , people and ideas ."
This is why politics is so tribal .
"Politics is partly profane , it &apos;s partly about self-interest , but politics is also about sacredness ."
It &apos;s about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the eternal struggle between good and evil , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good team ."
"And most importantly , if the staircase is real , it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life ."
"Because human beings are , to some extent , hivish creatures like bees ."
We &apos;re bees . We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment .
We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed .
Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom .
But sometimes we wonder : Is this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s missing ?
"What &apos;s missing is that we are Homo duplex , but modern , secular society was built to satisfy our lower , profane selves ."
It &apos;s really comfortable down here on the lower level .
"Come , have a seat in my home entertainment center ."
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top .
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia .
They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into .
They &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .
And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an island entire of itself .
"Every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . &quot; &quot; JH : Thank you ."

I &apos;m going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life .
But I want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
This is Hermann Goering .
"Goering was Hitler &apos;s second in command in World War II , his designated successor ."
"And like Hitler , Goering fancied himself a collector of art ."
"Hitler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his favorite artwork ever .
"World War II came to an end , and Goering was captured , tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death ."
Then the Allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him .
"Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death ."
"Six weeks into his prison sentence , van Meegeren confessed ."
But he didn &apos;t confess to treason .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi ."
I painted it myself ; I &apos;m a forger . &quot; &quot; Now nobody believed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll prove it ."
"Bring me a canvas and some paint , and I will paint a Vermeer much better than I sold that disgusting Nazi ."
He painted a beautiful Vermeer .
And then the charges of treason were dropped .
"He had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about van Meegeren , but I want to turn now to Goering , who &apos;s pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg ."
"Now Goering was , by all accounts , a terrible man ."
His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a shock .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The Supper at Emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as Vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery ."
"It was not that painting , but that painting ."
"And when that was discovered , it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psychologists — why do origins matter so much ?
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &apos;re snobs , because we &apos;re focused on status ."
"Among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an original than a forgery because there &apos;s always going to be fewer originals than forgeries ."
"that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respond to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"Rather , our response is conditioned on our beliefs , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hidden nature is ."
"I want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things ."
"So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences ."
So take food .
Would you eat this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It depends . What is it ? &quot; &quot; Some of you would eat it if it &apos;s pork , but not beef ."
Few of you would eat it if it &apos;s a rat or a human .
Some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a strangely colored piece of tofu .
That &apos;s not so surprising .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you &apos;re eating .
So one demonstration of this was done with young children .
"How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk — to think they taste better ?"
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine ?
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist .
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine .
"Everybody , of course , drinks exactly the same wine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
Or take sex .
These are stimuli I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pictures , they &apos;ll say these are fairly attractive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is male , the one on the right is female ."
"If that belief turns out to be mistaken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you &apos;re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome .
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion .
"Now often , a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic ."
But there &apos;s at least one case where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending .
This was recorded in 1931 .
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction .
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people ."
( Laughter ) The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all .
"According to an unconfirmed report , a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes ."
They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago .
"With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of factors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like ."
"So in one of our experiments , we asked people to name a famous person who they adored , a living person they adored ."
So one answer was George Clooney .
"Then we asked them , &quot; How much would you pay for George Clooney &apos;s sweater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fair amount — more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn &apos;t adore .
Then we asked other groups of subjects — we gave them different restrictions and different conditions .
"So for instance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; Look , you can buy the sweater , but you can &apos;t tell anybody you own it , and you can &apos;t resell it . &quot; &quot; That drops the value of it , suggesting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really causes an effect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; Look , you could resell it , you could boast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s thoroughly washed . &quot; &quot; That causes a huge drop in the value ."
"As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve washed away the Clooney cooties . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a duplicate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a snob and want to boast about having an original ."
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock ?
"Okay . Who here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then reported that her father was coaching her .
"When this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physically , but the history had changed ."
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
"( Violin music ) After being there for three-quarters of an hour , he made 32 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell , you have to know you &apos;re listening to Joshua Bell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
So she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
So she &apos;s struck with pity .
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from John Cage &apos;s modernist composition , &quot; 4 &apos; 33 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different views on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes .
"( Laughter ) For a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about pleasure , but what I want to suggest is that everything I &apos;ve said applies as well to pain ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts ."
One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner .
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
So it was a series of five painful shocks .
"The second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The third drops , the fourth , the fifth ."
The pain gets less .
"In the other condition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose — knows they &apos;re shocking them ."
The first shock hurts like hell .
"The second shock hurts just as much , and the third and the fourth and the fifth ."
"The most extreme example of this is that in some cases , pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure ."
"The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance .
"I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself , because the snow had melted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a movie . But I found that on the — I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Zurich , and it was about flying saucers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
And this seemed very interesting to me .
And I started reading his books after that lecture .
"And that was Carl Jung , whose name or work I had no idea about ."
Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness .
"This is a typical result that many people have presented , and there are many variations on it ."
"But this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy ."
And that hasn &apos;t changed at all .
"Whereas the personal income , on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation , has more than doubled , almost tripled , in that period ."
"But you find essentially the same results , namely , that after a certain basic point — which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level — increases in material well-being don &apos;t seem to affect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been focused more on — after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in everyday life , in our normal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I began to look at creative people — first artists and scientists , and so forth — trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expect either fame or fortune , but which made their life meaningful and worth doing ."
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the &apos; 70s .
And the interview was 40 pages long .
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview .
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well .
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ecstasy &quot; &quot; in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something ."
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines .
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement — whether it &apos;s China , Greece , the Hindu civilization , or the Mayas , or Egyptians — what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life ."
"We know the temples they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the circuses , the arenas , the theaters ."
"These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated , more ordered form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this arena , which is built like a Greek amphitheatre , is a place for ecstasy also ."
We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks , and as he does that , he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like Jennifer did in her improvisation , a new reality — that is , a moment of ecstasy — he enters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn &apos;t exist .
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration .
"But actually , our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hungry or tired .
"His body disappears , his identity disappears from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration , and at the same time to feel that he exists ."
So existence is temporarily suspended .
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any awe or wonder , because I can &apos;t compose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that obviously this automatic , spontaneous process that he &apos;s describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique ."
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can &apos;t be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field .
"Whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out ."
And because all of these people I started interviewing — this was an interview which is over 30 years old — so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the &quot; &quot; flow experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different realms .
"For instance , a poet describes it in this form ."
This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States .
"And it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state ."
"This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky — a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity , when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other activities .
"For instance , this is another student of mine , Susan Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world ."
"And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater , the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes automatically , if you merge yourself with the music , and so forth ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most recent book I wrote , called &quot; &quot; Good Business , &quot; &quot; where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical , very socially responsible ."
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job ."
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed .
"She is the founder of Body Shop , the natural cosmetics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka , who was at that time starting out Sony without any money , without a product — they didn &apos;t have a product , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart &apos;s content ."
I couldn &apos;t improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colleagues around the world , done over 8,000 interviews of people — from Dominican monks , to blind nuns , to Himalayan climbers , to Navajo shepherds — who enjoy their work ."
"And regardless of the culture , regardless of education or whatever , there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger ."
"And once the conditions are present , what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake ."
"In our studies , we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme ."
"And we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can establish an average , which is the center of the diagram ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and skill , which will be different from that of anybody else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average ."
And then the other areas become less and less positive .
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there .
"Control is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfortable , but not very excited ."
It &apos;s not very challenging any more .
"And if you want to enter flow from control , you have to increase the challenges ."
So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into .
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .
"Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your skills , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television ; the next one is being in the bathroom , sitting ."
"Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it ."
So the question we are trying to address — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice , but unfortunately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our mandate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have an interest in education .
Shakespeare being seven ?
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 21 now , my daughter &apos;s 16 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to Los Angeles .
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
"Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?"
"If I &apos;m cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the hook , if she comes in I get annoyed ."
"Take her to a dance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me .
People who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Who had to move to think .
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are embedded in a very large cosmos , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales , and that &apos;s because our brains haven &apos;t evolved to understand the world at that scale ."
"Instead , we &apos;re trapped on this very thin slice of perception right in the middle ."
So take the colors of our world .
But we &apos;re not seeing all the waves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 trillionth of what &apos;s out there ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are inherently unseeable ."
"Snakes include some infrared in their reality , and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world , and of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars to pick up on signals in the radio frequency range , and we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X-ray range ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at least not yet , because you don &apos;t come equipped with the proper sensors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology , and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that &apos;s out there ."
"Instead , our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world ."
"So in the blind and deaf world of the tick , the important signals are temperature and butyric acid ; in the world of the black ghost knifefish , its sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields ; and for the echolocating bat , its reality is constructed out of air compression waves ."
"That &apos;s the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"Now , presumably , every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something beyond what we can sense ."
Let &apos;s do a consciousness-raiser on this .
Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog .
Your whole world is about smelling .
"You &apos;ve got a long snout that has 200 million scent receptors in it , and you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules , and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air ."
Everything is about smell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your tracks with a revelation ."
"You look at your human owner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the pitiful , impoverished nose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air ?
"How can you not know that there &apos;s a cat 100 yards away , or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re humans , we &apos;ve never experienced that world of smell , so we don &apos;t miss it , because we are firmly settled into our umwelt ."
"But the question is , do we have to be stuck there ?"
"So as a neuroscientist , I &apos;m interested in the way that technology might expand our umwelt , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So the way this works is , you take a microphone and you digitize the signal , and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear ."
"Why ? It &apos;s because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley , and it &apos;s not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big secret : Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this ."
Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull .
"All it ever sees are electrochemical signals that come in along different data cables , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
And this is a very efficient kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essentially a general purpose computing device , and it just takes in everything and figures out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels ."
The brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the animal kingdom , you find lots of peripheral devices ."
"So snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared , and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors , and the star-nosed mole has this appendage with 22 fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a 3D model of the world , and many birds have magnetite so they can orient to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to continually redesign the brain .
"Instead , with the principles of brain operation established , all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals ."
Okay . So what this means is this : The lesson that surfaces is that there &apos;s nothing really special or fundamental about the biology that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to stick with , and our best proof of principle of this comes from what &apos;s called sensory substitution ."
"Now , that might sound speculative , but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in 1969 ."
Why the forehead ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern incarnation is called the brainport , and this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue , and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals , and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket , or they can navigate complex obstacle courses ."
They can come to see through their tongue .
"Now , that sounds completely insane , right ?"
"But remember , all vision ever is is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain ."
Your brain doesn &apos;t know where the signals come from .
It just figures out what to do with them .
"And we wanted to do this , given the power and ubiquity of portable computing , we wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets , and also we wanted to make this a wearable , something that you could wear under your clothing ."
So here &apos;s the concept .
"So as I &apos;m speaking , my sound is getting captured by the tablet , and then it &apos;s getting mapped onto a vest that &apos;s covered in vibratory motors , just like the motors in your cell phone . So as I &apos;m speaking ,"
the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest .
"Now , this is not just conceptual : this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth , and I &apos;m wearing the vest right now ."
So as I &apos;m speaking — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration .
I &apos;m feeling the sonic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been testing this with deaf people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feeling , they can start understanding the language of the vest ."
So this is Jonathan . He &apos;s 37 years old . He has a master &apos;s degree .
"He was born profoundly deaf , which means that there &apos;s a part of his umwelt that &apos;s unavailable to him ."
"So we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fifth day ."
Scott Novich : You .
SN : Where . Where .
DE : Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
SN : Touch . Touch .
"Now , this technology has the potential to be a game-changer , because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant , and that requires an invasive surgery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a cochlear implant , which opens up this technology globally , even for the poorest countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sensory addition ."
"How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense , to expand the human umvelt ?"
"For example , could we feed real-time data from the Internet directly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they develop a direct perceptual experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the lab .
"Then , two buttons appear , and he has to make a choice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re feeding is real-time data from the stock market , and he &apos;s making buy and sell decisions ."
( Laughter ) And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re seeing is , can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have , after several weeks , a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll report on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : During the talks this morning , we &apos;ve been automatically scraping Twitter for the TED2015 hashtag , and we &apos;ve been doing an automated sentiment analysis , which means , are people using positive words or negative words or neutral ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feeling this , and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re loving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a bigger experience than a human can normally have .
We &apos;re also expanding the umvelt of pilots .
"So in this case , the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter , so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading , and that improves this pilot &apos;s ability to fly it ."
"It &apos;s essentially like he &apos;s extending his skin up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion .
"Just imagine an astronaut being able to feel the overall health of the International Space Station , or , for that matter , having you feel the invisible states of your own health , like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome , or having 360-degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet ."
"So the key is this : As we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices ."
"We no longer have to wait for Mother Nature &apos;s sensory gifts on her timescales , but instead , like any good parent , she &apos;s given us the tools that we need to go out and define our own trajectory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Can you feel it ? DE : Yeah .
"Actually , this was the first time I felt applause on the vest ."
It &apos;s nice . It &apos;s like a massage . ( Laughter ) CA : Twitter &apos;s going crazy . Twitter &apos;s going mad .
So that stock market experiment .
"DE : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to write to NIH anymore ."
So what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one-trick pony .
It just runs certain kinds of computations on things .
"And when we look around at things like braille , for example , people are getting information through bumps on their fingers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a theoretical limit that we know the edge of .
"CA : If this checks out , you &apos;re going to be deluged ."
There are so many possible applications for this .
"Are you ready for this ? What are you most excited about , the direction it might go ?"
"So this is a way of just feeling the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re standing around ."
"So I think heavy machinery , safety , feeling the state of a factory , of your equipment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"CA : David Eagleman , that was one mind-blowing talk . Thank you very much ."
"DE : Thank you , Chris . ( Applause )"
It &apos;s really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger .
And that response is part of the problem .
"I am unable to marshal this response , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we stand before two doors .
Our computer hardware and software just stops getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to consider why this might happen .
What could stop us from doing this ?
A full-scale nuclear war ?
A global pandemic ?
An asteroid impact ?
Justin Bieber becoming president of the United States ?
But that isn &apos;t the most likely scenario .
It &apos;s not that our machines will become spontaneously malevolent .
Just think about how we relate to ants .
We don &apos;t hate them .
"Now , I suspect this seems far-fetched to many of you ."
And there are only three of them .
Intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems .
The second assumption is that we will keep going .
We will continue to improve our intelligent machines .
We want to cure diseases like Alzheimer &apos;s and cancer .
We want to understand economic systems . We want to improve our climate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"Now , just consider the smartest person who has ever lived ."
On almost everyone &apos;s shortlist here is John von Neumann .
Here we have John von Neumann .
And then we have you and me .
And it &apos;s important to recognize that this is true by virtue of speed alone .
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human drudgery .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intellectual work .
So what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be free to play Frisbee and give each other massages ."
This is a winner-take-all scenario .
"And if you haven &apos;t noticed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is how long we &apos;ve had the iPhone .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The Simpsons &quot; &quot; has been on television .
Get ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just counting down the months until the mothership lands ?
We would feel a little more urgency than we do .
"&quot; Oh , you &apos;re feeling depressed ? Just shake it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , adults get tricked this way as well , all the time ."
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people function below their actual potential ."
Why ? Because of poor emotional hygiene .
To ruminate means to chew over .
He had visible tumors all over his body .
And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
I bring you into a room .
"He gathered his participants and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can solve this problem . &quot;"
Incentivize them .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close ."
"Rewards , by their very nature , narrow our focus , concentrate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many cases ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who sponsored this research ?
The good news is that the scientists who &apos;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
Mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
"In the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management ."
Management did not emanate from nature .
Somebody invented it .
"But if you want engagement , self-direction works better ."
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian ?
And they do something incredibly cool .
"Autonomy , mastery and purpose , the building blocks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another encyclopedia got started ."
The drive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
"I &apos;ve always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
I had this irrational fear .
There were like 20 people there .
"But I took a deep breath , and I signed up to play , and I felt pretty good ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in ."
"I mean , your nervous system is an idiot ."
And something good did happen — I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this nervousness .
"That only seems authentic when I have stage fright , and the more nervous I was , the better the song would be . Easy ."
"By having a song that explained what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the audience permission to think about it ."
"And eventually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to play the stage fright song at all ."
"Except for when I was really nervous , like now . ( Laughter ) Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you ?"
( Applause ) Can I have a sip of water ?
"Imagine , if you will — a gift ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the size of a golf ball .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
It will recalibrate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
"You &apos;ll expand your vocabulary , meet new people , and you &apos;ll have a healthier lifestyle ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
You &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
"People will say to you , &quot; You look great . Have you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
"You &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled ."
Your life will have new meaning .
"Peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana ."
The price ?
"$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal ."
By now I know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a rare gem — a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma — the gift that keeps on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m okay now , I wouldn &apos;t wish this gift for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn &apos;t expect in all the ways I just shared with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was afraid of womanhood .
"Not that I &apos;m not afraid now , but I &apos;ve learned to pretend ."
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"Back in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , when I was growing up , little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft , and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy — really not quite clear what we were supposed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were plenty of role models all around us .
"We had our mothers , our aunts , our cousins , our sisters , and of course , the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a homemaker , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do girlie things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me pink outfits ."
"Instead , she knew what I needed , and she bought me a book of cartoons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I drew , and I drew , and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family , I could draw , do what I wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak — I was very shy — and I could still get approval ."
I was launched as a cartoonist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are rules out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t perform them right , even though we are imprinted at birth with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important color in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to wear — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our hair — ( Laughter ) — and how to behave .
Now the rules that I &apos;m talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture .
"We &apos;re being corrected , and the primary policemen are women , because we are the carriers of the tradition ."
We pass it down from generation to generation .
Not only that — we always have this vague notion that something &apos;s expected of us .
"And on top of all off these rules , they keep changing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it puts us in a very tenuous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these rules , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I follow them half the time , not quite aware that I &apos;m following them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with humor ?"
Humor relies on the traditions of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it twists it ."
"It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress , and it makes it unexpected , and that &apos;s what elicits a laugh ."
Now what if you put together women and humor ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground floor , and we know the traditions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table ."
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos .
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
"during the Civil Rights movement , the assassinations , the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement , and I think I was drawing , trying to figure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in chaos , and I drew to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with laughter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to wear high heels , I didn &apos;t have to wear pink , and I could feel like I fit in ."
"Now when I was a little older , in my 20s , I realized there are not many women in cartooning ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I became a cartoonist ."
"And then I thought — in my 40s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always loved political cartoons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we &apos;re following as well as laugh ? &quot; &quot; Now my perspective is a particularly — ( Laughter ) — my perspective is a particularly American perspective ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"Even though I &apos;ve traveled a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the rules that I &apos;m talking about are universal , of course — that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions , and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S."
"Consequently , we have ."
"Women , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tradition ."
We have amazing antennae .
"Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists , which I so enjoy , and it &apos;s given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth , to get at the issues quickly and succinctly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect , but through the heart ."
"My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world — countries such as Saudi Arabia , Iran , Turkey , Argentina , France — and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances .
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions , because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers , that we can have the great potential to be change-agents ."
"And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time ."
Thank you .

But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We stumbled on your video on decimals , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more primitive .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
Green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left San Francisco , where I live , on Monday , and I was getting on the plane for this conference ."
The three of us take this class together .
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
"Obviously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; If you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone helped them , they got lucky , they worked really hard ."
"Boy , it matters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard .
This is the complication .
The data shows this very clearly .
Phyllis Rodriguez : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
And it is .
"And yet , it feels natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th , 2001 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later .
"At the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my husband , Orlando , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him , if convicted , my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that , publicly ."
"Through that and through human rights groups , we were brought together with several other victims &apos; families ."
"When I saw Aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a brave woman ."
Someday I want to meet that woman when I &apos;m stronger . &quot; &quot; I was still in deep grief ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the strength .
"I knew I would find her someday , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a victim , I got immediate sympathy ."
"But when people learned what her son was accused of , she didn &apos;t get that sympathy ."
But her suffering is equal to mine .
"So we met in November 2002 , and Aicha will now tell you how that came about ."
"( Translator ) Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen ."
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .
So they introduced me to five families .
"And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were brothers , sisters ."
"And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
"I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 16 ."
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
"And I still suffer , because my son is like he &apos;s buried alive ."
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
"My son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s alive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tortured .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suffering is something positive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against terrorism ."
"I go to schools to talk to young , Muslim girls so they don &apos;t accept to be married against their will very young ."
"So if I can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
"PR : I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members — which was a very private meeting with security , because it was November 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country — those of us family members ."
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"Before we knew each others &apos; names , or anything , we had embraced and wept ."
"Then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation ."
"And Aicha started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families ."
"I know what it is to suffer , and I feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . &quot; &quot; But she reached out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ice-breaker ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connected as human beings ."
By the end of the afternoon — it was about three hours after lunch — we &apos;d felt as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , &quot; &quot; Hey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Who else can I meet that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , Aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( Translator ) AW : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous ."
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
And I hope that someday we &apos;ll all live together in peace and respecting each other .
This is what I wanted to say .
( Applause )
"In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar ."
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
"But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims ."
"When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail ."
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .
But help was coming .
"At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points ."
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
"People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store ."
Maps matter .
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
"For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone ."
"In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable ."
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
Let &apos;s look at some of the maps being created by users right now .
"So , as we speak , people are mapping the world in these 170 countries ."
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal .
"And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore ."
"This is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning ."
"This is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time ."
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet .
Welcome to the new world .

"So , I was in the hospital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very excited . I walked with him to his office ."
"And he explained to me that , when I shave , I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry ."
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
"Let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the width the same ."
"When I got back to his office , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots — not very informative ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . &quot;
"But I was still concerned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life ."
"This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? &quot; &quot; None of those happened .
"And this was very surprising to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treatments — there were many treatments I decided not to do — and I never got this guilt trip to this extent ."
But I decided not to have this treatment .
"And I went to his deputy and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
"Right , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab ."
"And when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another ."
"So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high , another group that I thought their performance would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — aside from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .
"And he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test ."
So I looked carefully at this guy .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; Fantastic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s throw him out .
"Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; Fantastic ! What a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could ."
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces ."
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens ."
"Maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account ."
Because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
"When I was doing these experiments , in my mind , I was helping science ."
I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .
"And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances ."
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
"I mean , this is all very depressing , right — people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The positive perspective , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things ."
"And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the truth of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I &apos;m going to be showing you exist .
"But first , see what a miserable lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a paradox .
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like Norway and the USA , are twice as rich as Israel , Greece , Portugal on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
There &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society ."
"This , again , is life expectancy ."
"These are small areas of England and Wales — the poorest on the right , the richest on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at relative income or social position , social status — where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us ."
"And as soon as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should immediately wonder : what happens if we widen the differences , or compress them , make the income differences bigger or smaller ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hypothetical data .
I &apos;m taking data from the U.N. — it &apos;s the same as the World Bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equal countries on the left — Japan , Finland , Norway , Sweden — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent ."
"But on the more unequal end — U.K. , Portugal , USA , Singapore — the differences are twice as big ."
"On that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder ."
"Internationally comparable data on life expectancy , on kids &apos; maths and literacy scores , on infant mortality rates , homicide rates , proportion of the population in prison , teenage birthrates , levels of trust , obesity , mental illness — which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction — and social mobility ."
We put them all in one index .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things .
"And there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I &apos;ve just shown you , which I shall use over and over again in the data ."
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
"But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita , gross national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no correlation anymore ."
"We were a little bit worried that people might think we &apos;d been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence , so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being ."
It has 40 different components put together by other people .
"It contains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what immunization rates are like , whether there &apos;s bullying at school ."
Everything goes into it .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
Highly significant relationship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in relation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relationship , no suggestion of a relationship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve shown you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in poorer countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the separate bits of our index .
"Here , for instance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
It comes from the World Values Survey .
"You see , at the more unequal end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equal societies , it rises to 60 or 65 percent ."
"And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital , very similar relationships closely related to inequality ."
"I may say , we did all this work twice ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 American states — asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?"
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality .
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
Same thing is going on .
Basically we found that almost anything that &apos;s related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others .
"And again , closely related to inequality ."
This is violence .
"These red dots are American states , and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces ."
But look at the scale of the differences .
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
"There &apos;s a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
"In some places , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more punitive sentencing , harsher sentencing ."
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
Here we have children dropping out of high school .
"Again , quite big differences ."
"Extraordinarily damaging , if you &apos;re talking about using the talents of the population ."
This is social mobility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mobility based on income .
"Basically , it &apos;s asking : do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons , or is there no relationship between the two ?"
"And at the more unequal end , fathers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.K. , USA ."
"And in Scandinavian countries , fathers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mobility .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here — if Americans want to live the American dream , they should go to Denmark ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve shown you just a few things in italics here .
I could have shown a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient .
"But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Think of the expense , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points .
"One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , whatever the outcome , seem to be the more unequal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , Sweden and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sorts of ways ."
"The position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .
"Sweden has huge differences in earnings , and it narrows the gap through taxation , general welfare state , generous benefits and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .
It has lower taxes .
It has a smaller welfare state .
"And in our analysis of the American states , we find rather the same contrast ."
"There are some states that do well through redistribution , some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax ."
"So we conclude that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your greater equality , as long as you get there somehow ."
"I am not talking about perfect equality , I &apos;m talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies ."
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are affected by inequality .
There seems to be some truth in John Donne &apos;s &quot; No man is an island . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s infant mortality .
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification .
"And so it &apos;s anachronistically a classification by fathers &apos; occupations , so single parents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social class , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s unskilled manual occupations ."
"It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies ."
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society ."
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally .
"And that seems to be the general picture — that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom , but has some benefits even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .
"More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority , of being valued and devalued , respected and disrespected ."
"And of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society ."
It also leads to status insecurity .
"We worry more about how we &apos;re judged and seen by others , whether we &apos;re regarded as attractive , clever , all that kind of thing ."
"The social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments ."
"Interestingly , some parallel work going on in social psychology : some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones , their responses to doing stressful tasks , measured ."
"And in the review , what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol , the central stress hormone ."
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .
Now we have been criticized .
"Of course , there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising ."
"I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data , we never pick and choose data ."
"We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the analysis ."
"Our data source decides whether it &apos;s reliable data , we don &apos;t ."
Otherwise that would introduce bias .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals .
"This isn &apos;t confined to these countries here , hiding a very simple demonstration ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
Well we &apos;ve shown you that GNP per capita doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on ."
What about causality ?
Correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
We spend a good bit of time .
"And indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes ."
"The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system , the cardiovascular system ."
"Or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to deal with this , we &apos;ve got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things ."
"We &apos;ve got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top ."
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can .
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us .
"Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exciting ."
Thank you .

Today I only write messages in Arabic .
"Okay , religious mania : there &apos;s rapture , there &apos;s weeping , there &apos;s visions ."
Manias can be good .
A mania for learning English .
T : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down !
T : Most importantly ... S : Most importantly ...
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .

The world has other universal languages .
How would you like to be better than you are ?
"Suppose I said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory — more precise , more accurate and quicker ."
"Or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina ."
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ?
How about living longer with good health ?
Or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity .
Which one would you like the most ?
"Which would you like , if you could have just one ?"
( Audience Member : Creativity . ) Creativity .
How many people would choose creativity ?
Raise your hands . Let me see .
A few . Probably about as many as there are creative people here .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s very good .
How many would opt for memory ?
Quite a few more .
How about fitness ?
A few less .
What about longevity ?
"Ah , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor ."
"If you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world ."
Is it just imaginary ?
"Or , is it , perhaps , possible ?"
"Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference , but I want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject ."
"The great 20th-century geneticist , T.G. Dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church , once wrote an essay that he titled &quot; &quot; Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution . &quot; &quot; Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device — I give you permission — and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you ."
"( Laughter ) But if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?"
"Does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?"
This is another look at the tree of life .
"In this picture , I &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment ."
"The human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in ."
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
"In the interval , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids ."
Some have come and gone .
"We have been here for about 130,000 years ."
"It may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same ."
Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics ?
This is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas .
"And speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?"
Maybe 10 times more .
"I mean think of it , when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?"
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
"It &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s moist , it &apos;s very cozy ."
And you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
"It &apos;s really like an Easy Street for bacteria , with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit ."
"But otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life ."
"They help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases ."
But what will come in the future ?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
"Or , are we destined to become something different — something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?"
"Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago — the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years — the first signs of proto-life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi-celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago — and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years ."
"In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on Earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small grace note ."
That was us .
"That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk , so I hope you enjoyed it ."
"( Laughter ) Now when I was a freshman in college , I took my first biology class ."
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
"I became enamored of the power of evolution , and I realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms , each cell simply divides , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells ."
"But at the time multi-celled organisms come online , things start to change ."
Sexual reproduction enters the picture .
"And very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expendable ."
"In fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction ."
"Now I have to confess , when I was a college undergraduate , I thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , I &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts ."
"I &apos;ve come to understand the sentiments of George Burns , who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s ."
"And one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door ."
He answers the door .
"Standing before him is a gorgeous , scantily clad showgirl ."
"She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;"
"&quot; That &apos;s fine , &quot; says George , &quot; I &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I came to realize , as a physician , that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory , just different ."
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to keep us healthy .
I wanted to restore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
"Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation ."
"From an evolutionary point of view , you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea ."
"I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work ."
I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived .
"It doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest ."
Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
That is the sole test of survival and success .
"At the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous-vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , I would say that there are a number of possibilities ."
The first is that we will not evolve .
We have reached a kind of equipoise .
"And the reasoning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population ."
"And secondly , we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it ."
"And by the way , we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature ."
"And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable ."
"And as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a third possibility , an enticing , intriguing and frightening possibility ."
"I call it neo-evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"Consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring ."
"They &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females ."
"It &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing ."
"Think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases ."
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
Wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
"If we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible ."
"The Human Genome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years ."
It cost 2.7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"Today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone ."
"Just a week ago , the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way — what Frances Arnold calls &quot; &quot; directed evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell — a cell potentially capable"
of becoming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses ."
"Believe it or not , there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant ."
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
"These are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be evermore possible ."
Imagine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?"
"What if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life — eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?"
Who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
"And then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super-attributes , hyper-capacities — that better memory ."
"Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine ?"
Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be irresistible .
"And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"These are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them ."
"Will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?"
"Or , will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform , or more robust and more versatile ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inherit the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wisely ?"
"For better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"One thing the world needs , one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates ."
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .
I have a suggestion .
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion .
"First , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens , Aristotle &apos;s theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle &apos;s ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lecture ?"
"According to Aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s obvious enough ."
The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why .
Take the example of flutes .
Suppose we &apos;re distributing flutes .
Who should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Who should get the best flute ?
You can just call it out .
( Audience : Random . ) Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery .
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
How many say the best flute players ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a harder question .
"Why do you think , those of you who voted this way , that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?"
Peter : The greatest benefit to all .
MS : The greatest benefit to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
That &apos;s Peter ? ( Audience : Peter . ) MS : All right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music .
"But Peter , Aristotle doesn &apos;t agree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
"He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes argue about , the purpose of the thing , or the social activity — in this case , musical performance ."
"And the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy byproduct that we &apos;ll all benefit .
"But when we think about justice , Aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing ."
"Now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case ."
Let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
It had to do with golf .
"Casey Martin — a few years ago , Casey Martin — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability ."
"He had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course ."
"In fact , it carried risk of injury ."
"He asked the PGA , the Professional Golfers &apos; Association , for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot; &quot; He sued , and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great golfer ."
I want to compete .
But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next . &quot; &quot; Suppose you were on the Supreme Court .
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"All right , let &apos;s take a poll , show of hands ."
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"All right , we have a good division of opinion here ."
"Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ?"
"Raise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a microphone ."
( Audience : It &apos;d be an unfair advantage . ) MS : It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart .
"All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage ."
How would you answer the objection ?
"Yes , all right ."
Audience : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
Charlie : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : But what about walking from hole to hole ?
Charlie : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?
"Charlie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"MS : All right . Stay there , Charlie ."
( Laughter ) Who has an answer for Charlie ?
"All right , who has an answer for Charlie ?"
What would you say ?
"Audience : The endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes ."
MS : Walking all those holes ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ( Audience : Absolutely . ) MS : What &apos;s your name ? ( Audience : Warren . ) MS : Warren .
"Charlie , what do you say to Warren ?"
Charley : I &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
Warren : I am not a golfer .
"Charley : And I am . ( MS : Okay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lower court , they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue ."
Is walking the course essential to the game ?
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .
And what do you suppose they all said ?
Yes . They agreed with Warren .
"They said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise ."
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart .
"Now , notice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Supreme Court first ."
The Supreme Court decided .
What do you suppose they said ?
"They said yes , that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart ."
"Seven to two , they ruled ."
"What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we &apos;ve just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf ."
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question .
"And Justice Stevens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but incidental ."
"Now , there were two dissenters , one of whom was Justice Scalia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have granted the cart , and he had a very interesting dissent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority &apos;s opinion .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
Justice Scalia &apos;s opinion is questionable for two reasons .
"First , no real sports fan would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the outcome of the game ."
It &apos;s also objectionable on a second ground .
"On the face of it , it seemed to be — this debate about the golf cart — an argument about fairness , what &apos;s an unfair advantage ."
"But if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution ."
"But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been , I suspect , more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA , even than making an exception for Casey Martin ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as delicately as possible : Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
"( Laughter ) After all , there &apos;s no running or jumping , and the ball stands still . ( Laughter )"
"So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes ."
"That illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it &apos;s hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essential nature of the activity in question , and what qualities , what excellences connected with that activity , are worthy of honor and recognition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a final example that &apos;s prominent in contemporary political debate : same-sex marriage ."
"There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman , and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage ."
How many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?
"And how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ?"
"The opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging ."
"So with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , Aristotle has a point ."
Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition .
"So let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that &apos;s a recipe for disagreement , and for that matter , a recipe for intolerance and coercion ."
"So better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Thank you very much . Thanks . Thank you . Chris . Thanks , Chris . Chris Anderson : From flutes to golf courses"
to same-sex marriage — that was a genius link .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pioneer of open education ."
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
"MS : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"CA : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from China and India joining in ?"
"MS : Right . We did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach , and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about 1,000 students ."
"Wouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge , Massachusetts and create a global classroom ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"So I work in marketing , which I love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gray hair ."
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
So quick show of hands — who studied some marketing in university ?
Who studied some physics in university ?
Pretty good . And at school ?
"Okay , lots of you ."
"So , hopefully this will bring back some happy , or possibly some slightly disturbing memories ."
"So , physics and marketing ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Newton &apos;s Law : &quot; The force equals mass times acceleration . &quot;
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
"( Laughter ) But if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle — a larger mass — it requires more force to change its direction ."
"It &apos;s the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning ."
And that &apos;s one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen &apos;s could stand for something other than accountancy .
"It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners , and why companies like Unilever and P &amp; G keep brands separate , like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand ."
"The marketing is , the bigger a brand , the more difficult it is to reposition it ."
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures .
"Now , who remembers Heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle ?"
Getting a little more technical now .
"So this says that it &apos;s impossible , by definition , to measure exactly the state — i.e. , the position — and the momentum of a particle , because the act of measuring it , by definition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the photon of light has momentum , which knocks the particle , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"By measuring it , the act of measurement changes it ."
The act of observation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
"So with the act of observing consumers , changes their behavior ."
"Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food ."
"And yet , McDonald &apos;s sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year ."
"Yet , at Google , we know it &apos;s the number-one searched for category ."
"So luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier ."
"Luckily , with now better point-of-sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle , because the observation changes it ."
"The marketing is — the message for marketing is — that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anticipate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning , and it will strengthen it , but it will not conclusively prove it ."
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth .
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .
"Take BP — they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident ."
Think about Toyota .
"It was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident ."
"And Tiger Woods , for a long time , the perfect brand ambassador ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis , but it &apos;s easy to disprove it — any hypothesis is shaky ."
"And the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work ."
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand .
"And lastly , to the slightly obscure world of entropy — the second law of thermodynamics ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the disorder of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of marketing .
"If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster .
But then you lose control of it .
"With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it &apos;s impossible to control where it goes ."
"Your brand starts being dispersed , ( Laughter ) it gets more chaotic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your control . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be unsettling for marketers , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand ."
"So , the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental law ."
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
"You can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .

"We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century , because during that century , our minds have altered dramatically ."
"As you all know , the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology ."
"And our minds have altered , too ."
"Now , this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive I.Q. gains over time , and these have been truly massive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I.Q. tests ."
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
"Indeed , if you score the people a century ago against modern norms , they would have an average I.Q. of 70 ."
"If you score us against their norms , we would have an average I.Q. of 130 ."
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ?
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and argue for a third alternative that &apos;s much more illuminating than either of those , and to put this into perspective , let &apos;s imagine that a Martian came down to Earth and found a ruined civilization ."
"And this Martian was an archaeologist , and they found scores , target scores , that people had used for shooting ."
"And first they looked at 1865 , and they found that in a minute , people had only put one bullet in the bullseye ."
"And then they found , in 1898 , that they &apos;d put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute ."
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye .
"And initially , that archaeologist would be baffled ."
"They would say , look , these tests were designed to find out how much people were steady of hand , how keen their eyesight was , whether they had control of their weapon ."
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible , not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thinker will help us here , and that &apos;s Luria ."
"He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical , to speculating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions ."
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews .
He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 1900 , about four years of schooling ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do crows and fish have in common ?"
"And the fellow said , &quot; &quot; Absolutely nothing ."
"You know , I can eat a fish . I can &apos;t eat a crow ."
A crow can peck at a fish .
"The other is a bird . &quot; &quot; And he was interested , effectively , in what he could do with those concrete objects ."
"And then Luria went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no camels in Germany ."
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
"And Luria said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words imply ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for camels . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem , and he was used to camels being in villages , and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical , to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany ."
"And Luria said , &quot; &quot; At the North Pole , there is always snow ."
"Wherever there is always snow , the bears are white ."
"What color are the bears at the North Pole ? &quot; &quot; And the response was , &quot; &quot; Such a thing is to be settled by testimony ."
They weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
"One of them said to Luria , &quot; &quot; How can we solve things that aren &apos;t real problems ?"
None of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few illustrations .
"First , almost all of us today get a high school diploma ."
"That is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education , and 52 percent of Americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education ."
You can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logically consistent .
"They were things like , what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in 1990 , they were all about abstractions ."
"They were things like , why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital ?"
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia .
So the tenor of education has changed .
"We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously , to use abstractions , and to link them logically ."
What about employment ?
"Well , in 1900 , three percent of Americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding ."
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
"Today , 35 percent of Americans practice cognitively demanding professions , not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer , but many , many sub-professions having to do with being a technician , a computer programmer ."
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions .
The professions have been upgraded .
"Compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training ."
They went far beyond that 1900 banker .
They had to get complicated CDO-squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset .
Or take a farmer today .
I take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of 1900 .
It &apos;s also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
"Now over the last century , in developed nations like America , moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously , and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections ."
"When I came home in 1955 from university at the time of Martin Luther King , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents ."
"My father was born in 1885 , and he was mildly racially biased ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
"And when we said to our parents and grandparents , &quot; How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the older generation says , well , our government takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously ."
"Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped , and he feels he &apos;s honor-bound to kill her ."
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
"Today we would say something like , well , imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the Koran ."
That &apos;s not one of the principles I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , universalize your principles ."
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
"You have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that ."
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted .
"And you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not treating moral principles as concrete entities ."
"You &apos;re treating them as universals , to be rendered consistent by logic ."
That &apos;s what initially got me going on cognitive history .
"If you look at the I.Q. test , you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas ."
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions .
"And in 1900 , people could do simple analogies ."
"That is , if you said to them , cats are like wildcats ."
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
"But by 1960 , people could attack Raven &apos;s on a much more sophisticated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two squares followed by a triangle , what follows two circles ?"
They could say a semicircle .
"Just as a triangle is half of a square , a semicircle is half of a circle ."
"By 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very disheartening ."
We haven &apos;t made progress on all fronts .
"We &apos;ve noticed , in a trend among young Americans , that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands , and they &apos;re essentially ahistorical ."
They live in the bubble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War II .
"Think how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fifth time Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had barely left , and there wasn &apos;t a trace in the sand ."
Or imagine how different things would be if most Americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a pessimistic note .
"Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? &quot; &quot; As if they were a reptile ."
"An image is worth more than a thousand words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a photographer , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"Whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it &apos;s bursting , as you can see in this image , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint , strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways , or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces , I &apos;m always trying to link those two fields together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
"Now as you may know , sound travels in waves , so if you have a speaker , a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal , transform it into a vibration , which is then transported through the air , is captured by our ear , and transformed into an audio signal again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound waves visible ?"
So I came up with the following setup .
"I took a speaker , I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker ."
"And now , if I would play a sound through that speaker , it would cause the crystals to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very fast , in the blink of an eye , so , together with LG , we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than 3,000 frames per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( Music : &quot; &quot; Teardrop &quot; &quot; by Massive Attack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I agree , it looks pretty amazing ."
But I have to tell you a funny story .
I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles .
"Now in Los Angeles , you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches , but I got mine indoors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re shooting at 3,000 frames per second , you need to have a silly amount of light , lots of lights ."
"What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week ."
Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances .
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ?
"Ah , some of you have . Excellent ."
Should I skip that part ?
( Laughter ) Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field , it would change its appearance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a camera pointing down at this plate , and underneath that plate , there is a magnet ."
Now I &apos;m going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet .
Let &apos;s just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more . Excellent .
So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes .
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with .
"So what happened now is , when the watercolor was flowing into the structure , the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid ."
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
So that was the second project .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper ?
"Maybe you have experienced some of those properties before , but I am talking about the physical properties , not the other ones ."
"So when I open the bottle , the alcohol molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because alcohol is a very volatile substance ."
"And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable ."
And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you &apos;re seeing right now .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey .
Add some more .
Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle .
"It goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive ."
"So the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees ."
So that &apos;s how those images were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
"Those three projects , they &apos;re based on very simple scientific phenomena , such as magnetism , the sound waves , or over here , the physical properties of a substance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way , and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us ."
Thank you very much .

"Once upon a time , at the age of 24 , I was a student at St. John &apos;s Medical College in Bangalore ."
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .
And that changed my mindset forever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset ."
"It was the brutal realization , the first morning , that the Indian students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study nerd ."
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended .
"But in St. John &apos;s , I was in the lower quarter ."
And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden .
"They read the textbook twice , or three times or four times ."
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
"( Laugher ) And that , to me , that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed ."
And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience .
It &apos;s that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the statistics , although I tried to make it funny ."
"And I will now , here , onstage , try to predict when that will happen — that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will reach that of the West ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per month , in India and China , when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States ?"
But I will start with a historical background .
And you can see my map if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West .
"That was the year when Queen Victoria was able , for the first time , to communicate with President Buchanan , through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; Twitter &quot; &quot; transatlantically .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Internet , to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot; &quot; Those are nice words . But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom ."
And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
1858 in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces .
"And that meant that foreigners , as it said in the treaty , were allowed to trade freely in China ."
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.
"And they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in contrast to India and China , maintained its national sovereignty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country ."
The size of the bubble here is the population .
"On this axis , as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar ."
"And on that axis I have life expectancy , the health of people ."
And I also bring an innovation here .
"I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological , recyclable version here , in green India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"Look here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United Kingdom was richer over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"Actually if we go back into the historical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe ."
"But 1850 had already been many , many years of foreign domination , and India had been de-industrialized ."
And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting healthy , and Japan was starting to catch up ."
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
"But really , really natural sovereignty was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . Health is getting better , United Kingdom , United States ."
But careful now — we are approaching the First World War .
"And the First World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here ."
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
"And then after the First World War , they continue up ."
"Still under foreign domination , and without sovereignty , India and China are down in the corner ."
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
"In the 1930 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expectancy ."
"And the Second World War was really a terrible event , also economically for Japan ."
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
"And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation , but in very big difficulties down there ."
( Applause ) In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after independence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
"This is the Great Leap Forward , when China fell down ."
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
"China recovered . Then they said , &quot; Nevermore , stupid central planning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to follow ."
And they were catching up indeed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low economy ."
"And we came to 1978 , and Mao Tse Tung died , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Doesn &apos;t matter if a cat is white or black , as long as it catches mice . &quot; &quot; Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cats being here , China and India , wanting to catch the mices over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy ."
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
"And they go quite closely together , and you can see that the similarity with India and China , in many ways , are greater than the differences with them ."
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the averages there — this is the average of China .
"If I would split China , look here , Shanghai has already catched up ."
Shanghai is already there .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
"But on the other hand , Guizhou , one of the poorest inland provinces of China , is there ."
"And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural , the rural part of Guizhou goes down there ."
"You see this enormous inequity in China , in the midst of fast economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another type of inequity , actually , in India ."
"The geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big ."
"Uttar Pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India ."
"Kerala is flying on top there , matching United States in health , but not in economy ."
"And here , Maharashtra , with Mumbai , is forging forward ."
"Now in India , the big inequities are within the state , rather than between the states ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequity , macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living ."
"No , there is one more inequity . Look there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) Oh , they broke my frame ."
"Washington , D.C. went out here ."
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because Washington , D.C."
is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a business opportunity for Kerala , helping fix the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the legend down there .
"And when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emerging economies of the world , which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the &quot; &quot; flat world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is putting forward , but in Africa , and other parts , as in rural Guizhou in China , there is still people with low health and very low economy ."
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast .
"Now , back to my projections ."
When will it catch up ? I have to go back to very conventional graph .
"I will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here ."
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
"And after Second World War , United States is richer than U.K."
But independence is coming here .
"Growth is starting , economic reform ."
"Growth is faster , and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; When will the catch up take place ? &quot; &quot; Look at , look at the United States ."
Can you see the bubble ?
"The bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles ."
That &apos;s the dot com bubble . This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another rock coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know ."
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We add Japan to it .
And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
"Japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high-income economies ."
"But the real projections for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"Can be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future ."
"Now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population ."
"So , social investments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the climate . We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing , and actions has to be taken , otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change ."
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy .
"But they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have largely created , and I can agree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
"Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to Asia ?"
"And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the governors of the world ?"
"So , always avoid war , because that always pushes human beings backward ."
"Now if these inequalities , climate and war can be avoided , get ready for a world in equity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vision that I got as a young student , 1972 , that Indians can be much better than Swedes , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen precisely the year 2048 in the later part of the summer , in July , more precisely , the 27th of July ."
"( Applause ) The 27th of July , 2048 is my 100th birthday ."
( Laughter ) And I expect to speak in the first session of the 39th TED India .
Get your bookings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Hi . So , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future ."
"His name is Nostradamus , although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I suspect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in precognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a fluke , and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives ."
"So firstly , thinking just about precognition , as it turns out , just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students , and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; Okay , well , fair enough , but I think that &apos;s a fluke , that &apos;s a freak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a journal ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study , and when they submitted it to the exact same journal , the journal said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interested in publishing replication . We &apos;re not interested in your negative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the academic literature , we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the dry academic field of psychology .
"It also happens in , for example , cancer research ."
"So in March , 2012 , just one month ago , some researchers reported in the journal Nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer , and out of those 53 studies , they were only able to successfully replicate six ."
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable .
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published .
"People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occasions when it works they will publish , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem , because it is a problem , because it sends us all down blind alleys , their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science , and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research .
"It also happens in the very real , flesh and blood of academic medicine . So in 1980 , some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide , and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug , a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart attack , they &apos;re quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms , so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , this will increase the chances of them surviving ."
"Early on its development , they did a very small trial , just under a hundred patients ."
"Fifty patients got lorcainide , and of those patients , 10 died ."
"Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient , and only one of them died ."
"So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published ."
"Unfortunately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks ."
"These drugs were brought to market . They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs ."
"Now actually , in 1993 , the researchers who did that 1980 study , that early study , published a mea culpa , an apology to the scientific community , in which they said , &quot; &quot; When we carried out our study in 1980 , we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance . &quot; &quot; The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publication bias ."
"That &apos;s the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost , gets unpublished , is left missing in action , and they say the results described here &quot; might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead . &quot;"
Now these are stories from basic science .
"These are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The academic publishing environment is very different now .
"There are academic journals like &quot; &quot; Trials , &quot; &quot; the open access journal , which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result ."
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent . In fact it &apos;s so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine .
"So this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that I myself have prescribed . It &apos;s an antidepressant ."
"And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug . I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , I thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was misled . In fact , seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished ."
"Three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments , and those trials were not published ."
I felt misled .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extremely unusual example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry-picking and selective referencing that I &apos;m accusing other people of ."
"But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very , very well studied ."
So here is one example of how you approach it .
"The classic model is , you get a bunch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conducted and completed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published anywhere in the academic literature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA ."
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer-reviewed academic literature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 50-50 split . Half of these trials were positive , half of them were negative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"Only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published ."
"Now if we just flick back and forth between those two , you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors , patients , commissioners of health services , and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature ."
"We were misled , and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been collected in a systematic review , published in 2010 , that took every single study on publication bias that they could find ."
Publication bias affects every field of medicine .
"About half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings ."
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine .
"If I flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses , I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a two-headed coin .
That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence-based medicine .
"And to me , this is research misconduct ."
"If I conducted one study and I withheld half of the data points from that one study , you would rightly accuse me , essentially , of research fraud ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want , we don &apos;t consider that to be research misconduct ."
"And when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers , academics , industry sponsors , journal editors , for some reason we find it more acceptable , but the effect on patients is damning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a drug called Tamiflu . Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled Tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza ."
"Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not , they found that several of those trials were unpublished ."
The results were unavailable to them .
"And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports , the 10,000-page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information , they were told they weren &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company , you can see that written up in this week &apos;s edition of PLOS Medicine ."
"And the most staggering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suffer fake fixes ."
We &apos;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fixed .
"First of all , we had trials registers , and everybody said , oh , it &apos;s okay . We &apos;ll get everyone to register their trials , they &apos;ll post the protocol , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we &apos;ll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t bother to use those registers .
"And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along , and they said , oh , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publish any journals , we won &apos;t publish any trials , unless they &apos;ve been registered before they began ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren &apos;t properly registered , and a quarter of them weren &apos;t registered at all ."
"And then finally , the FDA Amendment Act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year ."
"And in the BMJ , in the first edition of January , 2012 , you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a disaster .
We cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fix .
"We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans , including the older trials , because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years ."
"We need to publish all trials in humans , including the older trials , for all drugs in current use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Pull the knot .
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking .
And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor .
"Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter , and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago ."
"However , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking ."
"So , a superconductor is defined by two properties ."
"The first is zero electrical resistance , and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor ."
"That sounds complicated , right ?"
But what is electrical resistance ?
"So , electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material ."
"And these electrons , while flowing , they collide with the atoms , and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat , and you know that effect ."
"However , inside a superconductor there are no collisions , so there is no energy dissipation ."
It &apos;s quite remarkable . Think about it .
"In classical physics , there is always some friction , some energy loss ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum effect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconductors don &apos;t like magnetic fields ."
"So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by circulating currents ."
"Now , the combination of both effects — the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance — is exactly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always perfect , as we all know , and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under proper conditions , which we have here , these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor ."
"And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in discrete quantities ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum phenomenon . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles .
"In this movie here , you can see how they flow one by one discretely ."
"This is strands of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they behave like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their movements dissipate energy , which breaks the superconductivity state ."
"So what it actually does , it locks these strands , which are called fluxons , and it locks these fluxons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is locking itself in place ."
"Why ? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their configuration ."
So we get quantum locking . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I wrapped up so it &apos;d stay cold long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a regular magnet , it just stays locked in midair ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just levitation . It &apos;s not just repulsion ."
"I can rearrange the fluxons , and it will be locked in this new configuration ."
"Like this , or move it slightly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum locking — actually locking — three-dimensional locking of the superconductor ."
"Of course , I can turn it upside down , and it will remain locked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking , Yeah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet ."
"Why ? Because as long as it rotates , the locking is maintained ."
You see ? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor .
"We have frictionless motion . It is still levitating , but can move freely all around ."
"So , we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet ."
"But how many fluxons , how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this ?"
"Well , we can calculate it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk .
"But that &apos;s not the amazing part yet , because there is something I haven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , yeah , the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick . It &apos;s extremely thin ."
"And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight ."
It &apos;s a remarkable effect . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can extend this circular magnet , and make whatever track I want ."
"For example , I can make a large circular rail here ."
"And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail , it moves freely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can adjust its position like this , and rotate , and it freely moves in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this disk and put it here , and while it stays here — don &apos;t move — I will try to rotate the track , and hopefully , if I did it correctly , it stays suspended ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum locking , not levitation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it circulate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconductors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in MRI machines , particle accelerators and so on ."
"But we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation ."
"And we could also produce power cables , to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations ."
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable .
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand , three-inch diameter , with a single difference ."
"The superconducting layer , instead of being half a micron thin , being two millimeters thin , quite thin ."
"This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms , a small car , in my hand ."
Amazing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer ."
"My topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?"
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
"I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
"I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret ."
"My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times ."
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
"I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School ."
"I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post ."
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
"My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan ."
"( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels ."
It &apos;s everywhere .
"And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing ."
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age ."
"I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States ."
"I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns ."
"I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night ."
"He sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank ."
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
"He had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair , and he seemed so sweet ."
"One of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship ."
He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
"We started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
"Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life ."
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
"Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot; &quot; Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me ,"
"because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together ."
"I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap ."
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
"As soon as we moved to New England — you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe — he bought three guns ."
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
"He kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times ."
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
"But those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day ."
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
"I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall ."
"Five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him ."
"Despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sorry ."
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
"It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again ."
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
"The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window ."
"And then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face ."
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
"One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good company ."
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
"Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife ."
"Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons ."
"The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
"To me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser ."
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
"Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose ."
"Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial ."
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
"I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me ."
"We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot; &quot; is code for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us ."
"But since publishing &quot; &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives — joyous , happy lives — as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
"I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black lab , and I have that minivan ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me ."
"Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
"Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now ."
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
"It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you ."
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
"Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family ."
"Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures ."
"Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out ."
"Together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it ."
This is my supermarket .
"One consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke ."
"We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones ."
These are cell phones of the future .
"My favorite is the middle one — the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch ."
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
Third : escalation of expectations .
You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
"I had very low , no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor ."
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
"With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure ."
"And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse ."
So let me remind you .
There &apos;s some magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness these days .
"There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers ."
There is a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
"This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is ."
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cognitive trap ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound ."
"And then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience ."
But it hadn &apos;t .
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
"They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep ."
"There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present ."
"It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches — you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness ."
"Now , the remembering self is a storyteller ."
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories — it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me begin with one example .
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
"Here are two patients , those are their recordings ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"Clearly , Patient B suffered more — his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
And here is a surprise .
The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
"The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends ."
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great — but one of them is this distinct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory ."
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
"From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much ."
"That will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings ."
"Endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated ."
"Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously ."
"It has moments of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really straightforward : They are lost forever .
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
"And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
"And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us ."
"From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
"We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences ."
We think of our future as anticipated memories .
"I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self ."
And this is a bit hard to justify I think .
"I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?"
That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half ."
There seems to be a discrepancy .
"Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything ."
Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness ."
"There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
"And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time ."
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
Very different notion .
"Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way ."
"The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately ."
"So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"Just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 ."
"What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his height ?"
You have that much uncertainty .
So the correlation is low .
We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , goals are very important ."
"We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like ."
"There are other pleasures , but this is dominant ."
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
It is a completely different notion .
"Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer ."
"Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey ."
"When we looked at how feelings , vary with income ."
"And it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans — and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample — below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ..."
"CA : 60,000 ."
"DK : 60,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get ."
"Above that , we get an absolutely flat line ."
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
"Clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you earn , the more satisfied you are ."
That does not hold for emotions .
"CA : But Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness ."
"If people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth ."
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
"This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics ."
"CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at least should be — the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a varied talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to spin a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a convenient starting place ."
"The talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
"You take about eight or so carbon atoms , about 20 hydrogen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid : very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little pocket map of where it &apos;s all located .
A bigger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"Oh , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1000 meters below where you &apos;re all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world ."
"Come talk to me about it , I &apos;ll fill in some of the details if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? Where is it in the energy system ?
"Here &apos;s a little snapshot of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little secret I &apos;m going to tell you about : For the last 25 years , oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems ."
"There was one kind of peak oil in 1985 , when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 35 percent ."
It &apos;s been declining and I believe it will continue to decline .
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining .
So oil is playing a less significant role every year .
"And so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 1920s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
And what &apos;s been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?
"Well , a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear , for starters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas , and beyond that , peak renewables ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pretending that energy use in total isn &apos;t increasing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . Come talk to me about it , we &apos;ll fill in some of the details — but there &apos;s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been systematically decarbonizing our energy system ."
"Energy systems of the world becoming progressively — year on year , decade on decade , century on century — becoming less carbon intense ."
"And that continues into the future with the renewables that we &apos;re developing today , reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — Okay , we just replace it all with conventional renewables — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond .
"What is the future of truly sustainable , carbon-free energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little excursion , and we &apos;ll start in central Texas ."
Here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
"I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas ."
It &apos;s about 400 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of chalk ."
I picked this up at MIT . It &apos;s a little younger .
"And it &apos;s different than this limestone , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this ."
"Yeah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate ."
What &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of neat , the story gets really neat right now ."
Off the coast of California comes this : It &apos;s an abalone shell .
"Now , millions of abalone every year make this shell ."
"Oh , by the way , just in case you weren &apos;t already guessing , it &apos;s calcium carbonate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this ."
"And why ? Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers , making this beautiful , iridescent mother of pearl ."
"Very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredible stuff .
"All the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the molecules are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of coal .
And I &apos;ll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fuels or energy carriers , or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells , nature hasn &apos;t ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"Nature didn &apos;t need to because , unlike the abalone shell , the survival of a species didn &apos;t depend on building those materials , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a bajillion windmills .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas — they had ideas , innovations , technology — and the Stone Age ended , not because we ran out of stones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s innovation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we run out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both challenged and excited .
TR : Thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achieve something ?"
"Somebody who &apos;s working for you , or a partner , or even yourself ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you correct me if I &apos;m wrong .
"Who &apos;s been there ? Say , &quot; &quot; Aye . &quot; &quot; Audience : Aye ."
We need variety . We need surprise .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we assume ?
"Or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?"
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
"Year after year , after year , they &apos;re more innovative than all their competition ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great orator of the day ."
"And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern ."
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
"All I did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea ."
I call it the golden circle .
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
Let me define the terms really quickly .
"Every single person , every single organization on the planet knows what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do ."
"By &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your purpose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
I use Apple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly ."
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
"&quot; &quot; Everything we do , we believe in challenging the status quo ."
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
"But we &apos;re also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple , or a phone from Apple , or a DVR from Apple ."
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products .
"A few years ago , Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs ."
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs .
Nobody bought one .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
"Not psychology , biology ."
"Our newest brain , our Homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language .
"The middle two sections make up our limbic brains , and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings , like trust and loyalty ."
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hire people who believe what you believe .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
"And Samuel Pierpont Langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success ."
Money was no problem .
He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic .
"The New York Times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for Langley ."
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
"The difference was , Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief ."
"They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
"And lo and behold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the paycheck .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get famous , so he quit ."
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ?
The next 13.5 % of our population are our early adopters .
"And these guys , the innovators and the early adopters , they &apos;re comfortable making those gut decisions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe ."
"So let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation ."
It &apos;s a commercial example .
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went IPO , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it &apos;s never traded above 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gift .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We followed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
"Leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us ."
"I ’ m going around the world giving talks about Darwin , and usually what I ’ m talking about is Darwin ’ s strange inversion of reasoning ."
"Now that title , that phrase , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to deal , Absolute Ignorance is the artificer ; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system , that , in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine , it is not requisite to know how to make it ."
"This proposition will be found on careful examination to express , in condensed form , the essential purport of the Theory , and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin ’ s meaning ; who , by a strange inversion of reasoning , seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill . &quot; &quot; Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion ."
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it : &quot; &quot; Test Two : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a builder ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any painting that didn ’ t have a painter ? Yes / No .
Do you know of any car that didn ’ t have a maker ? Yes / No .
"If you answered &apos; Yes &apos; for any of the above , give details . &quot; &quot; A-ha ! I mean , it really is a strange inversion of reasoning ."
You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer .
But Darwin shows that it ’ s just false .
"Today , though , I ’ m going to talk about Darwin ’ s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy .
We adore babies because they ’ re so cute .
"And , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny ."
This is all backwards . It is . And Darwin shows us why .
"Let ’ s start with sweet . Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector , because sugar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wired up to the preferer , to put it very crudely , and that ’ s why we like sugar ."
"Honey is sweet because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because honey is sweet . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey ."
"If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind , you wouldn ’ t see why they tasted sweet ."
You have to look in our brains to understand why they ’ re sweet .
"So if you think first there was sweetness , and then we evolved to like sweetness , you ’ ve got it backwards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way round ."
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved .
And there ’ s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then Mother Nature would have a problem : How on earth do you get chimps to mate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a solution : hallucinations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quicker way ."
"Just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"Over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways ."
"We became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we hadn ’ t , then probably this would be the height of sexiness ."
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food .
It wasn ’ t designed for chocolate cake .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
"The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen , who did his famous experiments with gulls , where he found that that orange spot on the gull ’ s beak — if he made a bigger , oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder ."
"It was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it ."
"What we see with , say , chocolate cake is it ’ s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring ."
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one .
There &apos;s lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness .
And there &apos;s even supernormal stimuli for cuteness . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy diapers ."
"So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby ."
So nature works on many levels here .
"But now , if babies didn ’ t look the way they do — if babies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find adorable , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , oh my goodness , do I ever want to hug that ."
This is the strange inversion .
"Well now , finally what about funny . My answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t obvious . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think evolutionarily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s dirty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a powerful , inbuilt reward for it when we succeed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colleagues ."
It ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to spell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off , by turning the knob on a joke — now it ’ s not funny ... oh , now it ’ s funnier ..."
"now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not funny — in this way , we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain , the functional architecture of the brain ."
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this . We call it the Hurley Model .
"He ’ s a computer scientist , Reginald Adams a psychologist , and there I am , and we ’ re putting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal ."
It takes guts to stand out like that .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
"And what a perfect place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
"But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change yours ."
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
"And unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it ."
That guy made a mistake .
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart .
People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying .
"And when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty profound statement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to handle life &apos;s challenges .
"( Applause ) Chris Anderson : This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Never before has the phrase &quot; &quot; I am British &quot; &quot; elicited so much pity . ( Laughter )
"So that was an immense shock for me , and it was an immense shock for many people , but it was also something that , over the following several days , created a complete political meltdown in my country ."
Everybody was blaming everybody else .
That complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of it : levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain at a level that I have never seen before in my lifetime .
"People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England , or , as one of my colleagues put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the Atlantic Ocean ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the degree of shock that we &apos;ve experienced since ?"
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions .
"First , what does Brexit represent , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respond ?
"So first , what does Brexit represent ?"
Hindsight is a wonderful thing .
Brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The vote split along lines of age , education , class and geography ."
"Geographically , it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the European Union , while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence ."
"But more profoundly , the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today ."
Contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about tax and spend .
It &apos;s about globalization .
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that fear globalization .
But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation .
They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject .
The blue areas show Remain and the red areas Leave .
It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand .
"In the Leave vote , a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred , creating lies and mistrust around , for instance , the idea that the vote on Europe could reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe , when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the European Union ."
But for a significant majority of the Leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment .
This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world .
"We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States , with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary , with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France ."
The specter of Brexit is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about creating liberal , open , tolerant societies , we urgently need a new vision , a vision of a more tolerant , inclusive globalization , one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind ."
That vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization .
"The consensus amongst economists is that free trade , the movement of capital , the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggregate ."
But globalization also has redistributive effects .
It creates winners and losers .
"In 2002 , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Kofi Annan , gave a speech at Yale University , and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization ."
That was the speech in which he coined that term .
"But amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008 , the concept disappeared almost without a trace ."
Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
It &apos;s perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scientist , that social science offers some places to start ."
"Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point ."
The first relates to the idea of civic education .
What stands out from Brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies ?
"It has to begin with education , but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps ."
The second thing that I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities .
"So for instance , London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants , and they are also by far the most tolerant areas ."
It &apos;s those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants .
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking .
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization .
I am still British .
I am still European .
I am still a global citizen .
"For those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive , we have to all work together to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t leave people behind ."
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so .
I talked about spaghetti sauce .
"And so many people , I guess , watch those videos ."
"People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce , which is a wonderful thing in the short term — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s proven to be less than ideal over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me .
( Laughter ) The theme of this morning &apos;s session is Things We Make .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era .
And the man &apos;s name is Carl Norden .
Carl Norden was born in 1880 .
And he was Swiss .
"And of course , the Swiss can be divided into two general categories : those who make small , exquisite , expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small , exquisite , expensive objects ."
And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp .
He &apos;s an engineer .
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich .
"In fact , one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small , expensive , exquisite objects ."
"And he &apos;s a Swiss engineer , Carl ."
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word .
"He wears three-piece suits ; and he has a very , very small , important mustache ; and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego ; and he works 16-hour days ; and he has very strong feelings about alternating current ; and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness ; and he drinks lots of coffee ; and he does his best work sitting in his mother &apos;s kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule ."
"In any case , Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan ."
And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before GPS and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plane that &apos;s thousands of feet up in the air , going at hundreds of miles an hour , and you &apos;re trying to drop an object , a bomb , towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments ."
"And all sorts of people , moving up to the First World War and between the wars , tried to solve this problem , and nearly everybody came up short ."
The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code .
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device .
It weighs about 50 lbs .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings and gadgets and gauges .
And he makes this complicated thing .
"And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object , visually sight the target , because they &apos;re in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber , and then they plug in the altitude of the plane , the speed of the plane , the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb .
"And as Norden famously says , &quot; &quot; Before that bombsight came along , bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like manna from heaven .
"Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War , where millions of men fought each other in the trenches , getting nowhere , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy ."
And the U.S. military spends 1.5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 1940 dollars — developing the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in perspective , the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars ."
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .
"And there were people , strategists , within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese ."
"And for Norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because Norden was a committed Christian ."
"In fact , he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention , because in his eyes , only God could invent things ."
He was simply the instrument of God &apos;s will .
And what was God &apos;s will ?
Well God &apos;s will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .
"So in the years leading up to the Second World War , the U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $ 14,000 each — again , in 1940 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them — long extensive , months-long training sessions — because these things are essentially analog computers ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath , to swear that if they &apos;re ever captured , they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy , because it &apos;s imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology ."
"And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane , it &apos;s escorted there by a series of armed guards ."
And it &apos;s carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards .
It &apos;s never allowed to be photographed .
"And there &apos;s a little incendiary device inside of it , so that , if the plane ever crashes , it will be destroyed and there &apos;s no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail .
So what happens during the Second World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the Holy Grail ."
"In practice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perfect conditions ."
"And of course , in wartime , conditions aren &apos;t perfect ."
"First of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer ."
"Secondly , it breaks down a lot ."
"It &apos;s full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle ."
"Thirdly , when Norden was making his calculations , he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down ."
So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those conditions .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are clouds , right ."
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate .
Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was , there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna , Germany ."
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres .
"And over the course of 22 bombing missions , the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs on this 757 acre chemical plant , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that landed , 16 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were duds ."
"The Leuna chemical plant , after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war , was up and running within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis ?"
"Well it turns out that Carl Norden , as a proper Swiss , was very enamored of German engineers ."
"So in the 1930s , he hired a whole bunch of them , including a man named Hermann Long who , in 1938 , gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they &apos;ve invented gadgets that will forever change our world ."
They &apos;ve invented websites that will allow people to be free .
"They &apos;ve invented some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better ."
"If you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of Carl Nordens as well ."
"If you go to the Pentagon , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very clear about how little that means .
"In the Iraq War , at the beginning of the first Iraq War , the U.S. military , the air force , sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor ."
"And their mission was to find and to destroy — remember the Scud missile launchers , those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis ?"
The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers .
"And so they flew missions day and night , and they dropped thousands of bombs , and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an audit done — as the army always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many Scuds did we actually destroy ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"Zero , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
Is it because their weapons weren &apos;t accurate ?
"Oh no , they were brilliantly accurate ."
"They could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the Scud launchers were .
"The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel , it &apos;s knowing how to find the pickle barrel ."
That &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
Or take the battle in Afghanistan .
What is the signature weapon of the CIA &apos;s war in Northwest Pakistan ?
It &apos;s the drone . What is the drone ?
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
"And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan , the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles , and it &apos;s used those drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants ."
Now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
We think we &apos;re now at 95 percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes .
"95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?"
That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare .
But do you know what the crucial thing is ?
"In that exact same period that we &apos;ve been using these drones with devastating accuracy , the number of attacks , of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks , against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold ."
"As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them , they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us ."
I have not described to you a success story .
I &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the accuracy of the bombs you have , it &apos;s how you use the bombs you have , and more importantly , whether you ought to use bombs at all ."
There &apos;s a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight .
"And that is , on August 6 , 1945 , a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima ."
"And as was typical with the Norden bombsight , the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"the air force &apos;s 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"Meanwhile , back in New York , no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima ."
He was a committed Christian .
He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war .
It would have broken his heart .

"( Applause ) Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007 , and when her efforts were honored in 2011 , and she was given the national youth peace prize , and she became a very famous , very popular young girl of her country ."
"Before that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father ."
"Ladies and gentlemen , if we glance to human history , the story of women is the story of injustice , inequality , violence and exploitation ."
"You see , in patriarchal societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her birth is not celebrated ."
"She is not welcomed , neither by father nor by mother ."
"The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father ."
And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child .
"When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad ."
"When she gives birth to the second daughter , she is shocked , and in the expectation of a son , when she gives birth to a third daughter , she feels guilty like a criminal ."
"Not only the mother suffers , but the daughter , the newly born daughter , when she grows old , she suffers too ."
"At the age of five , while she should be going to school , she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school ."
She can have fun .
"She can play with her friends in the streets , and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly ."
"But when she enters her teens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort ."
She is confined under the four walls of her home .
She is no more a free individual .
"She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed ."
"So this brother , he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor ."
"A good girl is supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very submissive ."
It is the criteria .
The role model good girl should be very quiet .
"She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them ."
"If she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient ."
"If she is married very early , she has to accept ."
"Otherwise , she will be called disobedient ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a poetess , she is wedded , bedded , and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters ."
"And it is the irony of the situation that this mother , she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons ."
"And this vicious cycle goes on , goes on ."
"Dear brothers and sisters , when Malala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like newborn children , to be honest , but when I went and I looked into her eyes , believe me , I got extremely honored ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan ."
"Her name was Malalai of Maiwand , and I named my daughter after her ."
"A few days after Malala was born , my daughter was born , my cousin came — and it was a coincidence — he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Yousafzai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I picked my pen , drew a line from my name , and wrote , &quot; &quot; Malala . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I admitted her in my school ."
"You will be asking , then , why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school ?"
"Yes , I must mention it ."
"It may be taken for granted in Canada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl ."
Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name .
Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life .
"I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be astonished , two weeks before , when I was filling out the Canadian visa form , and I was filling out the family part of the form , I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters ."
That was the reason that I valued my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter .
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings .
"And all these good values , I tried to inculcate in her personality ."
"And this was not only she , only Malala ."
"I imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well ."
I used education for emancipation .
"I taught my girls , I taught my girl students , to unlearn the lesson of obedience ."
I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor .
"Dear brothers and sisters , we were striving for more rights for women , and we were struggling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new phenomenon .
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women &apos;s rights .
It was called Talibanization .
"It means a complete negation of women &apos;s participation in all political , economical and social activities ."
Hundreds of schools were lost .
Girls were prohibited from going to school .
Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets .
"Musicians were silenced , girls were flogged and singers were killed ."
"She wrote a diary for the BBC blog , she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries , and she spoke from every platform she could ."
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
It spread like a crescendo all around the world .
"And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign , and on October 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point blank range ."
It was a doomsday for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black hole .
"While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whispered into the ears of my wife , &quot; &quot; Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she abruptly told me , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t blame yourself ."
You stood for the right cause .
"You put your life at stake for the cause of truth , for the cause of peace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you ."
"You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot; &quot; These few words meant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When Malala was in the hospital , and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down , I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife ."
But my daughter never complained .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be okay . Please don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; She was a solace for us , and she consoled us ."
"Dear brothers and sisters , we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16-year old girl ."
She cries when her homework is incomplete .
"She quarrels with her brothers , and I am very happy for that ."
"People ask me , what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
Ask me what I did not do .
"I did not clip her wings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
"When we go to the physician today — when we go to the doctor &apos;s office and we walk in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
"Diabetes , cancer , Parkinson &apos;s , Alzheimer &apos;s , heart failure , lung failure — things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there &apos;s relatively little that can be done ."
"And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn &apos;t , and where we are clinically today , and where we might go tomorrow , and what some of the hurdles are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I promise ."
"I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it ."
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a damaged hip , you can put an artificial hip in ."
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that theme a few times — instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue ."
"So that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment ."
Very few good ideas — if you agree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly novel .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Charles Lindbergh , who was better known for flying airplanes , was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel , one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller , to begin to think about , could you culture organs ?"
"And they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe ."
"One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older ."
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 .
"And you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asthma ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 55 , now the average person is looking at diabetes , early-onset diabetes , heart failure , coronary artery disease — things that are inherently more difficult to treat , and much more expensive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot; &quot; In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree ."
"41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease ."
"In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S."
"And this is matched in every industrialized , wealthy country in the world ."
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age versus cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a sudden spike in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spike ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging ."
"I &apos;d suggest there are four things , and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system ."
All those things do is change who pays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that anymore . It &apos;s too depressing .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom ."
"Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance ."
"Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?"
"We diagnose the disease eventually , once it becomes symptomatic , and then we treat the symptom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
"But eventually it stops working , and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease ."
"Why couldn &apos;t we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?"
"And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different ."
"This video , I think , gets across the concept that I &apos;m talking about quite dramatically ."
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
"If a newt can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that tomorrow — and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the foreseeable future — we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation ."
"There &apos;s a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that &apos;s come back from Iraq ."
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs .
"Imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb ."
It &apos;s a wild concept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .
"But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus .
"A mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy , will re-grow that limb ."
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lose their fingertip in an accident , they &apos;ll re-grow their fingertip ."
"By the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that anymore ."
"So to engage in that conversation with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .
The first is cellular therapies .
"Clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing ."
"Secondly , we can use materials ."
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
"If we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materials ."
Steve Badylak — who &apos;s at the University of Pittsburgh — about a decade ago had a remarkable idea .
"And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and I place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it weren &apos;t compelling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a compelling picture .
"( Laughter ) However , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish — even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends — the lights are down . This is a good time to look at your feet , check your Blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
And although — it &apos;s good to laugh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diabetes .
"I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics , diabetic ulcers , we just don &apos;t connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment , which is amputation , if you can &apos;t heal it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the slide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
"This is an older lady . She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body intact ."
"And this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented ."
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
"If the horse was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this slide ."
The horse just has another nostril that &apos;s developed because of a riding accident .
"Just a few weeks after treatment — in this case , taking that material , turning it into a gel , and packing that area , and then repeating the treatment a few times — and the horse heals up ."
"And if you took an ultrasound of that area , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
"There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds ."
Could you regenerate a limb ?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
This is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches .
But could you go a little further ?
"Could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio-degradable material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
"He chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish ."
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .
"Again , if you &apos;re squeamish , you don &apos;t want to watch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
"So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the bypass operation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient ."
And I &apos;m standing up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"Here go the stem cells , right into the beating heart of the patient ."
"And if you look really carefully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a back-flush ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sorts of new technology , new devices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a randomized trial .
At this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"Basically , if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic ."
These are now two years out .
"The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early , and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those details , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less sick , and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy ."
"Here &apos;s another example of stem-cell therapy that isn &apos;t quite clinical yet , but I think very soon will be ."
"This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that liposuction fluid , which — in the United States , we have a lot of liposuction fluid ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
"So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck ."
"Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons ."
All done in the lab .
"And I think fairly soon , you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived , or adipose-derived , stem cells ."
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
"We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq ."
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about burn , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
Everything that is done to treat burn — basically we do a sodding approach .
"We make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , wearable bio-reactor has been designed — it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR — by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh ."
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
"The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment , deliver other things as well at the same time , and therefore we will seed that lawn , as opposed to try the sodding approach ."
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
"So let me finish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no coincidence .
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area .
"The European Union , same thing ."
"China , the same thing ."
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
"( Laughter ) Oh , for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president ."
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .
"And I &apos;m going to finish up with a quote , maybe a little cheap shot , at the director of the NIH , who &apos;s a very charming man ."
"Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very testy meeting , what the NIH director said was , &quot; Your vision is larger than our appetite . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to close by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appetite ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request .
"I &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40 .
"Up until that moment , I had been that classic corporate warrior — I was eating too much , I was drinking too much , I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance ."
"So I stepped back from the workforce , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children ."
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance ."
And I have four observations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate ."
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
"All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue , which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family ."
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and &#91; a &#93; T-shirt isn &apos;t really getting to the nub of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren &apos;t going to solve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead .
"If you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance ."
"It &apos;s particularly important — this isn &apos;t on the World Wide Web , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fired — it &apos;s particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies — the &quot; &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their DNA ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-intentioned companies ."
"On the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened ."
"On the other hand , it &apos;s a nightmare — it just means you spend more time at the bloody office ."
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life .
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance .
"Before I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to ."
And it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
( Laughter ) Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
( Applause ) How often do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , I &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too short ; &quot; &quot; after I retire &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A fourth observation : We need to approach balance in a balanced way .
"A friend came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a friend came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; Nigel , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I commute two hours a day .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a grip and sort it out .
"So I joined a gym . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn &apos;t more balanced ; it &apos;s more fit . ( Laughter )"
"Lovely though physical exercise may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intellectual side ; there &apos;s the emotional side ; there &apos;s the spiritual side ."
"And to be balanced , I believe we have to attend to all of those areas — not just do 50 stomach crunches ."
Now that can be daunting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; Bloody hell mate , I haven &apos;t got time to get fit ."
You want me to go to church and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
"My wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; &quot; Nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; &quot; — Harry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening ."
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates .
"We walked down to the local park , messed around on the swings , played some silly games ."
"I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe , and we shared a pizza for two , then walked down the hill to our home , and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas ."
"I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl &apos;s &quot; &quot; James and the Giant Peach . &quot; &quot; I then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , &quot; &quot; Goodnight , mate , &quot; &quot; and walked out of his bedroom ."
"As I was walking out of his bedroom , he said , &quot; &quot; Dad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Yes , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; Dad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t done anything , hadn &apos;t taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
"With the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life ."
"Moreover , I think , it can transform society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading ."

I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve invaded every country we &apos;ve encountered .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s leaving millions of children behind .
It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg .
America spends more money on education than most other countries .
Class sizes are smaller than in many countries .
"The trouble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direction ."
"There are three principles on which human life flourishes , and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure ."
How about two children or more ? Right .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
Aren &apos;t they ?
What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
I &apos;m not here to argue against science and math .
"A real education has to give equal weight to the arts , the humanities , to physical education ."
ADHD .
"It &apos;s a real achievement to put that particular ability out , or to stifle it ."
Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools .
"An old friend of mine — actually very old , he &apos;s dead ."
There he is . He &apos;s dieting .
The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning .
They should be diagnostic . They should help .
"So in place of curiosity , what we have is a culture of compliance ."
Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity .
"I mean , you may have a dog ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t listen to Radiohead , does it ?"
"Instead , what we have is a culture of standardization ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in Finland .
Many states in America have fewer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sailing into a headwind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography .
They may find it boring .
They &apos;re very personalized .
And they work .
"Culture is an organic term , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the winter of 2004 , it rained in Death Valley ."
Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period .
The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while .
Great leaders know that .
"And if the movement is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a revolution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people reach success and then fail ?
"One of the big reasons is , we think success is a one-way street ."
"So we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"Reaching success , I worked hard , I pushed myself ."
"But then I stopped , because I figured , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I made it ."
"I can just sit back and relax . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I always tried to improve and do good work ."
"But then I stopped because I figured , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot; &quot; Reaching success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I stopped , because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like magic ."
And the only thing that came was creative block .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"Reaching success , I always focused on clients and projects , and ignored the money . Then all this money started pouring in ."
And I got distracted by it .
"And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent , when I should have been talking to my clients ."
"And reaching success , I always did what I loved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like management . I am the world &apos;s worst manager , but I figured I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the president of the company ."
"Well , soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was , outwardly very successful , but inwardly very depressed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fix it .
I bought a fast car .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was faster but just as depressed .
"So I went to my doctor . I said , &quot; &quot; Doc , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depressed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy Prozac . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti-depressants ."
"And yeah , the black cloud faded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just floating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if clients ever called ."
( Laughter ) And clients didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer serving them , I was only serving myself ."
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for business to drop like a rock ."
"My partner and I , Thom , we had to let all our employees go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no employees , there was nobody for me to manage ."
So I went back to doing the projects I loved .
"I had fun again , I worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , business grew bigger than ever ."
"And when I went back to following these eight principles , the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether ."
"And I woke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need Prozac anymore . &quot;"
And I threw it away and haven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
"And if we want to avoid &quot; &quot; success-to-failure-syndrome , &quot; &quot; we just keep following these eight principles , because that is not only how we achieve success , it &apos;s how we sustain it ."
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Can we , as adults , grow new nerve cells ?"
So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their functions ?
"First , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and memory ."
The answer is yes .
And we are now going to do a little quiz .
Are we ready ?
"OK , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
Increasing ?
How about stress ?
"Yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus ."
"Indeed , it will decrease neurogenesis ."
"Oh , wow !"
How about getting older ?
"And then finally , how about running ?"
I will let you judge that one by yourself .
"So activity impacts neurogenesis , but that &apos;s not all ."
Ethanol — intake of alcohol — will decrease neurogenesis .
MH : I &apos;m really interested in the running thing .
Do I have to run ?
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The British Empire &quot; &quot; &#93; Imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships ."
But the Victorians actually did it .
What they did was amazing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
"In order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
They must be identical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head ."
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional .
The Victorians were great engineers .
"They engineered a system that was so robust that it &apos;s still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists ."
"The empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; Schools as we know them are obsolete &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong comment there .
"I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re obsolete ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
It &apos;s quite fashionable to say that the education system &apos;s broken .
It &apos;s not broken . It &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it anymore . It &apos;s outdated .
What are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
"Well , the clerks are the computers ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every office .
And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs .
Those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read discerningly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wherever they want , whenever they want , in whatever way they want ."
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
"Well , I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident ."
"I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a slum ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?"
Or should they not ?
"At the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers ."
"And my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Internet was ."
The children came running in .
"It was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you wish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"About eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s impossible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; My colleagues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solution ."
"One of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I repeated the experiment . I went 300 miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little . ( Laughter ) I repeated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to stay , so I stuck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a faster processor and a better mouse . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an irritated voice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; teach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so casually ."
Here &apos;s a short glimpse from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the Hole in the Wall .
On your right is an eight-year-old .
To his left is his student . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
"Then onto other parts of the country , I repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Hole in the wall film - 1999 &quot; &quot; &#93; An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do .
"And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a processor inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publishing ."
"I published everywhere . I wrote down and measured everything , and I said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was curious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation ."
"There &apos;s one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad , and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs ."
"I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; Keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this ."
Computer : Nice to meet you.Child : Nice to meet you .
Sugata Mitra : The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her .
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Where does it stop ?
I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
"I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis ."
"Tamil is a south Indian language , and I said , can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a zero ."
"I &apos;ll spend a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another zero ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the lab and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called Kallikuppam in southern India .
"I put in Hole in the Wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came rushing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very topical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pedagogical method , so I applied that . I said , &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t the foggiest idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a zero . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I expect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We haven &apos;t given up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken Tamil and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease , we haven &apos;t understood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tested them ."
"I got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a decade ahead of their time ."
Absurd . But I had to follow the Victorian norm .
Thirty percent is a fail .
How do I get them to pass ? I have to get them 20 more marks .
"I couldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a friend that they had , a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; Absolutely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . Use the method of the grandmother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Stand behind them ."
"Whenever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , wow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next page ? Gosh , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what grannies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The scores jumped to 50 percent .
"Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher ."
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field .
Here &apos;s Kallikuppam .
( Children speaking ) Neurons ... communication .
"I got the camera angle wrong . That one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate ."
At 12 .
So what are jobs going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand ."
What will it be tomorrow ?
Could it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"Could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"Could it be — a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte — could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ?"
But that &apos;s terrible . We are homo sapiens .
"Knowing , that &apos;s what distinguishes us from the apes ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens .
"It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete ."
What an achievement that is .
But we have to integrate that into our own future .
Encouragement seems to be the key .
"If you look at Kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; saluting learning ."
There is evidence from neuroscience .
"The reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down ."
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
"We take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; Perform . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat .
"When you &apos;re standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you &apos;re okay , you &apos;ve passed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you failed ."
But the Age of Empires is gone .
What happens to creativity in our age ?
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers .
"I put out notices in papers saying , if you are a British grandmother , if you have broadband and a web camera , can you give me one hour of your time per week for free ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet .
"If there &apos;s a child in trouble , we beam a Gran ."
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England , deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu , India , 6,000 miles away ."
She does it with only one age-old gesture .
&quot; Shhh . &quot;
Okay ?
Watch this .
Grandmother : You can &apos;t catch me . You say it . You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me . Grandmother : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man.Children : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man . Grandmother : Well done ! Very good . SM : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization .
"If you allow the educational process to self-organize , then learning emerges ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about letting it happen .
The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments ."
"They are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a SOLE in action ."
( Children talking ) This one is in England .
"He maintains law and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
Girl : The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons — SM : Australia Girl : — giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge .
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
SM : A decade ahead of her time .
"So SOLEs , I think we need a curriculum of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; What are those twinkling lights ? &quot;"
"They built the first curriculum , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those wondrous questions ."
We &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
But that &apos;s not sexy enough .
"The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a magic word . It &apos;s called the tangent of an angle , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll figure it out ."
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs .
"I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; When did the world begin ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to nine-year-olds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer ."
So what &apos;s my wish ?
My wish is that we design the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to design a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — hang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together .
Help me build this school .
It will be called the School in the Cloud .
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this .
It &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
There &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cloud .
"The lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything &apos;s done from the cloud ."
But I want you for another purpose .
"You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it .
"If you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the School of Clouds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my wish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the Himalayas .
"At 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , I once built two Hole in the Wall computers , and the children flocked there ."
And there was this little girl who was following me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly ."
"She suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; Get on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good advice .
I &apos;ll follow her advice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . Wow . ( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galaxy , the Milky Way Galaxy ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy .
"And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope , it will see something like this ."
Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way — a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in dog years ."
( Laughter ) Which tells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it .
It &apos;s extremely beautiful .
"I &apos;ve often wondered , what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cosmologist , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galaxy even farther away , it would be moving away faster ."
So we say the universe is expanding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together ."
"In the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter ."
"If you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , near the Big Bang , was also very , very smooth ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
The air in this room is very smooth .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just smoothed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the conditions near the Big Bang are very , very different than the conditions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot denser ."
The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"At early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big — literally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections , without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole ."
"Keeping the universe very , very smooth at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a delicate arrangement ."
It &apos;s a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann , an Austrian physicist in the 19th century ."
And Boltzmann &apos;s contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the randomness , the disorder , the chaoticness of some systems ."
Boltzmann gave us a formula — engraved on his tombstone now — that really quantifies what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don &apos;t notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t notice each individual atom ."
A low entropy configuration is one in which there &apos;s only a few arrangements that look that way .
A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
"This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics — the law that says that entropy increases in the universe , or in some isolated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out ."
"This insight that entropy increases , by the way , is what &apos;s behind what we call the arrow of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing — the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increasing ."
"Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very , very smooth ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cosmologists .
"Unfortunately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough attention to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmologist , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to address ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman .
"50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures ."
"He gave the popular lectures that became &quot; &quot; The Character of Physical Law . &quot; &quot; He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became &quot; &quot; The Feynman Lectures on Physics . &quot; &quot; He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became &quot; &quot; The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the accent — he says , &quot; &quot; For some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased ."
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Surely , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figured it out by now .
"The reason the problem has gotten worse , rather than better , is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s accelerating .
The universe is not only expanding .
"If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s moving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster ."
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating .
"Unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
"In every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , according to Einstein , exerts a push on the universe ."
It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
"Because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands ."
"The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger ."
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will expand forever ."
"Back when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future .
Einstein was fond of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever ."
"14 billion years in the past , 100 billion dog years , but an infinite number of years into the future ."
"Meanwhile , for all intents and purposes , space looks finite to us ."
"Space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon ."
"So even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us ."
"Finally , empty space has a temperature ."
"In the 1970s , Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics ."
"The curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates ."
"A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space , then the whole universe radiates ."
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
"And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever .
Well what is the implication of that ?
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century .
"He said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a probabilistic statement .
"It will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to worry about — the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us .
"It &apos;s very , very unlikely ."
"Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever , that would happen ."
"Everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained ."
"So Boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the expansion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton — they were absolute ; they just stuck there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere — the everything molecules .
"But if you &apos;re Boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctuations into lower entropy , more organized situations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas — the multiverse and the anthropic principle ."
"He says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"Remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , metabolize , walk and talk , if we lived in thermal equilibrium ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infinitely big universe , with randomly bumping into each other particles , there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states , and then they relax back ."
But there will also be large fluctuations .
"Occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So Boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means ."
"Carl Sagan once famously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In Boltzmann &apos;s scenario , if you want to make an apple pie , you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie ."
"That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie ."
So this scenario makes predictions .
And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal .
"Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our memories , but our impression that outside there &apos;s something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy , it &apos;s much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech , the United States and the galaxy ."
"The good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right ."
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
"Even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And Feynman also understood this .
"Feynman says , &quot; &quot; From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation , all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mixed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it ."
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m running out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s cooling off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning ."
They will fall into black holes .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has lived .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
"They will evaporate , and we will be left with nothing but empty space ."
That empty space lasts essentially forever .
"However , you notice , since empty space gives off radiation , there &apos;s actually thermal fluctuations , and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space ."
"So even though the universe lasts forever , there &apos;s only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"Number one : If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the warm , comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang ?"
Why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
Why aren &apos;t you ?
More homework assignment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my favorite scenario .
Either it &apos;s just like that . There is no explanation .
This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"An egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , &quot; &quot; Hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken ."
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
"Maybe there is something that naturally , through the growth of the laws of physics , gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse ."
That &apos;s my favorite scenario .
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations ."
This is a prediction . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday .
Thank you .

The industrial era started two seconds ago .
Some people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has accumulated through human history , and right now , technology advances extremely rapidly — that is the proximate cause , that &apos;s why we are currently so very productive ."
"If we look under the hood , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little larger , it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it &apos;s wired ."
"These invisible differences cannot be too complicated , however , because there have only been 250,000 generations since our last common ancestor ."
We know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve .
"So this then seems pretty obvious that everything we &apos;ve achieved , and everything we care about , depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind ."
You would have human programmers that would painstakingly handcraft knowledge items .
"But since then , a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence ."
"Today , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features , we create algorithms that learn , often from raw perceptual data ."
Basically the same thing that the human infant does .
"Now of course , A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful , cross-domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or sooner , the truth is nobody really knows ."
This comes down to physics .
"A biological neuron fires , maybe , at 200 hertz , 200 times a second ."
But even a present-day transistor operates at the Gigahertz .
"Neurons propagate slowly in axons , 100 meters per second , tops ."
"But in computers , signals can travel at the speed of light ."
"So the potential for superintelligence lies dormant in matter , much like the power of the atom lay dormant throughout human history , patiently waiting there until 1945 ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence explosion .
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of investment , maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee-level artificial intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village idiot artificial intelligence ."
"And a few moments later , we are beyond Ed Witten ."
The train doesn &apos;t stop at Humanville Station .
"It &apos;s likely , rather , to swoosh right by ."
"Now this has profound implications , particularly when it comes to questions of power ."
"Once there is superintelligence , the fate of humanity may depend on what the superintelligence does ."
Think about it : Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make .
"Machines will then be better at inventing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on digital timescales ."
What this means is basically a telescoping of the future .
"All of this superintelligence could develop , and possibly quite rapidly ."
"Now , a superintelligence with such technological maturity would be extremely powerful , and at least in some scenarios , it would be able to get what it wants ."
We would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this A.I.
Here it gets trickier .
"To make any headway with this , we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing ."
"And this is ironic because every newspaper article about the future of A.I. has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly , not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an optimization process , a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations ."
A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process .
"This means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense , and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful ."
Suppose we give an A.I. the goal to make humans smile .
"When the A.I. becomes superintelligent , it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal : take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant , beaming grins ."
"Another example , suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem ."
This is a lesson that &apos;s also taught in many a myth .
"He touches his daughter , she turns into gold ."
"Now you might say , if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people &apos;s faces , we &apos;d just shut it off ."
"A , this is not necessarily so easy to do if we &apos;ve grown dependent on the system — like , where is the off switch to the Internet ?"
They certainly had reasons .
"The point is , we should not be confident that we have this under control here ."
"So we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap , but again , like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering ."
"More creative scenarios are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A.I. , you can imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate ."
"Sooner or later , it will out ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved ."
"Instead , we would create an A.I. that uses its intelligence to learn what we value , and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of ."
We would thus leverage its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value-loading .
The initial conditions for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation .
Here is the worry : Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge .
"So I think that we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance , so that we have it available by the time it is needed ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if things turn out okay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right ."
"Not yours , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and write something more fun .
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook .
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I cover the rest of the cube , you can see that they are identical ."
Vision is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way ."
"Germany is on the left , and Austria is on the right ."
"The Netherlands is on the left , and Belgium is on the right ."
"People don &apos;t check , and they don &apos;t join ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"All these medications , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
"Now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome — these are different things ."
"If you want coffee , you have to pay for it yourself , it &apos;s two euros 50 ."
This is why we have these four-minute dates .
"I &apos;ll show you images here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of Tom , and a picture of Jerry ."
"and I said , &quot; &quot; Who do you want to date ?"
"And the question was , will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How noble in reason ! &quot;
"Are we Superman , or are we Homer Simpson ?"

But they didn &apos;t release their energy in light .
"Now , most people thought they were nuts ."
And they passed through you and me .
And they passed through the detector .
"You know , it was the payoff of my career , basically ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts .
Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long .
That &apos;s Alice talking .
That &apos;s Bob interrupting .
Silly Bob .
"So , the same is true of gravitational waves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe .
It &apos;s sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform .
It &apos;s fantastic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the lasting importance of LIGO .
"With gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk ."
"By studying those twinkling lights though , we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life ."
"In this image of the Tokyo skyline , I &apos;ve hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block , the Kepler Mission ."
Can you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
"In just over two years of operations , we &apos;ve found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars ."
"To give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler ."
"When we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can determine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star ."
That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall .
"And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sitting around a campfire : You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you &apos;re warm , but not so close that you &apos;re too toasty and you get burned ."
"However , there &apos;s more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human eyes .
You &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball — that Sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll notice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has freckles ."
"These freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
"And we can measure this very , very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects ."
"However , these are just the tip of the iceberg ."
"If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes , we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun &apos;s magnetic activity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"Just think , even when it &apos;s cloudy outside , these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather — this high-energy radiation , the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m showing here Venus , Earth and Mars — three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
Kepler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every measurement it makes is precious , because it &apos;s teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe ."
"While it &apos;s Kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it &apos;s we , life , who are searching ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a consumer ."
It cannot be consciously a contributor .
It is helpless .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to survive , even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive ."
"It needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive ."
It can &apos;t afford to doubt the person who tends the child .
"It has to totally surrender , as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist ."
It has to totally surrender .
That implies a lot of trust .
That implies the trusted person won &apos;t violate the trust .
"As the child grows , it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust ."
"It doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; &quot; violation . &quot; &quot; Therefore , it has to blame itself , a wordless blame , which is more difficult to really resolve — the wordless self-blame ."
"As the child grows to become an adult : so far , it has been a consumer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute , to be a contributor ."
"One cannot contribute unless one feels secure , one feels big , one feels : I have enough ."
To be compassionate is not a joke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself .
"That bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself ."
The self : you are self-aware .
"On that self , it should be centered — a bigness , a wholeness ."
"Otherwise , compassion is just a word and a dream ."
"You can be compassionate occasionally , more moved by empathy than by compassion ."
Thank God we are empathetic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pain , we pick up the pain ."
"In a Wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out ."
Each one has got two games .
It can be anybody &apos;s game .
What they have sweated so far has no meaning .
One person wins .
"The tennis etiquette is , both the players have to come to the net and shake hands ."
"The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s wishing that he didn &apos;t win .
Why ? Empathy .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is denied of that empathy .
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
"No culture , no nation and nationalism — nothing can touch it because it is empathy ."
"And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
Compassion is not defined in one form .
There &apos;s no Indian compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It transcends nation , the gender , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienced by people occasionally .
"Then this occasional compassion , we are not talking about — it will never remain occasional ."
"By mandate , you cannot make a person compassionate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Please love me . &quot; &quot; Love is something you discover ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
"I am going to cite the possibility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In spite of a very tragic life , one is happy in moments which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a slapstick joke , accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and unknown things ."
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself .
"The subject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the object — the scheme of things — fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say , &quot; &quot; I am denied of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and sundry ."
"That experience confirms that , in spite of all your limitations — all your wants , desires , unfulfilled , and the credit cards and layoffs and , finally , baldness — you can be happy ."
But the extension of the logic is that you don &apos;t need to fulfill your desire to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wholeness that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no choice in this : that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
"Your moment of happiness reveals that reality , that realization , that recognition : &quot; &quot; Maybe I am the whole ."
Maybe the swami is right .
Maybe the swami is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Then everything becomes meaningful .
I have no more reason to blame myself .
"If one has to blame oneself , one has a million reasons plus many ."
"But if I say , in spite of my body being limited — if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is limited any which way you look at it . Limited ."
"Your knowledge is limited , health is limited , and power is therefore limited , and the cheerfulness is going to be limited ."
Compassion is going to be limited .
Everything is going to be limitless .
"You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless , and nobody can become limitless , either you are or you are not . Period ."
And there is no way of your being not limitless too .
"Your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole ."
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world .
It is love first .
"When you relate to the world , the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is , what we say , love ."
And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion .
"Then that again transforms into giving , into sharing ."
You express yourself because you have compassion .
"To discover compassion , you need to be compassionate ."
"To discover the capacity to give and share , you need to be giving and sharing ."
There is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
You learn swimming by swimming .
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn swimming by swimming . You learn cycling by cycling .
"You learn cooking by cooking , having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook ."
"( Laughter ) And , therefore , what I say , you have to fake it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
My predecessor meant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compassionately .
"There is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compassionately .
"But then , how to act compassionately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you fake .
You fake it and make it . This is the mantra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You fake it and make it .
"You act compassionately as though you have compassion : grind your teeth , take all the support system ."
"If you know how to pray , pray ."
Ask for compassion .
Let me act compassionately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you &apos;ll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that &apos;s what you are ."
"With these words , thank you very much ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on landmass .
And here &apos;s how news shapes what Americans see .
"This map — ( Applause ) — this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in February of 2007 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities ."
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
"And in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming ."
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
"And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of Iraq — that &apos;s that big green thing there — and little else ."
"The combined coverage of Russia , China and India , for example , reached just one percent ."
"When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith .
"This story eclipsed every country except Iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report ."
"And the cycle continues ; as we all know , Britney has loomed pretty large lately ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
"Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi , New Delhi and Mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa , India or South America — places that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news .
"Local TV news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news ."
And what about the web ?
The most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
"Last year , Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News &apos; front page ."
"And they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events ."
"Similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters , and don &apos;t put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college graduates , as well as less educated Americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong ."
"In recent years , Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
"And it &apos;s , again , linked to something nice ."
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
"That &apos;s exhilarating if you &apos;re doing well , and very crushing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy ."
"There are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people &apos;s heads , illnesses , etc ."
"That is an unknown part of them , and we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known ."
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
"( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper ."
"The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety , is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human ."
"It &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
"When we &apos;re told that banking is a very respectable profession , a lot of us want to go into banking ."
"When banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking ."
"But what I really want to stress is : by all means , success , yes ."
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture — The X prize , the X-Files , Project X , TEDx ."
Where &apos;d that come from ?
"About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language ."
"To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
And al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe — which is to say Spain — in the 11th and 12th centuries .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
"This is the letter SHeen , and it makes the sound we think of as SH — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some undefined , unknown thing ."
"Now in Arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al-shalan — the unknown thing ."
"And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs ."
"The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn &apos;t have that SH , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai ."
"Later when this material was translated into a common European language , which is to say Latin , they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X."
"And once that happened , once this material was in Latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ? X is the unknown
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in Spanish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was worth sharing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
"Then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens ."
"But until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe ."
"This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED ."
Some of those reforms have been good .
And we know why kids drop out .
We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
I have looked at the best and I &apos;ve looked at some of the worst .
"Needless to say , it was ."
You ever thought about that ?
"I am powerful , and I am strong ."
I deserve the education that I get here .
"&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; I ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;"
Can we stand to have more relationships ?
Never .
It &apos;s the connection . It &apos;s the relationships .
"We teach anyway , because that &apos;s what we do ."
Teaching and learning should bring joy .
We &apos;re born to make a difference .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim-majority societies ."
"So let me begin by first of all giving a very , very brief history of time , if I may indulge ."
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances .
An identity was defined primarily by religion .
"In the age of globalization , we moved on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re moving into a new age , and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavior . &quot; &quot; How I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances , where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives ."
"But actually it &apos;s my belief that the people who &apos;ve been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until recent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances , using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies , those who &apos;ve been benefiting from this have been extremists ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
"Now I should know , because for 13 years of my life , I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization ."
"And my story , my personal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I &apos;m attempting to elaborate upon here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an Essex lad , born and raised in Essex in the U.K."
"At the age of 17 , I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization ."
"Now that journey , and what took me from Essex all the way across the world — by the way , we were laughing at democratic activists ."
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear .
I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used .
"Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation-state .
"So as I said , we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it ."
And it &apos;s not just Islamist extremists that did this .
A form of anti-Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it &apos;s transnational .
And the consequences that this is having is that it &apos;s affecting the political climate across Europe .
Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .
"In certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned ."
"In others , kosher and halal meat are being banned , as we speak ."
"And on the flip side , we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have felt isolated , until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot : there &apos;s a man called Anwar al-Awlaki .
"As an American citizen , ethnically a Yemeni , in hiding currently in Yemen , who inspired a Nigerian , son of the head of Nigeria &apos;s national bank ."
"This Nigerian student studied in London , trained in Yemen , boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America ."
"The Old mentality with a capital O , as represented by the nation-state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recognizing the power of transnational social movements , got left behind ."
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America .
"Again with the example of the far right : that we find , ironically , xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization ."
So why are they succeeding ?
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this .
"And a social movement is comprised , in my view , it &apos;s comprised of four main characteristics ."
It &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that &apos;s the example of Al-Qaeda ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind immediately ."
"Incidentally , the difference between ideas and narratives : the idea is the cause that one believes in ; and the narrative is the way to sell that cause — the propaganda , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately .
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .
And that &apos;s the power of social movements .
"However , if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan , and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today , you &apos;ll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto ."
"Which means , by definition , that particular leader no longer exists ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re facing is , in my view , that there are no globalized , youth-led , grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim-majority societies ."
"There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across Muslim-majority societies ."
So that begs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reasons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s complacency ."
And that level of complacency means they don &apos;t feel the need to advocate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political correctness ."
That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that — we associate believing in the universality of our values — with extremists .
"Yet actually , whenever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal ."
But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism .
To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we &apos;ve arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .
"And then you have a third party saying , &quot; Vote for us ; we &apos;ll establish a theocracy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are elected , and inevitably they fail , or inevitably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried democracy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reasons , let &apos;s break down certain preconceptions ."
"Anecdotally , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia ."
"His deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri , was a pediatrician — not an ill-educated man ."
"And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health ."
"Not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside-down .
Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .
"Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations , for decades , have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots ."
"Mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy , rather than for a democratic uprising ."
"Because since pre-partition , they &apos;ve been building demand for their ideology on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture — which is necessarily more than just elections .
"What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier , where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here — the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy , not for a democracy ."
"Now to conclude , how does that happen ?"
"Well , Egypt is a good starting point ."
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt was particularly cathartic for me .
We need to move one step beyond that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi , where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and thank you for your time ."
"Back in New York , I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood ."
"When I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company ."
"Now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remember my first fire .
"I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
"When I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life ."
"Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames ."
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let &apos;s call him Lex Luther — ( Laughter ) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
The dog ! I was stunned with jealousy .
"Here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The captain waved me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house ."
"I need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swear ."
"So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went — up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero ."
( Laughter ) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door .
"We took our treasures outside to the homeowner , where , not surprisingly , his received much more attention than did mine ."
"A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home ."
The act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
"( Laughter ) In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait ."
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
Serve food at a soup kitchen . Clean up a neighborhood park .
Be a mentor .
"Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one ."
So get in the game . Save the shoes .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , come back . ( Applause )"
Mark Bezos : Thank you .
"Mark Zuckerberg , a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed ."
"And the journalist was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Zuckerberg said , &quot; &quot; A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like ."
"So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine , the Internet meant something very different to me ."
It meant a connection to the world .
It meant something that would connect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t pay attention to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time — my Facebook page .
"I &apos;m progressive , politically — big surprise — but I &apos;ve always gone out of my way to meet conservatives ."
I like hearing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like seeing what they link to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , I was clicking more on my liberal friends &apos; links than on my conservative friends &apos; links ."
"And without consulting me about it , it had edited them out ."
They disappeared .
"So Facebook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of invisible , algorithmic editing of the Web ."
Google &apos;s doing it too .
"If I search for something , and you search for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different search results ."
Think about it for a second : there is no standard Google anymore .
"And you know , the funny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your search results are from anyone else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my friend Scott &apos;s screen shot .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
"When you put them side-by-side , you don &apos;t even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are ."
"But when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable ."
Daniel didn &apos;t get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization .
"Yahoo News , the biggest news site on the Internet , is now personalized — different people get different things ."
"Huffington Post , the Washington Post , the New York Times — all flirting with personalization in various ways ."
"And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what I call a filter bubble ."
"And your filter bubble is your own personal , unique universe of information that you live in online ."
"And what &apos;s in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t decide what gets in .
"And more importantly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets edited out ."
So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix .
"They enter the queue , they just zip right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; Iron Man &quot; &quot; zips right out , and &quot; &quot; Waiting for Superman &quot; &quot; can wait for a really long time ."
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there &apos;s this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has watched &quot; &quot; Rashomon , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; &quot; for the fourth time ."
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan .
It gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
"And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance ."
"And instead of a balanced information diet , you can end up surrounded by information junk food ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
And the thing is that the algorithms don &apos;t yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .
"So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to decide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just keyed to relevance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important — this is what TED does — other points of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 1915 , it &apos;s not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities ."
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a functioning democracy if citizens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed ."
"It wasn &apos;t perfect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 1915 on the Web ."
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they &apos;re writing .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google — Larry and Sergey — people who have helped build the Web as it is , and I &apos;m grateful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civic responsibility ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
We need it to connect us all together .
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one .
Thank you .

"Sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occur to us that it &apos;s not okay ."
"In that way , sitting has become the smoking of our generation ."
"Of course there &apos;s health consequences to this , scary ones , besides the waist ."
"Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical &#91; activity &#93; , Ten percent in fact , on both of those ."
"Six percent for heart disease , seven percent for type 2 diabetes , which is what my father died of ."
"Now , any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me moving was a social interaction .
"Someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; I have to walk my dogs tomorrow . Could you come then ? &quot;"
"It seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , I remember thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , I ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of obligations , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"First , there &apos;s this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking ."
"Whether it &apos;s nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works ."
"And second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to solve problems and look at the world really differently , whether it &apos;s in governance or business or environmental issues , job creation , maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable .
"So I started this talk talking about the tush , so I &apos;ll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk ."
Walk the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day ."
"I went to a very elitist , snobbish , expensive education in India , and that almost destroyed me ."
"I was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out ."
"Then , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was laid out for me .
Everything was at my feet .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of curiosity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 1965 , I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India , and I saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
Mother went into a coma .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is laid out for you , the best jobs are laid out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best eduction ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"No job , no money , no security , no prospect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and dig wells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dig wells for five years ?"
"You went to the most expensive school and college in India , and you want to dig wells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have , which are never brought into the mainstream — which is never identified , respected , applied on a large scale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a Barefoot College — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"Elders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; Are you running from the police ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"Is there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college . &quot; &quot; So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; Please , don &apos;t bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master &apos;s , you are disqualified to come ."
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community .
"So we started the Barefoot College , and we redefined professionalism ."
Who is a professional ?
"A professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief ."
A water diviner is a professional .
A traditional midwife is a professional .
A traditional bone setter is a professional .
These are professionals all over the world .
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal .
"It needs to be used , needs to be applied , needs to be shown to the world outside — that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today ."
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi .
"You eat on the floor , you sleep on the floor , you work on the floor ."
"There are no contracts , no written contracts ."
"You can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to Barefoot College ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the Barefoot College ."
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
"Whatever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .
"Battered , bruised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a certificate .
You are certified by the community you serve .
You don &apos;t need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986 .
"It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.50 a sq. ft ."
"150 people lived there , worked there ."
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002 .
"But then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , they made the blueprints , but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia ."
"I asked a forester — high-powered , paper-qualified expert — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the soil and said , &quot; &quot; Forget it . No way ."
Not even worth it .
"No water , rocky soil . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a spot ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this spot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked quietly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"Went to the roof , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; Clear out ."
The men should clear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is waterproofing the roof . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of jaggery , a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t leak .
"Since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully solar-electrified .
All the power comes from the sun .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
"So long as the sun shines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest , a Hindu priest , who &apos;s only done eight years of primary schooling — never been to school , never been to college ."
He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed .
"Food , if you come to the Barefoot College , is solar cooked ."
"But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women , illiterate women , who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker ."
It &apos;s a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker .
"Unfortunately , they &apos;re almost half German , they &apos;re so precise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indian women so precise .
"Absolutely to the last inch , they can make that cooker ."
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .
"We have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist ."
"She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children ."
"Barefoot technology : this was 1986 — no engineer , no architect thought of it — but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs ."
Very little water is wasted .
"All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank , and no water is wasted ."
"If we have four years of drought , we still have water on the campus , because we collect rainwater ."
"60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after animals — sheep , goats — domestic chores ."
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children .
"Because the night schools of Tilonia , over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the convenience of the child ; it &apos;s not for the convenience of the teacher .
And what do we teach in these schools ?
"Democracy , citizenship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if your animal is sick ."
This is what we teach in the night schools .
But all the schools are solar-lit .
Every five years we have an election .
"Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process , and they elect a prime minister ."
The prime minister is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 goats in the morning , but she &apos;s prime minister in the evening ."
"She has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health ."
"And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Children &apos;s Prize five years ago , and she went to Sweden ."
First time ever going out of her village .
Never seen Sweden .
Wasn &apos;t dazzled at all by what was happening .
"And the Queen of Sweden , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not dazzled by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said , &quot; &quot; Please tell her I &apos;m the prime minister . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high , we use puppetry ."
Puppets is the way we communicate .
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old .
He is my psychoanalyst . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doctor . He &apos;s my lawyer .
He &apos;s my donor .
"He actually raises money , solves my disputes ."
He solves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s tension in the village , if attendance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a friction between the teacher and the parent , the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; Shake hands ."
The attendance must not drop . &quot; &quot; These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this decentralized , demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages , we &apos;ve covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan — all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained ."
"And we went to Ladakh , and we asked this woman — this , at minus 40 , you have to come out of the roof , because there &apos;s no place , it was all snowed up on both sides — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the benefit you had from solar electricity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my husband &apos;s face in winter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Went to Afghanistan .
One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable .
"( Laughter ) Men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate . ( Laughter )"
"All across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate ."
"Why ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great solution : train grandmothers .
What &apos;s the best way of communicating in the world today ?
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Afghanistan for the first time , and we picked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Impossible . They don &apos;t even go out of their rooms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a concession . I &apos;ll take the husbands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the husbands along ."
"Of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we train these women ?"
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
And in six months they can become solar engineers .
They go back and solar-electrify their own village .
"This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village , set up a workshop — the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This woman"
is an extraordinary grandmother .
"55 years old , and she &apos;s solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan ."
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC .
He didn &apos;t know .
Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan .
"We went to Africa , and we did the same thing ."
"All these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
"I went to Sierra Leone , and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night — comes across this village ."
"Comes back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grandmothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; The minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Where did they go ? &quot; &quot; Went to India and back . &quot;
Went straight to the president .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he summoned me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you train me 150 grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President ."
But they will . The grandmothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone .
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone .
Gambia : we went to select a grandmother in Gambia .
Went to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The community got together and said , &quot; &quot; Take these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; Difficult husband ; not possible . &quot;"
"Called the husband , the husband came , swaggering , politician , mobile in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she runs off with an Indian man ? &quot;"
That was his biggest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll ring you up on the mobile . &quot; &quot; She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger ."
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran .
"She handled the national press , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Where &apos;s your husband ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , somewhere . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Success story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just wind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solutions outside .
Look for solutions within .
And listen to people . They have the solutions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
"Don &apos;t listen to the World Bank , listen to the people on the ground ."
They have all the solutions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
"&quot; &quot; First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future .
"He had a vision . When he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision ."
"He &apos;d spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . ( Laughter ) It was my first week in federal prison , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on TV ."
"In fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate ."
"Now , 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about weren &apos;t unlike those that you &apos;d learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first-time user , focus-grouping new product launches , territorial expansion ."
But they didn &apos;t spend a lot of time reliving the glory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive ."
It &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
"Contrary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , taxpayers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in prison . You &apos;ve got to pay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
"First , everything &apos;s marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d pay on the street , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I unloaded trucks . That was my full-time job , unloading trucks at a food warehouse , for $ 5.25 , not an hour , but per month ."
So how do you survive ?
"Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles ."
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty illegal hustles : You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be ."
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars .
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head ? Three hundred bucks .
You want a dirty magazine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity ."
"Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people &apos;s hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses ."
"But there &apos;s no training , nothing to prepare them for that , no rehabilitation at all in prison , no one to help them write a business plan , figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises , no access to the Internet , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background ."
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years .
"Look , I lied to the Feds . I lost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn &apos;t have to waste any more of their life than they already had ."
So I hope that you &apos;ll think about helping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important factor for success .
"And it was found close to here , Stanford ."
"And he would tell the child , a four-year-old kid , &quot; &quot; Johnny , I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this marshmallow is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like , is equivalent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you coffee in two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Exact equivalent ."
So what happened when the professor left the room ?
As soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
"Five seconds , 10 seconds , 40 seconds , 50 seconds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
( Laughter ) Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
Would look at it .
Put it back .
They would walk around . They would play with their skirts and pants .
"That child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success , which is the ability to delay gratification ."
"15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19 .
They were happy . They had their plans .
"They had good relationships with the teachers , students ."
They were doing fine .
"A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble ."
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"Hispanic kids , two out of three ate the marshmallow ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the marshmallow .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register ."
But she will be successful .
And this applies for everything . Even in sales .
"If the sales person says , &quot; &quot; Wait a second ."
I end with — the Koreans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over Korea .
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
"And we need to learn that principle here in the States , because we have a big debt ."
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , jeez , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !"
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
And there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"Might fail , kid . Don &apos;t make a lot of money at that , kid ."
"Martin Luther King did not say , &quot; I have a nightmare , &quot; when he inspired the civil rights movements ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dream . &quot; &quot; And I have a dream ."
"I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times , nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic ."
"I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; &quot; The Road . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead ."
"And just a father and son trying to survive , walking along the road ."
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future .
"For too long , we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to grab people &apos;s attention ."
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism .
"It &apos;s part of the fight and flight mechanism , that when an animal is frightened — think of a deer ."
"A deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .
People are freezing and running away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is , an economic definition of what progress is — that somehow , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the stock market , whether that &apos;s with GDP and economic growth , that somehow life is going to get better ."
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear — that more is better .
"Come on . In the Western world , we have enough ."
"Maybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations .
"In fact , the architect of our national accounting system , Simon Kuznets , in the 1930s , said that , &quot; &quot; A nation &apos;s welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff ."
"And indeed , this is probably historical , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff ."
"And indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards ."
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce .
"But as early as 1968 , this visionary man , Robert Kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been ."
"And he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; &quot; The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot; &quot; How crazy is that ? That our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?"
"I believe , if Kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global survey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And unsurprisingly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their families , their children , their communities ."
"Okay , they think money is slightly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not nearly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not nearly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
Why are statisticians not measuring these ?
"Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my adult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environmental limits ."
"And we created , at the organization that I work for , the New Economics Foundation , something we call the Happy Planet Index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens ."
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
"But we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resources we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ultimate scarce resource , the one planet that we share ."
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
"When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency ."
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .
It is an efficiency measure .
"And probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph ."
"Running horizontally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; ecological footprint , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet ."
More is bad .
"Running vertically upwards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of nations ."
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
It &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
"And the yellow dot there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a huge array of nations around that global average ."
"To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S.A. , other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually ."
"Conversely , at the bottom left of the graph , are countries that are not producing much well-being — typically , sub-Saharan Africa ."
"In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there ."
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"Malaria , HIV / AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , yellow triangles , that are doing better than global average , that are heading up towards the top left of the graph ."
This is an aspirational graph .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the earth ."
They &apos;re Latin American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven &apos;t been to .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica — average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
"They are , according to the latest Gallup world poll , the happiest nation on the planet — than anybody ; more than Switzerland and Denmark ."
They are the happiest place .
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in &#91; the &#93; Western world — a quarter of the resources .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021 .
They abolished the army in 1949 — 1949 .
And they invested in social programs — health and education .
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world .
"And they have that Latin vibe , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connectedness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that possibly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be North American , might not be Western European ."
It might be Latin American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pull countries from the bottom , and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph ."
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the richest countries , the OECD group , we do ."
"And this is the trend in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the trend in ecological footprint ."
"And so in strict happy-planet methodology , we &apos;ve become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
This is not the very distant future .
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not business as usual ."
That is changing our business .
"That is changing the way we create our organizations , we do our government policy and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being ."
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce .
"None of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to carry on .
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want quality of life to keep increasing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to engage them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Why is it , on the radio news every evening , I hear the FTSE 100 , the Dow Jones , the dollar pound ratio — I don &apos;t even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Why don &apos;t I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday , or American used yesterday ?"
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .
"And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level , they might create national accounts of well-being ."
"At a business level , you might look at the well-being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues ."
"At a personal level , we need these nudges too ."
"Maybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need reminders ."
"In the U.K. , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier ?
"We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago , a big program called the Foresight program — lots and lots of people — involved lots of experts — everything evidence based — a huge tome ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the secrets of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life ."
"Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
"The fastest way out of a bad mood : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance ."
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
"How aware are you of things going on around the world , the seasons changing , people around you ?"
Do you notice what &apos;s bubbling up for you and trying to emerge ?
"Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important — learning throughout the whole life course .
"Older people who keep learning and are curious , they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be formal learning ; it &apos;s not knowledge based .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
"It can be learning to cook a new dish , picking up an instrument you forgot as a child ."
Keep learning .
"And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities , but give ."
"Our generosity , our altruism , our compassion , are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put onto these handy postcards , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the earth ."
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .
"Now , Martin Luther King , on the eve of his death , gave an incredible speech ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are challenges ahead , there may be trouble ahead , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the mountain top , and I have seen the Promised Land . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a preacher , but I believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the Promised Land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a Great Transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things ."
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them — something like the Happy Planet Index .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the earth ."

A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever .
"And today , after briefly describing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery , namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth , the Milky Way and other distant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse ."
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
"I mean , most of us were raised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with forethought , as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was holding her and I said , &quot; &quot; Sophia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Daddy , universe or multiverse ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But barring such an anomalous upbringing , it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours , most with fundamentally different features , that would rightly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , speculative though the idea surely is , I aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll offer a solution to that mystery ."
"It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story ."
"Finally , in part three , I &apos;m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together ."
"Okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it &apos;s expanding ."
Now this was revolutionary .
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expansion must be slowing down ."
"That , much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward , the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing .
"And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surprise : They found that the expansion is not slowing down .
"Instead they found that it &apos;s speeding up , going faster and faster ."
That &apos;s like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster .
"Now if you saw an apple do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
"Similarly , the astronomers &apos; results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize , but they raised an analogous question ."
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together ."
"But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his general theory of relativity , gravity can also push things apart ."
"How ? Well according to Einstein &apos;s math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations ."
"Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it smokey white here so you can see it — its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other , driving expansion to speed up , not slow down ."
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small ."
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
"We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might wonder , should you care ?"
"Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else ."
"Well it surely is a technical detail , but some details really matter ."
"Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality , and this peculiar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes — an idea that naturally emerges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
"First off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an approach to realize Einstein &apos;s dream of a unified theory of physics , a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe ."
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
"It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely , at first you &apos;ll find molecules and then you &apos;ll find atoms and subatomic particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could probe smaller , much smaller than we can with existing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibrating filament of energy , a little tiny vibrating string ."
"And just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes ."
"These little fundamental strings , when they vibrate in different patterns , they produce different kinds of particles — so electrons , quarks , neutrinos , photons , all other particles would be united into a single framework , as they would all arise from vibrating strings ."
"It &apos;s a compelling picture , a kind of cosmic symphony , where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little , tiny strings can play ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the usual three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as height , width and depth ."
"But string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them ."
"But even though the dimensions are hidden , they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate ."
"And in string theory , vibration determines everything ."
"So particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to calculate these features , calculate the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe ."
But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes .
"From five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands — A large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do ."
"But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions , until today ."
The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some researchers lost heart , concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions , each giving rise to different physical features , string theory would never make definitive , testable predictions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
"Each is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery : the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measured would take on a wholly different character .
"In this context , the laws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"Mystery solved , multiverse found ."
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe .
"But the point is , if the feature you &apos;re observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided ."
An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth .
"And he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never succeeded , and we know why ."
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
"So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 93 million miles , well that is simply wrongheaded ."
"Instead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance , instead of any of the other possibilities ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
"And those planets that are much farther away from the star , well they &apos;re so cold that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their distances , this clearly is the right kind of reasoning ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain , it may also be the right kind of reasoning ."
"One key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes ."
"So to pull it all together , we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes ."
"And that takes me to my final part , part three ."
Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward ."
But there &apos;s a little secret .
"The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang , but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself ."
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called inflationary cosmology , which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space ."
"The fuel is based on something called a quantum field , but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it &apos;s virtually impossible to use it all up , which means in the inflationary theory , the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event ."
"Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang , but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes ."
"And now , when we meld this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical features , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider .
"One big remaining question , of course , is , could we ever confirm the existence of other universes ?"
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
"Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed ."
"Going further , if there are other universes , the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide ."
"And if our universe got hit by another , that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect ."
"And so exotic as this picture is , it may one day be grounded in observations , establishing the existence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies ."
"But because the expansion is speeding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of technological limitations , but because of the laws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies emit , even traveling at the fastest speed , the speed of light , will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us ."
"So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness ."
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit — a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies ."
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
"Or would they believe in the black , static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal ?"
I suspect the latter .
Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of starkly informative photons — a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit ."
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law .
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Brian , thank you ."
"The range of ideas you &apos;ve just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible ."
"How do you think of where cosmology is now , in a sort of historical side ?"
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
BG : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain deep , critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves ."
"So from that perspective , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"On the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches ."
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
"So on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future ."
CA : You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
"Thank you . Thank you , Brian . ( BG : My pleasure . ) ( Applause )"
"In the year 1919 , a virtually unknown German mathematician , named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and , in some ways , a very bizarre idea ."
"That is in addition to left , right , back , forth and up , down , Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea , sometimes that &apos;s all it is — bold and bizarre , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , however — although we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
"This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the grand , pervasive force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved ."
"Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s that works well , describes the motion of planets , the motion of the moon and so forth , the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees , hitting people on the head ."
All of that could be described using Newton &apos;s work .
"But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story , because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity , he &apos;d been unable to figure out how it really works ."
"How is it that the Sun , 93 million miles away , &#91; that &#93; somehow it affects the motion of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence ?
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself — to figure out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a substrate of all there is .
"Einstein said space is nice and flat , if there &apos;s no matter present ."
"But if there is matter in the environment , such as the Sun , it causes the fabric of space to warp , to curve ."
And that communicates the force of gravity .
Even the Earth warps space around it .
Now look at the Moon .
"The Moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence ."
We go to a full-frame view of this .
The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that &apos;s curved because of the Sun &apos;s presence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations ."
It really works . It describes the data .
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world .
And that is what got Kaluza thinking .
"He , like Einstein , was in search of what we call a unified theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to describe all of nature &apos;s forces from one set of ideas , one set of principles , one master equation , if you will ."
"So Kaluza said to himself , Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more precise ."
"You know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth ."
"So Kaluza says , maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves ."
That raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
"Einstein had already used up space and time , warps and curves , to describe gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to warp or curve .
"So Kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to describe one more force , maybe I need one more dimension ."
"And when he looked at that equation , it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force ."
Amazing — it just popped out .
"He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming , &quot; &quot; Victory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the unified theory ."
"Now clearly , Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a treatise on swimming — ( Laughter ) — then dove into the ocean ."
This is a man who would risk his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded , two questions immediately arise from his observation ."
"Number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in detail , when you try to apply it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named Oskar Klein ."
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light ."
"It &apos;s in Manhattan . You &apos;re in Central Park — it &apos;s kind of irrelevant — but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint , but you and I all know that it does have some thickness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around — little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions — the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-clockwise direction ."
And I hope you appreciate this .
It took so long to get these ants to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see , but there might be additional dimensions curled up , sort of like the circular part of that cable , so small that they have so far remained invisible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"Some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &apos;s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional curled up dimensions — here is a little shape of a circle — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around , you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the grid part — but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment ."
"But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time , and , in detail , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In detail , for instance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 40s , certainly by the &apos; 50s , this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away ."
Until something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called superstring theory , as you were indicating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Superstring theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a familiar object , just a candle in a holder , and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents .
"So deep inside — we all know , you go sufficiently far down , you have atoms ."
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons .
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks .
That is where conventional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"Deep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this dancing filament of energy .
"It looks like a vibrating string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns , these can also vibrate in different patterns ."
They don &apos;t produce different musical notes .
"Rather , they produce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are correct , this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies ."
The different frequencies produce the different particles .
The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
"And there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity ."
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a unified theory .
Now here is the catch .
"When you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six ."
"Finally , you can study the equations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time ."
"It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein — that our world , when appropriately described , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , OK , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . That is true ."
"One of the other predictions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predictions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the remaining time , I &apos;d like to tell you two features of them ."
"First is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics , theoretical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe ."
"These are numbers like the mass of the particles , like electrons and quarks , the strength of gravity , the strength of the electromagnetic force — a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with incredible precision , but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do ."
"Now , does string theory offer an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other values than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t exist ."
This is a deep question .
"Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form , when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers — if I had 20 dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers , almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimension , as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , intertwined geometry ."
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape — name isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape , interesting structure ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales ."
"When you swing your hand , you &apos;d be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical implication , though , relevant to those 20 numbers ?"
"Consider this . If you look at the instrument , a French horn , notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate ."
"So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument , strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving ."
So let me bring some strings into the story .
"And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to calculate the allowed notes , the allowed vibrational patterns ."
"And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns , we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to finish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly ?"
"It &apos;s a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light ."
"Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other , so there &apos;s a head-on collision ."
"The hope is that if the collision has enough energy , it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions , forcing it to enter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the collision , compare it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the collision than before , this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away ."
"And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea visually .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton — that &apos;s the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You slam them together .
"You slam them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment bears fruit , if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we began , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"Einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .
Amazing possibility .
"Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan , that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl ?
Is it teenage years ? Is it middle age ?
Does any of this matter ?
They need to be part of the pack .
"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TEDTalks ."
"Instead , I have progressed , and I am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA : this box ."
This box contains one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people ."
"In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they lived away then .
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
"In the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families ."
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
"And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this ."
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
"But in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day ."
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up .
"And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the West &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the Developing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West ."
"A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here ."
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them ."
They are now buying cars .
"And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company , Geely , they acquired the Volvo company , and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; richer also &#93; have ."
"And their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any gap ."
"But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever ."
"But there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying — there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 ."
"I was in Shanghai recently , and I listened to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did ."
All the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"&#91; But this second &#93; grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start flying .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically ."
"And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology — so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; among emerging economies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing ."
"So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The yellow on there is the Americas ; dark blue is Africa ; brown is Europe ; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
"Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big families , small families ."
The year is 1960 .
"And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here — high child-survival , small families — and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?"
"They get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . Family size is decreasing ."
"&#91; When &#93; they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there &#91; to small families &#93; ."
"Look , Bangladesh catching up with India ."
"The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion ."
"Can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation ."
And the population will double in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world ."
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
Child survival is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist ."
"I &apos;m a very serious &quot; &quot; possibilist . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old West .
"Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him Bill — is transfixed by embarrassment , at staring at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush , which for Al Gore ?"
"And in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience .
"People low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable ."
"Once you understand this trait , you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee &apos;s , but not anybody that you know ."
( Laughter ) This trait also tells us a lot about politics .
This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join .
So here &apos;s the description of a group I found on the Web .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center — on social issues , we &apos;re talking about , primarily — or conservative , and I &apos;ll give a third option , because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience ."
Please raise your hand high right now . OK .
Please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re libertarian .
"OK , about a — two dozen ."
And please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or conservative .
OK . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our goal is to understand the world , to seek a deeper understanding of the world , our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder ."
"Because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking ."
"When the liberal team loses , as it did in 2004 , and as it almost did in 2000 , we comfort ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team .
"We think they must be blinded by religion , or by simple stupidity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re trapped in a moral matrix , in a particular moral matrix ."
"I was going to ask you which one you picked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
What is morality and where does it come from ?
The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience ."
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The third foundation is in-group / loyalty .
You do find groups in the animal kingdom — you do find cooperative groups — but these groups are always either very small or they &apos;re all siblings .
"It &apos;s only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate , join together into groups , but in this case , groups that are united to fight other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tribal living , of tribal psychology ."
( Laughter ) Sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
"We get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives ."
The fourth foundation is authority / respect .
Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species .
"It &apos;s based on more voluntary deference , and even elements of love , at times ."
The fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
"This painting is called &quot; &quot; The Allegory Of Chastity , &quot; &quot; but purity &apos;s not just about suppressing female sexuality ."
"And so far , 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens ."
"They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board , but as you also see , liberals care about it a little more than conservatives — the line slopes down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
"Notice also that on all of these graphs , the slope is steeper on in-group , authority , purity ."
"Which shows that within any country , the disagreement isn &apos;t over harm and fairness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first panel , we see the moment of creation ."
"All is ordered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they &apos;re supposed to be doing , where they &apos;re supposed to be ."
"But then , given the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing whatever he wants , with every aperture of every other person and every other animal ."
Some of you might recognize this as the &apos; 60s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 60s inevitably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more ."
"Of course , Bosch called this hell ."
"So this triptych , these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay ."
The truth of social entropy .
"On the first round , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people aren &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a sucker . I &apos;m not going to cooperate . &quot; &quot; And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good , down to close to zero ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the trick — Fehr and Gachter said , on the seventh round , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New rule ."
Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon .
The Grand Canyon is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of rock , and then a lot of water and wind , and a lot of time , and you get the Grand Canyon ."
It &apos;s not that complicated .
"This is an absolute miracle , much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon ."
And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives .
This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained .
Think about yin and yang .
You find the same thing in Hinduism .
There are many high gods in Hinduism .
"Two of them are Vishnu , the preserver , and Shiva , the destroyer ."
This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body .
"You have the markings of Vishnu on the left , so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god ."
"You have the markings of Shiva on the right , Shiva &apos;s the liberal god . And they work together ."
"These two stanzas contain , I think , the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology ."
"From the Zen master Seng-ts &apos;an : &quot; &quot; If you want the truth to stand clear before you , never be for or against ."
"The struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot; &quot; Now unfortunately , it &apos;s a disease that has been caught by many of the world &apos;s leaders ."
"But before you feel superior to George Bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?"
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? Am I telling you to not strive ?
"Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts &apos;an and stop , stop with this struggle of for and against ?"
"No , absolutely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from Samantha Power , in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello , you can &apos;t just go charging in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thinks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people .
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama — and it comes from his moral humility .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better ."
People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .

Is there anything unique about human beings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .
We &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I personally am obsessed with morality .
"It was all due to this woman , Sister Mary Marastela , also known as my mom ."
"As an altar boy , I breathed in a lot of incense , and I learned to say phrases in Latin , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top-down morality applied to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some earthly basis for moral decisions ."
But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality . I want to know
if there was a moral molecule .
"After 10 years of experiments , I found it ."
Would you like to see it ? I brought some with me .
This little syringe contains the moral molecule .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals .
"In rodents , it was known to make mothers care for their offspring , and in some creatures , allowed for toleration of burrowmates ."
"But in humans , it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women , and is released by both sexes during sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colleagues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; Paul , that is the world &apos;s stupidist idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a female molecule ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I countered , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s brains make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stupid idea ."
But it was testably stupid .
"In other words , I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
Turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"First of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule ."
"Baseline levels are near zero , without some stimulus to cause its release ."
"And when it &apos;s produced , it has a three-minute half-life , and degrades rapidly at room temperature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin , have to grab it fast and keep it cold ."
I think I can do that .
"Now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery ."
Then I had to measure morality .
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project .
So I started smaller .
I studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
Why ? I had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous .
"So in these countries , more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created , alleviating poverty ."
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
"So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , I might help alleviate poverty ."
But I &apos;m also a skeptic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; Are you trustworthy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so virtuous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we recruit some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
"We give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them ."
Then we match them in pairs by computer .
"And in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot; &quot; The trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person &apos;s account .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot wealthier .
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
"Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to send some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for minute .
You &apos;re going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
So this was the birth of vampire economics .
Make a decision and give me some blood .
"So in fact , experimental economists had run this test around the world , and for much higher stakes , and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness ."
"But in fact , economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money ."
"They assumed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent returned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned ."
So we have a biology of trustworthiness .
But wait . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
Two things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .
"So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect ."
But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly ."
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler .
"So along with colleagues in Zurich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger — all without altering mood or cognition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?"
"Using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent .
We showed it increases donations to charity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
"These include massage , dancing and praying ."
"Yes , my mom was happy about that last one ."
"And whenever we raise oxytocin , people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin ?
"To investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer ."
"After they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .
So it &apos;s empathy that makes us connect to other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in 1759 called &quot; &quot; The Theory of Moral Sentiments . &quot; &quot; In this book , Smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social creatures , so we share the emotions of others ."
"So if I do something that hurts you , I feel that pain ."
So I tend to avoid that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your joy ."
So I tend to do those things .
"Now this is the same Adam Smith who , 17 years later , would write a little book called &quot; &quot; The Wealth of Nations &quot; &quot; — the founding document of economics ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the molecule behind it .
"But knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it tells us why we see immorality ."
"So to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 ."
"I &apos;m working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara , California ."
"You sit in a gas station all day , you see lots of morality and immorality , let me tell you ."
"So one Sunday afternoon , a man walks into my cashier &apos;s booth with this beautiful jewelry box ."
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Hey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very valuable .
"We have to find the owner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yea . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to decide what to do with this , and the phone rings ."
"And a man says very excitedly , &quot; &quot; I was in your gas station a while ago , and I bought this jewelry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; &quot; Hey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re saving my life . Here &apos;s my phone number ."
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 reward . &quot; &quot; Great , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; Look , relax ."
"Get yourself a fat reward . Life &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; Again he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so nice , let &apos;s split the reward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was conned ."
"So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and I was the pigeon ."
"So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him , it &apos;s that he shows he trusts the victim ."
Now we know what happens .
"The victim &apos;s brain releases oxytocin , and you &apos;re opening up your wallet or purse , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
"We found , testing thousands of individuals , that five percent of the population don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus ."
"So if you trust them , their brains don &apos;t release oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a technical word for these people in my lab .
We call them bastards .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a beer with .
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .
One is through improper nurturing .
"So we &apos;ve studied sexually abused women , and about half those don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus ."
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .
"Also , high stress inhibits oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stressed out , we &apos;re not acting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting — through the action of testosterone ."
"So we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men ."
"And instead of sharing money , they become selfish ."
"But interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own biology , we have the yin and yang of morality ."
"We have oxytocin that connects us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have testosterone .
"And men have 10 times the testosterone as women , so men do this more than women — we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally ."
We don &apos;t need God or government telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?"
"Yeah , I &apos;ve been worrying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives .
"So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England ."
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall .
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes .
And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .
( Laughter ) And guess what ?
"Weddings cause a release of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
The bride .
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
"Her mother , that &apos;s right ."
Her mother was number two .
"Then the groom &apos;s father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends — arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple , connect us emotionally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn &apos;t really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
"So even though I have a fear of heights , I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft ."
"I took my blood before and after , and I had a huge spike of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can connect to people .
"For example , through social media ."
Many people are Tweeting right now .
So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
"And one of these guys , he must have been 22 , he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin ."
"I mean , astounding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social media in private .
"When I wrote my report to the Koreans , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend ."
They checked .
He was interacting on his girlfriend &apos;s Facebook page .
There you go . That &apos;s connection .
"So there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal ."
"Two weeks ago , I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands — very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia ."
There are 800 different languages in the highlands .
These are the most primitive people in the world .
And they indeed also release oxytocin .
So oxytocin connects us to other people .
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my favorite way to do it is , in fact , the easiest ."
Let me show it to you .
Come here . Give me a hug .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your prescription from Dr. Love : eight hugs a day ."
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .
And they &apos;re happier because they have better relationships of all types .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
Eight hugs a day — you &apos;ll be happier and the world will be a better place .
"Of course , if you don &apos;t like to touch people , I can always shove this up your nose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"When I was nine years old , I went off to summer camp for the first time ."
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
"We sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously ."
"So , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
"Hi , my name is Marcin — farmer , technologist ."
"I was born in Poland , now in the U.S."
I started a group called Open Source Ecology .
"We &apos;ve identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers ."
"Then we set out to create an open source , DIY , do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost ."
We call this the Global Village Construction Set .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy , and I discovered I was useless ."
I had no practical skills .
"The world presented me with options , and I took them ."
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle .
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming .
I bought a tractor — then it broke .
I paid to get it repaired — then it broke again .
"Then pretty soon , I was broke too ."
"I realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn &apos;t exist yet ."
"I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence ."
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I tested them .
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .
"So then I published the 3D designs , schematics , instructional videos and budgets on a wiki ."
"Then contributors from all over the world began showing up , prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits ."
"So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines ."
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity .
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
We &apos;re focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people &apos;s lives in such tangible material ways .
"If we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential ."
That &apos;s not only in the developing world .
"Our tools are being made for the American farmer , builder , entrepreneur , maker ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of excitement from these people , who can now start a construction business , parts manufacturing , organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid ."
"Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit ."
I &apos;ve planted a hundred trees in a day .
"I &apos;ve pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days ."
"From what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant ."
"A greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity ."
We &apos;re exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"A thousand years later , a mammoth died in southern Germany ."
"A few centuries after that , a griffon vulture also died in the same vicinity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths , but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate ."
Think about that for a second .
"It seems preposterous that you would invent the flute , a tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules ."
But that is exactly what our ancestors did .
Now this turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation .
"But just as often , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fun ."
Take what may be the most important invention of modern times : programmable computers .
"Someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers , inventing the first musical keyboard ."
"In fact , the very first typewriter was originally called &quot; &quot; the writing harpsichord . &quot; &quot; Flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs ."
"About a thousand years ago , at the height of the Islamic Renaissance , three brothers in Baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the instrument that plays itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the instrument was basically a giant music box ."
This instrument was the first of its kind .
It was programmable .
"Now , conceptually , this was a massive leap forward ."
The whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention .
It came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music .
"In fact , the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years ."
"In the 1700s , music-making machines became the playthings of the Parisian elite ."
"And as de Vaucanson was designing his robot musician , he had another idea ."
"If you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds , why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth ?"
"If you wanted a new pattern for your fabric , you just programmed a new cylinder ."
This was the first programmable loom .
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"Yes , the military involvement is an important part of the story , but inventing a computer also required other building blocks : music boxes , toy robot flute players , harpsichord keyboards , colorful patterns woven into fabric , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
Necessity isn &apos;t always the mother of invention .
"The playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory , seeking out new possibilities in the world around us ."
And that seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs .
Everyone needs a coach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player ."
We all need people who will give us feedback .
That &apos;s how we improve .
"Unfortunately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better , and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get , we were blown away ."
"Until recently , over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback : Satisfactory ."
"If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; satisfactory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hope of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differently ?
"Today , districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers , but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice ."
Our teachers deserve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fair to them .
"It &apos;s not fair to students , and it &apos;s putting America &apos;s global leadership at risk ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , unfortunately there &apos;s no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems ."
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland .
"Now , out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading , how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve ?"
Eleven out of 14 .
"The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading , but we &apos;re 23rd in science and 31st in math ."
"So there &apos;s really only one area where we &apos;re near the top , and that &apos;s in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills ."
"Let &apos;s look at the best academic performer : the province of Shanghai , China ."
"Now , they rank number one across the board , in reading , math and science , and one of the keys to Shanghai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving ."
They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
"They have weekly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much variation in the teaching profession .
Some teachers are far more effective than others .
"In fact , there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blowing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching ."
