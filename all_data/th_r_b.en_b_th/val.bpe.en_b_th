"When I was 11 , I remember wak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"My father was list@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C N@@ e@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ u@@ sual then , because the news mos@@ tly de@@ pre@@ ssed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n and made it il@@ leg@@ al for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ ssed as a bo@@ y to e@@ sc@@ ort my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer allow@@ ed to be outside alone , to a sec@@ re@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would su@@ sp@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would see@@ m we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ zy in win@@ ter but extre@@ m@@ ely h@@ ot in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teach@@ er , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would sudd@@ en@@ ly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follow@@ ed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ a@@ red , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ a@@ su@@ red .
My grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary man for his time .
"A to@@ tal ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ mot@@ e pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , he in@@ si@@ sted that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teach@@ er .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for gir@@ ls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ cei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ cei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was great@@ er risk in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ st@@ rated by our life and always being sc@@ a@@ red and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Li@@ st@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ main with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was rais@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed by dec@@ ad@@ es of war .
"F@@ e@@ w@@ er than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ yon@@ d high school , and had my family not been so com@@ mit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I stand here a p@@ rou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ bu@@ ry C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hen I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ late me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ gger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for gir@@ ls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for gir@@ ls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ b@@ ition gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at opportunity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ pos@@ ition ."
"@@ Li@@ ke A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their vil@@ la@@ ge , and they literally mi@@ ssed being kil@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone r@@ ang , a voice war@@ ning him that if he sent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wi@@ sh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , and this is something that is often dis@@ mi@@ ssed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who succe@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ z@@ es the value in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers are@@ n &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ iti@@ al and conv@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ g@@ oti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ext of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , we must have the supp@@ ort of men ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , gir@@ ls who went to school nu@@ mb@@ ered in the hundreds — remember , it was il@@ leg@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million gir@@ ls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the f@@ ra@@ g@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ yon@@ d the U.S@@ . t@@ ro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ coura@@ ge them , I see a pr@@ omi@@ sing future and la@@ sting change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bil@@ ities , and every single day the gir@@ ls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ Li@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the wh@@ ite have se@@ pa@@ rated .
And sli@@ gh@@ tly more complex things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s t@@ wi@@ ce as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And deep bene@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at c@@ rac@@ ks in the Earth &apos;s c@@ ru@@ st , you &apos;ve got he@@ at se@@ ep@@ ing up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of el@@ em@@ ents ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ oti@@ c chemi@@ stry ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings start put@@ ting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person dang@@ er@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ trac@@ tive ?
A@@ re they a pot@@ ential mate ? A@@ re they a pot@@ ential net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a mental re@@ su@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? W@@ here are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more personal with it .
H@@ a@@ ve you ever had any dise@@ ases ?
H@@ a@@ ve you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath sm@@ ell bad while you &apos;re answ@@ ering my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? Wh@@ o are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to s@@ le@@ ep with ?
I get it .
We are ne@@ uro@@ logi@@ cally har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to se@@ ek out people like ourselves .
We start for@@ ming cli@@ que@@ s as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce fe@@ els like .
"We bon@@ d together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fer@@ ence , ra@@ ce , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We se@@ ek out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ for@@ ce our personal cho@@ ices .
"S@@ ome@@ times , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s op@@ ening a tiny little box and asking you to s@@ que@@ e@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the cat@@ eg@@ ories , I &apos;ve found , are too limit@@ ing ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too na@@ r@@ row .
And this can get really dang@@ er@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a di@@ sc@@ la@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too deep into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed environment .
"I was rais@@ ed in do@@ w@@ nt@@ own M@@ an@@ ha@@ t@@ tan in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , two blo@@ cks from the e@@ pic@@ ent@@ er of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ c@@ tions of a reli@@ gi@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ based up@@ bri@@ ng@@ ing .
"W@@ here I come from , if you w@@ er@@ en &apos;t a dra@@ g que@@ en or a radi@@ cal thin@@ k@@ er or a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce arti@@ st of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x up@@ bri@@ ng@@ ing , but as a ki@@ d on the stre@@ ets of New York , you learn how to tru@@ st your own inst@@ inc@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let gir@@ ls play .
"So I went home , and I sha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the cha@@ ra@@ de for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pla@@ ying a ki@@ d nam@@ ed W@@ al@@ ter in a movi@@ e called &quot; &quot; Ju@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that follow@@ ed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an S@@ later around and b@@ ad@@ g@@ ered him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which d@@ ou@@ b@@ led up the la@@ y@@ ers of the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of my id@@ ent@@ ity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really pla@@ ying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in cla@@ ss and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to chec@@ k for an A@@ da@@ m &apos;s ap@@ ple or gra@@ b my c@@ rot@@ ch to chec@@ k what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the sta@@ l@@ ls so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing standing up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ ep@@ over@@ s I would have pan@@ ic atta@@ cks trying to bre@@ ak it to gir@@ ls that they didn &apos;t want to ki@@ ss me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t ha@@ te my body or my gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was per@@ for@@ ming this e@@ labo@@ rate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fied as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have di@@ ag@@ n@@ osed me as something like gen@@ der d@@ y@@ sm@@ or@@ phi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just w@@ oke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a ki@@ d beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sh@@ oc@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fal@@ l@@ en in love , it was the last thing on either of our min@@ ds to dis@@ cu@@ ss what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I f@@ ell in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an e@@ ye@@ la@@ sh either ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great b@@ le@@ ssi@@ ngs of my very un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allow@@ ed to be me , growing and changing in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , P@@ rop@@ os@@ ition 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was rais@@ ing a lot of du@@ st around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ri@@ ed wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was stru@@ ck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ ni@@ shed ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts recor@@ d , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mi@@ sta@@ k@@ es so b@@ la@@ t@@ antly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the dis@@ cu@@ ssion on tel@@ evi@@ sion and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ pa@@ ration of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was ess@@ entially dra@@ wing ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies throu@@ gh@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this dis@@ cu@@ ssion was dra@@ wing ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies around me ."
"If this was a war with two dis@@ pa@@ rate si@@ des , I , by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t , f@@ ell on team ga@@ y , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent st@@ rai@@ ght ."
"At the time I was just beginning to emer@@ ge from this ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ year personal id@@ ent@@ ity c@@ ris@@ is z@@ ig@@ z@@ a@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this a@@ w@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s c@@ lo@@ the@@ s to the op@@ pos@@ ite extre@@ me of this su@@ per sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ sat@@ ing , bo@@ y-@@ cha@@ sing gir@@ l@@ y-@@ girl to finally just a he@@ sit@@ ant exp@@ lo@@ ration of what I actually was , a t@@ om@@ bo@@ y@@ is@@ h girl who li@@ ked both bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls depen@@ ding on the person ."
"I had spent a year phot@@ ograph@@ ing this new generation of gir@@ ls , much like myself , who f@@ ell kind of bet@@ we@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ lin@@ es — gir@@ ls who sk@@ at@@ e@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in la@@ cy under@@ we@@ ar , gir@@ ls who had bo@@ ys &apos; hai@@ r@@ c@@ ut@@ s but wor@@ e gir@@ ly nai@@ l poli@@ sh , gir@@ ls who had e@@ ye@@ sha@@ do@@ w to mat@@ ch their sc@@ rap@@ ed k@@ ne@@ es , gir@@ ls who li@@ ked gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys who all li@@ ked bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls who all ha@@ ted being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their fre@@ e@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our ut@@ op@@ i@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble exp@@ lo@@ ded into these ra@@ g@@ ing de@@ bat@@ es where p@@ und@@ its started lik@@ ening our love to be@@ sti@@ ality on national tel@@ evi@@ sion ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ro@@ l@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my cha@@ rac@@ ter ."
I was leg@@ ally and in@@ di@@ sp@@ u@@ ta@@ bly a secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss c@@ itiz@@ en .
I was not an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st .
I wa@@ ve no fla@@ gs in my own life .
But I was pla@@ gue@@ d by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to stri@@ p the ri@@ ghts of the v@@ ast vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one el@@ ement of their cha@@ rac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not de@@ ser@@ ving of equ@@ al ri@@ ghts as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even con@@ sci@@ ously met a vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m of their di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were ca@@ sting into secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss c@@ itiz@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them pa@@ use .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I figu@@ red out a way where I could int@@ ro@@ duce them to each other phot@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cally without any arti@@ fi@@ ce , without any li@@ gh@@ ting , or without any man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h you can exam@@ ine a lion &apos;s whi@@ sk@@ ers without the fear of him ri@@ pp@@ ing your face off .
"For me , phot@@ ograph@@ y is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing fil@@ m , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vie@@ w@@ er to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t gone before , but most import@@ antly , to people that they might be af@@ rai@@ d of ."
"@@ Li@@ fe ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to di@@ st@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew exi@@ sted through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a ser@@ ies of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , mu@@ g@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent st@@ rai@@ ght , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limit@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the fre@@ e@@ zing co@@ ld , and I phot@@ ograph@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those phot@@ ograph@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fund@@ ed two weeks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Music ) V@@ ide@@ o : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ let@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an arti@@ st born and rais@@ ed in New York C@@ ity . ( Music )@@ "
S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a phot@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c recor@@ d of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My aim is to take a simple por@@ tra@@ it of any@@ one who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent st@@ rai@@ ght or fe@@ els like they f@@ all in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q sp@@ ec@@ tru@@ m in any way .
My go@@ al is to show the human@@ ity that exi@@ sts in every one of us through the simp@@ lic@@ ity of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent that all men are created equ@@ al . &quot;
It &apos;s writ@@ ten in the D@@ ec@@ la@@ ration of In@@ depen@@ dence .
We are fai@@ ling as a nation to u@@ pho@@ ld the mo@@ ra@@ ls up@@ on which we were f@@ oun@@ ded .
There is no equ@@ ality in the United States .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equ@@ ality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ri@@ age &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ i@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ re@@ at every person as you &apos;d tre@@ at yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that ."
The fi@@ ght for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts is not just about ga@@ y mar@@ ri@@ age .
"T@@ o@@ day in 2@@ 9 sta@@ t@@ es , more than half of this country , you can leg@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o is respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all respon@@ sible for equ@@ ality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve sh@@ ot 3@@ 00 fac@@ es in New York C@@ ity .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the gener@@ ous supp@@ ort of the H@@ u@@ man Ri@@ ghts C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
I want to take the project across the country .
"I want to vi@@ sit 25 American cities , and I want to sho@@ ot 4@@ ,000 or 5@@ ,000 people ."
This is my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts fi@@ ght of my generation .
I challenge you to look into the fac@@ es of these people and tell them that they de@@ ser@@ ve less than any other human being .
"( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ el@@ f evi@@ dent tru@@ ths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4@@ ,000 fac@@ es across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) i@@ O T@@ il@@ let@@ t W@@ right : A@@ b@@ sol@@ utely nothing could have pre@@ pa@@ red us for what happened after that ."
"A@@ l@@ most 8@@ 5@@ ,000 people wat@@ ched that video , and then they started ema@@ il@@ ing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their to@@ w@@ ns and help them to show their fac@@ es ."
And a lot more people wanted to show their fac@@ es than I had anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed .
"So I changed my im@@ medi@@ ate go@@ al to 1@@ 0,000 fac@@ es ."
"That video was made in the sp@@ ring of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ vel@@ ed to almost 20 cities and phot@@ ograph@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a min@@ ute of just qui@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a thou@@ sand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ la@@ ry ."
"So after tra@@ vel@@ ing and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a or sma@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found evi@@ dence that the in@@ iti@@ al pre@@ mi@@ se was de@@ ad on ."
V@@ i@@ si@@ bility really is key .
F@@ ami@@ li@@ ar@@ ity really is the g@@ at@@ e@@ way drug to em@@ pa@@ thy .
"O@@ n@@ ce an is@@ sue pop@@ s up in your own back@@ y@@ ard or am@@ ong@@ st your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to ex@@ pl@@ ore sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy for it or ex@@ pl@@ ore a new per@@ sp@@ ective on it ."
"O@@ f course , in my tra@@ vel@@ s I met people who leg@@ ally di@@ v@@ or@@ ced their children for being other than st@@ rai@@ ght , but I also met people who were S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts who s@@ wit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ches because their child was a le@@ s@@ bi@@ an ."
S@@ par@@ king em@@ pa@@ thy had become the back@@ b@@ one of S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was star@@ ting to learn that was really interesting : S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differ@@ ences between us .
"In fact , on the con@@ tra@@ ry , it high@@ li@@ ghts them ."
"It pres@@ ents , not just the comple@@ x@@ ities found in a proce@@ ssion of different human be@@ ings , but the comple@@ x@@ ities found within each individu@@ al person ."
"It wasn &apos;t that we had too many bo@@ x@@ es , it was that we had too few ."
"At some point I realized that my mi@@ ssion to phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h &quot; &quot; ga@@ ys &quot; &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently fla@@ w@@ ed , because there were a million different sha@@ des of ga@@ y ."
"H@@ ere I was trying to help , and I had per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to av@@ oi@@ d — yet another box ."
A@@ t some point I ad@@ ded a question to the rele@@ ase form that asked people to qu@@ anti@@ fy themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent ga@@ y .
And I wat@@ ched so many exi@@ st@@ ential cri@@ ses un@@ fo@@ ld in front of me .
( Laughter ) P@@ eople didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been pre@@ sent@@ ed with the op@@ tion before .
C@@ an you qu@@ anti@@ fy your open@@ ness ?
"O@@ n@@ ce they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for some@@ where between 70 to 9@@ 5 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks ."
"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger prop@@ or@@ tion of people id@@ enti@@ fied as something that was much more nuan@@ ced ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a sp@@ ec@@ tru@@ m of what I have come to re@@ f@@ er to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fer@@ ence doesn &apos;t exi@@ st .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the is@@ sue of choice ver@@ su@@ s bio@@ logical im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the belie@@ f that se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ en@@ tation is a choice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal .
"The most important thing to take from the perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge system is this : If you have ga@@ y people over here and you have st@@ rai@@ ght people over here , and while we recogni@@ ze that most people id@@ enti@@ fy as some@@ where clos@@ er to one bi@@ nary or another , there is this v@@ ast sp@@ ec@@ tru@@ m of people that exi@@ st in between ."
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a comp@@ lic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you pa@@ ss a la@@ w that allow@@ s a b@@ os@@ s to fi@@ re an em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e for h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al behavior , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two h@@ et@@ er@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
W@@ here exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss c@@ itiz@@ en ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ vel@@ s is just what a poor bin@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ en@@ tation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ vel@@ ing so much and me@@ et@@ ing so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and D@@ e@@ mo@@ c@@ rat@@ s and R@@ ep@@ u@@ b@@ lic@@ ans and jo@@ cks and que@@ ens and every other po@@ la@@ ri@@ z@@ ation you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human ra@@ ce ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one leg@@ al hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the sha@@ red na@@ r@@ ra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and stru@@ gg@@ le , just being other than st@@ rai@@ ght doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the en@@ d@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always bec@@ om@@ ing , as it h@@ ope@@ fully appe@@ ars across more and more pla@@ t@@ for@@ ms , bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ters , bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book pa@@ ges , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , perhaps in wat@@ ching this proce@@ ssion of human@@ ity , something interesting and u@@ se@@ ful will beg@@ in to happen ."
"H@@ ope@@ fully these cat@@ eg@@ ories , these bi@@ na@@ ries , these over@@ -@@ simp@@ li@@ fied bo@@ x@@ es will beg@@ in to become u@@ sel@@ ess and they &apos;ll beg@@ in to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ tip@@ lic@@ ity .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human ri@@ ghts .
"So is it me particu@@ larly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to h@@ ous@@ ing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the fre@@ e@@ dom to sh@@ op here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to dis@@ own as your child or your bro@@ ther or your si@@ ster or your mother or your father , your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ sin , your un@@ cle , the pre@@ si@@ dent , your poli@@ ce woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So p@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t gre@@ et us as st@@ rang@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fel@@ low human be@@ ings , per@@ i@@ od ."
Thank you .

"We started talking about s@@ la@@ very , and really , I started learning about s@@ la@@ very , for I had cer@@ tain@@ ly known it exi@@ sted in the world , but not to such a de@@ gre@@ e ."
"A@@ f@@ ter we fin@@ i@@ shed talking , I felt so hor@@ ri@@ ble and hon@@ est@@ ly as@@ ha@@ med at my own lack of knowledge of this at@@ ro@@ city in my own li@@ fe@@ time , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?"
"It started bur@@ ning a ho@@ le in my sto@@ ma@@ ch , so within weeks , I f@@ le@@ w down to L@@ os A@@ ng@@ el@@ es to me@@ et with the direc@@ tor of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves and off@@ er them my help ."
Th@@ us began my jour@@ ney into mo@@ der@@ n day s@@ la@@ very .
"O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before ."
S@@ ome I even consi@@ der@@ ed like my second home .
"But this time , I would see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons hi@@ dd@@ en in the clos@@ et ."
A con@@ ser@@ v@@ ative esti@@ mate tel@@ ls us there are more than 2@@ 7 million people en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the world today .
That &apos;s d@@ ou@@ ble the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic s@@ la@@ ve tra@@ de .
"A hund@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , an ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural s@@ la@@ ve cost about three times the an@@ nu@@ al sa@@ la@@ ry of an American work@@ er ."
"That equ@@ ates to about $ 5@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money ."
"@@ Y@@ et today , entire fami@@ lies can be en@@ s@@ la@@ ved for gener@@ ations over a de@@ b@@ t as small as $ 18 ."
"A@@ st@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly , s@@ la@@ very gener@@ ates pro@@ f@@ its of more than $ 1@@ 3 billion wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de each year ."
"M@@ any have been tri@@ c@@ ked by fal@@ se pr@@ omi@@ ses of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re for@@ ced to work without pay under the thre@@ at of viol@@ ence , and they cannot walk away ."
"T@@ o@@ day &apos;s s@@ la@@ very is about com@@ mer@@ ce , so the go@@ o@@ ds that en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people produce have value , but the people produc@@ ing them are di@@ sp@@ os@@ able ."
"S@@ la@@ very exi@@ sts every@@ where , ne@@ ar@@ ly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ leg@@ al every@@ where in the world ."
"In India and N@@ e@@ pa@@ l , I was int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns ."
This st@@ range and a@@ we@@ some si@@ ght was like wal@@ king into an@@ cient E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or D@@ ant@@ e &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in tem@@ per@@ atu@@ res of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire fami@@ lies in fact , were c@@ lo@@ ak@@ ed in a he@@ av@@ y b@@ lan@@ k@@ et of du@@ st , while me@@ chan@@ ic@@ ally sta@@ c@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the sc@@ or@@ ching kil@@ ns to tru@@ cks hundreds of y@@ ar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ ad@@ en@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this ta@@ s@@ k over and over for 16 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no bre@@ ak@@ s for food , no water bre@@ ak@@ s , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made u@@ ri@@ nat@@ ing pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ ential ."
So per@@ v@@ a@@ sive was the he@@ at and the du@@ st that my cam@@ era became too h@@ ot to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ as@@ ed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air con@@ diti@@ on@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I sat there , I thought , my cam@@ era is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ac@@ k in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to c@@ ry , but the ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ oni@@ st next to me quickly gra@@ b@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very c@@ lear@@ ly expla@@ ined to me that emoti@@ onal di@@ sp@@ la@@ ys are very dang@@ er@@ ous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them ."
I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any direc@@ t help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a c@@ itiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se situ@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tru@@ sted that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wai@@ t until I got home to really feel my he@@ ar@@ t@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ ima@@ la@@ y@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for mi@@ les down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tru@@ cks wa@@ iting at ro@@ ads bel@@ ow ."
"The big s@@ he@@ ets of s@@ late were he@@ a@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ r@@ ying them , and the kids h@@ oi@@ sted them from their he@@ ads using these han@@ d@@ made har@@ ne@@ sses of sti@@ cks and ro@@ pe and t@@ or@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"@@ How can we aff@@ ect something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ v@@ a@@ sive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ s@@ la@@ ved , people working 16 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these vil@@ la@@ g@@ ers cla@@ im@@ ed their fre@@ e@@ dom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their h@@ ou@@ ses ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so p@@ et@@ ri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cent@@ er ra@@ l@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ oni@@ sts on the ground hel@@ ped them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry le@@ ase of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ ffi@@ c@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ f@@ ely within this particular indu@@ stry ."
"In K@@ a@@ th@@ man@@ du , I was e@@ sc@@ or@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x s@@ la@@ ves themselves ."
"They u@@ sh@@ ered me down a na@@ r@@ row set of stai@@ r@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent l@@ it ba@@ se@@ ment ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ thel , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are v@@ enue@@ s for for@@ ced pros@@ tit@@ u@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , pri@@ v@@ ate ro@@ oms , where the s@@ la@@ ves , women , along with young gir@@ ls and bo@@ ys , some as young as seven years old , are for@@ ced to ent@@ er@@ tain the cli@@ ents , en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ h@@ ol ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ bi@@ cle is dar@@ k and di@@ ng@@ y , id@@ enti@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and par@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ wo@@ od and a cur@@ tain ."
The work@@ ers here often en@@ du@@ re tra@@ gi@@ c se@@ x@@ u@@ al ab@@ use at the hands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers .
"S@@ tan@@ ding in the ne@@ ar dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feeling this quic@@ k , h@@ ot fear , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be t@@ rapp@@ ed in that h@@ ell ."
I had only one way out : the stai@@ r@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to cli@@ m@@ b through .
"These people have no e@@ sc@@ ape at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ ject , it &apos;s important to not@@ e that s@@ la@@ very , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ ffi@@ c@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hundreds of people are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in ag@@ ri@@ culture , in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , in d@@ ome@@ stic ser@@ v@@ itu@@ de , and the list can go on ."
"@@ R@@ ec@@ ently , the New York T@@ im@@ es repor@@ ted that between 10@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are so@@ ld into se@@ x s@@ la@@ very every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The t@@ ex@@ ti@@ le indu@@ stry is another one we often think of when we hear about s@@ la@@ ve la@@ b@@ or .
I vi@@ sit@@ ed vil@@ la@@ ges in India where entire fami@@ lies were en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The d@@ yed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x d@@ ye in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qui@@ d up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ ye is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"@@ &quot; &quot; We have no fre@@ e@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our d@@ ye@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the lar@@ gest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a quic@@ k look ."
"I saw what se@@ em@@ ed to be a family fi@@ shing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some you@@ ng@@ er kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ rong . They were all en@@ s@@ la@@ ved .
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren are taken from their fami@@ lies and tra@@ ffi@@ c@@ ked and v@@ ani@@ shed , and they &apos;re for@@ ced to work en@@ d@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is eight years old .
"He was tre@@ mb@@ ling when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e ."
He was p@@ et@@ ri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .
"The sk@@ el@@ e@@ tal t@@ ree li@@ mb@@ s sub@@ mer@@ g@@ ed in L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta often cat@@ ch the fi@@ shing n@@ ets , and we@@ ary , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed children are th@@ ro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lin@@ es ."
M@@ any of them d@@ ro@@ wn .
"For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been for@@ ced to work on the la@@ ke ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ fied of his ma@@ ster , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with c@@ rue@@ l@@ ty all his life , he pa@@ sses that down to the you@@ ng@@ er s@@ la@@ ves that he manag@@ es ."
"I met these bo@@ ys at five in the mor@@ ning , when they were ha@@ u@@ ling in the last of their n@@ ets , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the co@@ ld , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to not@@ e that these n@@ ets we@@ i@@ gh more than a thou@@ sand p@@ ounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to int@@ ro@@ duce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was re@@ sc@@ ue@@ d from a fi@@ shing vil@@ la@@ ge .
I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ates vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms of s@@ la@@ very .
"H@@ ere he &apos;s seen taking a bat@@ h at the well , p@@ our@@ ing big bu@@ ck@@ ets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ fe ."
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possi@@ bility .
Wh@@ o will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
"D@@ ri@@ ving down a ro@@ ad in G@@ han@@ a with par@@ tn@@ ers of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , a fel@@ low ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ oni@@ st on a m@@ op@@ ed sudd@@ en@@ ly sp@@ ed up to our c@@ ru@@ is@@ er and tap@@ ped on the win@@ do@@ w ."
He told us to fol@@ low him down a di@@ r@@ t ro@@ ad into the ju@@ ng@@ le .
"At the end of the ro@@ ad , he ur@@ g@@ ed us out of the car , and told the dri@@ ver to quickly leave ."
"Th@@ en he poin@@ ted to@@ ward this ba@@ rely vi@@ sible fo@@ ot@@ pat@@ h , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the pat@@ h , this is the pat@@ h . G@@ o . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we started down the pat@@ h , we pu@@ shed a@@ side the v@@ ines blo@@ c@@ king the way , and after about an h@@ our of wal@@ king in , found that the tra@@ il had become flo@@ o@@ ded by rec@@ ent ra@@ ins , so I h@@ oi@@ sted the phot@@ o ge@@ ar ab@@ o@@ ve my head as we de@@ sc@@ en@@ ded into these wat@@ ers up to my che@@ st ."
"A@@ f@@ ter another two hours of h@@ ik@@ ing , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ rup@@ tly en@@ ded at a c@@ lear@@ ing , and before us was a ma@@ ss of hol@@ es that could fit into the size of a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all field , and all of them were full of en@@ s@@ la@@ ved people la@@ bor@@ ing ."
"M@@ any women had children st@@ rapp@@ ed to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for go@@ ld , wa@@ ding in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cu@@ ry ."
M@@ er@@ cu@@ ry is used in the ex@@ trac@@ tion process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in a mine sha@@ ft in another part of G@@ han@@ a .
"When they came out of the sha@@ ft , they were so@@ ak@@ ing w@@ et from their own s@@ we@@ at ."
"I remember looking into their ti@@ red , blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ot eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours ."
"The sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 3@@ 00 fe@@ et deep , and they car@@ ry out he@@ av@@ y b@@ ag@@ s of st@@ one that later will be transp@@ or@@ ted to another area , where the st@@ one will be p@@ oun@@ ded so that they can ex@@ trac@@ t the go@@ ld ."
"At first g@@ lan@@ ce , the p@@ oun@@ ding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look clos@@ er , we see some less for@@ tu@@ nate working on the fri@@ ng@@ es , and children too ."
"A@@ ll of them are vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m to in@@ ju@@ ry , il@@ l@@ ness and viol@@ ence ."
"In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this mu@@ s@@ cu@@ lar person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is and mer@@ cu@@ ry po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years ."
"This is M@@ an@@ u@@ ru . W@@ hen his father died , his un@@ cle tra@@ ffi@@ c@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es ."
"When his un@@ cle died , M@@ an@@ u@@ ru in@@ her@@ ited his un@@ cle &apos;s de@@ b@@ t , which fu@@ r@@ ther for@@ ced him into being en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the min@@ es ."
"When I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 14 years , and the le@@ g in@@ ju@@ ry that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing ac@@ ci@@ dent , one so se@@ v@@ ere doc@@ tors say his le@@ g should be am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted ."
"O@@ n top of that , M@@ an@@ u@@ ru has tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is , yet he &apos;s still for@@ ced to work day in and day out in that mine sha@@ ft ."
"E@@ ven still , he has a dre@@ am that he will become free and become educ@@ ated with the help of local ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , and it &apos;s this sort of det@@ er@@ mi@@ nation , in the face of un@@ ima@@ gi@@ na@@ ble od@@ ds , that fil@@ ls me with complet@@ e a@@ we ."
I want to sh@@ ine a light on s@@ la@@ very .
"When I was working in the field , I brought lots of can@@ d@@ les with me , and with the help of my inter@@ pre@@ ter , I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was phot@@ ograph@@ ing that I wanted to il@@ lu@@ mi@@ nate their stories and their p@@ light , so when it was sa@@ fe for them , and sa@@ fe for me , I made these images ."
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
"I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ aring wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do wha@@ tever we can to help make a difference in their lives ."
"I tru@@ ly believe , if we can see one another as fel@@ low human be@@ ings , then it bec@@ omes very difficult to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate at@@ ro@@ cities like s@@ la@@ very ."
"These images are not of i@@ ssues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all de@@ ser@@ ving of the same ri@@ ghts , dig@@ n@@ ity and resp@@ ect in their lives ."
"There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mi@@ stre@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous hon@@ or of me@@ et@@ ing ."
"I hope that these images a@@ wak@@ en a for@@ ce in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that for@@ ce will ig@@ nit@@ e a fi@@ re , and that fi@@ re will sh@@ ine a light on s@@ la@@ very , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ da@@ ge can contin@@ ue to live in the sha@@ do@@ ws ."

The dec@@ o@@ ra@@ tive use of wi@@ re in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Africa dat@@ es back hundreds of years .
"But mo@@ der@@ ni@@ z@@ ation actually brought communic@@ ation and a whole new material , in the form of tel@@ e@@ phone wi@@ re ."
R@@ u@@ ral to ur@@ b@@ an mi@@ gra@@ tion me@@ ant that ne@@ w@@ found indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ als started to re@@ place har@@ d-@@ to@@ -@@ com@@ e-@@ by natural gra@@ sses .
"So , here you can see the change from use — star@@ ting to use con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry materi@@ als ."
These piec@@ es d@@ ate back from the &apos; 4@@ 0s to the late &apos; 5@@ 0s .
"In the &apos; 9@@ 0s , my inter@@ est and pa@@ ssion for trans@@ iti@@ onal art for@@ ms led me to a new form , which came from a s@@ qu@@ at@@ ter cam@@ p outside D@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started develop@@ ing , really , and m@@ ent@@ or@@ ing them in terms of scale , in terms of the design ."
And the project so@@ on gre@@ w from five to 50 we@@ a@@ ver@@ s in about a year .
"S@@ o@@ on we had out@@ gro@@ wn the sc@@ rap y@@ ar@@ ds , what they could provi@@ de , so we co@@ er@@ ced a wi@@ re man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r to help us , and not only to supp@@ ly the materi@@ als on bo@@ b@@ b@@ ins , but to produce to our col@@ or speci@@ fic@@ ations ."
"At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possi@@ bility here to produce con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry produc@@ ts , away from the eth@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry ."
So I developed a whole range around — ma@@ ss@@ -@@ produc@@ ed range — that obvi@@ ously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er@@ -@@ end dec@@ or market that could be ex@@ por@@ ted and also ser@@ vice our local market .
"We started experim@@ ent@@ ing , as you can see , in terms of sha@@ pes , for@@ ms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our p@@ et project . It &apos;s succe@@ ss@@ ful , it &apos;s been run@@ ning for 12 years . And we supp@@ ly the C@@ on@@ ran sh@@ op@@ s , and D@@ on@@ na K@@ a@@ ran , and so it &apos;s kind of great ."
"This is our group , our main group of we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."
They come on a we@@ ek@@ ly bas@@ is to D@@ ur@@ b@@ an .
They all have b@@ ank ac@@ count@@ s .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the ru@@ ral area where they came from .
It &apos;s a we@@ ek@@ ly tur@@ na@@ rou@@ nd of produc@@ tion .
This is the community that I ori@@ gi@@ nally show@@ ed you the sli@@ de of .
"And that &apos;s also mo@@ der@@ ni@@ zed today , and it &apos;s supp@@ or@@ ting work for 3@@ 00 we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."
And the rest says it all .

"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ac@@ k in univer@@ sity , we had a quic@@ k project to design some so@@ lar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s my c@@ lo@@ ck .
"It us@@ es something called the d@@ war@@ f sun@@ f@@ low@@ er , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ches in he@@ i@@ ght ."
"Now , as you know , sun@@ f@@ low@@ ers tra@@ ck the sun during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which direc@@ tion the sun@@ f@@ low@@ er is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank area in the ba@@ se ."
"At no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed pos@@ ition of the sun@@ f@@ low@@ er , and in the ev@@ ening again , and that &apos;s your c@@ lo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my c@@ lo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a f@@ low@@ er ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed , sub@@ j@@ ective op@@ ini@@ on , it &apos;s bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gla@@ sses with a sh@@ ot gla@@ ss under each one .
In each sh@@ ot gla@@ ss is a different sc@@ ented oi@@ l .
"In the mor@@ ning , the sun@@ light will sh@@ ine down on the first mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gla@@ ss , focu@@ sing a be@@ am of light on the sh@@ ot gla@@ ss under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ ented oi@@ l inside , and a particular sm@@ ell will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ el@@ ls are di@@ sp@@ er@@ sed throu@@ gh@@ out that environment ."
A@@ ny@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the sm@@ ell .
You can see why I ha@@ te Ch@@ ris .
One thing you have to know about me is I ha@@ te to l@@ ose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gg@@ ing me for well over a dec@@ a@@ de .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the so@@ lar power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks project , a young la@@ dy I knew sug@@ ge@@ sted maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"T@@ o do this , I de@@ vi@@ sed something called the five sen@@ ses g@@ rap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have a scale from z@@ ero to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ ny@@ time I had a me@@ mo@@ ra@@ ble experience in my life , I would recor@@ d it on this g@@ rap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a quic@@ k video to show you how it works .
"B@@ i@@ ke desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bi@@ ke desig@@ ner ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le rev@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ i@@ ght &#93; &#91; S@@ m@@ ell &#93; &#91; T@@ a@@ ste &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses g@@ rap@@ h works .
So here are some other resul@@ ts .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , ta@@ ste and sm@@ ell are quite high , but noti@@ ce sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ lu@@ r@@ ps ) N@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , c@@ lu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do h@@ ang out with .
"A@@ ll right , and sm@@ ok@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that sm@@ ok@@ ers told me the sen@@ sation of hol@@ ding a ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e and bri@@ ng@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the sm@@ ok@@ ing experience , which show@@ s , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ es are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the perf@@ ect experience look like on the five sen@@ ses g@@ rap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as int@@ en@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ ther@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perf@@ ect one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . Gre@@ at se@@ x ."
Re@@ sp@@ on@@ d@@ ents said that great se@@ x h@@ its all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses theory does help expla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I sudd@@ en@@ ly re@@ me@@ mb@@ ered the so@@ lar@@ -@@ power@@ ed c@@ lo@@ cks project from my you@@ th ."
And I realized this theory also expla@@ ins why Ch@@ ris &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck is so much better than mine .
"You see , my c@@ lo@@ ck only focu@@ ses on si@@ ght , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ ris &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first c@@ lo@@ ck ever that us@@ es sm@@ ell to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ ris &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck is a rev@@ olution ."
And that &apos;s what this theory ta@@ u@@ ght me about my field .
"You see , up ti@@ ll now , us desig@@ n@@ ers , we &apos;ve ma@@ in@@ ly focu@@ sed on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ ris &apos;s c@@ lo@@ ck show@@ s us that even rais@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant produc@@ t .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses theory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three quic@@ k ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ mat@@ or . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I b@@ ru@@ sh my te@@ et@@ h t@@ wi@@ ce a day , and what if we had a to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh that ta@@ st@@ es like can@@ dy , and when the ta@@ ste of can@@ dy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh ?"
"Fi@@ nally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a fl@@ ute or a c@@ lar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pre@@ ss down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the fl@@ ute or the c@@ lar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ stru@@ ment I do play : the tel@@ evi@@ sion re@@ mot@@ e control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll noti@@ ce that the five sen@@ ses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realize the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emoti@@ ons and that el@@ u@@ sive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
Ma@@ ybe that could be the top@@ ic of my next talk .
"@@ U@@ n@@ til then , p@@ le@@ ase have fu@@ n using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .

"( A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c ) I se@@ ek re@@ fu@@ ge in Al@@ la@@ h from cur@@ sed S@@ a@@ tan . In the N@@ ame of Al@@ la@@ h , the most G@@ ra@@ ci@@ ous , the most M@@ er@@ ci@@ ful ."
( Eng@@ lish ) I was born in a middle cla@@ ss family .
"My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a busin@@ ess@@ man ."
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a bo@@ y or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I gue@@ ss I was the lu@@ ck@@ y one .
My mother had 16 pre@@ g@@ nan@@ ci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 16 pre@@ g@@ nan@@ ci@@ es , five of us are ali@@ ve ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
"D@@ ay to day , I wat@@ ched women being car@@ ri@@ ed to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , or wat@@ ched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard ."
"At that time , when I fin@@ i@@ shed my high school , I really wanted to be a doc@@ tor ."
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help women and children .
"So I complet@@ ed my education , but I wanted to go to univer@@ sity ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a d@@ or@@ mit@@ ory for gir@@ ls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in medi@@ cal school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a result , my father sent me to America ."
I came to America .
I complet@@ ed my education .
"W@@ hi@@ le I was complet@@ ing my education , my country was inv@@ ad@@ ed by R@@ us@@ sia ."
"And do you know that at the time I was complet@@ ing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I complet@@ ed my education , I brought my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n .
"D@@ ay after day , when I list@@ en@@ ed to the news , when I follow@@ ed what was going on with my country , my heart was bre@@ ak@@ ing up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a profe@@ ss@@ or at a univer@@ sity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in P@@ ak@@ i@@ sta@@ n , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 90 percent of them were women and children . M@@ ost of the men have been kil@@ led or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ,@@ "
"@@ when I went da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ v@@ ey , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wi@@ do@@ w with five to eight children sitting there and we@@ ep@@ ing and not kno@@ wing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
"I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supp@@ or@@ ting the family as a 10@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the h@@ ou@@ se@@ hold , trying to prot@@ ect their si@@ ster and their mother and their children ."
So it was a very de@@ v@@ as@@ ta@@ ting situ@@ ation .
"My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"At that moment , we talk about mom@@ entu@@ m ."
"At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ for@@ med me . It gave me sta@@ tu@@ s .
It gave me con@@ fi@@ dence . It gave me a care@@ er .
"It hel@@ ped me to supp@@ ort my family , to bring my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe ."
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was easy ?
"N@@ o , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ sia inv@@ ad@@ ing A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , people were not tru@@ sting any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I ?"
S@@ ome@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ ome@@ body who got educ@@ ated here .
D@@ id they tru@@ st me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tru@@ st in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"Fi@@ nally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his t@@ ent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teach@@ er . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ zy woman , cra@@ zy woman , how do you think I can be a teach@@ er ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; F@@ i@@ nally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my off@@ er , and once I started a cla@@ ss in his comp@@ ound , the word sp@@ read all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 scho@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
"But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teach@@ er tra@@ ining . We were tra@@ ining women &apos;s ri@@ ghts , human ri@@ ghts , demo@@ c@@ rac@@ y , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were giving all kinds of tra@@ ining . And one day , I tell you ,@@ "
"@@ one day I was in the offi@@ ce in P@@ e@@ sha@@ war , P@@ ak@@ i@@ sta@@ n ."
"A@@ ll of a sudd@@ en , I saw my sta@@ ff run@@ ning to ro@@ oms and loc@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ u@@ n away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a lead@@ er , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re sc@@ a@@ red . You know it &apos;s dang@@ er@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a lead@@ er , you have to hold it together ."
You have to hold it together and show stre@@ ng@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were p@@ our@@ ing into my offi@@ ce ."
So I inv@@ ited them to the offi@@ ce .
"They came , and there were n@@ ine of them — n@@ ine T@@ ali@@ b@@ an ."
They were the u@@ g@@ li@@ est looking men you can ever see .
"( Laughter ) V@@ ery mean@@ -@@ looking people , black c@@ lo@@ the@@ s , black tur@@ b@@ an , and they p@@ our into my offi@@ ce ."
And I inv@@ ited them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to dr@@ ink te@@ a .
"And of course , with the t@@ one of voice they were using , it was very sc@@ ary , but I was really sha@@ king up ."
"But also I was st@@ rong , hol@@ ding myself up ."
"And , of course , by that time , you know how I dre@@ ss — I dre@@ ss from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ j@@ a@@ b ."
"The only thing you could see , my eyes ."
"They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for gir@@ ls ?
"What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? W@@ here is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teach@@ ing gir@@ ls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody ."
"We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ o@@ ran , H@@ o@@ ly B@@ o@@ ok ."
"And you know , K@@ o@@ ran says that if you learn the H@@ o@@ ly B@@ o@@ ok , the woman , they can be a good wi@@ fe , and they can o@@ be@@ y their hu@@ s@@ b@@ and . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speak@@ ing P@@ as@@ h@@ to ."
"They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s O@@ K . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I o@@ ffer@@ ed them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left ."
"B@@ y that time , my sta@@ ff p@@ ou@@ red into my offi@@ ce ."
They were sc@@ a@@ red to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
"@@ V@@ ery happy , and I was happy to be ali@@ ve , of course ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happy to be ali@@ ve ."
"But also , as we contin@@ u@@ ously gave tra@@ ining during the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an — of course during the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an there is another story ."
"We went under@@ ground and we provi@@ ded education for 80 scho@@ ol@@ gir@@ ls , 3@@ ,000 students under@@ ground , and contin@@ u@@ ously we tra@@ ined ."
"W@@ ith the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , we went into the country , and we open@@ ed school after school ."
We open@@ ed women &apos;s learning cent@@ er .
We contin@@ u@@ ously open@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ics .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
We had re@@ produc@@ tive health tra@@ ining .
We had all kinds of tra@@ ining that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ gh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up nor@@ th of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and all of a sudd@@ en , again , I was st@@ op@@ ped in the middle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men ."
"@@ Ri@@ f@@ les on their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders , they blo@@ c@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"And I told my dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the dri@@ ver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you ."
"What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing . &quot; &quot; They called my name ."
"And by that time , the women are y@@ el@@ ling and scre@@ am@@ ing inside the car ."
"I am very sha@@ k@@ en up , and I told myself , this is it ."
"This time , we all are going to be kil@@ led ."
There is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
"But still , the moment comes , and you take stre@@ ng@@ th from wha@@ tever you believe and wha@@ tever you do ."
It &apos;s in your heart .
"You believe in your wor@@ th , and you can walk on it ."
So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
"My le@@ g was sha@@ king , and I got outside ."
"And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up nor@@ th here and there .
"You tra@@ in women , you te@@ ach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job ."
"You build their sk@@ il@@ ls . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?"
"What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s O@@ K ."
"The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gu@@ n and k@@ ill ."
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
"So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; T@@ ur@@ n around and go back to the offi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were supp@@ or@@ ting gir@@ ls ."
"We only had money for women to tra@@ in them , to s@@ end them to school , and nothing else ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the offi@@ ce , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were gone ."
They ran away home . N@@ o@@ body sta@@ yed there .
"My bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone ."
"I was sha@@ k@@ en up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?"
Because we had tra@@ ining going on up nor@@ th already .
H@@ und@@ reds of women were there coming to get tra@@ ining .
"So I was sitting there , all of a sudd@@ en , at this moment , talking about mom@@ entu@@ m , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful don@@ ors called me about a repor@@ t ."
"And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I answ@@ ered her ."
"She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing . &quot; &quot; I tried to co@@ ver ."
"N@@ o matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again ."
"@@ &quot; O@@ K , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I told her the whole story .
"At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back fu@@ r@@ ther , the same young men , standing up there and hol@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and poin@@ ting to us to stop the car ."
So we st@@ op@@ ped the car .
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one con@@ dition , that wha@@ tever I say , you ac@@ cept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do ."
"So I took them to the mos@@ que , and to make a long story sh@@ ort , I told them I &apos;d give them teach@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"They learn Eng@@ lish , they learn how to be teach@@ ers , they learn comp@@ ut@@ ers , and they are my gu@@ i@@ des ."
"E@@ very area that is un@@ known to us in the m@@ oun@@ tain areas , they go with me . They are a@@ head , and we go ."
And they prot@@ ect us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tel@@ ls you that education trans@@ for@@ ms people .
"When you educ@@ ate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gen@@ der equ@@ ality ."
"We cannot only tra@@ in women but for@@ get about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the har@@ de@@ st time ."
"( Laughter ) So we started tra@@ ining men because the men should know the pot@@ ential of women , know how much these pot@@ ential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing ."
"So we are contin@@ u@@ ously giving tra@@ ining to men , and I really believe st@@ rong@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
"It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country ."
We were going every@@ where .
"W@@ om@@ en were getting education : la@@ w@@ y@@ er , engine@@ er , teach@@ er , and we were going from house to house ."
We never loc@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But you know what happened to my country .
"T@@ o@@ day , people cannot walk out of their do@@ or without sec@@ ur@@ ity i@@ ssues ."
But we want the same A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
"T@@ o@@ day , the women of A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ ining to be la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
"They are tra@@ ining to be doc@@ tors , back again ."
"They are tra@@ ining to be teach@@ ers , and they are run@@ ning busin@@ ess@@ es ."
"So it is so wonderful to see people like that re@@ ach their complet@@ e pot@@ ential , and all of this is going to happen ."
"I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compa@@ ssion , and because of tru@@ st and hon@@ est@@ y ."
"If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ comp@@ lish ."
"We have one p@@ oet , Ma@@ w@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī ."
"He said that by having compa@@ ssion and having love , you can con@@ que@@ r the world ."
"And I tell you , we could ."
"And if we could do it in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world ."
"@@ Thank you very , very much ."

"This is where I live . I live in K@@ en@@ ya , at the s@@ outh parts of the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my da@@ d &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s at the back , and behind the c@@ ow@@ s , that &apos;s the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k ."
"N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k is not f@@ en@@ ced in the s@@ outh wi@@ d@@ ely , which means wi@@ ld animals like z@@ e@@ bra@@ s mi@@ g@@ rate out of the par@@ k fre@@ ely ."
"So pre@@ dat@@ ors like lions fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck .
"This is one of the c@@ ow@@ s which was kil@@ led at night , and I just w@@ oke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had ."
"My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from he@@ a@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up ha@@ ting lions so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prot@@ ect our community and the li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were kil@@ led in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i .
And I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k lions are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to n@@ ine years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his da@@ d &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fi@@ re , because I thought lions were sc@@ a@@ red of fi@@ re ."
"But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the lions to see through the c@@ ow@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ ue@@ d .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ a@@ rec@@ row .
I was trying to tri@@ ck the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing ne@@ ar the c@@ ow@@ shed .
"But lions are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ a@@ rec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he ju@@ m@@ ps in and kil@@ ls the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the c@@ ow@@ shed with a t@@ or@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that lions are af@@ rai@@ d of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new radi@@ o , and that day she almost kil@@ led me , but I learned a lot about elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ dic@@ at@@ or box . It &apos;s a small de@@ vice found in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mot@@ ori@@ sts when they want to turn right or left . It b@@ lin@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the li@@ ghts , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small t@@ or@@ ch from a b@@ rok@@ en fla@@ sh@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the so@@ lar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ ter@@ y , and the bat@@ ter@@ y supp@@ lies the power to the small in@@ dic@@ at@@ or box . I call it a trans@@ for@@ mer ."
And the in@@ dic@@ at@@ or box makes the li@@ ghts fla@@ sh .
"As you can see , the bu@@ l@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
"The li@@ ghts fla@@ sh and tri@@ ck the lions into thinking I was wal@@ king around the c@@ ow@@ shed , but I was s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ en@@ ced any problem with lions ."
And my ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing h@@ omes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grand@@ mother .
"She had a lot of her animals being kil@@ led by lions , and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the li@@ ghts . You can see at the back , those are the lion li@@ ghts ."
"S@@ in@@ ce now , I &apos;ve set up seven h@@ omes around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over K@@ en@@ ya for sc@@ aring other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ ena@@ s , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are el@@ e@@ phant@@ s away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion , I was lu@@ ck@@ y to get a scho@@ lar@@ ship in one of the best scho@@ ols in K@@ en@@ ya , B@@ ro@@ o@@ kh@@ ouse Inter@@ national S@@ cho@@ ol , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fund@@ rais@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re in@@ sta@@ l@@ ling the li@@ ghts to the h@@ omes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ na gra@@ ss@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an ai@@ r@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I grow up .
"I used to ha@@ te lions , but now because my inv@@ en@@ tion is sa@@ ving my father &apos;s c@@ ow@@ s and the lions , we are able to sta@@ y with the lions without any con@@ f@@ lic@@ t ."
"A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , than@@ k you very much ."
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : You have no idea how exc@@ iting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .
So you got this scho@@ lar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ Ri@@ cha@@ rd T@@ ur@@ ere : Y@@ ep .
C@@ A : You &apos;re working on other electri@@ cal inv@@ enti@@ ons .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
"@@ R@@ T : My next inv@@ en@@ tion is , I want to make an electri@@ c f@@ en@@ ce@@ .@@ C@@ A : E@@ l@@ ec@@ tri@@ c f@@ ence ?"
"@@ R@@ T : But I know electri@@ c f@@ ences are already inv@@ ented , but I want to make mine ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : You already tried it once , right , and you — R@@ T : I tried it before , but I st@@ op@@ ped because it gave me a sho@@ ck . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : In the tr@@ en@@ ches . Ri@@ cha@@ rd T@@ ur@@ ere , you are something else ."
"We &apos;re going to che@@ er you on every step of the way , my friend ."
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ R@@ T : Thank you . ( Applause )
"@@ Just absol@@ utely amazing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ i@@ sap@@ pe@@ ars right into the back@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s b@@ lu@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it back@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"You know , one of the int@@ en@@ se p@@ lea@@ su@@ res of tra@@ vel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ gra@@ phi@@ c research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the w@@ ind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of pl@@ ants ."
"@@ Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still jour@@ ney be@@ yon@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the I@@ nu@@ it el@@ ders still re@@ so@@ nate with mean@@ ing , or that in the H@@ ima@@ la@@ ya , the B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the cent@@ ral re@@ ve@@ lation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exi@@ st in some absol@@ ute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our l@@ ine@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succe@@ ss@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago ."
"And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves ."
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es .
"We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ o@@ ra@@ ble se@@ pa@@ ration of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art ."
"But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que c@@ ad@@ ence of the song , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture ."
"And whether it is the P@@ ena@@ n in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ sut de@@ ser@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ ya , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a ca@@ ra@@ v@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a — this is in@@ ci@@ den@@ tally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the de@@ ser@@ t with a mon@@ th ago — or in@@ de@@ ed a yak her@@ der in the s@@ l@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mother of the world ."
"A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the Earth ."
"And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope ."
"Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al life and cul@@ tural life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the bio@@ logical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ."
"And you might think of this cul@@ tural we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere as being the su@@ m to@@ tal of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ons brought into being by the human ima@@ gi@@ nation since the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
The e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere is human@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
"And just as the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere — and , if anything , at a far great@@ er rate ."
"N@@ o bio@@ logi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are sug@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the b@@ r@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most ap@@ o@@ cal@@ y@@ pti@@ c sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o in the real@@ m of bio@@ logical di@@ versity — sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most opti@@ mi@@ stic sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tural di@@ versity ."
"And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that , of course , is language los@@ s ."
"When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ag@@ es sp@@ ok@@ en on the planet ."
"Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ la@@ ry or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal ru@@ les ."
A language is a fla@@ sh of the human spi@@ rit .
It &apos;s a ve@@ hi@@ cle through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
"E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth fore@@ st of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al possi@@ bil@@ ities ."
"And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ag@@ es , as we sit here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being whi@@ sp@@ ered into the e@@ ars of children ."
"They &apos;re no longer being ta@@ u@@ ght to bab@@ ies , which means , eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already de@@ ad ."
"What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pa@@ ss on the wi@@ s@@ dom of the an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors or anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ e the pr@@ omi@@ se of the children ?"
"And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ la@@ b@@ les of an an@@ cient t@@ ong@@ ue ."
"And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ oke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ b@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ e@@ se ."
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll sudd@@ en@@ ly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be u@@ na@@ ble to speak your own language .
"And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , a bri@@ e@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost ."
"Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being ."
"T@@ ake , for example , this child of a B@@ a@@ ra@@ san@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ tho@@ logi@@ cally they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the ea@@ st in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ nak@@ es ."
"Now , this is a people who co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do not di@@ sti@@ ng@@ u@@ is@@ h the col@@ or blue from the col@@ or green because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fore@@ st up@@ on which the people de@@ p@@ end ."
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; &quot; li@@ ng@@ u@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who speak@@ s a different language .
"And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ tho@@ logical past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ou@@ ses , where there are six or seven langu@@ ag@@ es sp@@ ok@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one practi@@ cing a language ."
They simply list@@ en and then beg@@ in to speak .
"O@@ r , one of the most fas@@ ci@@ nat@@ ing tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ oni@@ shing people first con@@ ta@@ c@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 ."
"In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mi@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ries at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted con@@ ta@@ ct and made a cr@@ iti@@ cal mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
"They d@@ rop@@ ped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y phot@@ ograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ en@@ dly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st had never seen anything t@@ wo@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal in their lives ."
"They pic@@ ked up these phot@@ ograph@@ s from the fore@@ st flo@@ or , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that these were cal@@ ling car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ a@@ red the five mi@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ries to death ."
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ a@@ red each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
"We tra@@ ced gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stan@@ ces of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ low@@ s had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ a@@ red him any@@ way . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous knowledge of the fore@@ st that was ast@@ oni@@ shing ."
The@@ ir h@@ un@@ ters could sm@@ ell anima@@ l ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
"In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ oni@@ shing as@@ sig@@ nm@@ ent when I was asked by my profe@@ ss@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i , inf@@ il@@ t@@ rat@@ ing the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ eti@@ es which were the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion of D@@ u@@ val@@ i@@ er &apos;s stre@@ ng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ out@@ es , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ i@@ son used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es ."
"In order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble fa@@ ith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t ."
"O@@ n the con@@ tra@@ ry , it &apos;s a complex me@@ ta@@ physical wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
It &apos;s interesting .
"If I asked you to name the great reli@@ gi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?"
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , Is@@ la@@ m , B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sm , Ju@@ dai@@ sm , wha@@ tever ."
"There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ ha@@ ran Africa had no reli@@ gi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ sti@@ l@@ lation of these very pro@@ found reli@@ gi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c D@@ i@@ a@@ sp@@ or@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very era ."
"But , what makes V@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad ."
"So , the living give bir@@ th to the spi@@ r@@ its ."
"The spi@@ r@@ its can be inv@@ ok@@ ed from bene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ at@@ er , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ en@@ ta@@ ri@@ ly di@@ sp@@ la@@ ce the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ e@@ f sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te bec@@ omes the go@@ d ."
That &apos;s why the V@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ oi@@ sts like to say that &quot; &quot; You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about God .
"We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are pos@@ se@@ ssed , you are taken by the spi@@ rit — how can you be har@@ med ?"
"So you see these ast@@ oni@@ shing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ o@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance han@@ d@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ b@@ ers with imp@@ un@@ ity , a rather ast@@ oni@@ shing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when ca@@ tal@@ y@@ zed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a ."
"D@@ e@@ sc@@ en@@ d@@ ants of the an@@ cient T@@ ai@@ ron@@ a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which once car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the w@@ ake of the con@@ que@@ st , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an i@@ so@@ lated v@@ ol@@ can@@ ic ma@@ ssi@@ f that so@@ ars ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal pla@@ in ."
"In a blo@@ od@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ pan@@ is@@ h ."
"T@@ o this day , they re@@ main ru@@ led by a rit@@ u@@ al pri@@ e@@ s@@ tho@@ od but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ e@@ s@@ tho@@ od is rather ex@@ tra@@ ordinary ."
"The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es are taken away from their fami@@ lies at the age of three and four , se@@ que@@ ster@@ ed in a sha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the ba@@ se of gla@@ ci@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ ine@@ -@@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to mi@@ mic the n@@ ine months of ge@@ sta@@ tion they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ic@@ ally in the wom@@ b of the great mother ."
"And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tu@@ rated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that ma@@ in@@ tain the prop@@ os@@ ition that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers alone ma@@ in@@ tain the cos@@ mic — or we might say the ec@@ o@@ logical — bal@@ ance ."
"And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re sudd@@ en@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ ri@@ se . And in that cr@@ y@@ sta@@ l moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the Su@@ n beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the s@@ l@@ op@@ es of the st@@ un@@ ning@@ ly beautiful lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , sudd@@ en@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t is af@@ fi@@ r@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ l@@ ory . And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you ."
"It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the you@@ ng@@ er bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying the world ."
"Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition bec@@ omes very important ."
"W@@ h@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , we either inv@@ oke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea ra@@ ci@@ st in its simp@@ lic@@ ity , or al@@ ter@@ nati@@ v@@ ely , we inv@@ oke Th@@ o@@ re@@ a@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are ."
"Well , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther s@@ enti@@ mental no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a ."
"There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the ma@@ la@@ ri@@ al s@@ wam@@ ps of the A@@ sma@@ t or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and rit@@ u@@ al , for@@ g@@ ed a tra@@ diti@@ onal my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exi@@ st because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
"Now , what does that mean ?"
It means that a young ki@@ d from the An@@ des who &apos;s rais@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u spi@@ rit that will direc@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ f@@ oun@@ dly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that re@@ source or that place than a young ki@@ d from M@@ on@@ tan@@ a rais@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a spi@@ rit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was rais@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of B@@ r@@ iti@@ sh C@@ olu@@ m@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts exi@@ sted to be cut .
"That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ uk@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ ok@@ ed B@@ e@@ ak of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ r@@ its that d@@ w@@ el@@ led at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ r@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ a@@ mat@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation ."
"Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ ities , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . T@@ ake this plant here ."
It &apos;s a phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
"This is a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ pa@@ ration of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re ."
"What makes a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fas@@ ci@@ nat@@ ing is not the s@@ he@@ er pha@@ r@@ ma@@ co@@ logical pot@@ ential of this pre@@ pa@@ ration , but the e@@ labo@@ ration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wo@@ o@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ ma@@ line , mil@@ dly hal@@ lu@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy sm@@ oke dri@@ ft across your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness — but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e family called P@@ sy@@ chot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is ."
"This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ o@@ ma@@ mi b@@ low@@ ing that snu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine ."
T@@ o have that pow@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sh@@ ot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ ti@@ ngs and lan@@ ding on a se@@ a of electri@@ city . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the di@@ ss@@ olution of reality .
"In fact , I used to ar@@ g@@ ue with my profe@@ ss@@ or , Ri@@ cha@@ rd E@@ v@@ an S@@ hu@@ lt@@ es — who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his disco@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ oms in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — I used to ar@@ g@@ ue that you couldn &apos;t cla@@ ssi@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ines as hal@@ lu@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a hal@@ lu@@ ci@@ nation . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken o@@ ra@@ lly because they &apos;re de@@ na@@ tu@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found na@@ tu@@ ra@@ lly in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ da@@ se ."
They can only be taken o@@ ra@@ lly if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chemi@@ cal that de@@ na@@ tures the M@@ A@@ O .
"Now , the fas@@ ci@@ nat@@ ing things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ tam@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question ."
"@@ How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar pl@@ ants , do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ logi@@ cally un@@ rela@@ ted pl@@ ants that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemi@@ cal ver@@ sion of the whole being great@@ er than the su@@ m of the parts ?"
"Well , we use that great e@@ u@@ phe@@ mi@@ sm , &quot; &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be mean@@ ing@@ less ."
"But you ask the In@@ di@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The pl@@ ants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?"
"This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 vari@@ eti@@ es of a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they di@@ sti@@ ng@@ u@@ is@@ h a great di@@ stance in the fore@@ st , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our eye as one species ."
"And then you ask them how they e@@ sta@@ bli@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about pl@@ ants ."
"I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ eti@@ es in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it sing@@ s to you in a different key ."
"Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than count@@ ing st@@ am@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , mean@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on ."
"Well , the truth is the 20@@ th century , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be re@@ me@@ mb@@ ered for its w@@ ars or its techno@@ logical inno@@ v@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we sto@@ od by and either activ@@ ely en@@ d@@ or@@ sed or pa@@ ssi@@ v@@ ely ac@@ cep@@ ted the ma@@ ssive de@@ struc@@ tion of both bio@@ logical and cul@@ tural di@@ versity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change ."
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ st@@ antly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x In@@ di@@ ans did not stop being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American st@@ op@@ ped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ gy .
"It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere . It is power , the c@@ ru@@ de face of d@@ omi@@ nation ."

And you cannot understand the pai@@ n of T@@ i@@ b@@ et until you move through it at the ground level .

"One day she i@@ na@@ d@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ mb@@ and of M@@ ao , and for that trans@@ gre@@ ssion , she was given seven years of hard la@@ b@@ or ."
"The pai@@ n of T@@ i@@ b@@ et can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ m@@ pti@@ ve spi@@ rit of the people is something to be@@ hold ."
"And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ bra@@ ce a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of di@@ versity ?"

I was so surpri@@ sed that a to@@ tal st@@ rang@@ er ca@@ red enough to ask .
I realized that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
( Music ) ( Applause )
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cu@@ lation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cles ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ pa@@ l of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a han@@ d@@ rai@@ l . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ si@@ sted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ c@@ king out from the e@@ dge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can cat@@ ch the children fal@@ ling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government offi@@ cial said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a han@@ d@@ rai@@ l . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ ping through .
And we were allow@@ ed to call this ro@@ pe as a han@@ d@@ rai@@ l .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the b@@ ran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they sit on the e@@ dge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ shing place — there are many kinds of water tap@@ s .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the show@@ er , and the one in front is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ shing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s put@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this archit@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ oms .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et box , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ pa@@ l says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to sta@@ y in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we consi@@ der no@@ i@@ se very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ i@@ se .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cent@@ ration in cla@@ ss ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the ju@@ ng@@ le with no@@ i@@ se ."
They need no@@ i@@ se .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not supp@@ osed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The sand is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never mel@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are supp@@ osed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they divi@@ de cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ oms .
They are supp@@ osed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cla@@ ss@@ room .
And a wa@@ sh@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cla@@ ss@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cla@@ ss@@ room has at least one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ ant@@ a C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sha@@ ped kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five met@@ ers ta@@ ll with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ i@@ ght is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ f@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s ok@@ ay . H@@ is s@@ ku@@ ll is quite st@@ rong .
He is resi@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to ju@@ m@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ffi@@ c j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ yo , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of dang@@ er ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are los@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is show@@ ing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 met@@ ers .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 met@@ ers in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 met@@ ers on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic abil@@ ities am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ pa@@ l says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
Just like s@@ he@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ ju@@ ry .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think archit@@ ec@@ ture is cap@@ able of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the at@@ te@@ mp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some images of c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers of ga@@ la@@ x@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge coll@@ ec@@ tions of ga@@ la@@ x@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tual gra@@ v@@ ity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al star@@ s , but coll@@ ec@@ tions of star@@ s , or ga@@ la@@ x@@ ies ."
"Now , by show@@ ing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are these beautiful ob@@ jects , but more than that , I think ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous , they are surpri@@ sing , and they &apos;re u@@ se@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most ma@@ ssive labo@@ rat@@ ories .
"And as labo@@ rat@@ ories , to descri@@ be ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers is to descri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or ty@@ pes , and the first ty@@ pe that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ ster ."
"It is so ma@@ ssive that the light pa@@ ssing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being di@@ stor@@ ted by the extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of this c@@ lu@@ ster ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see ri@@ ngs around this c@@ lu@@ ster ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ ster has a ma@@ ss of over one million billion sun@@ s ."
"But more than their ma@@ ss , they have this ad@@ diti@@ onal fe@@ ature ."
"They are ess@@ entially i@@ so@@ lated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ e@@ d-@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ al@@ es , such as , how does gra@@ v@@ ity work ?"
might be answ@@ ered by stud@@ ying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very h@@ ot .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ ster , and I sub@@ trac@@ t away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blo@@ b ."
This is in fal@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ ra@@ y light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not ga@@ la@@ x@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The answer is h@@ ot g@@ as , mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e g@@ as — in fact , it &apos;s pla@@ s@@ ma ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so h@@ ot goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous sli@@ de .
"The extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of these systems is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating parti@@ cles of g@@ as to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great tem@@ per@@ atu@@ res ."
"So this is the main idea , but science is a rou@@ gh dra@@ ft ."
"There are many ba@@ sic pr@@ oper@@ ti@@ es about this pla@@ s@@ ma that still con@@ fu@@ se us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still pu@@ sh our understanding of the physi@@ cs of the very h@@ ot ."
Th@@ i@@ rd thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very di@@ stu@@ r@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ ost of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ oms .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ ost of it is made up of something very , very my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cept through gra@@ v@@ ity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a parti@@ cle physi@@ ci@@ st , you want to know what happens when we sma@@ sh things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ in@@ ce ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tive sli@@ ces of the universe , sc@@ al@@ e@@ d-@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are mos@@ tly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this b@@ lu@@ is@@ h pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ pres@@ ents the h@@ ot g@@ as , and , of course , you can see many ga@@ la@@ x@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a parti@@ cle ac@@ cel@@ er@@ at@@ or at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small eff@@ ects that might be difficult to det@@ ect in the lab , might be comp@@ oun@@ ded and comp@@ oun@@ ded into something that we could possi@@ bly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ ny ."
"The reason why ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about dar@@ k matter , the reason why ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers can te@@ ach us about the physi@@ cs of the very small , is preci@@ sel@@ y because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the physi@@ cs of the very st@@ range .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cra@@ zy .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything st@@ rang@@ er I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ row a b@@ all into the air , I exp@@ ect it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t exp@@ ect is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing rate .
"S@@ i@@ mi@@ larly , cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts understand why the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ ding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing rate .
"They give the c@@ ause of this ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated ex@@ pan@@ sion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy aff@@ ect the universe at the lar@@ gest sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ ep@@ en@@ ding on how st@@ rong it is , maybe structure for@@ ms fa@@ ster or s@@ low@@ er ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer si@@ mu@@ lation .
And we need a way to simp@@ li@@ fy it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an anal@@ o@@ gy ."
"If I want to understand the sin@@ king of the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little pos@@ iti@@ ons of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that b@@ rok@@ e off ."
The most important thing to do is to tra@@ ck the two bi@@ g@@ gest parts .
"S@@ i@@ mi@@ larly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the lar@@ gest sc@@ al@@ es by trac@@ king its bi@@ g@@ gest piec@@ es and those bi@@ g@@ gest piec@@ es are c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers of ga@@ la@@ x@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sli@@ gh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I began by talking about how ga@@ la@@ x@@ y c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers are u@@ se@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d when he was asked about cars ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said fa@@ ster hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solu@@ tions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not fa@@ ster hor@@ ses .
They will requi@@ re an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of scienti@@ fic ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
"So , yes , we need to focu@@ s , yes , we need to con@@ cent@@ rate , but we also need to remember that inno@@ vation , ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity , inspi@@ ration — these things come when we bro@@ ad@@ en our field of vi@@ sion when we step back when we z@@ o@@ om out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stud@@ ying the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

"At the time , I was car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ st at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in car@@ dia@@ c imag@@ ing techni@@ que@@ s ."
The call came from a v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian at the L@@ os A@@ ng@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly fe@@ male chim@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e had wok@@ en up with a fac@@ i@@ al d@@ ro@@ op and the v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s were wor@@ ri@@ ed that she &apos;d had a st@@ rok@@ e .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the z@@ o@@ o and image the anima@@ l &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ dia@@ c c@@ ause .
"Now , to be clear , Nor@@ th American z@@ o@@ os are sta@@ ff@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s who take out@@ standing care of their anima@@ l patients ."
"But oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ona@@ lly , they do re@@ ach into the human medi@@ cal community , particu@@ larly for some speci@@ ality con@@ sul@@ tation , and I was one of the lu@@ ck@@ y physi@@ ci@@ ans who was inv@@ ited in to help ."
"I had a chan@@ ce to ru@@ le out a st@@ rok@@ e in this chim@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e and make sure that this g@@ or@@ il@@ la didn &apos;t have a t@@ or@@ n a@@ or@@ ta , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate this ma@@ ca@@ w for a heart mu@@ r@@ mu@@ r , make sure that this C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia se@@ a lion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ di@@ um wasn &apos;t inf@@ lam@@ ed , and in this picture , I &apos;m list@@ ening to the heart of a lion after a li@@ fe@@ sa@@ ving , col@@ labo@@ ra@@ tive proce@@ du@@ re with v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s and physi@@ ci@@ ans where we dra@@ ined 7@@ 00 c@@ c &apos;s of f@@ lu@@ id from the sa@@ c in which this lion &apos;s heart was con@@ ta@@ ined ."
"And this proce@@ du@@ re , which I have done on many human patients , was id@@ enti@@ cal , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that tai@@ l ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ent@@ er with physi@@ ci@@ ans , dis@@ cu@@ ssing sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms and di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os A@@ ng@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o with v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s , dis@@ cu@@ ssing sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms and di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es and tre@@ at@@ ments for their anima@@ l patients ."
"And oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ona@@ lly , on the very same day , I went on rou@@ n@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ent@@ er and at the L@@ os A@@ ng@@ el@@ es Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focu@@ s for me .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s were ess@@ entially taking care of the same dis@@ or@@ ders in their anima@@ l and human patients : c@@ ong@@ esti@@ ve heart fai@@ lu@@ re , brain tu@@ m@@ ors , le@@ uk@@ e@@ mi@@ a , di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , ar@@ thrit@@ is , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast cancer , even p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ omes like de@@ pre@@ ssion , an@@ xi@@ ety , compu@@ l@@ sions , e@@ ating dis@@ or@@ ders and self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a con@@ fe@@ ssion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died compa@@ ra@@ tive physi@@ o@@ logy and ev@@ olu@@ ti@@ ona@@ ry bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even writ@@ ten my s@@ eni@@ or the@@ sis on D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an theory — learning about the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wak@@ e-@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ lap@@ s , how was it that I had never thought to ask a v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian , or con@@ sul@@ t the v@@ et@@ eri@@ nary liter@@ ature , for in@@ si@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?"
"W@@ h@@ y had I never , no@@ r had any of my physi@@ ci@@ an friends and colle@@ ag@@ ues wh@@ om I asked , ever atten@@ ded a v@@ et@@ eri@@ nary con@@ fer@@ ence ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a surpri@@ se ?"
"I mean , look , every single physi@@ ci@@ an ac@@ cep@@ ts some bio@@ logical conn@@ ection between animals and humans ."
E@@ very medi@@ c@@ ation that we pre@@ scri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our fami@@ lies has first been te@@ sted on an anima@@ l .
But there &apos;s something very different about giving an anima@@ l a medi@@ c@@ ation or a human disease and the anima@@ l develop@@ ing c@@ ong@@ esti@@ ve heart fai@@ lu@@ re or di@@ ab@@ et@@ es or bre@@ ast cancer on their own .
"Now , maybe some of the surpri@@ se comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ pa@@ ration in our world between the ur@@ b@@ an and the non@@ ur@@ b@@ an ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ ol gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ e@@ se comes from a plant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human hospit@@ als , incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ dra@@ ls of technology ."
And this cre@@ ates a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical di@@ stance between the human patients who are being tre@@ ated there and anima@@ l patients who are living in oce@@ ans and far@@ ms and ju@@ ng@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even de@@ ep@@ er reason .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans and scientists , we ac@@ cept int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually that our species , H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens , is mer@@ ely one species , no more uni@@ que or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our he@@ ar@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m list@@ ening to M@@ o@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the M@@ ars R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ o@@ ok .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ ona@@ li@@ sm , even as I recogni@@ ze the scienti@@ fi@@ cally i@@ so@@ la@@ ting cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ i@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the anima@@ l doc@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human anima@@ l patient ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exc@@ iting conn@@ ec@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fai@@ lu@@ re .
"A@@ rou@@ nd the year 2@@ 000 , human car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts &quot; &quot; disco@@ vered &quot; &quot; emoti@@ ona@@ lly in@@ duc@@ ed heart fai@@ lu@@ re ."
"It was descri@@ bed in a g@@ am@@ b@@ ling father who had lost his life &apos;s sa@@ vi@@ ngs with a ro@@ ll of the di@@ ce , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter ."
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , no@@ r was it uni@@ que@@ ly human ."
"@@ V@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s had been di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing emoti@@ ona@@ lly in@@ duc@@ ed sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms in animals rang@@ ing from mon@@ ke@@ ys to f@@ lam@@ ing@@ os , from to de@@ er to ra@@ b@@ b@@ its , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sa@@ ved if this v@@ et@@ eri@@ nary knowledge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . do@@ cs and car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ u@@ ck out pat@@ ches of hair , others actually cut themselves ."
S@@ ome anima@@ l patients also har@@ m themselves .
There are bir@@ ds that pl@@ u@@ ck out fe@@ a@@ thers .
There are sta@@ l@@ lions that re@@ p@@ et@@ iti@@ v@@ ely b@@ ite their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s have very speci@@ fic and very eff@@ ective ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry in their self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ring animals .
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this v@@ et@@ eri@@ nary knowledge be put into the hands of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ i@@ sts and parents and patients stru@@ gg@@ ling with self-@@ in@@ ju@@ ry ?
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pre@@ ssion and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
"S@@ ome@@ times , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pre@@ ssed , and sometimes they become seri@@ ously de@@ pre@@ ssed and even p@@ sy@@ ch@@ oti@@ c ."
"They may ne@@ g@@ l@@ ect their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some extre@@ me c@@ ases , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s also know that oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ona@@ lly , a mare , so@@ on after giving bir@@ th , will ne@@ g@@ l@@ ect the fo@@ al , re@@ fu@@ sing to nu@@ r@@ se , and in some in@@ stan@@ ces , k@@ ic@@ k the fo@@ al , even to death ."
But v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s have de@@ vi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ j@@ ection sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome that inv@@ ol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the mare .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the bon@@ ding hor@@ m@@ one , and this lea@@ ds to r@@ ene@@ w@@ ed inter@@ est , on the part of the mare , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ h@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are stru@@ gg@@ ling with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pre@@ ssion and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?
"Well , de@@ sp@@ ite all of this pr@@ omi@@ se , un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately the gu@@ l@@ f between our fiel@@ ds re@@ ma@@ ins large ."
"T@@ o expla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d I &apos;m going to have to air some di@@ r@@ ty la@@ und@@ ry ."
S@@ ome physi@@ ci@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ b@@ s about doc@@ tors who are not M@@ .@@ D@@ . &apos; s .
"I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ omet@@ ri@@ sts and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , but maybe e@@ specially anima@@ l doc@@ tors ."
"O@@ f course , most physi@@ ci@@ ans don &apos;t realize that it is har@@ der to get into v@@ et school these days than medi@@ cal school , and that when we go to medi@@ cal school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens , but v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s need to learn about health and disease in ma@@ m@@ ma@@ ls , am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ pti@@ les , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the v@@ ets for feeling an@@ no@@ yed by my profe@@ ssion &apos;s con@@ de@@ sc@@ en@@ sion and ig@@ nor@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the v@@ ets : What do you call a v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian who can only take care of one species ?
"A physi@@ ci@@ an . ( Laughter ) C@@ los@@ ing the g@@ ap has become a pa@@ ssion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through pro@@ gram@@ s like D@@ ar@@ win on R@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , where we &apos;re bri@@ ng@@ ing anima@@ l exper@@ ts and ev@@ olu@@ ti@@ ona@@ ry bio@@ logi@@ sts and em@@ be@@ d@@ ding them on our medi@@ cal te@@ am@@ s with our inter@@ ns and our resi@@ d@@ ents ."
"And through Z@@ o@@ o@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we bring medi@@ cal scho@@ ols together with v@@ et@@ eri@@ nary scho@@ ols for col@@ la@@ bor@@ tive dis@@ cu@@ ssi@@ ons of the sha@@ red dise@@ ases and dis@@ or@@ ders of anima@@ l and human patients ."
"At Z@@ o@@ o@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ants learn how tre@@ ating bre@@ ast cancer in a ti@@ ger can help us better tre@@ at bre@@ ast cancer in a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er ; how understanding pol@@ y@@ cy@@ stic over@@ ies in a H@@ ol@@ ste@@ in c@@ ow can help us better take care of a d@@ ance in@@ struc@@ tor with pain@@ ful per@@ i@@ o@@ ds ; and how better understanding the tre@@ at@@ ment of se@@ pa@@ ration an@@ xi@@ ety in a high@@ -@@ st@@ run@@ g S@@ hel@@ ti@@ e can help an an@@ xi@@ ous young child stru@@ gg@@ ling with his first days of school ."
"In the United States and now inter@@ nati@@ ona@@ lly , at Z@@ o@@ o@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences physi@@ ci@@ ans and v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s chec@@ k their at@@ tit@@ u@@ des and their pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions at the do@@ or and come together as colle@@ ag@@ ues , as pe@@ ers , as doc@@ tors ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physi@@ ci@@ ans to em@@ bra@@ ce our patients &apos; and our own anima@@ l na@@ tures and jo@@ in v@@ et@@ eri@@ na@@ rian@@ s in a speci@@ e@@ s@@ -@@ sp@@ an@@ ning appro@@ ach to health ."
"Because it turns out , some of the best and most human@@ i@@ stic medi@@ cine is being practi@@ ced by doc@@ tors wh@@ ose patients are@@ n &apos;t human ."
"And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by pa@@ ying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get si@@ ck and he@@ al ."
Thank you .

"So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ st for two years in H@@ u@@ nan , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."

It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dre@@ am was to become a Ch@@ ine@@ se oper@@ a sing@@ er .
That is me pla@@ ying my ima@@ gi@@ nary pi@@ an@@ o .
"A@@ n oper@@ a sing@@ er must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ rob@@ ati@@ cs , so I tried everything I could to go to oper@@ a school ."
I even wr@@ ote to the school prin@@ ci@@ pa@@ l and the h@@ ost of a radi@@ o show .
But no a@@ du@@ l@@ ts li@@ ked the idea .
No a@@ du@@ l@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was seri@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends supp@@ or@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ rai@@ d that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ cla@@ ss happ@@ ine@@ ss would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fai@@ r .
So I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to find another cal@@ ling .
N@@ o@@ body around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fied my hu@@ ng@@ er for par@@ en@@ tal ad@@ vice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ dence in the F@@ ami@@ ly of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ depen@@ dent woman when C@@ on@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tra@@ dition requi@@ res o@@ be@@ dience . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ an@@ e E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be e@@ ffi@@ cient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ ap@@ er by the D@@ o@@ z@@ en &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspi@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ plet@@ e Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( ak@@ a E@@ cho C@@ ha@@ n ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ rom H@@ i@@ story &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S@@ . in 199@@ 5 , so which books did I read here first ?"
"B@@ o@@ oks ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The Go@@ od Earth &quot; &quot; is about Ch@@ ine@@ se pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not conv@@ eni@@ ent for prop@@ ag@@ an@@ da . G@@ ot it .
"The B@@ i@@ ble is interesting , but st@@ range ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a top@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th com@@ man@@ d@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You sha@@ ll hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"@@ &quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it bec@@ omes my to@@ ol to cli@@ m@@ b out of this C@@ on@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
E@@ n@@ count@@ ering a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of compa@@ ra@@ tive read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ si@@ ghts .
"For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Ch@@ ine@@ se students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cent@@ er of the world ."
A map actually car@@ ries somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ pa@@ ra@@ tive read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stan@@ d@@ ard practi@@ ce in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic world .
There are even research fiel@@ ds such as compa@@ ra@@ tive reli@@ gi@@ on and compa@@ ra@@ tive liter@@ ature .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tra@@ st gi@@ ves scho@@ lars a more complet@@ e understanding of a top@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if compa@@ ra@@ tive read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in dai@@ ly life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing books in pai@@ r@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in F@@ ran@@ k@@ l@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n A@@ dam@@ s &quot; &quot; by D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are inv@@ olved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with sha@@ red experi@@ ences ."

"For the Ch@@ ri@@ st , the te@@ mp@@ ta@@ tions are economic , political and spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al ."
"For the B@@ u@@ dd@@ ha , they are all p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical : lu@@ st , fear and social du@@ ty — interesting ."
"So if you know a fore@@ ig@@ n language , it &apos;s also fu@@ n to read your fav@@ or@@ ite books in two langu@@ ag@@ es ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of C@@ hu@@ ang T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s M@@ er@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ao : The W@@ at@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; A@@ la@@ n W@@ at@@ ts &#93; In@@ stead of lost in trans@@ lation , I found there is much to g@@ ain ."
"For example , it &apos;s through trans@@ lation that I realized &quot; &quot; happ@@ ine@@ ss &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ ine@@ se literally means &quot; &quot; fast jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; H@@ u@@ h !@@ "
&quot; &quot; B@@ ri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ ine@@ se literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ oks have given me a ma@@ gi@@ c por@@ tal to conn@@ ect with people of the past and the present .
I know I sha@@ ll never feel l@@ on@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ a@@ ving a dre@@ am sha@@ t@@ ter@@ ed really is nothing compa@@ red to what many others have su@@ ffer@@ ed .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only pur@@ p@@ ose of a dre@@ am .
"I@@ ts most important pur@@ p@@ ose is to get us in tou@@ ch with where dre@@ am@@ s come from , where pa@@ ssion comes from , where happ@@ ine@@ ss comes from ."
E@@ ven a sha@@ t@@ ter@@ ed dre@@ am can do that for you .
"So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a pur@@ p@@ ose and a c@@ lar@@ ity , most of the time ."
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
This back here was my brain cancer .
I@@ sn &apos;t it ni@@ ce ?
"( Laughter ) The key ph@@ ra@@ se is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phe@@ w ."
"( Applause ) H@@ a@@ ving brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , sh@@ oc@@ king news for me ."
I knew nothing about cancer .
"In W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar in a way ."
"@@ Y@@ our life as a complex human being is re@@ pla@@ ced by medi@@ cal data : Y@@ our images , your exam@@ s , your lab val@@ ues , a list of medi@@ c@@ ines ."
And everyone changes as well .
You sudd@@ en@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start speak@@ ing a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start poin@@ ting their fi@@ ng@@ ers at your body and your images .
"P@@ eople start changing as well because they start de@@ al@@ ing with the disease , instead of with the human being ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doc@@ tor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ell@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in the mean@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which no@@ body gi@@ ves an answer ."
These are the &quot; &quot; C@@ an I ? &quot; &quot; questions : C@@ an I work while I have cancer ?
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be cre@@ ative ?
"And you won@@ der , &quot; &quot; What have I done to de@@ ser@@ ve this ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I change something about my li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ? &quot; &quot; You won@@ der , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I do something ?"
"A@@ re there any other op@@ tions ? &quot; &quot; And , obvi@@ ously , doc@@ tors are the good guys in all these sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ os , because they are very profe@@ ssi@@ onal and de@@ dic@@ ated to cu@@ ring you ."
"But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes l@@ ose the idea that this is t@@ or@@ ture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ings are changing , but cla@@ ssi@@ cally , they t@@ end to not eng@@ age you in any way to learn about your con@@ dition , to get your friends and family eng@@ ag@@ ed , or show@@ ing you ways in which you can change your li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le to mini@@ mi@@ ze the ris@@ ks of what you &apos;re going through ."
"But instead , you &apos;re for@@ ced there to wai@@ t in the hands of a ser@@ ies of very profe@@ ssi@@ onal st@@ rang@@ ers ."
"W@@ hi@@ le I was in the hospit@@ al , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I sp@@ oke with it ."
"It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common practi@@ ce to ask for a picture of your own cancer ."
"I tal@@ ked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me ."
There &apos;s more to me .
"A cu@@ re , whi@@ che@@ ver it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospit@@ al against medi@@ cal ad@@ vice ."
I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to change my relation@@ ship with the cancer and I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dra@@ stic as a sur@@ g@@ ery .
"I &apos;m an arti@@ st , I use se@@ ver@@ al for@@ ms of open@@ -@@ source technologi@@ es and open information in my practi@@ ce ."
"So my best b@@ et was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be ac@@ ce@@ ssed by any@@ one ."
"So I created a we@@ b@@ site , which is called L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a , on which I put my medi@@ cal data , on@@ line ."
I actually had to ha@@ ck it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another spe@@ ech .
"( Laughter ) I ch@@ ose this word , L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a — L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a in I@@ ta@@ li@@ an means &quot; &quot; the cu@@ re &quot; &quot; — because in many different cul@@ tures , the word &quot; &quot; cu@@ re &quot; &quot; can mean many different things ."
"In our W@@ est@@ er@@ n cul@@ tures , it means er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating or re@@ ver@@ sing a disease , but in different cul@@ tures , for example , a culture from A@@ sia , from the M@@ e@@ dit@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from L@@ ati@@ n countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things ."
"O@@ f course , I was interested in the op@@ ini@@ ons of doc@@ tors and heal@@ th@@ care provi@@ ders , but I was also interested in the cu@@ re of the arti@@ st , of the p@@ oet , of the desig@@ ner , of , who kno@@ ws , the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans ."
"I was interested in the social cu@@ re , I was interested in the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical cu@@ re , I was interested in the spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al cu@@ re , I was interested in the emoti@@ onal cu@@ re , I was interested in any form of cu@@ re ."
"And , it worked ."
The L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a we@@ b@@ site went vi@@ ral .
"I re@@ cei@@ ved lots of media attention from I@@ ta@@ ly and from ab@@ ro@@ ad and I quickly re@@ cei@@ ved more than 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts — ema@@ il@@ s , social net@@ working — most of them were a sug@@ ge@@ stion on how to cu@@ re my cancer , but more of them were about how to cu@@ re myself as a full individu@@ al ."
"For example , many thousands of vide@@ os , images , pic@@ tures , art per@@ for@@ man@@ ces were produc@@ ed for L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
"For example , here we see F@@ ran@@ ce@@ sc@@ a F@@ ini in her per@@ for@@ man@@ ce ."
"O@@ r , as arti@@ st P@@ at@@ ri@@ ck Li@@ ch@@ ty has done : He produc@@ ed a 3@@ D s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture of my tu@@ m@@ or and put it on s@@ ale on Th@@ ing@@ i@@ ver@@ se ."
"Now you can have my cancer , too !@@ "
"( Laughter ) W@@ hi@@ ch is a ni@@ ce thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer ."
"And this was going on — scientists , the tra@@ diti@@ onal medi@@ cine exper@@ ts , se@@ ver@@ al re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers , doc@@ tors — all connected with me to give ad@@ vice ."
"W@@ ith all this information and supp@@ ort , I was able to form a team of se@@ ver@@ al neur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ ons , tra@@ diti@@ onal doc@@ tors , on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ red v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with wh@@ om I was able to dis@@ cu@@ ss the information I was re@@ cei@@ ving , which is very important ."
"And together , we were able to form a stra@@ te@@ gy for my own cu@@ re in many langu@@ ag@@ es , ac@@ cor@@ ding to many cul@@ tures ."
"And the curr@@ ent stra@@ te@@ gy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble for me ."
"@@ &#91; S@@ ur@@ g@@ ery &#93; The follow@@ -@@ up M@@ R@@ I@@ s show@@ ed , lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , little to no growth of the cancer ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
"I ch@@ ose the doc@@ tor I wanted to work with , I ch@@ ose the hospit@@ al I wanted to sta@@ y in , and in the mean@@ while , I was supp@@ or@@ ted by thousands of people , n@@ one of wh@@ om felt p@@ ity for me ."
"E@@ very@@ one felt like they could take an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in hel@@ ping me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a ."
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
"( Applause ) I had ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent news after the sur@@ g@@ ery — I have — I had a very low@@ -@@ gra@@ de g@@ li@@ om@@ a , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot ."
I have completely changed my life and my li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
E@@ very@@ thing I did was thou@@ gh@@ t@@ fully desig@@ ned to get me eng@@ ag@@ ed .
"@@ U@@ p until the very last few minutes of the sur@@ g@@ ery , which was very int@@ en@@ se , a mat@@ ri@@ x of elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des was im@@ pl@@ ant@@ ed in my brain from this side , to be able to build a func@@ ti@@ onal map of what the brain contro@@ ls ."
"And right before the oper@@ ation , we were able to dis@@ cu@@ ss the func@@ ti@@ onal map of my brain with the doc@@ tor , to understand which ris@@ ks I was run@@ ning into and if there were any I wanted to av@@ oi@@ d ."
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , there were ."
&#91; O@@ pen &#93; And this open@@ ness was really the fundamen@@ tal part of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a .
"Th@@ ou@@ sands of people sha@@ red their stories , their experi@@ ences ."
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t u@@ su@@ ally con@@ sul@@ t when they think about cancer .
"I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ oun@@ ding , contin@@ u@@ ous state of trans@@ lation am@@ ong many different langu@@ ag@@ es , in which science me@@ ets emoti@@ on and conv@@ enti@@ onal research me@@ ets tra@@ diti@@ onal research ."
&#91; S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a C@@ ur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really eng@@ ag@@ ed and connected society wh@@ ose w@@ ell@@ ness really depen@@ ds on the w@@ ell@@ ness of all of its comp@@ on@@ ents .
This global per@@ for@@ man@@ ce is my open@@ -@@ source cu@@ re for cancer .
"And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cu@@ re for me , but for us all ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
"A big challenge is , how should the i@@ P@@ ads be used , and what ap@@ ps should we put on the i@@ P@@ ads ?"
"My job is that I li@@ e to children , but they &apos;re hon@@ est lies ."
"I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ l@@ o P@@ ic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not truth ."
Ar@@ t is a li@@ e that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
"The arti@@ st must know the man@@ ner wh@@ er@@ e@@ by to conv@@ in@@ ce others of the tru@@ th@@ fu@@ l@@ ness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a ki@@ d , and I lo@@ ved it , but I had no idea what it me@@ ant ."
"( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fic@@ tion and reality ."
So how could I un@@ tang@@ le this kn@@ ot@@ ted bun@@ ch of sent@@ ences ?
"And I said , I &apos;ve got P@@ ow@@ er@@ P@@ o@@ int . Let &apos;s do a V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ th . L@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , bo@@ om ."
"We &apos;ve got truth and lies and then there &apos;s this little space , the e@@ dge , in the middle ."
"That li@@ mi@@ nal space , that &apos;s art ."
All right . V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful either .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a sum@@ mer cam@@ p cou@@ n@@ sel@@ or .
"I would do it on my sum@@ m@@ ers off from colle@@ ge , and I lo@@ ved it ."
It was a sp@@ or@@ ts sum@@ mer cam@@ p for f@@ our@@ - to si@@ x@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
"I was in char@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play sp@@ or@@ ts , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ ."
"( Laughter ) I play sp@@ or@@ ts at a f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ old level , so what would happen is the kids would dri@@ b@@ ble around some con@@ es , and then got h@@ ot , and then they would go sit under@@ ne@@ ath the t@@ ree where I was already sitting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life ."
"I would tell them about how , on the we@@ ek@@ ends , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ ue@@ en of Eng@@ land ."
"And so@@ on , other kids who w@@ er@@ en &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Ma@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t , right ?"
You &apos;re the guy who sp@@ ies for the Q@@ ue@@ en of Eng@@ land . &quot; &quot; And I had been wa@@ iting my whole life for st@@ rang@@ ers to come up and ask me that question .
"In my fan@@ ta@@ s@@ y , they were s@@ vel@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was fami@@ li@@ ar to me and really exc@@ iting .
"I think the pin@@ na@@ cle of this for me — I &apos;ll never for@@ get this — there was this little girl nam@@ ed Ri@@ le@@ y . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her l@@ un@@ ch every day and she would th@@ row out her f@@ ru@@ it ."
"She would just take her f@@ ru@@ it , her mo@@ m p@@ ac@@ ked her a mel@@ on every day , and she would just th@@ row it in the i@@ v@@ y and then she would e@@ at f@@ ru@@ it s@@ na@@ cks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Ri@@ le@@ y , you can &apos;t do that , you have to e@@ at the f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you th@@ row the f@@ ru@@ it in the i@@ v@@ y , pretty so@@ on , it &apos;s going to be over@@ gro@@ wn with mel@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I en@@ ded up telling stories to children and not being a nu@@ tr@@ iti@@ oni@@ st for children ."
"And so Ri@@ le@@ y was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of cam@@ p , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe from the gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore and I hi@@ d it in the i@@ v@@ y , and then at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , I was like , &quot; Ri@@ le@@ y , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;"
"And — ( Laughter ) — she went tru@@ d@@ g@@ ing through the i@@ v@@ y , and then her eyes just got so wi@@ de , and she poin@@ ted out this mel@@ on that was bi@@ gger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and ru@@ shed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why is there a sti@@ ck@@ er on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not th@@ row your sti@@ ck@@ ers in the i@@ v@@ y ."
"P@@ ut them in the tra@@ sh can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Ri@@ le@@ y car@@ ri@@ ed that mel@@ on around with her all day , and she was so p@@ rou@@ d ."
"And Ri@@ le@@ y knew she didn &apos;t grow a mel@@ on in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a we@@ i@@ rd place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
"It &apos;s what C@@ ol@@ eri@@ dge called the wil@@ ling su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of dis@@ belie@@ f or p@@ oe@@ tic fa@@ ith , for those mom@@ ents where a story , no matter how st@@ range , has some se@@ mb@@ lan@@ ce of the truth , and then you &apos;re able to believe it ."
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"A@@ du@@ l@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read ."
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be de@@ sc@@ en@@ ding on D@@ u@@ bl@@ in to take the wal@@ king t@@ our of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ ly@@ sses , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"O@@ r people go to L@@ on@@ don and they vi@@ sit B@@ ak@@ er S@@ tre@@ et to see S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck H@@ ol@@ mes &apos; ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , even though 2@@ 2@@ 1@@ B is just a number that was pain@@ ted on a building that never actually had that ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"We know these cha@@ rac@@ ters are@@ n &apos;t real , but we have real feel@@ ings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these cha@@ rac@@ ters are@@ n &apos;t real ,@@ "
and yet we also know that they are .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more easi@@ ly than a@@ du@@ l@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love wr@@ iting for kids ."
I think kids are the best au@@ dience for seri@@ ous liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .
"When I was a ki@@ d , I was ob@@ se@@ ssed with sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or no@@ vel@@ s , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ nia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ d@@ ro@@ be and go through to a ma@@ gi@@ cal land ."
And I was conv@@ inc@@ ed that sec@@ re@@ t do@@ ors really did exi@@ st and I would look for them and try to go through them .
"I wanted to live and c@@ ross over into that fic@@ ti@@ onal world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clos@@ et do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mo@@ m &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s clos@@ et , and there was not a sec@@ re@@ t ma@@ gi@@ cal land there ."
There was some other we@@ i@@ rd stuff that I think my mo@@ m should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
"A@@ f@@ ter colle@@ ge , my first job was working behind one of these sec@@ re@@ t do@@ ors ."
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
"It &apos;s at 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et in the M@@ is@@ sion in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ shing company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ed there called M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a non@@ pro@@ fit wr@@ iting cent@@ er called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , but then the front of it was a st@@ range sh@@ op ."
"You see , this place was z@@ on@@ ed re@@ tai@@ l , and in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the writ@@ er who f@@ oun@@ ded it , a writ@@ er nam@@ ed D@@ a@@ ve E@@ gg@@ ers , to come into comp@@ li@@ ance with co@@ de , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a pi@@ rate supp@@ ly st@@ ore . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wo@@ od ."
There &apos;s dra@@ w@@ ers you can pu@@ ll out and get c@@ it@@ rus so you don &apos;t get s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
"They have e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ches in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ ri@@ ng@@ time , pi@@ rat@@ es want to go wi@@ ld ."
You don &apos;t know . B@@ lack is bor@@ ing . P@@ ast@@ el .
"O@@ r eyes , also in lots of col@@ ors , just gla@@ ss eyes , depen@@ ding on how you want to deal with that situ@@ ation ."
"And the st@@ ore , st@@ rang@@ ely , people came to them and b@@ ou@@ ght things , and they en@@ ded up pa@@ ying the r@@ ent for our tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get in@@ struc@@ tion in wr@@ iting , and when you have to walk this we@@ i@@ rd , li@@ mi@@ nal , fic@@ ti@@ onal space like this to go do your wr@@ iting , it &apos;s going to aff@@ ect the kind of work that you make ."
It &apos;s a sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or that you can walk through .
"So I ran the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os A@@ ng@@ el@@ es , and it was my job to build the st@@ ore down there ."
So we have The E@@ cho P@@ ar@@ k T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art .

"It looked like he had just mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular archit@@ ect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."

"And it &apos;s a very speci@@ al space , because it &apos;s this we@@ i@@ rd space in the front ."
The j@@ oke isn &apos;t a j@@ oke .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ am@@ s on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ on@@ iz@@ ed the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three di@@ men@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and met@@ a &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with no@@ v@@ eli@@ sts like Jo@@ h@@ n B@@ ar@@ th and W@@ il@@ li@@ am G@@ ad@@ d@@ is , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ telling itself .
And one me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tive techni@@ que is bre@@ ak@@ ing the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all . Ri@@ ght ?
"It &apos;s when an ac@@ tor will turn to the au@@ dience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an ac@@ tor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that supp@@ os@@ e@@ dly hon@@ est moment , I would ar@@ g@@ ue , is in ser@@ vice of the li@@ e , but it &apos;s supp@@ osed to fore@@ ground the arti@@ fi@@ ci@@ ality of the fic@@ tion ."
"For me , I kind of pre@@ f@@ er the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"If I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak down the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all , I want fic@@ tion to e@@ sc@@ ape and come into the real world ."
I want a book to be a sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or that op@@ ens and l@@ ets the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my books .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly T@@ wit@@ ters and his B@@ l@@ ue W@@ ha@@ le P@@ rob@@ le@@ m . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a ki@@ d who gets a blue wha@@ le as a p@@ et but it &apos;s a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s deli@@ vered over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o — very t@@ ough city to own a blue wha@@ le in .
"A lot of h@@ il@@ ls , real e@@ state is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s cra@@ zy , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the j@@ ac@@ k@@ et is this case , and that &apos;s the co@@ ver under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the j@@ ac@@ k@@ et , and there &apos;s an ad that off@@ ers a free 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day ri@@ sk@@ -@@ free tri@@ al for a blue wha@@ le ."
And you can just s@@ end in a self-@@ ad@@ dre@@ ssed st@@ am@@ ped en@@ vel@@ o@@ pe and we &apos;ll s@@ end you a wha@@ le .
And kids do write in .
"So here &apos;s a let@@ ter . It says , &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ar people , I b@@ et you 10 bu@@ cks you won &apos;t s@@ end me a blue wha@@ le ."
"E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ non ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who s@@ end these in get back is a let@@ ter in very small pr@@ int from a Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an la@@ w fi@@ r@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that due to a change in cu@@ st@@ oms la@@ ws , their wha@@ le has been hel@@ d up in S@@ og@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d , which is a very lo@@ v@@ ely f@@ j@@ or@@ d , and then it just kind of tal@@ ks about S@@ og@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d and Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It di@@ gre@@ sses . ( Laughter )@@ "
But it fin@@ i@@ sh@@ es off by saying that your wha@@ le would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a messa@@ ge ."
"And when you call and leave him a messa@@ ge , you just , on the out@@ going messa@@ ge , it &apos;s just wha@@ le s@@ ounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually s@@ ounds a lot like a wha@@ le sound ."
And they get a picture of their wha@@ le too .
"So this is R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , and R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph bel@@ ong@@ s to a ki@@ d nam@@ ed N@@ ic@@ o who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s messa@@ ge ."
This is the first messa@@ ge I ever got from N@@ ic@@ o .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I am your ow@@ ner , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph . H@@ ell@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . B@@ ye ."
"M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ic@@ o called back , like , an h@@ our later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s messa@@ ges .
"( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , ye@@ ah , S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m cal@@ ling you again to say hel@@ l@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again t@@ om@@ or@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ ye ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
He &apos;s left over 25 messa@@ ges for R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph over four years .
"You find out all about him and the grand@@ ma that he lo@@ ves and the grand@@ ma that he lik@@ es a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the c@@ ros@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more messa@@ ge from N@@ ic@@ o ."
This is the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s messa@@ ge from N@@ ic@@ o .
"@@ &#91; B@@ e@@ ep &#93; ( Au@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph , sor@@ ry I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bu@@ s@@ y because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wha@@ le , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m cal@@ ling you to just say , to wi@@ sh you a mer@@ ry Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s ."
"So have a ni@@ ce Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s , and b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ ye , R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph . Go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
"M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ic@@ o , I ha@@ dn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a messa@@ ge two days ago ."
"H@@ is voice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter on the phone , and she was very ni@@ ce to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph as well ."
But N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s the best read@@ er I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was wr@@ iting for to be in that place emoti@@ ona@@ lly with the things that I create .
"I feel lu@@ ck@@ y . K@@ i@@ ds like N@@ ic@@ o are the best read@@ ers , and they de@@ ser@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."
Thank you very much .

It has been 1@@ 2@@ 8 years since the last country in the world ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed s@@ la@@ very and 5@@ 3 years since M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ced his &quot; &quot; I H@@ a@@ ve A D@@ re@@ am &quot; &quot; spe@@ ech .
"But we still live in a world where the col@@ or of our sk@@ in not only gi@@ ves a first im@@ pre@@ ssion , but a la@@ sting one that re@@ ma@@ ins ."
I was born in a family full of col@@ ors .
My father is the son of a mai@@ d from wh@@ om he in@@ her@@ ited an int@@ en@@ se dar@@ k cho@@ co@@ late t@@ one .
He was ad@@ op@@ ted by those who I know as my grand@@ parents .
"The mat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch , my grand@@ ma , has a por@@ ce@@ la@@ in sk@@ in and c@@ ot@@ ton@@ -@@ like hair ."
"My grand@@ pa was some@@ where between a v@@ an@@ il@@ la and stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry yo@@ gu@@ r@@ t t@@ one , like my un@@ cle and my cou@@ sin ."
"My mother is a c@@ in@@ nam@@ on@@ -@@ sk@@ in d@@ aughter of a na@@ tive B@@ ra@@ z@@ i@@ li@@ an , with a pin@@ ch of ha@@ z@@ el and hon@@ ey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mi@@ x of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e with mil@@ k , but with a lot of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ."
She has two si@@ st@@ ers .
"One in a to@@ a@@ ste@@ d-@@ pe@@ an@@ ut sk@@ in and the other , also ad@@ op@@ ted , more on the be@@ i@@ ge side , like a pan@@ c@@ ake ."
"( Laughter ) G@@ ro@@ wing up in this family , col@@ or was never important for me ."
"O@@ ut@@ side home , h@@ ow@@ ever , things were different so@@ on ."
C@@ ol@@ or had many other mean@@ ings .
I remember my first dra@@ wing le@@ ss@@ ons in school as a bun@@ ch of con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory feel@@ ings .
It was exc@@ iting and cre@@ ative but I never under@@ sto@@ od the uni@@ que f@@ le@@ sh@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ red pen@@ ci@@ l .
I was made of f@@ le@@ sh but I wasn &apos;t pin@@ k .
"My sk@@ in was bro@@ wn , and people said I was black ."
I was seven years old with a me@@ ss of col@@ ors in my head .
"@@ L@@ at@@ er , when I took my cou@@ sin to school , I was u@@ su@@ ally taken for the nan@@ ny ."
"B@@ y hel@@ ping in the kit@@ ch@@ en at a friend &apos;s par@@ ty , people thought I was the mai@@ d ."
I was even tre@@ ated like a pros@@ tit@@ ute just because I was wal@@ king alone on the be@@ ach with E@@ ur@@ ope@@ an friends .
"And many times , vi@@ sit@@ ing my grand@@ ma or friends in u@@ pp@@ er cla@@ ss buil@@ di@@ ngs , I was inv@@ ited not to use the main el@@ ev@@ at@@ or ."
"Because in the end , with this col@@ or and this hair , I cannot bel@@ ong to some places ."
"In some way , I get to used to it and ac@@ cept part of it ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , something inside of me ke@@ ep@@ s rev@@ ol@@ ving and stru@@ gg@@ ling ."
Y@@ e@@ ars later I mar@@ ri@@ ed a S@@ pan@@ i@@ ard .
But not any S@@ pan@@ i@@ ard .
I ch@@ ose one with the sk@@ in col@@ or of a lob@@ ster when sun@@ bur@@ nt .
"( Laughter ) S@@ in@@ ce then , a new question started to cha@@ se me ."
What will be the col@@ or of your children ?
"As you can understand , this is my last con@@ cer@@ n ."
"But thinking about it , with my pre@@ vi@@ ous back@@ ground , my story led me to make my personal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se as a phot@@ ograph@@ er ."
And that is how H@@ u@@ man@@ ae was born .
"H@@ u@@ man@@ ae is a pur@@ su@@ it to high@@ light our true col@@ ors , rather than the un@@ true wh@@ ite , red , black or y@@ el@@ low as@@ soci@@ ated with ra@@ ce ."
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our co@@ des .
It &apos;s a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss from a personal story to a global history .
I por@@ tra@@ y the sub@@ jects in a wh@@ ite back@@ ground .
"Th@@ en I cho@@ ose an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ pi@@ x@@ el s@@ qu@@ are from the n@@ ose , pa@@ int the back@@ ground , and look for the cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or in the indu@@ stri@@ al p@@ al@@ et@@ te , P@@ ant@@ one ."
"I started with my family and friends , then more and more people jo@@ ined the ad@@ ven@@ ture , than@@ ks to public cal@@ ls coming through the social media ."
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open con@@ cept that inv@@ it@@ es everybody to pu@@ sh the share but@@ ton in both the computer and their brain .
The s@@ no@@ w@@ b@@ all started to ro@@ ll .
"The project had a great w@@ el@@ come — inv@@ it@@ ations , ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iti@@ ons , physical forma@@ ts , g@@ al@@ l@@ er@@ ies and mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms ..@@ ."
just happened .
"And am@@ ong them , my fav@@ or@@ ite : when H@@ u@@ man@@ ae oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ es public sp@@ ac@@ es and appe@@ ars in the stre@@ et , it f@@ os@@ ters a popu@@ lar de@@ b@@ ate and cre@@ ates a feeling of community ."
"I have por@@ tra@@ yed more than 3@@ ,000 people in 1@@ 3 different countries , 1@@ 9 different cities around the world ."
"@@ Just to men@@ tion some of them — from someone inclu@@ ded in the F@@ or@@ b@@ es list , to re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who c@@ ros@@ sed the M@@ e@@ dit@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an by bo@@ at ."
"In P@@ ar@@ is , from the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O H@@ e@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters to a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
And students both in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land and fa@@ ve@@ la@@ s in Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ ei@@ ro .
"A@@ ll kinds of belie@@ f@@ s , gen@@ der id@@ ent@@ ities or physical im@@ pai@@ r@@ ments , a ne@@ w@@ born or ter@@ mi@@ nally ill ."
We all together build H@@ u@@ man@@ ae .
Th@@ ose por@@ tra@@ its make us re@@ think how we see each other .
"When mo@@ der@@ n science is questi@@ on@@ ing the ra@@ ce con@@ cept , what does it mean for us to be black , wh@@ ite , y@@ el@@ low , red ?"
"I@@ s it the eye , the n@@ ose , the m@@ outh , the hair ?"
"O@@ r does it have to do with our ori@@ g@@ in , nati@@ ona@@ l@@ ity or b@@ ank ac@@ cou@@ nt ?"
This personal ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se turned out to be a disco@@ very .
Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I realized that H@@ u@@ man@@ ae was u@@ se@@ ful for many people .
It re@@ pres@@ ents a sort of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r for those who cannot find themselves re@@ fl@@ ected in any la@@ be@@ l .
It was amazing that people started to share their thou@@ ghts about the work with me .
"I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too ."
"A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 1@@ 1@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl wr@@ ote me , &quot; &quot; V@@ ery good for me as a to@@ ol to work on her con@@ fi@@ dence , as this past we@@ ek@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends ar@@ gue@@ d with her that she does not bel@@ ong and should not be allow@@ ed to live in Nor@@ way ."
"So your work has a very speci@@ al place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman sha@@ red her por@@ tra@@ it on F@@ ace@@ book and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the g@@ lo@@ be had difficul@@ ti@@ es to place me in a group , a ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe , a box ."
P@@ er@@ haps we should stop .
"I@@ n@@ stead of f@@ ram@@ ing , ask the individu@@ al , &apos; How would you la@@ be@@ l yourself ? &apos; Th@@ en I would say , &apos; H@@ i . I &apos;m M@@ as@@ si@@ el ."
"I &apos;m a D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ D@@ ut@@ ch , I gre@@ w up in a mi@@ x@@ ed family and I &apos;m a bi@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ si@@ des these un@@ exp@@ ected and tou@@ ching re@@ ac@@ tions , H@@ u@@ man@@ ae fin@@ ds a new life in a different vari@@ ety of fiel@@ ds ."
"@@ Just to show you some exam@@ ples , il@@ lu@@ st@@ rat@@ ors and art students using it as a re@@ fer@@ ence for their sk@@ et@@ ches and their stu@@ dies ."
It &apos;s a coll@@ ection of fac@@ es .
"@@ Re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in the fiel@@ ds of an@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ logy , physi@@ cs and neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence use H@@ u@@ man@@ ae with different scienti@@ fic appro@@ ach@@ es rela@@ ted to human eth@@ ni@@ city , op@@ to@@ physi@@ o@@ logy , face recog@@ n@@ ition or Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s ."
"One of the most important imp@@ ac@@ ts of the project is that H@@ u@@ man@@ ae was ch@@ os@@ en to be the co@@ ver of F@@ o@@ re@@ ig@@ n A@@ ff@@ ai@@ r@@ s , one of the most rele@@ v@@ ant political pu@@ b@@ lic@@ ations ."
"And talking about fore@@ ig@@ n aff@@ ai@@ r@@ s , I found the perf@@ ect am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors for my project ..@@ ."
teach@@ ers .
They are the ones that use H@@ u@@ man@@ ae as a to@@ ol for educ@@ ational pur@@ pos@@ es .
"@@ The@@ ir pa@@ ssion en@@ coura@@ ges me to go back to dra@@ wing cla@@ sses , but this time as a teach@@ er myself ."
"My students , both a@@ du@@ l@@ ts and kids , pa@@ int their self-@@ por@@ tra@@ its , trying to disco@@ ver their own uni@@ que col@@ or ."
"As a phot@@ ograph@@ er , I realize that I can be a chan@@ ne@@ l for others to communic@@ ate ."
"As an individu@@ al , as A@@ ng@@ é@@ lic@@ a , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a ther@@ ap@@ i@@ st ."
"A@@ ll the f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion , fear and l@@ on@@ el@@ ine@@ ss that I once felt ..@@ ."
bec@@ omes love .
"The last country — the last country in the world who ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed s@@ la@@ very is the country where I was born , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
We still have to work hard to ab@@ o@@ lish di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation .
"That re@@ ma@@ ins a common practi@@ ce wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de , and that will not di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar by itself ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn ki@@ d .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small vil@@ la@@ ge in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a .
H@@ is vil@@ la@@ ge is ne@@ ar M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
D@@ rought dri@@ ves the small vil@@ la@@ ge into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the b@@ r@@ ink of star@@ vation .
"W@@ ith nothing left for him there , he lea@@ ves for the big city , in this case , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the cap@@ ital of S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opportun@@ ities , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way forward ."
He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ s@@ ki@@ r@@ ts of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"M@@ a@@ ybe a year pa@@ sses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ fast ."
"He me@@ ets this d@@ y@@ na@@ mic group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y h@@ im@@ self some new c@@ lo@@ the@@ s , money to s@@ end back home to his family ."
He is int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ p@@ ose in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , under an a@@ z@@ u@@ re blue sk@@ y , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn ki@@ d with the big city dre@@ am@@ s was the su@@ i@@ ci@@ de b@@ om@@ ber , and that d@@ y@@ na@@ mic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st organiz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ ae@@ da ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn ki@@ d just trying to make it big in the city end up with him b@@ low@@ ing h@@ im@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"He was wa@@ iting for an opportunity , wa@@ iting to beg@@ in his future , wa@@ iting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that pu@@ l@@ led him out of what we call wai@@ tho@@ od .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in ur@@ b@@ an cent@@ ers around the world .
"It is the story of the di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ chi@@ sed , un@@ em@@ plo@@ yed ur@@ b@@ an you@@ th who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Jo@@ han@@ ne@@ s@@ bur@@ g , sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wai@@ tho@@ od ."
"For young people , the pr@@ omi@@ se of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opportunity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pros@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s you@@ th who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment rat@@ es .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provi@@ de them opportun@@ ities , the story of wai@@ tho@@ od , the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , to viol@@ ence , to g@@ ang@@ s , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , 70 percent of young people su@@ ff@@ er from un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u last mon@@ th , and I went to vi@@ sit M@@ ad@@ ina H@@ os@@ pit@@ al , the hospit@@ al I was born in ."
"I remember standing in front of that bu@@ l@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ dd@@ en hospit@@ al thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ ced into that same state of wai@@ tho@@ od ?
W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a you@@ th lead@@ er@@ ship and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship sum@@ mit .
I brought together about 90 young S@@ o@@ ma@@ li lead@@ ers .
We sat down and bra@@ inst@@ or@@ med on solu@@ tions to the bi@@ g@@ gest challeng@@ es fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to univer@@ sity in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opportun@@ ities ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , un@@ em@@ plo@@ yed , f@@ ru@@ st@@ rated , that he was the perf@@ ect tar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st organiz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited ."
They s@@ ou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , the bi@@ g@@ gest bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l war have completely de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed the ro@@ ad system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the easi@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ iz@@ ed it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began r@@ ent@@ ing out mot@@ or@@ b@@ ik@@ es to local resi@@ d@@ ents who couldn &apos;t nor@@ ma@@ lly af@@ for@@ d them .
"He b@@ ou@@ ght 10 b@@ ik@@ es , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually exp@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ red within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to id@@ enti@@ fy and se@@ iz@@ e a new opportunity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship can be the most powerful to@@ ol against wai@@ tho@@ od ."
It em@@ pow@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic opportun@@ ities they are so de@@ sp@@ er@@ ately se@@ ek@@ ing .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ eti@@ ngs , M@@ o@@ ha@@ med M@@ o@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d , a fl@@ ori@@ st ."
He was hel@@ ping me tra@@ in some of the young people at the sum@@ mit in ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship and how to be inno@@ v@@ ative and how to create a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ ori@@ st M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until rec@@ ently , until M@@ o@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted f@@ low@@ ers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pla@@ stic b@@ ou@@ que@@ ts shi@@ pp@@ ed from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; W@@ hen was the last time you saw fre@@ sh f@@ low@@ ers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under ci@@ vi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So M@@ o@@ ha@@ med saw an opportunity ."
He started a lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing and design flo@@ ral company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ lies , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u climate ."
"And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing f@@ low@@ ers to we@@ d@@ di@@ ngs , cre@@ ating gar@@ d@@ ens at h@@ omes and busin@@ ess@@ es around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u .
"He want@@ s to create a space where fami@@ lies , young people , can come together , and , as he says , sm@@ ell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ros@@ es ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ros@@ es because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first step is to inspi@@ re young people , and in that room , M@@ o@@ ha@@ med &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the you@@ th in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his inno@@ vation , really had a st@@ rong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ ced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
"He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , that they could be change mak@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with inno@@ v@@ ative solu@@ tions to some of the bi@@ g@@ gest challeng@@ es fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al solu@@ tions to local problems .
"So inspi@@ ring young people and cre@@ ating a culture of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need exper@@ ti@@ se and m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship to gu@@ i@@ de them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ching their busin@@ ess@@ es .
"C@@ on@@ n@@ ect young people with the re@@ sources they need , provi@@ de them the supp@@ ort they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create ca@@ tal@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an growth ."
"For me , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
M@@ o@@ ha@@ med is not simply sel@@ ling f@@ low@@ ers .
I believe he is sel@@ ling hope .
"H@@ is P@@ e@@ ace P@@ ar@@ k , and that &apos;s what he cal@@ ls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help r@@ ent out and ma@@ in@@ tain those b@@ ik@@ es for him .
He gave them the opportunity to e@@ sc@@ ape the pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis of wai@@ tho@@ od .
These young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s are having a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous imp@@ act in their cities .
"So my sug@@ ge@@ stion is , turn you@@ th into ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and nu@@ r@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent inno@@ vation , and you will have more stories of f@@ low@@ ers and P@@ e@@ ace P@@ ar@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wai@@ tho@@ od ."
Thank you .

( Applause ) One of the real challeng@@ es is to inno@@ v@@ ate fundamen@@ tally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ ra@@ l@@ led to in education ."
This one teach@@ er didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
"P@@ ic@@ ture this : It &apos;s M@@ on@@ day mor@@ ning , you &apos;re at the offi@@ ce , you &apos;re set@@ t@@ ling in for the day at work , and this guy that you sort of recogni@@ ze from down the ha@@ ll , wal@@ ks right into your cu@@ bi@@ cle and he ste@@ als your cha@@ ir ."
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t say a word — just ro@@ l@@ ls away with it .
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your cha@@ ir out of all the other chai@@ r@@ s that are out there .
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t ac@@ knowledge the fact that you might need your cha@@ ir to get some work done today .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a st@@ ink .
"You &apos;d fol@@ low that guy back to his cu@@ bi@@ cle and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my cha@@ ir ? &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so now it &apos;s T@@ ue@@ s@@ day mor@@ ning and you &apos;re at the offi@@ ce , and a me@@ et@@ ing inv@@ it@@ ation pop@@ s up in your cal@@ en@@ da@@ r ."
"( Laughter ) And it &apos;s from this woman who you kind of know from down the ha@@ ll , and the sub@@ ject line re@@ fer@@ ences some project that you heard a little bit about ."
But there &apos;s no ag@@ en@@ da .
There &apos;s no information about why you were inv@@ ited to the me@@ et@@ ing .
"And yet you ac@@ cept the me@@ et@@ ing inv@@ it@@ ation , and you go ."
And I &apos;m talking about something far more val@@ u@@ able than offi@@ ce fu@@ r@@ nit@@ u@@ re .
I &apos;m talking about time . Y@@ our time .
"In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic of a terri@@ ble new il@@ l@@ ness known as M@@ A@@ S : M@@ in@@ d@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ."
( Laughter ) The pri@@ ma@@ ry sy@@ mp@@ tom of M@@ in@@ d@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is just ac@@ cep@@ ting a me@@ et@@ ing inv@@ it@@ ation the min@@ ute it pop@@ s up in your cal@@ en@@ da@@ r . ( Laughter )
"It &apos;s an inv@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry re@@ f@@ le@@ x — ding , cli@@ ck , b@@ ing — it &apos;s in your cal@@ en@@ da@@ r , &quot; &quot; G@@ ot@@ ta go , I &apos;m already late for a me@@ et@@ ing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) M@@ e@@ eti@@ ngs are important , right ?"
And col@@ labo@@ ration is key to the suc@@ cess of any ent@@ er@@ pri@@ se .
"And a w@@ ell@@ -@@ run me@@ et@@ ing can yi@@ el@@ d really pos@@ itive , ac@@ ti@@ ona@@ ble resul@@ ts ."
"But between glob@@ aliz@@ ation and per@@ v@@ a@@ sive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dra@@ mati@@ cally over the last few years ."
"And we &apos;re mi@@ ser@@ able . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re mi@@ ser@@ able not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good me@@ et@@ ing , it &apos;s because of M@@ A@@ S , our M@@ in@@ d@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , which is a self-@@ inf@@ lic@@ ted w@@ ound ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , I have evi@@ dence to pro@@ ve that M@@ A@@ S is a global e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic ."
Let me tell you why .
"A couple of years ago , I put a video on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be , and in the video , I ac@@ ted out every terri@@ ble con@@ fer@@ ence call you &apos;ve ever been on ."
"It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we ha@@ te about really bad me@@ eti@@ ngs ."
There &apos;s the mo@@ der@@ at@@ or who has no idea how to run the me@@ et@@ ing .
There are the parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
The whole thing kind of col@@ lap@@ ses into this col@@ labo@@ ra@@ tive tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
And everybody lea@@ ves very ang@@ ry .
It &apos;s kind of fun@@ ny .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quic@@ k look .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ re@@ ement on a very important prop@@ os@@ al .
"As a group , we need to deci@@ de if — blo@@ op blo@@ op — H@@ i , who just jo@@ ined ?"
"H@@ i , it &apos;s Jo@@ e . I &apos;m working from home today ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ i , Jo@@ e . Th@@ an@@ ks for jo@@ ining us today , great ."
"I was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we &apos;d like to get through , so let &apos;s s@@ ki@@ p the ro@@ ll call and I &apos;m g@@ on@@ na di@@ ve right in ."
O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an ag@@ re@@ ement on a very important prop@@ os@@ al .
"As a group , we need to deci@@ de if — blo@@ op blo@@ op — ( Laughter ) H@@ i , who just jo@@ ined ?"
No ? I thought I heard a be@@ ep . ( Laughter ) S@@ ound fami@@ li@@ ar ?
"@@ Yeah , it s@@ ounds fami@@ li@@ ar to me , too ."
"A couple of weeks after I put that on@@ line , 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in do@@ z@@ ens of countries , I mean do@@ z@@ ens of countries , wat@@ ched this video ."
"And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of vie@@ ws every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
"And in fact , some of the bi@@ g@@ gest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my per@@ mi@@ ssion to use this video in their ne@@ w@@ -@@ hi@@ re tra@@ ining to te@@ ach their new em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es how not to run a me@@ et@@ ing at their company ."
"And if the numbers — there are a million vie@@ ws and it &apos;s being used by all these companies — are@@ n &apos;t enough pro@@ of that we have a global problem with me@@ eti@@ ngs , there are the many , many thousands of com@@ ments pos@@ ted on@@ line after the video went up ."
"Th@@ ou@@ sands of people wr@@ ote things like , &quot; O@@ M@@ G , that was my day today ! &quot;"
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
"One guy wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s fun@@ ny because it &apos;s true ."
"E@@ eri@@ ly , sa@@ dly , de@@ pre@@ ssi@@ ng@@ ly true ."
It made me la@@ u@@ gh until I cri@@ ed .
"And cri@@ ed . And I cri@@ ed some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My dai@@ ly life until re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or death , si@@ gh . &quot;"
These are real quot@@ es and it &apos;s real sa@@ d .
A common the@@ me run@@ ning through all of these com@@ ments on@@ line is this fundamen@@ tal belie@@ f that we are power@@ less to do anything other than go to me@@ eti@@ ngs and su@@ ff@@ er through these po@@ or@@ ly run me@@ eti@@ ngs and live to me@@ et another day .
"But the truth is , we &apos;re not power@@ less at all ."
"In fact , the cu@@ re for M@@ A@@ S is right here in our hands ."
"It &apos;s right at our fi@@ ng@@ er@@ ti@@ ps , literally ."
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No M@@ A@@ S !
"( Laughter ) W@@ hi@@ ch , if I remember my high school S@@ pan@@ is@@ h , means something like , &quot; &quot; E@@ n@@ ough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No M@@ A@@ S works . It &apos;s very simple ."
"Fi@@ rst of all , the next time you get a me@@ et@@ ing inv@@ it@@ ation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , cli@@ ck the ten@@ ta@@ tive but@@ ton !@@ "
"It &apos;s ok@@ ay , you &apos;re allow@@ ed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there ."
It &apos;s right next to the ac@@ cept but@@ ton .
"O@@ r the maybe but@@ ton , or wha@@ tever but@@ ton is there for you not to ac@@ cept im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"Th@@ en , get in tou@@ ch with the person who asked you to the me@@ et@@ ing ."
"T@@ ell them you &apos;re very exc@@ ited to supp@@ ort their work , ask them what the go@@ al of the me@@ et@@ ing is , and tell them you &apos;re interested in learning how you can help them achi@@ e@@ ve their go@@ al ."
"And if we do this often enough , and we do it resp@@ ec@@ t@@ fully , people might start to be a little bit more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful about the way they put together me@@ et@@ ing inv@@ it@@ ations ."
And you can make more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful deci@@ sions about ac@@ cep@@ ting it .
P@@ eople might actually start sen@@ ding out ag@@ en@@ d@@ as . I@@ mag@@ ine !
O@@ r they might not have a con@@ fer@@ ence call with 12 people to talk about a sta@@ tu@@ s when they could just do a quic@@ k e@@ mai@@ l and get it done with .
P@@ eople just might start to change their behavior because you changed y@@ ours .
"And they just might bring your cha@@ ir back , too . ( Laughter ) No M@@ A@@ S !@@ "
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
And even bl@@ ind bab@@ ies s@@ mi@@ le to the sound of the human voice .
No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED T@@ al@@ k .
And it &apos;s this : Y@@ our number one ta@@ s@@ k as a speak@@ er is to trans@@ f@@ er into your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary gi@@ ft — a st@@ range and beautiful ob@@ ject that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s H@@ al@@ ey .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) P@@ re@@ sent@@ er : H@@ al@@ ey V@@ an D@@ y@@ ck !
"( Applause ) O@@ ver the course of 18 minutes , 1@@ ,@@ 200 people , many of wh@@ om have never seen each other before , are fin@@ ding that their bra@@ ins are star@@ ting to sy@@ n@@ c with H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain and with each other ."
They &apos;re literally beginning to ex@@ hi@@ bit the same bra@@ in@@ -@@ wa@@ ve patter@@ ns .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emoti@@ ons .
There &apos;s something even more star@@ t@@ ling happening .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are bil@@ lions of inter@@ connected neur@@ ons in an im@@ possible tang@@ le .
"But look here , right here — a few million of them are lin@@ ked to each other in a way which re@@ pres@@ ents a single idea ."
"And incredi@@ bly , this ex@@ act patter@@ n is being re@@ created in real time inside the min@@ ds of everyone list@@ ening ."
"That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a patter@@ n inv@@ ol@@ ving millions of neur@@ ons is being tel@@ ep@@ or@@ ted into 1@@ ,@@ 200 min@@ ds , just by people list@@ ening to a voice and wat@@ ching a face ."
But wai@@ t — what is an idea any@@ way ?
"Well , you can think of it as a patter@@ n of information that hel@@ ps you understand and na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world ."
Here are just a few exam@@ ples sha@@ red from the TED sta@@ ge .
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is key to our kids &apos; future .
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ or@@ a H@@ ar@@ dy — building from bam@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) E@@ l@@ or@@ a H@@ ar@@ dy : It is growing all around us , it &apos;s st@@ rong , it &apos;s el@@ eg@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ e-@@ resi@@ st@@ ant ."
C@@ A : C@@ hi@@ ma@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single id@@ ent@@ ity .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) C@@ hi@@ ma@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The single story cre@@ ates ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes , and the problem with ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are in@@ complet@@ e ."
"C@@ A : Y@@ our mind is te@@ em@@ ing with ideas , and not just rand@@ om@@ ly ."
They &apos;re care@@ fully lin@@ ked together .
C@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely they form an ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly complex structure that is your personal wor@@ l@@ d@@ view .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
It &apos;s how you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the world .
And it is built up out of millions of individu@@ al ideas .
"So , for example , if one little comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that kit@@ ten@@ s are a@@ do@@ ra@@ ble , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act like this ."
"But if another comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds are dang@@ er@@ ous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act a little bit differ@@ ently ."
"So , it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous why the ideas that make up your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view are c@@ ru@@ cial ."
"You need them to be as reli@@ able as possible — a gu@@ i@@ de , to the sc@@ ary but wonderful real world out there ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ ws can be dra@@ mati@@ cally different ."
"For example , how does your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view re@@ act when you see this image : ( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ al@@ ia M@@ o@@ ga@@ h@@ ed : What do you think when you look at me ?"
"@@ &quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ ith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a si@@ ster &quot; &quot; ?"
"O@@ r &quot; &quot; op@@ pre@@ ssed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ in@@ wa@@ shed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st &quot; &quot; ?"
"C@@ A : W@@ ha@@ tever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would re@@ act very differ@@ ently ."
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
"If communic@@ ated pr@@ oper@@ ly , they &apos;re cap@@ able of changing , fore@@ ver , how someone thin@@ ks about the world , and sha@@ ping their ac@@ tions both now and well into the future ."
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful for@@ ce sha@@ ping human culture .
"So if you ac@@ cept that your number one ta@@ s@@ k as a speak@@ er is to build an idea inside the min@@ ds of your au@@ dience , here are four gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines for how you should go about that ta@@ s@@ k : One , li@@ mit your talk to just one maj@@ or idea ."
"I@@ de@@ as are complex things ; you need to s@@ la@@ sh back your cont@@ ent so that you can focu@@ s on the single idea you &apos;re most pa@@ ssi@@ o@@ nate about , and give yourself a chan@@ ce to expla@@ in that one thing pr@@ oper@@ ly ."
"You have to give cont@@ ext , share exam@@ ples , make it vi@@ vi@@ d ."
"So pi@@ ck one idea , and make it the throu@@ gh@@ -@@ line run@@ ning through your entire talk , so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way ."
"T@@ wo , give your list@@ en@@ ers a reason to care ."
"B@@ e@@ fore you can start building things inside the min@@ ds of your au@@ dience , you have to get their per@@ mi@@ ssion to w@@ el@@ come you in ."
And the main to@@ ol to achi@@ e@@ ve that ?
C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
S@@ ti@@ r your au@@ dience &apos;s cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"@@ U@@ se int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing , pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ative questions to id@@ enti@@ fy why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs expla@@ ining ."
"If you can re@@ ve@@ al a dis@@ conn@@ ection in someone &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bri@@ dge that knowledge g@@ ap ."
"And once you &apos;ve sp@@ ar@@ ked that de@@ si@@ re , it will be so much easi@@ er to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of con@@ cep@@ ts that your au@@ dience already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"You use the power of language to we@@ a@@ ve together con@@ cep@@ ts that already exi@@ st in your list@@ en@@ ers &apos; min@@ ds — but not your language , their language ."
You start where they are .
The speak@@ ers often for@@ get that many of the terms and con@@ cep@@ ts they live with are completely un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar to their au@@ di@@ ences .
"Now , me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors can play a c@@ ru@@ cial ro@@ le in show@@ ing how the piec@@ es fit together , because they re@@ ve@@ al the de@@ si@@ red sha@@ pe of the patter@@ n , based on an idea that the list@@ en@@ er already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"For example , when J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er K@@ a@@ h@@ n wanted to expla@@ in the incredible new bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy called C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word proce@@ ss@@ or to ed@@ it DNA ."
"C@@ R@@ I@@ S@@ P@@ R allow@@ s you to cut and pa@@ ste gen@@ e@@ tic information really easi@@ ly . &quot; &quot; Now , a vi@@ vi@@ d ex@@ plan@@ ation like that deli@@ ver@@ s a sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying a@@ ha moment as it snap@@ s into place in our min@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s important , ther@@ e@@ fore , to test your talk on tru@@ sted friends , and find out which parts they get con@@ fu@@ sed by ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fi@@ nal ti@@ p : M@@ ake your idea wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
"B@@ y that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Wh@@ o does this idea bene@@ fit ? &quot;"
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
"If the idea only ser@@ ves you or your organiz@@ ation , then , I &apos;m sor@@ ry to say , it &apos;s probably not wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
The au@@ dience will see right through you .
"C@@ an I ask you to p@@ le@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a song or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school ma@@ th ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a los@@ ing prop@@ os@@ ition ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fi@@ nal ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 25 percent pa@@ ss rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak ma@@ th down into two cat@@ eg@@ ories ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ ti@@ cs with lead@@ ing c@@ oe@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ents great@@ er than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provi@@ ded you have a really st@@ rong grou@@ n@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ lic@@ ation of ma@@ th proce@@ sses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th teach@@ er ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cla@@ ss@@ room ."
One is a lack of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ is@@ h your l@@ ec@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up asking you to re@@ -@@ expla@@ in the entire thing at their de@@ s@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents lack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They lack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ le@@ s@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mu@@ la to app@@ ly in that situ@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V show@@ s , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry d@@ ram@@ a , show@@ s set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it sha@@ pes the ne@@ u@@ ral pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ solu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ patient with things that don &apos;t re@@ solve quickly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ rap up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a la@@ u@@ gh tra@@ ck ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and w@@ ell@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ books — particu@@ larly ma@@ ss@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ books — te@@ ach ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and patient problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s func@@ ti@@ ona@@ lly e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and cal@@ ling it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physi@@ cs t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"N@@ oti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three piec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ mu@@ la some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then comp@@ ute ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ffi@@ cient information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ stri@@ ng@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the practi@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and t@@ we@@ ak@@ ing the cont@@ ext a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was mol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mu@@ la ."
"You could literally , I mean this , pa@@ ss this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physi@@ cs , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ o@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ fi@@ cally in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ pa@@ rate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ pa@@ rate la@@ y@@ ers and , particu@@ larly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pre@@ ssed together and pre@@ sent@@ ed to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ patient problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ sual .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal structure , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , mea@@ su@@ re@@ ments , la@@ b@@ els , poin@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ st@@ ep@@ s , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ el@@ ling question , a comp@@ el@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , st@@ rai@@ ght pat@@ h from one to the other and c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ la@@ ting our students for how well they can step over the small c@@ rac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ pa@@ rate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ sual , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : W@@ hi@@ ch sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ?"
And this star@@ ts conver@@ sation because the vi@@ sual is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two answ@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pai@@ r@@ s , jour@@ na@@ ling , wha@@ tever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we realize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the low@@ er le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ b@@ els to talk about them more easi@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be ni@@ ce to have some mea@@ su@@ re@@ ments to really na@@ r@@ row it down , speci@@ fi@@ cally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal structure ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the conver@@ sation , the conver@@ sation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cla@@ sses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ st@@ ep@@ s together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , compa@@ red to that — which one cre@@ ates that patient problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my practi@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll yi@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ in@@ ste@@ in , who , I believe , has paid his due@@ s ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mu@@ lation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my practi@@ ce , in the U.S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the for@@ mu@@ lation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fai@@ r@@ ly comp@@ el@@ ling el@@ em@@ ents of problems like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that supp@@ or@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and patient problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"Fi@@ rst things first , we eli@@ mi@@ nate all the sub@@ st@@ ep@@ s ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to for@@ mu@@ late those ."
And then noti@@ ce that all the information writ@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ st@@ rac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ i@@ ght matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What ma@@ tt@@ ers here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ed question in ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so often see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ books , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ low@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ low@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ches , ro@@ l@@ ling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a conver@@ sation about ma@@ th because someone else has the for@@ mu@@ la ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ mu@@ la better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids answ@@ ering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cally and conver@@ sa@@ ti@@ ona@@ lly inti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ ining the conver@@ sation ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , atta@@ ch them to gue@@ sses , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teach@@ er &apos;s ed@@ ition ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ o@@ re@@ ti@@ cal mo@@ d@@ els that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teach@@ er &apos;s ed@@ ition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sources of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ o@@ re@@ ti@@ cal does not mat@@ ch up with the practi@@ cal ."
"But those conver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to repor@@ t some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ sta@@ l@@ led with these vi@@ ru@@ ses day one of the cla@@ ss .
"These are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , to@@ tally new , to@@ tally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a conver@@ sation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ ver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer inti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ low@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ coura@@ ge ma@@ th teach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ ti@@ media , because it bri@@ ngs the real world into your cla@@ ss@@ room in high re@@ solu@@ tion and full col@@ or ; to en@@ coura@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in conver@@ sation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in to@@ tal , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for patient problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th teach@@ er right now is because we have the tools to create this high@@ -@@ quality cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m in our front po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fai@@ r@@ ly che@@ ap , and the tools to di@@ stri@@ b@@ ute it fre@@ ely under open lic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get ema@@ il@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ sit@@ ed saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good conver@@ sation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the l@@ ine@@ ar mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my cla@@ ss@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; Go@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ c@@ lu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hu@@ ng@@ ry for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ la@@ ry for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ coura@@ ge you , wha@@ tever your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , teach@@ er , po@@ lic@@ y mak@@ er , wha@@ tever — in@@ si@@ st on better ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m ."
We need more patient problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ po@@ ration of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ stic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ ha@@ ck ant@@ en@@ na atta@@ ched to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ u@@ mb@@ ing com@@ pati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ e@@ s@@ co@@ pe to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the side of a gla@@ ss win@@ do@@ w in S@@ ao P@@ au@@ l@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
I was born and rais@@ ed in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ st@@ antly stru@@ gg@@ led against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and ca@@ red for first , because I was the only son and the you@@ ng@@ est of two in the family ."
But then the great f@@ am@@ ine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My si@@ ster and I would go sear@@ ching for fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mi@@ d@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the stre@@ ets sear@@ ching for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating chi@@ ps , and want@@ ing to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ u@@ ng@@ er is hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation . H@@ u@@ ng@@ er is h@@ op@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
"For a hu@@ ng@@ ry child , politi@@ cs and fre@@ e@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my nin@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ ine@@ ss in their he@@ ar@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans died of star@@ vation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
"In the same year , my mother di@@ sap@@ pe@@ a@@ red one day , and then my si@@ ster told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ in@@ ce we had never been se@@ pa@@ rated , and I thought we would be together fore@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the bi@@ g@@ gest mi@@ sta@@ ke I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my si@@ ster since then .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , I became an or@@ pha@@ n and h@@ om@@ el@@ ess ."
"My dai@@ ly life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a du@@ st@@ y piece of bre@@ ad in the tra@@ sh .
But that is no way to survi@@ ve .
"I started to realize , be@@ gg@@ ing would not be the solu@@ tion ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ leg@@ al mark@@ ets .
"S@@ ome@@ times , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even spent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al mine , 3@@ 3 met@@ ers under@@ ground without any prot@@ ection for up to 16 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ ph@@ ans survi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep from bit@@ ter co@@ ld or hu@@ ng@@ er pa@@ ins , I h@@ op@@ ed that , the next mor@@ ning , my si@@ ster would come back to w@@ ake me up with my fav@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"I don &apos;t mean big , g@@ r@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tra@@ sh can had bre@@ ad , even though it u@@ su@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die ."
H@@ o@@ pe ke@@ pt me ali@@ ve .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my si@@ ster &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ri@@ sk@@ y , but I would be ris@@ king my life either way ."
"I could die of star@@ vation like my father in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by e@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tried to c@@ ross the bor@@ der to China in the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time to av@@ oi@@ d being seen .
Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sho@@ ot and k@@ ill people trying to c@@ ross the bor@@ der without per@@ mi@@ ssion .
"@@ Ch@@ ine@@ se sol@@ di@@ ers will cat@@ ch and s@@ end back Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment ."
"I decided to c@@ ross during the day , first because I was still a ki@@ d and sc@@ a@@ red of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to c@@ ross during the day , I thought I might be able to c@@ ross without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 16 years old .
"I thought things in China would be easi@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ri@@ ed about being cau@@ ght and sent back .
"B@@ y a mi@@ rac@@ le , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , and was allow@@ ed to live there and e@@ at re@@ gu@@ lar me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"@@ L@@ at@@ er that year , an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st hel@@ ped me e@@ sc@@ ape China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of Eng@@ lish , yet my social work@@ er told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , I was an F stud@@ ent ."
( Laughter ) And I ba@@ rely fin@@ i@@ shed el@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ ry school .
And I remember I f@@ ou@@ ght in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ books and the li@@ bra@@ ry were not my pla@@ y@@ ground .
"My father tried very hard to moti@@ v@@ ate me into stud@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"At one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hu@@ r@@ t me de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , my level of moti@@ vation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my f@@ os@@ ter mother had made chi@@ ck@@ en w@@ ings for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pla@@ te , I saw the last chi@@ ck@@ en wing , that my f@@ os@@ ter father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I re@@ me@@ mb@@ ered my bio@@ logical father .
"My f@@ os@@ ter father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hu@@ ng@@ ry , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ vation ."
"My only wi@@ sh that night was to co@@ ok a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to hon@@ or him ."
And my answer was to pr@@ omi@@ se to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to hon@@ or his s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce .
"I took school seri@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I re@@ cei@@ ved an ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic a@@ ward for ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s list from the first se@@ me@@ ster in high school ."
( Applause ) That chi@@ ck@@ en wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ o@@ pe is personal . H@@ o@@ pe is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
"In Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ o@@ pe brought me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming fre@@ e@@ dom ."
"My f@@ os@@ ter father at that din@@ ner gave me a direc@@ tion , and he moti@@ v@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ p@@ ose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people hel@@ ped me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans are fi@@ gh@@ ting hard to survi@@ ve .
"They have to for@@ ce themselves to survi@@ ve , have hope to survi@@ ve , but they cannot make it without help ."
This is my messa@@ ge to you .
"H@@ a@@ ve hope for yourself , but also help each other ."
"@@ Li@@ fe can be hard for everyone , wh@@ er@@ ever you live ."
My f@@ os@@ ter father didn &apos;t int@@ end to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sma@@ l@@ le@@ st act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fy your hu@@ ng@@ er , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you ali@@ ve ."
But I con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also sa@@ ve another J@@ os@@ e@@ ph &apos;s life and change thousands of other J@@ os@@ e@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : J@@ os@@ e@@ ph , than@@ k you for shar@@ ing that very personal and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen your si@@ ster for , you said , it was almost exactly a dec@@ a@@ de , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to s@@ end her a messa@@ ge ."
J@@ os@@ e@@ ph K@@ i@@ m : In K@@ o@@ re@@ an ?
"A@@ H : You can do Eng@@ lish , then K@@ o@@ re@@ an as well ."
"( Laughter ) J@@ K : O@@ kay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in K@@ o@@ re@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without te@@ aring up ."
"N@@ un@@ a , it has been already 10 years that I ha@@ ven ’ t seen you ."
"I just wanted to say that I mi@@ ss you , and I love you , and p@@ le@@ ase come back to me and sta@@ y ali@@ ve ."
"And I — o@@ h , g@@ os@@ h ."
I still ha@@ ven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
"I will live my life happ@@ i@@ ly and study hard until I see you , and I pr@@ omi@@ se I will not c@@ ry again ."
"( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small messa@@ ge to my mo@@ m ?
"A@@ H : Su@@ re , p@@ le@@ ase ."
"@@ J@@ K : I ha@@ ven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still p@@ ra@@ y for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say than@@ k you for l@@ etting me be in this world .
Thank you .

How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a di@@ stor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of cha@@ rac@@ ters like this ?
"@@ How many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ standing . So I inv@@ ented that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the ent@@ ity fil@@ ling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was writ@@ ten to sub@@ mit the form millions and millions of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least non@@ -@@ vi@@ su@@ al@@ l@@ y-@@ im@@ pai@@ red humans , have no t@@ rou@@ ble read@@ ing these di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ qui@@ gg@@ ly cha@@ rac@@ ters , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as computer pro@@ gram@@ s simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ket@@ ma@@ ster , the reason you have to ty@@ pe these di@@ stor@@ ted cha@@ rac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a program that can bu@@ y millions of ti@@ ck@@ ets , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the preci@@ se sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom cha@@ rac@@ ters that is sh@@ own to the us@@ er is not so for@@ tu@@ nate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o regi@@ stra@@ tion pa@@ ge .
"The ran@@ dom cha@@ rac@@ ters that happened to be sh@@ own to the us@@ er were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word ."
But the best part is the messa@@ ge that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help de@@ s@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ext : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wai@@ t ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this poor person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A P@@ ro@@ ject is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"@@ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next ev@@ olution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Goog@@ le actually ac@@ qui@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the follow@@ ing realiz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ xi@@ mat@@ ely 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are ty@@ ped every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite p@@ rou@@ d of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started feeling bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , ess@@ entially you wa@@ ste 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ tip@@ ly that by 200 million , you get that human@@ ity as a whole is wa@@ sting about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started feeling bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the sec@@ ur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of depen@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this ef@@ for@@ t for something that is good for human@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that comp@@ ut@@ ers cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do u@@ se@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of put@@ ting it is , is there some hu@@ mong@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get comp@@ ut@@ ers to solve , yet we can sp@@ l@@ it into tiny 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they solve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ wa@@ days while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ enti@@ c@@ ating yourself as a human , but in ad@@ dition you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to dig@@ iti@@ ze books ."
So let me expla@@ in how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of pro@@ jects out there trying to dig@@ iti@@ ze books .
Goog@@ le has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ d@@ le , is trying to dig@@ iti@@ ze books ."
B@@ a@@ sically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Li@@ ke a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like taking a dig@@ ital phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h of every pa@@ ge of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every pa@@ ge of the book .
This is an image with t@@ ext for every pa@@ ge of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to deci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for opti@@ cal cha@@ rac@@ ter recog@@ n@@ ition , which takes a picture of t@@ ext and tri@@ es to figure out what t@@ ext is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not perf@@ ect .
"E@@ specially for ol@@ der books where the ink has f@@ ad@@ ed and the pa@@ ges have turned y@@ el@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot recogni@@ ze a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were writ@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recogni@@ ze about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recogni@@ ze and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you ty@@ pe a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from books that are being dig@@ iti@@ zed that the computer could not recogni@@ ze ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ wa@@ days instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , p@@ le@@ ase ty@@ pe both ."
"And if you ty@@ pe the cor@@ rec@@ t word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ su@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some con@@ fi@@ dence that you ty@@ ped the other word cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them ag@@ ree on what the new word is , then we get one more word dig@@ iti@@ zed ac@@ cu@@ rat@@ ely ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we rele@@ as@@ ed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ sit@@ es have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people wa@@ sted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to dig@@ iti@@ ze books ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ket@@ ma@@ ster ."
"So every time you bu@@ y ti@@ ck@@ ets on T@@ ic@@ ket@@ ma@@ ster , you help to dig@@ iti@@ ze a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or p@@ oke somebody , you help to dig@@ iti@@ ze a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other sit@@ es are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of sit@@ es that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re dig@@ iti@@ zing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million books a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ ny things can happen ."
And this is e@@ specially true because now we &apos;re giving people two rand@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en Eng@@ lish words next to each other .
So fun@@ ny things can happen .
"For example , we pre@@ sent@@ ed this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another rand@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ext : bad ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ site where we show@@ ed this actually happened to be called The E@@ mb@@ as@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ om ( T@@ ext : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ sul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ sul@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pre@@ sent@@ ing two rand@@ om@@ ly ch@@ os@@ en words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given ri@@ se to a really big Internet me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ mag@@ ine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ext : in@@ vi@@ sible to@@ a@@ ster ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re supp@@ osed to do is you take a scre@@ en sh@@ ot of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us dig@@ iti@@ ze a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sh@@ ot , and then you dra@@ w something that is rela@@ ted to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very c@@ ute . ( T@@ ext : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ext : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ al@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logical sh@@ vi@@ s@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ op D@@ og@@ g . ( Laughter )@@ "
"O@@ kay , so this is my fav@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fav@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of di@@ st@@ inc@@ t people that have hel@@ ped us dig@@ iti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has hel@@ ped us dig@@ iti@@ ze human knowledge ."
And it is numbers like these that moti@@ v@@ ate my research ag@@ en@@ da .
"So the question that moti@@ v@@ ates my research is the follow@@ ing : If you look at human@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale achi@@ ev@@ em@@ ents , these really big things that human@@ ity has g@@ ot@@ ten together and done hi@@ stor@@ ic@@ ally — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ r@@ ami@@ ds of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or the P@@ an@@ am@@ a C@@ an@@ al or put@@ ting a man on the M@@ o@@ on — there is a cu@@ ri@@ ous fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ i@@ rd ; they were all done with about 10@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordi@@ nat@@ ing more than 10@@ 0,000 people , let alone pa@@ ying them , was ess@@ entially im@@ possible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sh@@ own you a project where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us dig@@ iti@@ ze human knowledge ."
"So the question that moti@@ v@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the M@@ o@@ on with 10@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different pro@@ jects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qui@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It ha@@ sn &apos;t yet been la@@ un@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo .
"S@@ in@@ ce it ha@@ sn &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tru@@ st you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent , S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I pos@@ ed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ k@@ er ."
So I pos@@ ed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"Fi@@ rst of all , trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is par@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ag@@ es .
A large f@@ rac@@ tion of it is in Eng@@ lish .
"If you don &apos;t know any Eng@@ lish , you can &apos;t access it ."
"But there &apos;s large f@@ rac@@ tions in other different langu@@ ag@@ es , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ag@@ es , you can &apos;t access it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ late all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use comp@@ ut@@ ers to trans@@ late ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ lation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ lation no@@ wa@@ days is star@@ ting to trans@@ late some sent@@ ences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ late the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mi@@ sta@@ k@@ es .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mi@@ sta@@ ke , since it makes so many mi@@ sta@@ k@@ es , you don &apos;t know whether to tru@@ st it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ lated with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um p@@ ost .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ lated from J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se into Eng@@ lish .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ lated with a computer .
So the next sent@@ ence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
"@@ Re@@ member , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ext : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time in@@ sta@@ ll a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : How many times like the w@@ ind , a po@@ le , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ext : This in@@ sul@@ t to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fav@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ext : P@@ le@@ ase ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many than@@ k you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer trans@@ lation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ late the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?"
We could pay profe@@ ssi@@ onal language trans@@ la@@ tors to trans@@ late the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , it would be extre@@ m@@ ely ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ la@@ ting a tiny , tiny f@@ rac@@ tion of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ is@@ h ."
"W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia exi@@ sts in S@@ pan@@ is@@ h , but it &apos;s very small compa@@ red to the size of Eng@@ lish ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of Eng@@ lish .
"If we wanted to trans@@ late the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ is@@ h , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exp@@ lo@@ ited , out@@ sour@@ cing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hu@@ r@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ sta@@ cles ."
The first one is a lack of bi@@ li@@ ng@@ u@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exi@@ sts 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are bi@@ li@@ ng@@ u@@ al enough to help us trans@@ late .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of moti@@ vation .
How are we going to moti@@ v@@ ate people to actually trans@@ late the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ or@@ ma@@ lly , you have to pay people to do this ."
So how are we going to moti@@ v@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were blo@@ c@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solu@@ tion ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ lation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of lack of bi@@ li@@ ng@@ u@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1.@@ 2 billion people learning a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
"P@@ eople really , really want to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ ced to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for sof@@ t@@ ware to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ site — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo — where the ba@@ sic idea is people learn a new language for free while si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously trans@@ la@@ ting the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple sent@@ ences ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sent@@ ences on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple sent@@ ences along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ late them , and as you see how other people trans@@ late them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ an@@ ced , we give you more and more complex sent@@ ences to trans@@ late ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cra@@ zy thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"Fi@@ rst of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re mos@@ tly done building it , and now we &apos;re te@@ sting it ."
P@@ eople really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the lead@@ ing language learning sof@@ t@@ ware .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo , people are actually learning with real cont@@ ent ."
"As op@@ pos@@ ed to learning with ma@@ de@@ -@@ up sent@@ ences , people are learning with real cont@@ ent , which is in@@ her@@ ently interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more surpri@@ sing@@ ly , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ n@@ ers , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get are as ac@@ cu@@ rate as those of profe@@ ssi@@ onal language trans@@ la@@ tors , which is very surpri@@ sing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a sent@@ ence that was trans@@ lated from G@@ er@@ man into Eng@@ lish .
The top is the G@@ er@@ man .
The middle is an Eng@@ lish trans@@ lation that was done by somebody who was a profe@@ ssi@@ onal Eng@@ lish trans@@ la@@ tor who we paid 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ lation .
"And the bot@@ tom is a trans@@ lation by us@@ ers of D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the site ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perf@@ ect ."
"Now of course , we play a tri@@ ck here to make the trans@@ la@@ tions as good as profe@@ ssi@@ onal language trans@@ la@@ tors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ la@@ tions of mul@@ ti@@ ple begin@@ n@@ ers to get the quality of a single profe@@ ssi@@ onal trans@@ la@@ tor .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ bin@@ ing the trans@@ la@@ tions , the site actually can trans@@ late pretty fast ."
"So let me show you , this is our esti@@ mat@@ es of how fast we could trans@@ late W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia from Eng@@ lish into S@@ pan@@ is@@ h ."
"@@ Re@@ member , this is 50 million dol@@ lar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of value ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ late W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ pan@@ is@@ h , we could do it in five weeks with 10@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive us@@ ers ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive us@@ ers .
"S@@ in@@ ce all the pro@@ jects that my group has worked on so far have g@@ ot@@ ten millions of us@@ ers , we &apos;re h@@ ope@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ late extre@@ m@@ ely fast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about with D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo is I think this provi@@ des a fai@@ r business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The curr@@ ent business model for language education is the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys , and in particular , the stud@@ ent pa@@ ys R@@ os@@ et@@ ta S@@ t@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the curr@@ ent business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely un@@ fai@@ r to@@ wards the poor .
This is to@@ tally bi@@ as@@ ed to@@ wards the ri@@ ch .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating value , you &apos;re trans@@ la@@ ting stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ la@@ tions ."
So this is how we could mon@@ eti@@ ze this .
"S@@ in@@ ce people are cre@@ ating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time ."
"But the ma@@ gi@@ cal thing here is that they &apos;re pa@@ ying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the ni@@ ce thing about D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo is I think it provi@@ des a fai@@ r business model — one that doesn &apos;t di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate bet@@ a , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched this D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ o@@ li@@ ngo is the work of a really a@@ we@@ some team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So than@@ k you .
( Applause )
"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a fan@@ ta@@ stic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ u@@ sual , nam@@ ed A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art ."
"And A@@ li@@ ce was un@@ u@@ sual par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty ra@@ re in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the you@@ ng@@ est F@@ el@@ low to be el@@ ected to the R@@ oy@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans ."
"She was un@@ u@@ sual too because she contin@@ ue@@ d to work after she got mar@@ ri@@ ed , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced and was a single par@@ ent , she contin@@ ue@@ d her medi@@ cal work ."
"And she was un@@ u@@ sual because she was really interested in a new science , the emer@@ g@@ ing field of e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ o@@ logy , the study of patter@@ ns in disease ."
"But like every scienti@@ st , she ap@@ preci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it ."
The hard problem that A@@ li@@ ce ch@@ ose was the ris@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dence of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers .
"M@@ ost disease is cor@@ rela@@ ted with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying se@@ em@@ ed mos@@ tly to come from aff@@ lu@@ ent fami@@ lies ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expla@@ in this an@@ o@@ ma@@ ly ?"
"Now , A@@ li@@ ce had t@@ rou@@ ble getting fund@@ ing for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 p@@ ounds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ at@@ a M@@ em@@ ori@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sh@@ ot at coll@@ ecting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a nee@@ d@@ le in a ha@@ y@@ sta@@ ck sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ at@@ en bo@@ il@@ ed s@@ we@@ ets ?
H@@ ad they con@@ su@@ med co@@ lo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at fish and chi@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ u@@ mb@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ bon cop@@ i@@ ed questi@@ on@@ nai@@ re started to come back , one thing and one thing only ju@@ mp@@ ed out with the sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal c@@ lar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ thers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ yed when pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant ."
Now that fin@@ ding f@@ le@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal wi@@ s@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ v@@ enti@@ onal wi@@ s@@ dom hel@@ d that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a thre@@ sh@@ old ."
"It f@@ le@@ w in the face of conv@@ enti@@ onal wi@@ s@@ dom , which was huge en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m for the co@@ ol new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y machine ."
"And it f@@ le@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who hel@@ ped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art ru@@ shed to publi@@ sh her pre@@ li@@ mi@@ nary fin@@ di@@ ngs in The L@@ an@@ c@@ et in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"P@@ eople got very exc@@ ited , there was talk of the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and A@@ li@@ ce really was in a big hu@@ r@@ ry to try to study all the c@@ ases of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od cancer she could find before they di@@ sap@@ pe@@ a@@ red ."
"In fact , she need not have hu@@ r@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ r@@ iti@@ sh and medi@@ cal — B@@ r@@ iti@@ sh and American medi@@ cal e@@ sta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ments ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed the practi@@ ce of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years A@@ li@@ ce S@@ te@@ w@@ art had a very big fi@@ ght on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a fan@@ ta@@ stic model for thinking ."
"She worked with a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an nam@@ ed G@@ e@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ ale , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that A@@ li@@ ce wasn &apos;t ."
"So , A@@ li@@ ce was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was a rec@@ l@@ use ."
"A@@ li@@ ce was very war@@ m , very em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with her patients ."
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge f@@ ran@@ kly pre@@ fer@@ red numbers to people .
But he said this fan@@ ta@@ stic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r@@ . S@@ te@@ w@@ art wrong . &quot; &quot; He activ@@ ely s@@ ou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fi@@ r@@ ma@@ tion ."
"D@@ i@@ ffer@@ ent ways of looking at her mo@@ d@@ els , at her sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , different ways of c@@ run@@ ching the data in order to di@@ sp@@ ro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating con@@ f@@ lic@@ t around her the@@ ories .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge could give A@@ li@@ ce the con@@ fi@@ dence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a fan@@ ta@@ stic model of col@@ labo@@ ration — thinking par@@ tn@@ ers who are@@ n &apos;t e@@ cho cham@@ b@@ ers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such col@@ labo@@ rat@@ ors ."
A@@ li@@ ce and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge were very good at con@@ f@@ lic@@ t .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ struc@@ tive con@@ f@@ lic@@ t requi@@ re ?
"Well , first of all , it requi@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to resi@@ st the ne@@ uro@@ bio@@ logical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ f@@ er people mos@@ tly like ourselves , and it means we have to se@@ ek out people with different back@@ grou@@ n@@ ds , different di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to eng@@ age with them ."
That requi@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t com@@ mit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ pa@@ red to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ li@@ ce &apos;s d@@ aughter told me that every time A@@ li@@ ce went he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fel@@ low scienti@@ st , they made her think and think and think again ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a fi@@ ght , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it stri@@ k@@ es me that the bi@@ g@@ gest problems we face , many of the bi@@ g@@ gest di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers that we &apos;ve experi@@ en@@ ced , mos@@ tly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organiz@@ ations , some of them bi@@ gger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of aff@@ ecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives ."
So how do organiz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ rai@@ d of con@@ f@@ lic@@ t .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of E@@ ur@@ ope@@ an and American ex@@ ecu@@ ti@@ ves , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ed that they had i@@ ssues or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ rai@@ d to rai@@ se ."
"A@@ f@@ rai@@ d of the con@@ f@@ lic@@ t that that would pro@@ v@@ oke , af@@ rai@@ d to get em@@ bro@@ il@@ ed in ar@@ gu@@ ments that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to l@@ ose ."
E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organiz@@ ations mos@@ tly can &apos;t do what G@@ e@@ or@@ ge and A@@ li@@ ce so tri@@ u@@ m@@ phant@@ ly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organiz@@ ations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mos@@ tly fai@@ l to get the best out of them ."
So how do we devel@@ op the sk@@ il@@ ls that we need ?
"Because it does take sk@@ ill and practi@@ ce , too ."
"If we are@@ n &apos;t going to be af@@ rai@@ d of con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I worked with an ex@@ ecu@@ tive nam@@ ed Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medi@@ cal de@@ vice company ."
And Jo@@ e was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the de@@ vice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too comp@@ lic@@ ated and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity created mar@@ g@@ ins of er@@ ro@@ r that could really hu@@ r@@ t people .
He was af@@ rai@@ d of doing da@@ ma@@ ge to the patients he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organiz@@ ation , no@@ body else se@@ em@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;d look stu@@ pi@@ d .
"But he ke@@ pt wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , Jo@@ e and I found a way for him to rai@@ se his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situ@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
So now Jo@@ e had al@@ lies . They could think together .
"And yes , there was a lot of con@@ f@@ lic@@ t and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ gu@@ ment , but that allow@@ ed everyone around the table to be cre@@ ative , to solve the problem , and to change the de@@ vice ."
"@@ Jo@@ e was what a lot of people might think of as a whi@@ st@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ low@@ er , ex@@ cept that like almost all whi@@ st@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ low@@ ers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was pa@@ ssi@@ o@@ nately de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to the organiz@@ ation and the high@@ er pur@@ pos@@ es that that organiz@@ ation ser@@ ved ."
"But he had been so af@@ rai@@ d of con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , until finally he became more af@@ rai@@ d of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he da@@ red to speak , he disco@@ vered much more inside h@@ im@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever imag@@ ined ."
And his colle@@ ag@@ ues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a lead@@ er .
"So , how do we have these conver@@ sa@@ tions more easi@@ ly and more often ?"
"Well , the Uni@@ versity of D@@ el@@ ft requi@@ res that its P@@ h@@ D students have to sub@@ mit five sta@@ te@@ ments that they &apos;re pre@@ pa@@ red to de@@ f@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the sta@@ te@@ ments are about , what ma@@ tt@@ ers is that the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es are wil@@ ling and able to stand up to au@@ th@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a fan@@ ta@@ stic system , but I think lea@@ ving it to P@@ h@@ D can@@ di@@ dat@@ es is far too few people , and way too late in life ."
"I think we need to be teach@@ ing these sk@@ il@@ ls to kids and a@@ du@@ l@@ ts at every sta@@ ge of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organiz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the bi@@ g@@ gest ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ ne@@ ssed ra@@ rely come from information that is sec@@ re@@ t or hi@@ dd@@ en .
"It comes from information that is fre@@ ely av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble and out there , but that we are wil@@ l@@ fully bl@@ ind to , because we can &apos;t han@@ d@@ le , don &apos;t want to han@@ d@@ le , the con@@ f@@ lic@@ t that it pro@@ v@@ ok@@ es ."
"But when we d@@ are to bre@@ ak that sil@@ ence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , we ena@@ ble ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ pen information is fan@@ ta@@ stic , open net@@ works are ess@@ ential ."
But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we devel@@ op the sk@@ il@@ ls and the ha@@ bit and the tal@@ ent and the mo@@ ral coura@@ ge to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

"T@@ wo years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED sta@@ ge in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I sp@@ oke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my p@@ rou@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in Ma@@ la@@ wi ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"O@@ n the sta@@ ge that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"My Eng@@ lish lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by so many a@@ z@@ u@@ ng@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )@@ "
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll si@@ st@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of poor far@@ m@@ ers ."
"@@ Li@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w mai@@ ze ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ en@@ ced an a@@ w@@ ful f@@ am@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all Ma@@ la@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ low@@ s of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pa@@ sses through our bo@@ dies .
We d@@ rop down to nothing .
"In Ma@@ la@@ wi , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to pay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hu@@ ng@@ er , I was for@@ ced to d@@ rop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ cei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ bra@@ ry .
"I read books , science books , e@@ specially physi@@ cs ."
I couldn &apos;t read Eng@@ lish that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ram@@ s and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll could pu@@ m@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ u@@ m@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against hu@@ ng@@ er , which we were experi@@ en@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ rap y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ zy ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ pes ."
"@@ U@@ sing a bi@@ cy@@ cle f@@ r@@ ame and an old bi@@ cy@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ches , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed after an electri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ ue@@ ues of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ port@@ ers came too , which le@@ ad to blo@@ gg@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an ai@@ r@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on sta@@ ge that day in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , my Eng@@ lish lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afri@@ c@@ ans , and the poor who are stru@@ gg@@ ling with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
God b@@ less .
Ma@@ ybe one day you will wat@@ ch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , tru@@ st yourself and believe ."

"In the 19@@ 8@@ 0s in the commun@@ i@@ st E@@ a@@ ster@@ n G@@ er@@ many , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government ."
You had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple s@@ he@@ et of t@@ ext out of the ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er .
And this was done so the government could tra@@ ck where t@@ ext was coming from .
"If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tra@@ ck down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ech ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a col@@ or la@@ ser prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or la@@ ser prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and pr@@ int a pa@@ ge , that pa@@ ge will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single pa@@ ge in a patter@@ n which makes the pa@@ ge uni@@ que to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body seems to be making a fu@@ ss about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own governm@@ ents are using technology against us , the c@@ itiz@@ ens ."
And this is one of the main three sources of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the atta@@ cks based on the atta@@ ck@@ ers ."
We have three main grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls .
"@@ Li@@ ke here , we have M@@ r@@ . D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine ."
And the moti@@ ves of on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line atta@@ cks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al c@@ ases of mil@@ li@@ o@@ nai@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ ti@@ mil@@ li@@ o@@ nai@@ res , who made money with their atta@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"These guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ leg@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ count@@ s while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to coll@@ ect our cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ op@@ ping from an inf@@ ected computer ."
"The U.S@@ . S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ vice , two months ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ wi@@ ss b@@ ank ac@@ cou@@ nt of M@@ r@@ . S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that b@@ ank ac@@ cou@@ nt had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S@@ . dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ."
M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain h@@ im@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I c@@ lai@@ m it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of atta@@ ck@@ ers that we are wat@@ ching today are not moti@@ v@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re moti@@ v@@ ated by something else — moti@@ v@@ ated by prot@@ est@@ s , moti@@ v@@ ated by an op@@ ini@@ on , moti@@ v@@ ated by the la@@ u@@ gh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like A@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or pla@@ y@@ er in the field of on@@ line atta@@ cks .
"So those are the three main atta@@ ck@@ ers : cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like A@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are nation sta@@ t@@ es , governm@@ ents doing the atta@@ cks ."
And then we look at c@@ ases like what happened in D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ o@@ ta@@ r .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when governm@@ ents atta@@ ck against their own c@@ itiz@@ ens .
"D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ o@@ ta@@ r is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were ha@@ c@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body b@@ rok@@ e in and they ha@@ c@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a me@@ et@@ ing with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ pre@@ sen@@ tati@@ ves , I asked one of the lead@@ ers of the team whether he found pla@@ u@@ sible that people died because of the D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ o@@ ta@@ r ha@@ ck ."
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
Well D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ o@@ ta@@ r is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They s@@ ell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a we@@ b@@ site that has h@@ tt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted ser@@ vices , ser@@ vices like G@@ mai@@ l ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mai@@ l or one of their comp@@ et@@ it@@ ors , but these ser@@ vices are e@@ specially popu@@ lar in to@@ ta@@ lit@@ ari@@ an sta@@ t@@ es like I@@ ran , where di@@ ssi@@ d@@ ents use fore@@ ig@@ n ser@@ vices like G@@ mai@@ l because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local ser@@ vices and they are en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L conn@@ ec@@ tions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their dis@@ cu@@ ssi@@ ons ."
E@@ x@@ cept they can if they ha@@ ck into a fore@@ ig@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and is@@ sue ro@@ g@@ ue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ i@@ gi@@ N@@ o@@ ta@@ r .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ y@@ pti@@ an sec@@ re@@ t poli@@ ce in A@@ pri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pap@@ ers ."
"A@@ mong those pap@@ ers , was this bin@@ der ent@@ it@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were not@@ es from a company based in G@@ er@@ many which had so@@ ld the E@@ g@@ y@@ pti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communic@@ ation of the c@@ itiz@@ ens of the country ."
"They had so@@ ld this to@@ ol for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 E@@ uro@@ s to the E@@ g@@ y@@ pti@@ an government ."
The company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ est@@ er@@ n governm@@ ents are provi@@ ding to@@ ta@@ lit@@ ari@@ an governm@@ ents with tools to do this against their own c@@ itiz@@ ens .
But W@@ est@@ er@@ n governm@@ ents are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called S@@ ta@@ te T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate their own c@@ itiz@@ ens ."
"If you are a su@@ sp@@ ect in a cri@@ mi@@ nal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be tap@@ ped ."
"But today , it goes be@@ yon@@ d that ."
They will tap your Internet conn@@ ection .
"They will even use tools like S@@ ta@@ te T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a t@@ ro@@ j@@ an , which ena@@ b@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communic@@ ation , to list@@ en to your on@@ line dis@@ cu@@ ssi@@ ons , to coll@@ ect your pa@@ ss@@ words ."
"Now when we think de@@ ep@@ er about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that s@@ ounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really aff@@ ect me because I &apos;m a leg@@ al c@@ itiz@@ en ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ gu@@ ment , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ vac@@ y is imp@@ li@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ vac@@ y is not up for dis@@ cu@@ ssion .
This is not a question between pri@@ vac@@ y against sec@@ ur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of fre@@ e@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tru@@ st our governm@@ ents right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tru@@ st , do we b@@ lin@@ dly tru@@ st , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying mun@@ dan@@ e s@@ ounds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pa@@ ssion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science offi@@ ci@@ ally has no op@@ ini@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to value ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ st@@ it@@ utes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ g@@ ue that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ pa@@ ration between science and human val@@ ues is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a dang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion for mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues see@@ m to bel@@ ong to different s@@ ph@@ er@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atu@@ res .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have eth@@ ical ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compa@@ ssion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ s@@ ects , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ pos@@ ed to a great@@ er range of pot@@ ential happ@@ ine@@ ss and su@@ ffer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to noti@@ ce here is that this is a fac@@ tual c@@ lai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mi@@ s@@ con@@ st@@ rue@@ d the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ s@@ ects ."
"And there &apos;s no noti@@ on , no ver@@ sion of human mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from reli@@ gi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rela@@ te to con@@ diti@@ ons after death — either to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ ine@@ ss with God or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of su@@ ffer@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after death is itself a fac@@ tual c@@ lai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the con@@ diti@@ ons of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fai@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where st@@ rang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ labo@@ ration , where people are mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed in@@ di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ cei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answ@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ rob@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l eye , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ rob@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human commun@@ ities fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity rela@@ t@@ es to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our situ@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and political ar@@ rang@@ em@@ ents ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — wha@@ tever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ i@@ ci@@ de b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vi@@ r@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his perso@@ na@@ l@@ ity — his rather un@@ for@@ tu@@ nate perso@@ na@@ l@@ ity — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by changing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wha@@ tever cul@@ tural vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the cont@@ ext of a ma@@ tur@@ ing science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that value &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mo@@ ral lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atu@@ res , both personal and coll@@ ective ."
"And one thing to noti@@ ce is that perhaps there are sta@@ t@@ es of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we ra@@ rely access , that few people access ."
And these a@@ wai@@ t our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these sta@@ t@@ es can be ap@@ prop@@ ri@@ ately called my@@ sti@@ cal or spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other sta@@ t@@ es that we can &apos;t access because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could access them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic answ@@ ers to every con@@ cei@@ v@@ able mo@@ ral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nu@@ clear fac@@ il@@ ities , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being then they do have answ@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong answ@@ ers to the question of how humans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity , and will change our exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stance , there are 2@@ 1 sta@@ t@@ es in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the cla@@ ss@@ room is leg@@ al , where it is leg@@ al for a teach@@ er to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and rais@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ st@@ ers and even bre@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hundreds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ den@@ tally , are sub@@ j@@ ected to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts , I think , will fai@@ l to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut .
And the ra@@ ti@@ ona@@ le for this behavior is exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly reli@@ gi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we sp@@ oi@@ l the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , to sub@@ ject children to pai@@ n and viol@@ ence and public hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation as a way of en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing heal@@ thy emoti@@ onal develop@@ ment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it ma@@ tt@@ ers ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the noti@@ on of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ st@@ rue@@ d ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ j@@ ective noti@@ on of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from Mi@@ cha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
W@@ hen this sta@@ tue was car@@ ved the average life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ omes in such a way that not being able to run a ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
P@@ eople will s@@ end you do@@ na@@ tions when you &apos;re in that con@@ dition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ oti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vi@@ sion , does not make it vac@@ u@@ ous ."
The di@@ st@@ inc@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as clear and con@@ sequ@@ ential as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to noti@@ ce is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mo@@ ral lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape : There may be e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent ways to organiz@@ e a human society so as to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an ob@@ j@@ ective mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be te@@ mp@@ ted to ar@@ g@@ ue to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a range of materi@@ als that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess a clear di@@ st@@ inc@@ tion between food and po@@ i@@ son .
"The fact that there are many right answ@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not te@@ mp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tr@@ ition ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univer@@ s@@ al mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity would requi@@ re mo@@ ral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mo@@ ral truth ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the game of che@@ ss ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good che@@ ss , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ ue@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ mit@@ s some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when los@@ ing your Q@@ ue@@ en is a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , che@@ ss is a do@@ main of perf@@ ect ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this bri@@ ngs us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mo@@ ral s@@ ph@@ ere ."
C@@ on@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the pos@@ ition , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the p@@ rou@@ d d@@ eni@@ z@@ ens of an an@@ cient culture are wrong to for@@ ce their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with leng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row bat@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ t@@ end that we know so little about human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a practi@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry we@@ aring of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar wha@@ tever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry mean in a community where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first im@@ pu@@ l@@ se , rather often , is to mu@@ r@@ der her out of sha@@ me ?"
"@@ Just let that fact det@@ o@@ nate in your brain for a min@@ ute : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perf@@ ect solu@@ tion in our own society ."
"For in@@ stance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ stand almost any@@ where in the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zed world ."
"Now , g@@ r@@ ant@@ ed , for many men it may requi@@ re a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ective mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the perf@@ ect ex@@ pre@@ ssion of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical bal@@ ance with resp@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like you@@ th and be@@ au@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the opti@@ mal environment in which to rai@@ se our children ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the sp@@ ec@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ mes that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mo@@ ral lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape ."
But the thing to noti@@ ce is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ron@@ y , from my per@@ sp@@ ective , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answ@@ ers to mo@@ ral questions are reli@@ gi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ g@@ ues of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right answ@@ ers to mo@@ ral questions because they got these answ@@ ers from a voice in a whi@@ r@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent anal@@ y@@ sis of the cau@@ ses and con@@ dition of human and anima@@ l w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce of reli@@ gi@@ on as a l@@ ens through which most people view mo@@ ral questions has se@@ pa@@ rated most mo@@ ral talk from real questions of human and anima@@ l su@@ ffer@@ ing ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like ga@@ y mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nu@@ clear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely con@@ sequ@@ ential is@@ sue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ g@@ ues are right about one thing : We need a univer@@ s@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to noti@@ ce is that we do something different when talking about mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity — e@@ specially sec@@ u@@ lar , ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic , scienti@@ st ty@@ pes ."
W@@ hen talking about mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity we value differ@@ ences of op@@ ini@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stance the D@@ a@@ lai L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ dit@@ ating on compa@@ ssion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l comp@@ on@@ ent of human happ@@ ine@@ ss ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and t@@ or@@ tur@@ ing and kil@@ ling young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ ini@@ on about how to pro@@ f@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ est@@ er@@ n int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als look at this situ@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ a@@ lai L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ mit@@ s of a real ar@@ gu@@ ment that pot@@ entially fal@@ ls within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ co@@ late , he lik@@ es v@@ an@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ oti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a st@@ ring the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I show@@ ed up at a physi@@ cs con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ so@@ nate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ ci@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand st@@ ring theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of st@@ ring theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any st@@ ring theory c@@ lu@@ b that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ ini@@ ons must be exc@@ lu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a do@@ main of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowledge to cou@@ nt .
"@@ How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed ourselves that in the mo@@ ral s@@ ph@@ ere there is no such thing as mo@@ ral exper@@ ti@@ se , or mo@@ ral tal@@ ent , or mo@@ ral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed our@@ sel@@ ve@@ s@@ "
that every op@@ ini@@ on has to cou@@ nt ? How have we conv@@ inc@@ ed ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physi@@ cs that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ mit that there are right and wrong answ@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing , and mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity rela@@ t@@ es to that do@@ main of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ f@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to nee@@ d@@ less human su@@ ffer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mo@@ ra@@ l@@ ity .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between na@@ tions mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ ented ; it will always be easi@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently obvi@@ ous that we can no more resp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in noti@@ ons of human w@@ ell@@ -@@ being than we can resp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the noti@@ ons about how disease sp@@ re@@ ads , or in the sa@@ f@@ ety stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ di@@ ngs and ai@@ r@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must conver@@ ge on the answ@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ mit that these questions have answ@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble material there ."
"W@@ he@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , he@@ aring some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ ang@@ u@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ ssed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ ok@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a cel@@ e@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ male speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical view — &quot; that male lu@@ st is not to be tru@@ sted . &quot;"
"I mean , can you eng@@ age in a conver@@ sation with that kind of woman without se@@ em@@ ing kind of cul@@ tural im@@ per@@ i@@ ali@@ st ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ lo@@ ck ti@@ c@@ king , but the question is : What is v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry in a cont@@ ext where men have certain exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ ny hat , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ ri@@ ly do wha@@ tever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are pla@@ ced under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , e@@ specially when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ aring a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mo@@ ral pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ lo@@ ck 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ cing mo@@ ral pro@@ gre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mit that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ tai@@ l , then you have to ad@@ mit that we are going to understand all of the pos@@ itive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ al@@ ities of ourselves in much great@@ er de@@ tai@@ l ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand pos@@ itive social emoti@@ on like em@@ pa@@ thy and compa@@ ssion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ coura@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and w@@ ell@@ -@@ educ@@ ated in the cont@@ ext of men who do de@@ si@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F g@@ r@@ ant to know that compu@@ l@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right answ@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the resul@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ pa@@ red to shi@@ ft your inst@@ inc@@ tive curr@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these i@@ ssues ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ du@@ l@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ext of a tru@@ ly d@@ el@@ u@@ si@@ onal belie@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my ga@@ y son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I chop@@ ped his head off . And that was the most compa@@ ssi@@ o@@ nate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts ali@@ g@@ ned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emoti@@ on of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger cont@@ ext ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ec@@ sta@@ s@@ y and then b@@ low@@ ing h@@ im@@ self up on a bu@@ s ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a conver@@ sation I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an hon@@ or . Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Ch@@ ris and A@@ my in particular ."
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ le@@ pt in weeks .
"N@@ ei@@ l and I were sitting there com@@ par@@ ing how little we &apos;ve s@@ le@@ pt in anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ v@@ ous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organiz@@ ation called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might jo@@ in in and do simi@@ lar things ."
"B@@ ac@@ k in about 2@@ 000 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ is@@ h my first book , I was wan@@ der@@ ing around da@@ zed every day because I wr@@ ote from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
"I had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that I li@@ ved in , P@@ ar@@ k S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of writ@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ ita ra@@ ti@@ o of writ@@ ers to nor@@ mal people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of teach@@ ers ."
"My mo@@ m was a teach@@ er , my si@@ ster became a teach@@ er and after colle@@ ge so many of my friends went into teach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always he@@ aring them talk about their lives and how inspi@@ ring they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and con@@ st@@ antly inspi@@ ring people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the stru@@ gg@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teach@@ ing in city scho@@ ols were having t@@ rou@@ ble with their students ke@@ ep@@ ing up at gra@@ de level , in their read@@ ing and wr@@ iting in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds where Eng@@ lish isn &apos;t sp@@ ok@@ en in the home , where a lot of them have different speci@@ al needs , learning dis@@ abil@@ ities . And of course they &apos;re working in scho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fund@@ ed ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ dies , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention , more hours , more exper@@ ti@@ se from people that have sk@@ il@@ ls in Eng@@ lish and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five cla@@ sses of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day ."
How can we possi@@ bly give each stud@@ ent even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to great@@ ly mul@@ tip@@ ly the work@@ week and cl@@ one the teach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this ma@@ ssive group of people I knew : writ@@ ers , e@@ dit@@ ors , jour@@ na@@ li@@ sts , gra@@ du@@ ate students , as@@ si@@ st@@ ant profe@@ ss@@ ors , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble dai@@ ly hours and an inter@@ est in the Eng@@ lish word — I hope to have an inter@@ est in the Eng@@ lish language , but I &apos;m not speak@@ ing it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That c@@ lo@@ ck has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an inter@@ est in the pri@@ ma@@ cy of the writ@@ ten word in terms of nu@@ r@@ tur@@ ing a demo@@ c@@ rac@@ y , nu@@ r@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their inter@@ est , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two commun@@ ities together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , we r@@ ented this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ uar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ shed t@@ wi@@ ce or three times a year , and a few other ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines — we were going to move it into an offi@@ ce for the first time ."
It used to be in my kit@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an offi@@ ce , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writ@@ ers and e@@ dit@@ ors and everybody — sort of a wr@@ iting community — coming into the offi@@ ce every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tr@@ a help on their writ@@ ten h@@ ome@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two commun@@ ities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on wha@@ tever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or wha@@ tever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
"So , we had this place , we r@@ ented it , the lan@@ d@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this mu@@ ral , that &apos;s a Ch@@ ris W@@ are mu@@ ral , that basically expla@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in mu@@ ral form — it takes a long time to di@@ gest and you have to stand in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we r@@ ented this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cept the lan@@ d@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ on@@ ed for re@@ tai@@ l ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ta s@@ ell something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ha ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly to s@@ ell , but we did all the nec@@ ess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ i@@ ght room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors bel@@ ow , ac@@ ou@@ stic ti@@ le cei@@ li@@ ngs and f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent li@@ ghts ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ o@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ wa@@ shed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look — while we were ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hu@@ ll of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should s@@ ell supp@@ lies to the working bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody la@@ u@@ gh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s s@@ ell pi@@ rate supp@@ lies . &quot; &quot; This is the pi@@ rate supp@@ ly st@@ ore .
"You see , this is sort of a sk@@ et@@ ch I did on a nap@@ k@@ in ."
"A great car@@ p@@ ent@@ er built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pi@@ rate supp@@ l@@ y-@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks so@@ ld by the fo@@ ot and we have supp@@ lies to com@@ b@@ at s@@ cur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all han@@ d@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"@@ U@@ p at the top , you see the e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch di@@ sp@@ la@@ y , which is the black col@@ u@@ m@@ n there for every@@ day use for your e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ st@@ el and other col@@ ors for ste@@ pp@@ ing out at night — speci@@ al oc@@ ca@@ sions , b@@ ar mit@@ z@@ v@@ a@@ h@@ s and wha@@ tever ."
So we open@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ a@@ su@@ res that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ pla@@ c@@ ement eyes in case you l@@ ose one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ racti@@ cal J@@ ok@@ ing with P@@ i@@ rat@@ es . &quot;
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re read@@ ing the sig@@ n , we pu@@ ll a ro@@ pe behind the count@@ er and eight mo@@ p he@@ ads d@@ rop on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that d@@ rop@@ s on people &apos;s he@@ ads .
"It became mo@@ p he@@ ads . And this is the fish the@@ at@@ er , which is just a s@@ al@@ t@@ water tan@@ k with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er ."
"So right there is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s offi@@ ces , where all of us would be working on the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine and book e@@ dit@@ ing and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we open@@ ed up , we spent months and months ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place ."
"We had ta@@ b@@ les , chai@@ r@@ s , comp@@ ut@@ ers , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ c@@ om au@@ c@@ tion at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I b@@ ou@@ ght 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a st@@ rok@@ e of a pa@@ ddle .
"A@@ ny@@ way , we b@@ ou@@ ght &apos; e@@ m , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writ@@ ers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch bo@@ ard out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ ut@@ or@@ ing for Y@@ our Eng@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ Re@@ lated and W@@ r@@ iti@@ ng@@ -@@ Re@@ lated N@@ e@@ e@@ ds — Just C@@ ome In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the g@@ ates , they &apos;re g@@ on@@ na love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wa@@ ited , we sat at the ta@@ b@@ les , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited ."
"And everybody was bec@@ om@@ ing very dis@@ coura@@ g@@ ed because it was weeks and weeks that we wa@@ ited , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tru@@ st g@@ ap , because we were oper@@ ating behind a pi@@ rate supp@@ ly st@@ ore . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed a woman nam@@ ed N@@ in@@ ev@@ e@@ h C@@ ali@@ gar@@ i , a long@@ time S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o educ@@ at@@ or — she was teach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience nec@@ ess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teach@@ ers and community me@@ mbers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od — I conv@@ inc@@ ed her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was teach@@ ing ."
She took over as ex@@ ecu@@ tive direc@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ ads with the teach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so sudd@@ en@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one ra@@ ti@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention , a stud@@ ent can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , Eng@@ lish is not sp@@ ok@@ en in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ou@@ ght in a B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey au@@ c@@ tion right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et within those few blo@@ cks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or wha@@ tever , actually run@@ ning to this space , which is very st@@ range , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no sti@@ g@@ ma ."
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ ent@@ er@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s@@ -@@ T@@ ha@@ t-@@ N@@ e@@ e@@ d-@@ M@@ o@@ re@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"Fi@@ rst of all , it was a pi@@ rate supp@@ ly st@@ ore , which is in@@ san@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ dly , there &apos;s a publi@@ shing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same ta@@ b@@ les very often , and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , comp@@ ut@@ er@@ -@@ nex@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er — publi@@ shing cent@@ er , is what we called it — and a wr@@ iting cent@@ er ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school stud@@ ent actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no sti@@ g@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . They &apos;re mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing their behavior .
"These a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their field ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these a@@ du@@ l@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ pol@@ li@@ nation . The only problem , e@@ specially for the a@@ du@@ l@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly b@@ ou@@ ght into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ ith like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ i@@ shing their h@@ ome@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed . They don &apos;t sta@@ ll ."
They don &apos;t do their h@@ ome@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allow@@ ed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A bun@@ ch of happy fami@@ lies in a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a happy community .
A bun@@ ch of happy commun@@ ities ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is h@@ ome@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention ."
"So we started off with about 12 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hund@@ red ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our ros@@ ter ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , next to one stud@@ ent , con@@ cent@@ rated attention , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thou@@ ghts and their self-@@ ex@@ pre@@ ssion , is going to be absol@@ utely trans@@ forma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so fast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started bri@@ ng@@ ing in cla@@ sses during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a field tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the cla@@ sses getting way too exc@@ ited about wr@@ iting .
"You just point a cam@@ era at a cla@@ ss , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the books that they do .
"N@@ oti@@ ce the tit@@ le of the book , &quot; The B@@ o@@ ok That W@@ as N@@ ever Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book nam@@ ed C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , mean@@ while , there &apos;s an a@@ du@@ l@@ t in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely seri@@ ously , which b@@ low@@ s their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sh@@ ot of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The teach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to teach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , completely ma@@ l@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The teach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most u@@ se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the scho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are bri@@ ng@@ ing them in , or are@@ n &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor ros@@ ter ."
"@@ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teach@@ er will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ un@@ days ."
"We &apos;re working on our colle@@ ge e@@ s@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wi@@ re : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
Wh@@ oe@@ ver can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the cla@@ ss .
"The teach@@ er tel@@ ls them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ ining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the teach@@ er &apos;s gu@@ i@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the b@@ run@@ t of what we do is , people going st@@ rai@@ ght from their work@@ place , st@@ rai@@ ght from home , st@@ rai@@ ght into the cla@@ ss@@ room and working direc@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a cla@@ ss@@ room and you can sta@@ ff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ver@@ et@@ t Mi@@ ddle S@@ cho@@ ol W@@ rit@@ ers &apos; R@@ o@@ om , where we dec@@ o@@ rated it in bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ bra@@ ry . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ spap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ igh@@ t-@@ U@@ p N@@ e@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an ong@@ o@@ ing col@@ u@@ m@@ n from Ma@@ y@@ or G@@ av@@ in N@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ om in both langu@@ ag@@ es — Eng@@ lish and S@@ pan@@ is@@ h ."
"So then one day Is@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de wr@@ ote to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to write about how to achi@@ e@@ ve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ sha@@ ll H@@ i@@ gh S@@ cho@@ ol , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sig@@ nm@@ ent to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Is@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de is going to read all your e@@ s@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to publi@@ sh them in a book .
She &apos;s going to sp@@ on@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in pap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble in all the bo@@ ok@@ sto@@ res in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a and throu@@ gh@@ out the world , on A@@ ma@@ z@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside au@@ dience , there was Is@@ ab@@ el Al@@ l@@ en@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a ser@@ ies of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an sp@@ on@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I Mi@@ ght G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an ong@@ o@@ ing thing . M@@ ore and more books .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can di@@ min@@ is@@ h what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ o@@ red their words , hon@@ o@@ red their thou@@ ghts with hundreds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this attention that we give to their thou@@ ghts ."
"And once they achi@@ e@@ ve that level , once they &apos;ve writ@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s absol@@ utely trans@@ forma@@ tive .
And so then they &apos;re all so@@ ld in the st@@ ore . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We s@@ ell all the stud@@ ent books .
"W@@ here else would you put them , right ?"
"So we s@@ ell &apos; e@@ m , and then something we@@ i@@ rd had been happening with the sto@@ res . The st@@ ore , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the st@@ ore actually made money ."
So it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the pi@@ rate movi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was pa@@ ying the r@@ ent , pa@@ ying a fu@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ time sta@@ ff member there ."
There &apos;s the ocean ma@@ ps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ at@@ e@@ way to the community .
"P@@ eople would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ yon@@ d — there &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally a little cha@@ in there — right be@@ yon@@ d , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a field tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ op@@ ping , and they might be more likely to bu@@ y some lar@@ d , or mil@@ let for their par@@ rot , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prot@@ ec@@ tor for ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we s@@ ell ."
So the st@@ ore actually did really well .
"But it brought in so many people — teach@@ ers , don@@ ors , v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a non@@ -@@ pro@@ fit bu@@ ri@@ ed , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ nt@@ own . It was right in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ i@@ rd , happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been for@@ mer educ@@ at@@ ors or w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be educ@@ at@@ ors , so they com@@ bin@@ ed with a lot of local desig@@ n@@ ers , local writ@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to s@@ ell pi@@ rate supp@@ lies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cri@@ me@@ -@@ fi@@ gh@@ ting community in New York , they open@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n Su@@ per@@ her@@ o Su@@ pp@@ ly C@@ om@@ pan@@ y ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ y@@ s@@ mit@@ h &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every ser@@ vice they &apos;ve ever o@@ ffer@@ ed , you know , all over there ."
"So they open@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ os@@ t@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the supp@@ lies in kind of ba@@ sic form ."
These are all han@@ d@@ made .
"These are all sort of re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ed other produc@@ ts , or wha@@ tever ."
All the p@@ ac@@ ka@@ g@@ ing is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the vil@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the offi@@ ce ."
"This is a little v@@ au@@ l@@ t — you have to put your produc@@ t in there , it goes up an electri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the count@@ er tel@@ ls you that you have to rec@@ ite the v@@ ow of her@@ oi@@ sm , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it limit@@ s , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ so@@ nally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all han@@ d@@ made .
This is a sec@@ re@@ t id@@ ent@@ ity kit .
"If you want to take on the id@@ ent@@ ity of S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one , one American fe@@ male mar@@ ket@@ ing ex@@ ecu@@ tive from H@@ o@@ b@@ ok@@ en , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full d@@ os@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ ery where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded st@@ ep@@ s and then we turn on three hy@@ dra@@ u@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is bun@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the sec@@ re@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ low@@ ly op@@ ens ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the g@@ rap@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ oks .
It op@@ ens and then this is the tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing cent@@ er in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full eff@@ ect !
"But this is — I just want to em@@ pha@@ size — lo@@ cally fund@@ ed , lo@@ cally built ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ n@@ ers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ bon@@ o ."
"I just came and vi@@ sit@@ ed and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or wha@@ tever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ t@@ or@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bu@@ s@@ y . S@@ ame prin@@ ci@@ ples : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one attention , complet@@ e de@@ v@@ oti@@ on to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less opti@@ mi@@ sm and sort of a possi@@ bility of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ wit@@ ch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their he@@ ads when they walk through those 18 fe@@ et of this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re st@@ ore , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der on ta@@ b@@ les , pen@@ c@@ il@@ s and pap@@ ers , wha@@ tever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ ha@@ led H@@ am@@ d@@ an ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ dic@@ ted to video g@@ am@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ouldn &apos;t con@@ cent@@ rate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this con@@ cent@@ rated attention .
And he couldn &apos;t e@@ sc@@ ape it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wr@@ iting . He would fin@@ is@@ h his h@@ ome@@ work early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ i@@ shing his h@@ ome@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it chec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to achi@@ e@@ ve the next thing and be pre@@ pa@@ red for school the next day ."
"So he got ho@@ ok@@ ed on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ shed in five books .
"He co@@ -@@ wr@@ ote a mo@@ c@@ ku@@ men@@ ta@@ ry about fai@@ led super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; Su@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ B@@ e@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wr@@ ote a ser@@ ies on &quot; &quot; P@@ eng@@ u@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fi@@ gh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — pe@@ ng@@ u@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ ou@@ d just a few weeks ago to 500 people at S@@ y@@ m@@ phon@@ y S@@ p@@ ace , at a bene@@ fit for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ ang@@ el@@ ical about it . He bri@@ ngs his cou@@ sin@@ s in now .
There &apos;s four family me@@ mbers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ cho P@@ ar@@ k T@@ i@@ me T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time tra@@ vel@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
Le@@ e@@ ches . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ lu@@ r@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ac@@ k Y@@ est@@ er@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A@@ ny@@ way . So I &apos;m going to ju@@ m@@ p a@@ head .
"These are sp@@ ac@@ es that are only af@@ fi@@ li@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Wor@@ d S@@ t@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ field , M@@ as@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ p@@ ot in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati ; Y@@ outh S@@ pe@@ ak@@ s , S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , which inspi@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o S@@ t@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ is@@ h — is that ok@@ ay ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a min@@ ute . So , the TED W@@ is@@ h : I wi@@ sh that you — you perso@@ nally and every cre@@ ative individu@@ al and organiz@@ ation you know — will find a way to direc@@ tly eng@@ age with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got inv@@ olved , so that within a year we have a thou@@ sand exam@@ ples — a thou@@ sand ! — of trans@@ forma@@ tive par@@ tn@@ er@@ shi@@ ps ."
P@@ ro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspi@@ re others on the we@@ b@@ site ."
We created a we@@ b@@ site .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ wit@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ de@@ es of this con@@ fer@@ ence will u@@ sh@@ er in a new era of parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion in our public scho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in par@@ tn@@ ering your inno@@ v@@ ative spi@@ rit and exper@@ ti@@ se with that of inno@@ v@@ ative educ@@ at@@ ors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be u@@ se@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ sul@@ t with the teach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , they did this phen@@ om@@ ena@@ l job ."
"This we@@ b@@ site is already up , it &apos;s already got a bun@@ ch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ pon a S@@ cho@@ ol , &quot; &quot; which is a great tit@@ le , I think ."
"This site will do@@ cu@@ ment every story , every project that comes out of this con@@ fer@@ ence and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ site , you see a bun@@ ch of ideas you can be inspi@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own pro@@ jects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . So , vi@@ sit the site ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our direc@@ tor of national pro@@ gram@@ s . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You e@@ mai@@ l him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possi@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you inspi@@ red and get you going and gu@@ i@@ de you through the process so that you can aff@@ ect change .
And it can be fu@@ n ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be ster@@ i@@ le . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ ti@@ cally un@@ t@@ ena@@ ble .
You can do and use the sk@@ il@@ ls that you have .
The scho@@ ols need you . The teach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tual person : your physical per@@ son@@ ho@@ od and your open min@@ ds and open e@@ ars and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less compa@@ ssion , sitting next to them , list@@ ening and no@@ d@@ ding and asking questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how smar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can sh@@ ine that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
"So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se man comes up to you and says , &quot; E@@ x@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , well , this is O@@ ak S@@ tre@@ et , that &apos;s E@@ l@@ m S@@ tre@@ et ."
"This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of that blo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blo@@ cks don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
"S@@ tre@@ ets have nam@@ es ; blo@@ cks are just the un@@ nam@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ es in between stre@@ ets . &quot; &quot; He lea@@ ves , a little con@@ fu@@ sed and di@@ sap@@ poin@@ ted ."
"So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in J@@ ap@@ an , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; E@@ x@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
B@@ lo@@ cks have nam@@ es .
"@@ Just look at Goog@@ le M@@ ap@@ s here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 14 , 15 , 16 , 1@@ 7 , 18 , 1@@ 9 ."
"A@@ ll of these blo@@ cks have nam@@ es , and the stre@@ ets are just the un@@ nam@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ es in between the blo@@ cks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ i@@ stri@@ ct E@@ i@@ ght ."
"There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I not@@ ic@@ ed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first house ever built on a blo@@ ck is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
"Th@@ i@@ rd is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to realize as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you pay them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to pay them because they fai@@ led at their job . They get ri@@ ch when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not si@@ ck ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ si@@ cal ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est Afri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ ra@@ se , like the per@@ i@@ od at the end of a sent@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ ra@@ sing , but the way they cou@@ nt off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this map is also ac@@ cu@@ rate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that wha@@ tever true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."

D@@ om@@ o ari@@ ga@@ to go@@ z@@ ai@@ ma@@ sh@@ ita .
"So I started working with re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es because I wanted to make a difference , and making a difference star@@ ts with telling their stories ."
"So when I me@@ et re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , I always ask them questions ."
Wh@@ o b@@ om@@ bed your house ?
Wh@@ o kil@@ led your son ?
D@@ id the rest of your family make it out ali@@ ve ?
How are you cop@@ ing in your life in exi@@ le ?
"But there &apos;s one question that always seems to me to be most re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , and that is : What did you take ?"
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ om@@ b@@ s were exp@@ lo@@ ding in your to@@ wn , and the ar@@ med g@@ ang@@ s were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ rian re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t he@@ sit@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent dang@@ er .
"He took his high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a because my life depen@@ ded on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"O@@ n his way to school , he would do@@ dge s@@ ni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is cla@@ ss@@ room sometimes sho@@ ok with the sound of b@@ om@@ b@@ s and sh@@ el@@ ling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every mor@@ ning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , p@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he in@@ si@@ sted , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ rai@@ d , but our det@@ er@@ mi@@ nation to gra@@ du@@ ate is st@@ rong@@ er than our fear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terri@@ ble news ."
"H@@ any &apos;s a@@ un@@ t , his un@@ cle and his cou@@ sin were mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed in their h@@ omes for re@@ fu@@ sing to leave their house ."
The@@ ir th@@ ro@@ ats were s@@ l@@ it .
It was time to f@@ le@@ e .
"They left that day , right away , in their car , H@@ any hi@@ dd@@ en in the back because they were fac@@ ing chec@@ k@@ poin@@ ts of m@@ ena@@ cing sol@@ di@@ ers ."
"And they would c@@ ross the bor@@ der into Le@@ ban@@ on , where they would find pe@@ ace ."
But they would beg@@ in a life of g@@ rue@@ ling har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y .
"They had no choice but to build a sha@@ ck on the side of a mu@@ d@@ dy field , and this is H@@ any &apos;s bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f , who pla@@ ys outside ."
"And that day , they jo@@ ined the bi@@ g@@ gest population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , Le@@ ban@@ on , that is tiny ."
"It only has four million c@@ itiz@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ rian re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a vil@@ la@@ ge that is not h@@ ost to S@@ y@@ rian re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and human@@ ity that is re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble .
"Th@@ ink about it this way , prop@@ or@@ ti@@ o@@ nately ."
"It would be as if the entire population of G@@ er@@ many , 80 million people , would f@@ le@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"H@@ al@@ f of the entire population of S@@ y@@ ri@@ a is now u@@ pro@@ ot@@ ed , most of them inside the country ."
S@@ i@@ x and a half million people have f@@ led for their lives .
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have c@@ ros@@ sed the bor@@ ders and have found san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small prop@@ or@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to E@@ uro@@ pe ."
What I find most wor@@ r@@ ying is that half of all S@@ y@@ rian re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had ar@@ ri@@ ved after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a into J@@ or@@ d@@ an .
And most t@@ rou@@ b@@ ling of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ rian re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children are in school in Le@@ ban@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ rian re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , as cent@@ ers of ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ u@@ m@@ ph over their tra@@ u@@ ma and tra@@ in for the day that they can go home as ag@@ ents of pos@@ itive change and social trans@@ formation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of the terri@@ ble war in S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a that has been ra@@ g@@ ing on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this cam@@ p .
I vi@@ sit@@ ed this cam@@ p .
"It &apos;s in D@@ j@@ i@@ b@@ ou@@ ti , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a , and it was so re@@ mot@@ e that we had to take a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to f@@ ly there ."
It was du@@ st@@ y and it was terri@@ bly h@@ ot .
"And we went to vi@@ sit a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own d@@ aughter , and I went up and tal@@ ked to her ."
"My scho@@ ol@@ ing days are over . &quot; &quot; And I thought , there must be some mi@@ s@@ understanding , so I turned to my colle@@ ag@@ ue and she con@@ fi@@ r@@ med to me there is no fund@@ ing for secon@@ d@@ ary education in this cam@@ p ."
"B@@ eli@@ e@@ ve me or not , I come o@@ ffer@@ ing a solu@@ tion to a very important part of this lar@@ ger problem , with the requi@@ site focu@@ s on climate ."
"And the solu@@ tion I off@@ er is to the bi@@ g@@ gest cul@@ pr@@ it in this ma@@ ssive mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the ear@@ th by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ."
"That cul@@ pr@@ it is business and indu@@ stry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 5@@ 2 years since my gra@@ du@@ ation from G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a T@@ ech in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"As an indu@@ stri@@ al engine@@ er , cu@@ m a@@ spi@@ ring and then succe@@ ss@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur ."
"A@@ f@@ ter f@@ oun@@ ding my company , Inter@@ face , from sc@@ rat@@ ch in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 3@@ 6 years ago , to produce car@@ p@@ et ti@@ les in America for the business and inst@@ itu@@ tion mark@@ ets , and s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survi@@ v@@ al to pros@@ per@@ ity and global d@@ om@@ in@@ ance in its field , I read P@@ au@@ l H@@ a@@ w@@ k@@ en &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ co@@ logy of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the sum@@ mer of 199@@ 4 ."
"In his book , P@@ au@@ l char@@ ges business and indu@@ stry as , one , the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it in cau@@ sing the dec@@ line of the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , and , two , the only inst@@ itu@@ tion that is large enough , and per@@ v@@ a@@ sive enough , and powerful enough , to really le@@ ad human@@ kind out of this me@@ ss ."
And by the way he con@@ vi@@ c@@ ted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the ear@@ th .
"And I then challeng@@ ed the people of Inter@@ face , my company , to le@@ ad our company and the entire indu@@ stri@@ al world to su@@ stai@@ na@@ bility , which we defin@@ ed as ev@@ en@@ tually oper@@ ating our p@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ u@@ m@@ -@@ int@@ en@@ sive company in such a way as to take from the ear@@ th only what can be r@@ ene@@ w@@ ed by the ear@@ th , na@@ tu@@ ra@@ lly and rap@@ id@@ ly — not another fre@@ sh d@@ rop of oi@@ l — and to do no har@@ m to the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ."
T@@ ake nothing : do no har@@ m .
"I simply said , &quot; &quot; If H@@ a@@ w@@ k@@ en is right and business and indu@@ stry must le@@ ad , who will le@@ ad business and indu@@ stry ?"
"@@ U@@ n@@ less somebody lea@@ ds , no@@ body will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a@@ xi@@ o@@ ma@@ tic . Why not us ?"
"And than@@ ks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine writ@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ ai@@ l .
And that became the he@@ ad@@ line of a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e arti@@ cle .
They went on to descri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ rom pl@@ under@@ er to reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , f@@ ran@@ kly , was a pretty sa@@ d com@@ men@@ ta@@ ry on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."
"A@@ s@@ ked later in the C@@ ana@@ di@@ an do@@ cu@@ men@@ ta@@ ry , &quot; &quot; The C@@ or@@ po@@ ration , &quot; &quot; what I me@@ ant by the &quot; &quot; go to j@@ ai@@ l &quot; &quot; re@@ mar@@ k , I o@@ ffer@@ ed that the@@ ft is a cri@@ me ."
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cri@@ me .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cri@@ me — there must be a clear , de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ble al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive to the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ mak@@ e-@@ wa@@ ste indu@@ stri@@ al system that so d@@ omi@@ nat@@ es our ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to produc@@ ts that quickly become wa@@ ste in a lan@@ d@@ f@@ ill or an inc@@ in@@ er@@ at@@ or — in sh@@ ort , di@@ gg@@ ing up the ear@@ th and conver@@ ting it to pol@@ lu@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a w@@ ell@@ -@@ known environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation , imp@@ act — a bad thing — is the produc@@ t of population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , imp@@ act is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ su@@ me in their aff@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produc@@ ed ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ g@@ ely sub@@ j@@ ective , you can perhaps qu@@ anti@@ fy people , and perhaps qu@@ anti@@ fy aff@@ lu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ u@@ sive in too many ways to qu@@ anti@@ fy ."
So the equ@@ ation is con@@ cep@@ tual .
S@@ ti@@ ll it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ p@@ et , a p@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ u@@ m@@ -@@ int@@ en@@ sive produc@@ t for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our technologi@@ es so they di@@ mini@@ shed environ@@ mental imp@@ act , rather than mul@@ tip@@ li@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ write that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal@@ l@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the nu@@ mer@@ at@@ or incre@@ ases imp@@ act — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ omi@@ nat@@ or dec@@ reas@@ es imp@@ act ."
"So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the nu@@ mer@@ at@@ or — call it T@@ 1 — where it incre@@ ases imp@@ act , to the den@@ omi@@ nat@@ or — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ du@@ ces imp@@ act ?"
"I thought about the cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of first indu@@ stri@@ al rev@@ olution , T@@ 1 , as we practi@@ ced it at Inter@@ face , and it had the follow@@ ing cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs ."
E@@ x@@ trac@@ tive : taking ra@@ w materi@@ als from the ear@@ th .
"@@ L@@ ine@@ ar : take , make , wa@@ ste ."
P@@ ow@@ ered by f@@ os@@ si@@ l fue@@ l@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved energy .
W@@ a@@ ste@@ ful : ab@@ u@@ sive and focu@@ sed on la@@ b@@ or produc@@ tiv@@ ity .
M@@ ore car@@ p@@ et per man@@ -@@ h@@ our .
"Th@@ in@@ king it through , I realized that all those at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes must be changed to move T to the den@@ omi@@ nat@@ or ."
"In the new indu@@ stri@@ al rev@@ olution ex@@ trac@@ tive must be re@@ pla@@ ced by r@@ ene@@ w@@ able ; l@@ ine@@ ar by cy@@ cli@@ cal ; f@@ os@@ si@@ l fue@@ l energy by r@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy , sun@@ light ; wa@@ ste@@ ful by wa@@ ste@@ -@@ free ; and ab@@ u@@ sive by b@@ eni@@ g@@ n ; and la@@ b@@ or produc@@ tiv@@ ity by re@@ source produc@@ tiv@@ ity ."
"And I reas@@ on@@ ed that if we could make those trans@@ forma@@ tive changes , and get ri@@ d of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could re@@ duce our imp@@ act to z@@ ero , inclu@@ ding our imp@@ act on the climate ."
"And that became the Inter@@ face pla@@ n in 199@@ 5 , and has been the pla@@ n ever since ."
We have mea@@ su@@ red our pro@@ gre@@ ss very ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as e@@ mi@@ ssi@@ ons down 8@@ 2 percent in absol@@ ute ton@@ na@@ ge .
( Applause ) O@@ ver the same sp@@ an of time s@@ al@@ es have incre@@ as@@ ed by t@@ wo@@ -@@ thi@@ r@@ ds and pro@@ f@@ its have d@@ ou@@ b@@ led .
So an 8@@ 2 percent absol@@ ute re@@ duc@@ tion trans@@ la@@ t@@ es into a 90 percent re@@ duc@@ tion in gre@@ en@@ house g@@ as int@@ en@@ sity rela@@ tive to s@@ al@@ es .
This is the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de of the re@@ duc@@ tion the entire global tech@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere must realize by 20@@ 50 to av@@ oi@@ d ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ phi@@ c climate dis@@ rup@@ tion — so the scientists are telling us .
"F@@ os@@ si@@ l fue@@ l u@@ sa@@ ge is down 60 percent per un@@ it of produc@@ tion , due to e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ en@@ ci@@ es in r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"The che@@ ap@@ est , most sec@@ u@@ re bar@@ re@@ l of oi@@ l there is is the one not used through e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
W@@ at@@ er u@@ sa@@ ge is down 7@@ 5 percent in our wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de car@@ p@@ et ti@@ le business .
"D@@ own 40 percent in our bro@@ ad@@ lo@@ om car@@ p@@ et business , which we ac@@ qui@@ red in 199@@ 3 right here in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , C@@ ity of In@@ du@@ stry , where water is so preci@@ ous ."
"@@ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able or rec@@ y@@ cla@@ ble materi@@ als are 25 percent of the to@@ tal , and growing rap@@ id@@ ly ."
"@@ R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is 2@@ 7 percent of our to@@ tal , going for 100 percent ."

"Th@@ ree years ago we la@@ un@@ ched car@@ p@@ et ti@@ le for the home , under the b@@ r@@ and F@@ l@@ or , mi@@ s@@ sp@@ el@@ led F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and cli@@ ck today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ c@@ om and have C@@ o@@ ol C@@ ar@@ p@@ et deli@@ vered to your front do@@ or in five days .
"It is practi@@ cal , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ kon that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : z@@ ero imp@@ act , z@@ ero fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our tar@@ get year for z@@ ero , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the sum@@ mit of M@@ ount S@@ us@@ tai@@ na@@ bility ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ ero .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ ero to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to bi@@ gger pro@@ f@@ its ."
Here is the business case for su@@ stai@@ na@@ bility .
"F@@ rom real life experience , cos@@ ts are down , not up , re@@ fl@@ ecting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ oi@@ ded cos@@ ts in pur@@ su@@ it of z@@ ero wa@@ ste — the first face of M@@ ount S@@ us@@ tai@@ na@@ bility ."
This has paid all the cos@@ ts for the trans@@ formation of Inter@@ face .
"And this di@@ sp@@ els a my@@ th too , this fal@@ se choice between the environment and the econom@@ y ."
"O@@ ur produc@@ ts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspi@@ red by design for su@@ stai@@ na@@ bility , an un@@ exp@@ ected w@@ ell@@ sp@@ ring of inno@@ vation ."
O@@ ur people are g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ iz@@ ed around this sha@@ red high@@ er pur@@ p@@ ose .
You cannot be@@ at it for at@@ trac@@ ting the best people and bri@@ ng@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ od@@ will of the mar@@ ket@@ place is ast@@ oni@@ shing .
"N@@ o amount of ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , no cle@@ ver mar@@ ket@@ ing cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , at any pri@@ ce , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ od@@ will ."
"C@@ os@@ ts , produc@@ ts , people , mar@@ ket@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year recor@@ d of s@@ al@@ es and pro@@ f@@ its .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ al@@ es , over a thre@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ od , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the mar@@ ket@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We literally ga@@ ined market share .
We might not have survi@@ ved that re@@ ce@@ ssion but for the adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ges of su@@ stai@@ na@@ bility .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face pl@@ ans , would that solve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ main t@@ rou@@ b@@ led by the re@@ vi@@ sed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A divi@@ ded by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , sug@@ ge@@ sting that aff@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ f@@ ram@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch fu@@ r@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a low@@ er@@ case &apos; a , &apos; sug@@ ge@@ sting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ ine@@ ss — more happ@@ ine@@ ss with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ f@@ r@@ ame ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econom@@ ics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succe@@ e@@ ds us : the su@@ stai@@ na@@ ble species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , eth@@ ic@@ ally , happ@@ i@@ ly and ec@@ o@@ logi@@ cally in bal@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a thou@@ sand gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the in@@ defin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wai@@ t for our ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"At Inter@@ face we really int@@ end to bring this prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pi@@ cal su@@ stai@@ na@@ ble , z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int indu@@ stri@@ al company fully into exi@@ st@@ ence by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , clear to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the challenge is in ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vi@@ ser A@@ m@@ ory Lo@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something exi@@ sts , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a p@@ et@@ ro@@ -@@ int@@ en@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it follow@@ s that everybody can ."
"H@@ a@@ w@@ k@@ en fu@@ l@@ fil@@ led business and indu@@ stry , lead@@ ing human@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with contin@@ ue@@ d un@@ chec@@ ked dec@@ line of the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here — f@@ ran@@ kly , an u@@ na@@ c@@ cep@@ table risk ."
Wh@@ o is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me int@@ ro@@ duce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain cli@@ m@@ b .
"O@@ n a T@@ ue@@ s@@ day mor@@ ning in Mar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bri@@ ng@@ ing them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was conn@@ ecting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , I re@@ cei@@ ved an e@@ mai@@ l from G@@ l@@ en@@ n Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s , one of my people in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia me@@ et@@ ing ."
He was sen@@ ding me an ori@@ gi@@ nal p@@ oe@@ m that he had com@@ pos@@ ed after our T@@ ue@@ s@@ day mor@@ ning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mom@@ ents of my life .
"Because it told me , by God , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ l@@ en@@ n wr@@ ote . And here is that person , most at risk ."
"P@@ le@@ ase me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s C@@ hi@@ ld . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ ue@@ s@@ day mor@@ n ."
A wi@@ se friend int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ at@@ en you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my d@@ aughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d I &apos;ve just be@@ gu@@ n to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"B@@ eg@@ in , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I s@@ qu@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s C@@ hi@@ ld &quot; &quot; has sp@@ ok@@ en to me with one simple but pro@@ found messa@@ ge , which I pre@@ su@@ me to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."
"The contin@@ u@@ um of human@@ ity , sure , but in a lar@@ ger sense , the we@@ b of life itself ."
"And we have a choice to make during our bri@@ e@@ f , bri@@ e@@ f vi@@ sit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hu@@ r@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
