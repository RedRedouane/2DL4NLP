"We live in difficult and challen@@ ging economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first vic@@ ti@@ ms of difficult economic times , I think , is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding of any kind , but cer@@ tain@@ ly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding for science , and particu@@ lar@@ ly cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ led science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
So I want to try and con@@ v@@ ince you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous and lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous thing to do .
"But I think to set the scen@@ e , I want to show — the next sli@@ de is not my at@@ tem@@ pt to show the wor@@ st TED sli@@ de in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a mes@@ s ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my fa@@ ult ; it &apos;s from the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of how much science cos@@ ts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for continu@@ ing to sp@@ end on cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven science and expl@@ or@@ ation , I should tell you how much it cos@@ ts ."
So this is a game called &quot; &quot; s@@ po@@ t the science bu@@ d@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science bu@@ d@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of b@@ lob@@ s and then y@@ ell@@ ow set of b@@ lob@@ s ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ ell@@ ow set of b@@ lob@@ s around the big y@@ ell@@ ow blo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion p@@ oun@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from medic@@ al research , space expl@@ or@@ ation , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and human@@ i@@ ties , fun@@ ded from the science bu@@ d@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny y@@ ell@@ ow blo@@ b around the oran@@ ge blo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and Ger@@ many and F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"@@ R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; D in tot@@ al in the econ@@ omy , publi@@ c@@ ly fun@@ ded , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is stra@@ ight from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; is that our expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ descri@@ bab@@ ly beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ as@@ sini space pro@@ be around Sat@@ ur@@ n , after we &apos;d fin@@ ish@@ ed fil@@ ming &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the moon En@@ ce@@ la@@ du@@ s .
"So that big swe@@ ep@@ ing , wh@@ ite sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is Sat@@ ur@@ n , which is actually in the bac@@ k@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that c@@ res@@ cent there is the moon En@@ ce@@ la@@ du@@ s , which is about as big as the Bri@@ ti@@ sh I@@ s@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 kil@@ ome@@ ters in dia@@ me@@ ter .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ pro@@ ces@@ sed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and wh@@ ite , stra@@ ight from Sat@@ ur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fa@@ in@@ t , sort of , w@@ is@@ ps of almost sm@@ oke ri@@ sing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we v@@ is@@ u@@ al@@ ize that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful grap@@ hi@@ c .
What we found out were that those fa@@ in@@ t w@@ is@@ ps are actually f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of ice ri@@ sing up from the sur@@ face of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the me@@ chan@@ ism for po@@ wer@@ ing those f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins re@@ qui@@ res there to be la@@ k@@ es of li@@ qu@@ id water ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qu@@ id water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evidence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of a moon 7@@ 50 million mi@@ les away from the Earth is really quite ast@@ oun@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essenti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a ha@@ bit@@ at for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a grap@@ hi@@ c . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of En@@ ce@@ la@@ du@@ s .
This is when C@@ as@@ sini f@@ le@@ w ben@@ e@@ ath En@@ ce@@ la@@ du@@ s .
"So it made a very low pas@@ s , just a few hundred kil@@ ome@@ ters ab@@ ove the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ri@@ sing up into space , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Europ@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the Jo@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of ro@@ ck ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the moon Europ@@ a , which is a th@@ ic@@ k sh@@ e@@ et of ice , probably a hundred kil@@ ome@@ ters th@@ ic@@ k ."
"But by meas@@ ur@@ ing the way that Europ@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the magnetic field of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and looking at how those cr@@ ac@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that grap@@ hi@@ c move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very stron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an o@@ ce@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Europ@@ a ."
"So bel@@ ow the ice , there &apos;s an o@@ ce@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id around the whole moon ."
"It could be hund@@ re@@ ds of kil@@ ome@@ ters de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s sal@@ tw@@ at@@ er , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er than there is in all the o@@ ce@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little moon around J@@ up@@ it@@ er , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for fin@@ ding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disco@@ very .
O@@ ur expl@@ or@@ ation of the solar system has ta@@ u@@ ght us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ wer@@ ing one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can pos@@ si@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to expl@@ or@@ ation and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very fam@@ ous picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s E@@ ve , D@@ ece@@ m@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by Ap@@ ol@@ lo 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Ear@@ th@@ ri@@ se from Ap@@ ol@@ lo 8 .
"A fam@@ ous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sa@@ ved 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ bul@@ ent year — the stu@@ dent ri@@ ots in P@@ ar@@ is , the he@@ ight of the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the st@@ age at TED , is that this picture , ar@@ gu@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental mo@@ vement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mo@@ v@@ able , kind of inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le@@ -@@ looking world just hang@@ ing against the bla@@ ck@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not of@@ ten said about the space expl@@ or@@ ation , about the Ap@@ ol@@ lo progra@@ m , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make arg@@ um@@ ents that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achi@@ ev@@ ement and de@@ li@@ vered pic@@ tures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , the economic imp@@ act of Ap@@ ol@@ lo ."
The bi@@ ggest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by Ch@@ ase E@@ con@@ ome@@ tri@@ c@@ s .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 sp@@ ent on Ap@@ ol@@ lo , 14 came back into the U.S. econ@@ omy ."
"So the Ap@@ ol@@ lo progra@@ m pa@@ id for itself in in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion , in engine@@ ering , achi@@ ev@@ ement and , I think , in in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing young scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers 14 times over ."
So expl@@ or@@ ation can p@@ ay for itself .
What about scienti@@ fi@@ c disco@@ very ?
What about dri@@ ving in@@ nov@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vir@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tr@@ um of hy@@ dro@@ gen ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scienti@@ sts , many ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light gi@@ ven off from atoms ."
And they saw strange pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re see@@ ing when you put it through a pri@@ s@@ m is that you he@@ at hy@@ dro@@ gen up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a wh@@ ite light , it just e@@ mi@@ ts light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light b@@ lu@@ e one , some dark b@@ lu@@ e ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of at@@ omi@@ c struc@@ ture because the way that &apos;s expla@@ ined is atoms are a single n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with electr@@ ons going around them .
And the electr@@ ons can only be in particular pla@@ ces .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they e@@ mi@@ t light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that atoms , when you he@@ at them up , only e@@ mi@@ t light at very speci@@ fi@@ c col@@ ors , was one of the k@@ ey dri@@ ver@@ s that led to the develop@@ ment of the quantum theory , the theory of the struc@@ ture of atoms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tr@@ um of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when electr@@ ons j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black lin@@ es in that spec@@ tr@@ um .
And the ele@@ ment he@@ li@@ um was disco@@ vered just by star@@ ing at the light from the Sun because some of those black lin@@ es were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known ele@@ ment .
And that &apos;s why he@@ li@@ um &apos;s called he@@ li@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; he@@ li@@ os &quot; &quot; — he@@ li@@ os from the Sun .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic , and inde@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pur@@ su@@ it , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behavi@@ ors of electr@@ ons in materi@@ als like si@@ lic@@ on , for example ."
"The way that si@@ lic@@ on beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build tran@@ sist@@ ors , is a p@@ u@@ re@@ ly quantum ph@@ enomen@@ on ."
"So without that cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven understanding of the struc@@ ture of atoms , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic theory , quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s , then we wouldn &apos;t have tran@@ sist@@ ors , we wouldn &apos;t have si@@ lic@@ on ch@@ i@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the bas@@ is of our modern econ@@ omy ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful tw@@ ist to that tal@@ e ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; we ke@@ pt emp@@ ha@@ siz@@ ing the la@@ ws of physics are univer@@ sal ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can tran@@ sp@@ ort it , not only to the planets , but to the most dist@@ ant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing predic@@ tions of quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s , just by looking at the struc@@ ture of atoms — the same theory that descri@@ bes tran@@ sist@@ ors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are bi@@ g@@ ger than , quite speci@@ f@@ ic@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a limi@@ t im@@ posed on the mas@@ s of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of p@@ ap@@ er in a labor@@ at@@ ory , get a te@@ les@@ cop@@ e , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars bi@@ g@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible predic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the ed@@ ge of that mas@@ s ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galax@@ y , a common &quot; &quot; our gar@@ den &quot; &quot; galax@@ y with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of bil@@ li@@ ons of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic c@@ ore , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ ining out so bri@@ gh@@ tly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galax@@ y .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galax@@ y , and it &apos;s sh@@ ining as bri@@ gh@@ tly as the center of the galax@@ y with a billion sun@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a T@@ y@@ p@@ e I@@ a super@@ nov@@ a expl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible ph@@ enomen@@ a , because it &apos;s a star that si@@ ts there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ bon@@ -@@ oxy@@ gen d@@ war@@ f .
"It si@@ ts there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
"And it has a bin@@ ary comp@@ ani@@ on that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of g@@ as ."
"And what it does is it suc@@ ks g@@ as off its comp@@ ani@@ on star , until it gets to this limi@@ t called the Ch@@ and@@ ra@@ sek@@ ha@@ r limi@@ t , and then it exp@@ lo@@ des ."
"And it exp@@ lo@@ des , and it sh@@ in@@ es as bri@@ gh@@ tly as a billion sun@@ s for about two weeks , and re@@ lea@@ ses , not only energy , but a hu@@ ge amount of che@@ mi@@ cal ele@@ ments into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ bon@@ -@@ oxy@@ gen d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ gen in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ gen in the universe thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the first generation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into planets , stars , new solar syste@@ ms and , inde@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the power and be@@ a@@ ut@@ y and univer@@ s@@ ality of the la@@ ws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the struc@@ ture of atoms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ endi@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der F@@ lem@@ ing : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I w@@ oke up just after da@@ wn on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t pla@@ n to re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ize all medicine by disco@@ ver@@ ing the world &apos;s first anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tic . &quot; &quot; Now , the expl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not int@@ end to inv@@ ent the tran@@ sist@@ or ."
"And they cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t int@@ end to descri@@ be the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s of super@@ nov@@ a expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons , which even@@ tually told us where the building b@@ loc@@ ks of life were sy@@ n@@ the@@ siz@@ ed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ endi@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing things .
"It can also , I think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the valu@@ e of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like Sat@@ ur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ as@@ sini space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a fam@@ ous picture , not because of the be@@ a@@ ut@@ y and ma@@ j@@ est@@ y of Sat@@ ur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a tiny , fa@@ in@@ t blo@@ b just hang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the r@@ ings ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tu@@ red in that f@@ ra@@ me of Sat@@ ur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million mi@@ les away .
"I think the Earth has got a strange pro@@ per@@ ty that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dist@@ ant or most fam@@ ous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ oy@@ ager sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ raf@@ t ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in fron@@ t of it for scal@@ e .
The V@@ oy@@ ager is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s cur@@ ren@@ tly 10 billion mi@@ les away from Earth , trans@@ mi@@ tting with that dis@@ h , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in con@@ t@@ act with it ."
"But it vi@@ si@@ ted J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Sat@@ ur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and Ne@@ p@@ t@@ un@@ e ."
"And after it vi@@ si@@ ted all four of those planets , Carl S@@ ag@@ an , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of tur@@ ning V@@ oy@@ ager around and tak@@ ing a picture of every planet it had vi@@ si@@ ted ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ al@@ e B@@ lu@@ e D@@ o@@ t &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in that red s@@ ha@@ ft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion mi@@ les away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ ag@@ an wr@@ ote about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; C@@ on@@ si@@ der again that do@@ t ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was li@@ ved out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates of jo@@ y and suff@@ ering thousands of con@@ fi@@ dent religi@@ ons , ide@@ ologi@@ es and economic doc@@ tr@@ in@@ es , every h@@ un@@ ter and for@@ ager , every her@@ o and co@@ ward , every cre@@ at@@ or and dest@@ ro@@ yer of civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hop@@ e@@ ful child , inv@@ ent@@ or and expl@@ or@@ er , every teacher of mor@@ als , every cor@@ ru@@ pt poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me le@@ ad@@ er , every sa@@ in@@ t and sin@@ ner in the history of our speci@@ es , li@@ ved there , on a m@@ ote of du@@ st , s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in a sun@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that astronom@@ y &apos;s a h@@ um@@ b@@ ling and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ -@@ building experience .
There is perhaps no better de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ ce@@ its than this dist@@ ant i@@ ma@@ ge of our tiny world .
"T@@ o me , it under@@ s@@ cor@@ es our respon@@ sibili@@ ty to de@@ al more kin@@ dly with one another and to pres@@ er@@ ve and ch@@ er@@ ish the p@@ al@@ e b@@ lu@@ e do@@ t , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ auti@@ ful words about the power of science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"The arg@@ ument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had pen@@ ic@@ il@@ l@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the tran@@ sist@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disco@@ ver anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me lea@@ ve the last words to someone who &apos;s rap@@ id@@ ly be@@ coming a her@@ o of m@@ ine , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under as@@ sa@@ ult all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ Just exp@@ lo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the prog@@ ress of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Un@@ iversi@@ ty of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"H@@ ere is a lum@@ p of f@@ les@@ h , about three p@@ oun@@ ds , which you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand ."
But it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space .
"It can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the me@@ an@@ ing of its own exist@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is truly the most amaz@@ ing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the great@@ est my@@ ster@@ y con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the a@@ du@@ l@@ t human brain .
"And each neur@@ on makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 con@@ tac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have cal@@ cula@@ ted that the number of per@@ mut@@ ations and com@@ bin@@ ations of brain ac@@ tivity ex@@ ce@@ eds the number of ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stu@@ d@@ ying the brain ?"
"One approach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavi@@ or ."
This is what I sp@@ oke about in the last TED .
"T@@ o@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually rec@@ or@@ d the ac@@ tivity of in@@ dividu@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ ort of e@@ av@@ es@@ drop on the ac@@ tivity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one rec@@ ent disco@@ very that has been made by resear@@ ch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in P@@ ar@@ ma , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o R@@ iz@@ z@@ ola@@ tti and his colle@@ agu@@ es , is a group of neurons called mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the fron@@ t of the brain in the fron@@ tal lo@@ bes ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordin@@ ary m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neurons in the fron@@ t of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person perfor@@ ms a speci@@ fi@@ c action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an app@@ le , a m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neur@@ on in the fron@@ t of my brain will fire ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an ob@@ ject , another neur@@ on will fire , com@@ man@@ ding me to pul@@ l that ob@@ ject ."
These are called m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ iz@@ z@@ ola@@ tti found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else per@@ form@@ ing the same action ."
"So , here is a neur@@ on that fi@@ res when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fi@@ res when I watch Jo@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is truly ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neur@@ on is a@@ do@@ p@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ form@@ ing a vir@@ tual reality si@@ mu@@ lation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ance of these mir@@ ro@@ r neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ olved in things like imi@@ tation and e@@ mu@@ lation .
Because to imi@@ t@@ ate a comple@@ x act re@@ qui@@ res my brain to a@@ do@@ pt the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for imi@@ tation and e@@ mu@@ lation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de ."
"So , how do you do imi@@ tation ? Why is imi@@ tation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and imi@@ tation , e@@ mu@@ lation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ enomen@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 10@@ 0,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ d@@ den emer@@ gence and rap@@ id sp@@ read of a number of sk@@ il@@ ls that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fire , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the abili@@ ty to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavi@@ or ."
A@@ ll of that happened rela@@ tively quickly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had achi@@ ev@@ ed its pres@@ ent size almost three or four hundred th@@ ous@@ and years ago , 10@@ 0,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I c@@ la@@ im that what happened was the su@@ d@@ den emer@@ gence of a s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated mir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on system , which allowed you to e@@ mu@@ la@@ te and imi@@ t@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ d@@ den ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal disco@@ very by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular ty@@ p@@ e of to@@ ol , instead of d@@ ying out , this sp@@ read rap@@ id@@ ly , hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was trans@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed ver@@ tically , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ d@@ den@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ i@@ an ."
D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ i@@ an evolution is s@@ low ; it takes hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A po@@ lar be@@ ar , to ev@@ ol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 10@@ 0,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just watch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another po@@ lar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , f@@ ur on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the po@@ lar be@@ ar took 10@@ 0,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ re@@ a@@ ds in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The imi@@ tation of comple@@ x sk@@ il@@ ls is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion .
"Now there is another kind of mir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on , which is inv@@ olved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for action , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ch@@ es me , my hand , neur@@ on in the so@@ mat@@ os@@ en@@ sor@@ y cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ sor@@ y regi@@ on of the brain fi@@ res ."
"But the same neur@@ on , in some ca@@ ses , will fire when I simply watch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ ing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different lo@@ ca@@ tions . Di@@ ff@@ er@@ ent neurons for different lo@@ ca@@ tions ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same lo@@ cation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ rol@@ led in em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"Now , the question then ari@@ ses : I@@ f I simply watch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get conf@@ used and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ sa@@ tion mer@@ ely by wat@@ ching somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pa@@ in re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise you &apos;ll get conf@@ used and mu@@ d@@ d@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sign@@ al that vet@@ o@@ es the sign@@ al of the mir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from con@@ sci@@ ously experiencing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the br@@ achi@@ al ple@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sa@@ tions coming in , if I now watch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ hi neurons , or em@@ pa@@ thy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ str@@ act met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical sense .
"A@@ ll that &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"@@ Re@@ move the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ a@@ ster@@ n ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y , and that is there is no real inde@@ pen@@ dent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just vi@@ a Facebook and Inter@@ net , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole c@@ ha@@ ins of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dist@@ inc@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else &apos;s con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
And this is not m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y .
It emer@@ ges from our understanding of basi@@ c neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . I@@ f the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you watch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , if you have pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ sage the other person &apos;s hand , that reli@@ ev@@ es the pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neur@@ on were ob@@ ta@@ ining reli@@ ef from mer@@ ely wat@@ ching somebody else being mas@@ sa@@ g@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sli@@ de ."
F@@ or the lon@@ g@@ est time people have re@@ gar@@ ded science and human@@ i@@ ties as being dist@@ inc@@ t .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now sp@@ oke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , human@@ i@@ ties on the other ; never the tw@@ a@@ in sh@@ all me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on system under@@ lies the inter@@ face allo@@ wing you to re@@ think about is@@ su@@ es like con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ pres@@ en@@ tation of self , what se@@ par@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what allo@@ ws you to em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the emer@@ gence of culture and civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great h@@ onor today to share with you The Di@@ git@@ al Un@@ iver@@ se , which was created for human@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can rol@@ l the vide@@ o that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ alay@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ u@@ sic ) The fla@@ t hor@@ iz@@ on that we &apos;ve ev@@ olved with has been a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded resour@@ ces and un@@ limi@@ ted cap@@ ac@@ ity for di@@ sp@@ os@@ al of wa@@ st@@ e .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ ove the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here and had seen the hor@@ iz@@ on ben@@ d back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limi@@ ted condi@@ tion ."
The Di@@ git@@ al Un@@ iver@@ se A@@ t@@ la@@ s has been built at the American M@@ u@@ se@@ um of N@@ at@@ ural H@@ ist@@ ory over the past 12 years .
"We ma@@ in@@ tain that , put that together as a pro@@ ject to really char@@ t the universe across all scal@@ es ."
"What we see here are sat@@ el@@ li@@ t@@ es around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per regi@@ stra@@ tion against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A sup@@ port@@ ed this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the Hay@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The Di@@ git@@ al Un@@ iver@@ se is the bas@@ is of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our ma@@ in space sho@@ ws in the do@@ me .
"But what you see here is the res@@ ult of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we h@@ os@@ ted with L@@ in@@ kop@@ ing Un@@ iversi@@ ty in S@@ we@@ den ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their gra@@ du@@ ate work , and the res@@ ult has been this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are called U@@ ni@@ view and a comp@@ any called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in S@@ we@@ den ."
"This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tual f@@ light pat@@ h and mo@@ vi@@ e that we see here was actually flo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tu@@ red this live from my l@@ ap@@ top in a ca@@ fe called Earth M@@ at@@ ters on the L@@ o@@ wer E@@ ast S@@ ide of M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ labor@@ ative pro@@ ject with the R@@ u@@ bin M@@ u@@ se@@ um of H@@ im@@ alay@@ an Ar@@ t for an ex@@ hi@@ bit on com@@ par@@ ative cos@@ m@@ ology ."
"And so as we move out , we see continu@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , li@@ ght@@ -@@ tra@@ v@@ el time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dist@@ ant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essenti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally see@@ ing a con@@ tain@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P mi@@ c@@ ro@@ wa@@ ve bac@@ k@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ tain@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ tain@@ ment of the vi@@ sible universe .
We know the universe is bi@@ g@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back quickly , we see here the radi@@ o sp@@ here that we j@@ um@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are pos@@ i@@ tions , the la@@ test pos@@ i@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve m@@ app@@ ed , and our sun here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty quickly between sever@@ al or@@ ders of ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the pa@@ ths of V@@ oy@@ ager 1 , V@@ oy@@ ager 2 , P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 1@@ 1 and P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ raf@@ t to have left the solar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in cl@@ os@@ er , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This ma@@ p can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ ar@@ ol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the ca@@ mer@@ a P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ as@@ sini mis@@ sion .
"But here we see the comple@@ x tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory of the C@@ as@@ sini mis@@ sion col@@ or co@@ ded for different mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ ses , in@@ gen@@ i@@ ously developed so that 45 en@@ coun@@ ters with the lar@@ g@@ est moon , T@@ it@@ an , which is lar@@ ger that the planet M@@ er@@ cur@@ y , di@@ ver@@ ts the or@@ bit into different parts of mis@@ sion ph@@ ase ."
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws us to come cl@@ ose and look at parts of this .
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can also be net@@ worked between do@@ mes .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we net@@ work do@@ mes ."
And we can net@@ work between do@@ mes and clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
We &apos;re actually sh@@ ar@@ ing t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in G@@ h@@ ana as well as new li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a and a high school in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia .
And the C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ ans have actually con@@ tr@@ ol@@ led the Hay@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um from their high school .
"This is an i@@ ma@@ ge from Sat@@ ur@@ day , ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed by the A@@ qu@@ a sat@@ el@@ li@@ te , but through the U@@ ni@@ view so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
So you &apos;re see@@ ing the ed@@ ge of the Earth .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al .
"This is , in fact , right here is the val@@ ley of L@@ has@@ a , right here in Ti@@ bet ."
But we can see the haz@@ e from fi@@ res and so fort@@ h in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ ley down bel@@ ow in India .
This is Ne@@ p@@ al and Ti@@ bet .
"And just in cl@@ os@@ ing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to bra@@ ve in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world ne@@ eds now is a sense of being able to look at our@@ selves in this much lar@@ ger condi@@ tion now and a much lar@@ ger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essenti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .
"And to be able to see our con@@ te@@ xt in this lar@@ ger sense at all scal@@ es hel@@ ps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"Now , O@@ K , you can op@@ en your ey@@ es ."
"And we ask the question as a fun@@ c@@ tion of the three different lives , how much life sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of me@@ an@@ ing is the stron@@ g@@ est .
There &apos;s a group of people in Ken@@ ya .
P@@ eople c@@ ross o@@ ce@@ ans to go see them .
These people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they k@@ ill li@@ ons .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s co@@ ol ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is , the boy@@ s are br@@ ought up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are br@@ ought up to be mothers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was eng@@ ag@@ ed to be marri@@ ed as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed p@@ u@@ ber@@ ty ."
"M@@ y mother , my grand@@ mother , my a@@ un@@ ties , they con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your hus@@ b@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ o@@ ol , ye@@ ah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a per@@ fe@@ ct woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the mor@@ ning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , swe@@ ep@@ ing the h@@ ou@@ se , co@@ ok@@ ing for my si@@ b@@ l@@ ings , col@@ lec@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a per@@ fe@@ ct wife .
I went to school not because the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ b@@ l@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was li@@ ving ."
Why did she say that ?
M@@ y father worked as a poli@@ ce@@ man in the c@@ ity .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for some@@ times even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
M@@ y mother worked hard in the far@@ m to grow c@@ rop@@ s so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ar@@ ed the co@@ ws and the go@@ at@@ s so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would sel@@ l the co@@ ws , he would sel@@ l the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and d@@ ran@@ k with his friends in the b@@ ars ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any pro@@ per@@ ty , and by de@@ fa@@ ult , everything in my family any@@ way bel@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ tion@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
Te@@ ach@@ ers looked ni@@ ce .
"They we@@ ar ni@@ ce d@@ res@@ ses , high@@ -@@ he@@ e@@ led sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just wr@@ iting on the bo@@ ar@@ d — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , com@@ par@@ ed to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our tradi@@ tion , there is a cer@@ em@@ on@@ y that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a r@@ ite of pas@@ sage to w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"And then I was just fin@@ ish@@ ing my ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a tran@@ si@@ tion for me to go to high school ."
This was the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"On@@ ce I go through this tradi@@ tion , I was going to become a wife ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of be@@ coming a teacher will not come to pas@@ s ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pla@@ n to fig@@ ure these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this cer@@ em@@ on@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a sti@@ g@@ ma , people will be cal@@ ling him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the cer@@ em@@ on@@ y ."
It was a s@@ ha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he fi@@ gu@@ red out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; o@@ kay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ em@@ on@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole we@@ ek long of exc@@ it@@ ement .
It &apos;s a cer@@ em@@ on@@ y . P@@ eople are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tual cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happens , we were dan@@ c@@ ing , having exc@@ it@@ ement , and through all the ni@@ ght we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tual day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ou@@ se that we were dan@@ c@@ ing in . Y@@ es , we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cour@@ t@@ yar@@ d , and there were a bun@@ ch of people wa@@ iting ."
They were all in a circ@@ le .
"And as we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this circ@@ le of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman si@@ tting in the mid@@ dle of it , and this woman was wa@@ iting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my si@@ ster@@ s and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I s@@ at down ."
"And I s@@ at down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ r@@ ying a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ri@@ ed the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the cli@@ tor@@ is , and she cut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I b@@ led . I b@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ e@@ ding for a while , I fa@@ in@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m lu@@ ck@@ y , I never di@@ ed — but many di@@ e ."
"It &apos;s pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was lu@@ ck@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and br@@ ought a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree weeks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I met a young gen@@ tle@@ man from our village who had been to the Un@@ iversi@@ ty of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was we@@ ar@@ ing a wh@@ ite t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , je@@ ans , ca@@ mer@@ a , wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have pa@@ ved ro@@ a@@ ds . It was quite at@@ trac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a hus@@ b@@ and wa@@ iting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This gen@@ tle@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in high school also , my da@@ d was sic@@ k ."
"He got a st@@ ro@@ ke , and he was really , really sic@@ k , so he really cou@@ ldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ very@@ body who is my da@@ d &apos;s age , mal@@ e in the commun@@ ity , is my father by de@@ fa@@ ult — my un@@ c@@ les , all of them — and they dic@@ t@@ ate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ o@@ man &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ yn@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come without the sup@@ port of the village , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to buy the air tic@@ k@@ et ."
I got a s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the sup@@ port of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost op@@ port@@ un@@ ity ."
This should have been gi@@ ven to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tradi@@ tion .
There &apos;s a beli@@ ef am@@ ong our people that mor@@ ning br@@ ings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the mor@@ ning , because there &apos;s good news in the mor@@ ning ."
"And in the village also , there is one ch@@ i@@ ef , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the mor@@ ning , as the sun r@@ ose ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ en@@ s his do@@ or is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; M@@ y child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . Can you sup@@ port me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I pro@@ mi@@ sed him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a li@@ st of another 15 men that I went — 1@@ 6 more men — every single mor@@ ning I went and vi@@ si@@ ted them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to sup@@ port me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ ri@@ ved in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ ts , v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and lots of f@@ ood in the ca@@ f@@ et@@ er@@ ia ."
I was in a land of p@@ len@@ ty .
"I en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed myself , but dur@@ ing that moment while I was here , I disco@@ vered a lot of things ."
"I learned that that cer@@ em@@ on@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called fe@@ mal@@ e gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in Ken@@ ya .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in A@@ fri@@ ca are at ri@@ s@@ k of going through this mu@@ ti@@ lation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ per@@ ty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me an@@ gr@@ y .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting marri@@ ed ."
"They were getting mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted , and here , after I gra@@ du@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my gra@@ du@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had pro@@ mi@@ sed you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I sp@@ oke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is rap@@ ed when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is bla@@ med for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got marri@@ ed , the mother is bla@@ med for that , and she &apos;s p@@ un@@ ish@@ ed ."
She &apos;s be@@ aten .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mo@@ ved , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for boy@@ s . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for boy@@ s , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a si@@ gn of com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment ."
And they did . They don@@ ated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"An@@ gel@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any cr@@ it@@ er@@ ia that we had ."
"She &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was ol@@ der . She was 12 years old , and we were tak@@ ing girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"An@@ gel@@ ine had been mo@@ ving from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father — mo@@ ving from one grand@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ou@@ se to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . She had no st@@ abili@@ ty in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remem@@ ber that day , and I saw something be@@ yon@@ d what I was see@@ ing in An@@ gel@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was ol@@ der to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to come to the clas@@ s .
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is An@@ gel@@ ine ."
A trans@@ formation had beg@@ un in her life .
An@@ gel@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a p@@ il@@ o@@ t so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stu@@ dent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stu@@ dent , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re divi@@ sion that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ har@@ on . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s Ev@@ el@@ y@@ n . F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 1@@ 2@@ 5 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted ."
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls will not be marri@@ ed when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achi@@ ev@@ ing their dre@@ am@@ s .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties where they can ri@@ se ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being be@@ aten because of the re@@ v@@ olu@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our commun@@ ity ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are list@@ en@@ ing to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ sion@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war ends , no po@@ ver@@ ty ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our tom@@ or@@ row better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . P@@ eople will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e b@@ old . St@@ and up . B@@ e fe@@ ar@@ less . B@@ e con@@ fi@@ dent .
"M@@ ove out , because as you change your world , as you change your commun@@ ity , as we believe that we are imp@@ ac@@ ting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your commun@@ ity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . I@@ f you do that , and I do that , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ace@@ ful world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ lease ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s at a TED C@@ on@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual in any way , shape or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the ma@@ j@@ ority ."
M@@ y T@@ al@@ k today is about self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ den@@ ce .
It &apos;s just a basi@@ c fact about being human that some@@ times the self seems to just me@@ l@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is ec@@ stati@@ c and we re@@ ach for met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ li@@ f@@ ted or e@@ lev@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ str@@ act like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
So here &apos;s the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or I &apos;m off@@ ering today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ou@@ se with many ro@@ om@@ s , most of which we &apos;re very famili@@ ar with ."
But some@@ times it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ars from out of no@@ where and it op@@ en@@ s on@@ to a stair@@ case .
We c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case and experience a state of al@@ ter@@ ed con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psych@@ ologi@@ st W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ a@@ mes wr@@ ote about the many var@@ i@@ eties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He col@@ lec@@ ted all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exc@@ iting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ rad@@ ley , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ es@@ us in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ rad@@ ley said about it .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ rad@@ ley : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shape for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , appe@@ ar@@ ing to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ."
M@@ y happiness was so great that I said I wanted to di@@ e .
This world had no place in my affec@@ tions .
"P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ f@@ ish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I desi@@ red the wel@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st en@@ e@@ mi@@ es ."
"@@ J@@ H : So n@@ ote how B@@ rad@@ ley &apos;s pet@@ ty , mor@@ al@@ isti@@ c self just di@@ es on the way up the stair@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he be@@ comes lo@@ ving and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case .
O@@ thers use psych@@ ede@@ li@@ c dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c s@@ cr@@ ol@@ l sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ sil@@ oc@@ y@@ bin mus@@ h@@ room and at the same moment get yan@@ ked up the stair@@ case by a go@@ d .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ den@@ ce in nature .
O@@ thers o@@ ver@@ come their self at ra@@ ves .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ de@@ st place of all : war .
"So many bo@@ ok@@ s about war say the same thing , that nothing br@@ ings people together like war ."
And that br@@ ing@@ ing them together op@@ en@@ s up the possibili@@ ty of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ dent experi@@ ences .
I &apos;m going to pla@@ y for you an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this book by G@@ len@@ n G@@ ray .
G@@ ray was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in World War I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ len@@ n G@@ ray : M@@ any vet@@ er@@ ans will ad@@ mi@@ t that the experience of commun@@ al eff@@ ort in b@@ at@@ tle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; be@@ comes &quot; our &quot; and in@@ dividu@@ al fa@@ it@@ h l@@ os@@ es its c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l import@@ ance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ sur@@ ance of im@@ m@@ ort@@ ality that makes self-@@ sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce at these mom@@ ents so rela@@ tively easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not di@@ e , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ ra@@ des for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It feel@@ s some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l in the wr@@ iting of the great F@@ ren@@ ch soci@@ ologi@@ st E@@ m@@ ile D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im .
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im even called us H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , or tw@@ o@@ -@@ level man ."
The lo@@ wer level he called the level of the prof@@ an@@ e .
Now prof@@ an@@ e is the op@@ pos@@ ite of sac@@ red .
It just means ordin@@ ary or common .
And in our ordin@@ ary lives we ex@@ ist as in@@ dividu@@ als .
We want to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y our in@@ dividu@@ al desi@@ res .
We pur@@ sue our in@@ dividu@@ al go@@ als .
But some@@ times something happens that tri@@ g@@ ger@@ s a ph@@ ase change .
"In@@ dividu@@ als un@@ ite into a te@@ am , a mo@@ vement or a n@@ ation , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im called this level the level of the sac@@ red because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the fun@@ c@@ tion of religi@@ on was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral commun@@ ity ."
D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us takes on an air of sac@@ re@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people circ@@ le around some sac@@ red ob@@ ject or valu@@ e , they &apos;ll then work as a te@@ am and fi@@ ght to def@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im wr@@ ote about a set of in@@ ten@@ se col@@ lec@@ tive e@@ mo@@ tions that ac@@ comp@@ lish this mir@@ ac@@ le of E p@@ l@@ ur@@ i@@ b@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of in@@ dividu@@ als ."
Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive jo@@ y in B@@ rit@@ a@@ in on the day World War I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive ang@@ er in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which br@@ ought down a dic@@ tat@@ or ."
So let me sum@@ mar@@ ize where we are .
I &apos;m off@@ ering the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or of a stair@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x and this stair@@ case takes us up from the prof@@ an@@ e level to the level of the sac@@ red .
So here &apos;s the milli@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ lar question for social scienti@@ sts like me : I@@ s the stair@@ case a fe@@ ature of our ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary desi@@ gn ?
"I@@ s it a produc@@ t of natural se@@ lec@@ tion , like our han@@ ds ?"
Well many scienti@@ sts who study religi@@ on take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ ist@@ s , for example , ar@@ gu@@ e that religi@@ on is a set of me@@ mes , sort of par@@ a@@ si@@ tic me@@ mes , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of cra@@ z@@ y religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive stuff , like su@@ ic@@ ide bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to l@@ ose our@@ selves ?"
How could it ever be ad@@ ap@@ tive for any organ@@ ism to o@@ ver@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Char@@ les Darwin wr@@ ote a great de@@ al about the evolution of mor@@ ality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ arwin n@@ ot@@ ed that many of our vir@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to our@@ selves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as multi@@ level se@@ lec@@ tion .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of g@@ uy@@ s on a college cre@@ w te@@ am .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in this te@@ am there &apos;s com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion .
There are g@@ uy@@ s comp@@ eting with each other .
"The s@@ lo@@ w@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get cut from the te@@ am ."
And only a few of these g@@ uy@@ s are going to go on in the sp@@ ort .
"So within the te@@ am , their interest@@ s are actually p@@ it@@ ted against each other ."
And some@@ times it would be ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous for one of these g@@ uy@@ s to try to sa@@ bot@@ age the other g@@ uy@@ s .
M@@ aybe he &apos;ll b@@ ad@@ m@@ ou@@ th his ch@@ i@@ ef ri@@ val to the co@@ ach .
"But while that com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on within the bo@@ at , this com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on across bo@@ at@@ s ."
They can only win if they all pul@@ l together as a te@@ am .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary tru@@ ths ."
Let me il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate this for you .
"S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;ve got a group of little organ@@ is@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be ha@@ m@@ ster@@ s ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s sup@@ pose that this little group here , they ev@@ olved to be co@@ oper@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this si@@ mu@@ lation , as they inter@@ act they ga@@ in poin@@ ts , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led in size , you &apos;ll see them sp@@ lit , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it ga@@ ins we@@ al@@ th or poin@@ ts or f@@ ood ."
"And in sh@@ ort order , the co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders have taken over .
I@@ f a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem then it cannot re@@ ap the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation and group se@@ lec@@ tion cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fav@@ or@@ ite s@@ olution is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the mi@@ to@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a in every cell has its own D@@ N@@ A , tot@@ ally se@@ par@@ ate from the D@@ N@@ A in the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ par@@ ate fre@@ e-@@ li@@ ving bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and be@@ came a super@@ organ@@ ism .
A super@@ organ@@ ism can basically take what it wan@@ ts .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually comp@@ os@@ ed of these new super@@ organ@@ is@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is some@@ times called a ma@@ j@@ or tran@@ si@@ tion in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ arwin &apos;s la@@ ws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of play@@ er on the field and things beg@@ in to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some so@@ li@@ tar@@ y was@@ ps beg@@ an cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar@@ ly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors be@@ came cul@@ tur@@ al cre@@ atures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a ca@@ mp@@ fire , they divi@@ ded la@@ b@@ or , they beg@@ an pain@@ ting their bo@@ di@@ es , they sp@@ oke their own di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts , and even@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own go@@ ds ."
"On@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation loc@@ ked inside ."
"And they un@@ loc@@ ked the most po@@ wer@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ oper@@ ation — a force for con@@ struc@@ tion and de@@ struc@@ tion ."
L@@ o@@ ok at the people in these ph@@ ot@@ os I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing commun@@ al inter@@ est , which re@@ qui@@ res them to l@@ ose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my T@@ al@@ k de@@ li@@ vered in the stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole T@@ al@@ k over again in three minutes in a more ful@@ l@@ -@@ spec@@ tr@@ um sort of way .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ a@@ id@@ t : We human@@ s have many var@@ i@@ eties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ a@@ mes expla@@ ined ."
One of the most common is c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the se@@ cre@@ t stair@@ case and l@@ os@@ ing our@@ selves .
"The stair@@ case takes us from the experience of life as prof@@ an@@ e or ordin@@ ary up@@ wards to the experience of life as sac@@ red , or de@@ ep@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted ."
"We are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ im expla@@ ined ."
"And we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x because we ev@@ olved by multi@@ level se@@ lec@@ tion , as Darwin expla@@ ined ."
"If it is an ad@@ ap@@ tation , then we ev@@ olved to be religi@@ ous ."
"I mean that we ev@@ olved to see sac@@ re@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ am@@ s and circ@@ le around sac@@ red ob@@ jects , people and ideas ."
This is why poli@@ tics is so trib@@ al .
"P@@ o@@ li@@ tics is par@@ tly prof@@ an@@ e , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but poli@@ tics is also about sac@@ re@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ ining with others to pur@@ sue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the et@@ er@@ n@@ al str@@ u@@ g@@ gle between good and ev@@ il , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good te@@ am ."
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , if the stair@@ case is real , it expla@@ ins the per@@ sist@@ ent under@@ cur@@ r@@ ent of dis@@ sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion in modern life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , hi@@ v@@ ish cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We bu@@ sted out of the hi@@ ve dur@@ ing the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions and br@@ ought liber@@ ty to the op@@ pres@@ sed .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays we f@@ ly around like in@@ dividu@@ al be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ e@@ dom .
But some@@ times we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , but modern , se@@ cu@@ lar society was built to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y our lo@@ wer , prof@@ an@@ e selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ fort@@ able down here on the lo@@ wer level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment center ."
One great challenge of modern life is to find the stair@@ case ami@@ d all the cl@@ ut@@ ter and then to do something good and no@@ ble once you c@@ lim@@ b to the top .
I see this desi@@ re in my students at the Un@@ iversi@@ ty of V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
They all want to find a cause or cal@@ ling that they can th@@ row themselves into .
They &apos;re all sear@@ ching for their stair@@ case .
M@@ ost people long to o@@ ver@@ come pet@@ t@@ iness and become part of something lar@@ ger .
And this expla@@ ins the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary re@@ son@@ ance of this simple met@@ ap@@ h@@ or con@@ j@@ u@@ red up ne@@ ar@@ ly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land enti@@ re of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the ma@@ in . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the ple@@ as@@ u@@ res of every@@ day life .
But I want to beg@@ in with a story of an un@@ us@@ ual and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is Her@@ mann G@@ o@@ ering .
"G@@ o@@ ering was H@@ it@@ ler &apos;s second in comm@@ and in World War I@@ I , his design@@ ated success@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ ler , G@@ o@@ ering f@@ an@@ ci@@ ed h@@ im@@ self a col@@ lec@@ tor of art ."
"H@@ it@@ ler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fav@@ or@@ ite art@@ work ever .
"@@ World War I@@ I came to an end , and G@@ o@@ ering was cap@@ tu@@ red , tried at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely sen@@ ten@@ ced to de@@ ath ."
Th@@ en the Al@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his col@@ lec@@ tions and found the pa@@ int@@ ings and went after the people who s@@ old it to him .
"@@ V@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en was char@@ g@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself p@@ un@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by de@@ ath ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks into his pri@@ son sen@@ t@@ ence , v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en conf@@ es@@ sed ."
But he didn &apos;t conf@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not sel@@ l a great ma@@ ster@@ piece to that N@@ az@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it myself ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now no@@ body beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ r@@ ing me a can@@ v@@ as and some pain@@ t , and I will pain@@ t a Ver@@ me@@ er much better than I s@@ old that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ az@@ i ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful Ver@@ me@@ er .
And then the char@@ ges of tre@@ as@@ on were d@@ rop@@ ped .
"He had a les@@ s@@ er char@@ ge of for@@ ger@@ y , got a year sen@@ t@@ ence and di@@ ed a her@@ o to the D@@ ut@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en , but I want to turn now to G@@ o@@ ering , who &apos;s pic@@ tu@@ red here being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now G@@ o@@ ering was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ g@@ at@@ ors descri@@ bed him as an ami@@ c@@ able psych@@ op@@ ath .
He had disco@@ vered after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sho@@ ck .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The S@@ up@@ per at E@@ m@@ ma@@ us &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as Ver@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ ster@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ ger@@ y ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was disco@@ vered , it lost all its valu@@ e and was taken away from the mu@@ se@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psych@@ ologi@@ sts — why do ori@@ g@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we respon@@ d so much to our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ ologi@@ sts like V@@ e@@ b@@ l@@ en and W@@ ol@@ fe would ar@@ gu@@ e that the reason why we take ori@@ g@@ ins so ser@@ i@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ b@@ s , because we &apos;re f@@ ocu@@ sed on stat@@ us ."
"A@@ m@@ ong other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how po@@ wer@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an ori@@ gin@@ al than a for@@ ger@@ y because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer ori@@ gin@@ als than for@@ ger@@ ies ."
"@@ that human@@ s are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , natural born essenti@@ al@@ ist@@ s ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respon@@ d to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is condi@@ tion@@ ed on our beli@@ ef@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hi@@ d@@ den nature is ."
"I want to su@@ ggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to su@@ ggest that ple@@ as@@ ure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level ple@@ as@@ u@@ res like art , but even the most seem@@ ing@@ ly simple ple@@ as@@ u@@ res are affec@@ ted by our beli@@ ef@@ s about hi@@ d@@ den es@@ sen@@ ces ."
So take f@@ ood .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It de@@ pen@@ ds . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ ef ."
F@@ e@@ w of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a r@@ at or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a stran@@ gel@@ y col@@ or@@ ed piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so surpri@@ sing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it ta@@ st@@ es to you will de@@ p@@ end cri@@ tically on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of this was done with young children .
"H@@ ow do you make children not just be more lik@@ ely to e@@ at car@@ r@@ ots and dr@@ ink mil@@ k , but to get more ple@@ as@@ ure from e@@ ating car@@ r@@ ots and dr@@ in@@ king mil@@ k — to think they ta@@ st@@ e better ?"
How do you get a@@ du@@ l@@ ts to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
This was rec@@ ently done with a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c tw@@ ist .
In fron@@ t of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ very@@ body , of course , dr@@ in@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re dr@@ in@@ king exp@@ en@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with ple@@ as@@ ure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s tree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more ple@@ as@@ ur@@ able , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take sex .
These are sti@@ mul@@ i I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fa@@ ir@@ ly at@@ trac@@ tive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is mal@@ e , the one on the right is fe@@ mal@@ e ."
"If that beli@@ ef turns out to be mi@@ st@@ ak@@ en , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disco@@ ver that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ i@@ sed ver@@ sion of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why sp@@ ou@@ ses in happy marri@@ ag@@ es t@@ end to think that their hus@@ b@@ and or wife looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particu@@ lar@@ ly dra@@ ma@@ tic example of this comes from a neur@@ ological di@@ sor@@ der known as C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
So C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is a di@@ sor@@ der where you get a speci@@ fi@@ c de@@ lu@@ sion .
"Now of@@ ten , a res@@ ult of C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is tra@@ gic ."
But there &apos;s at le@@ ast one case where C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me had a happy en@@ ding .
This was rec@@ or@@ ded in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The golf c@@ lu@@ b@@ s were ow@@ ned by John F@@ . Ken@@ ne@@ dy and s@@ old for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ c@@ tion .
The bub@@ ble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y S@@ pe@@ ars and s@@ old for sever@@ al hund@@ re@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ ri@@ ving mark@@ et in the parti@@ ally e@@ aten f@@ ood of bel@@ o@@ ved people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are perhaps the most valu@@ able of all .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to an un@@ con@@ fir@@ med re@@ port , a S@@ au@@ di milli@@ on@@ a@@ ire off@@ er@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones th@@ ro@@ wn at Ge@@ orge B@@ ush at an Ira@@ q@@ i pres@@ s con@@ fer@@ ence sever@@ al years ago .
"W@@ it@@ h my colle@@ agu@@ es Ge@@ orge Ne@@ w@@ man and G@@ il Di@@ es@@ en@@ dru@@ ck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the ob@@ jects that people like ."
"So in one of our experim@@ ents , we asked people to na@@ me a fam@@ ous person who they ad@@ or@@ ed , a li@@ ving person they ad@@ or@@ ed ."
So one answer was Ge@@ orge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you p@@ ay for Ge@@ orge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ at@@ er ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fa@@ ir amount — more than you would p@@ ay for a brand new swe@@ at@@ er or a swe@@ at@@ er ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other groups of sub@@ jects — we gave them different re@@ stri@@ c@@ tions and different condi@@ tions .
"So for in@@ stance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , you can buy the swe@@ at@@ er , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t re@@ sel@@ l it . &quot; &quot; That d@@ rop@@ s the valu@@ e of it , su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ing that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really ca@@ u@@ ses an effec@@ t is you tell people , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , you could re@@ sel@@ l it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly w@@ ash@@ ed . &quot; &quot; That ca@@ u@@ ses a hu@@ ge drop in the valu@@ e ."
"As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve w@@ ash@@ ed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ o@@ ties . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ no@@ b and want to bo@@ ast about having an ori@@ gin@@ al ."
Wh@@ o here lik@@ es the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then re@@ port@@ ed that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on tele@@ vision , the valu@@ e of her art d@@ rop@@ ped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physic@@ ally , but the history had changed ."
So he got J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million dol@@ lar viol@@ in down to a W@@ ashington D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ ef cli@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ ol@@ in music ) Af@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"A@@ p@@ par@@ ently to really en@@ jo@@ y the music of J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re list@@ en@@ ing to J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the vide@@ o — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s standing in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s struc@@ k with p@@ ity .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and han@@ ds him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from John C@@ age &apos;s mo@@ der@@ n@@ ist comp@@ os@@ ition , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a dol@@ lar 9@@ 9 , you can list@@ en to that sil@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of sil@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about ple@@ as@@ ure , but what I want to su@@ ggest is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ lies as well to pa@@ in ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beli@@ ef@@ s about the es@@ s@@ ence of it , affec@@ t how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lo@@ v@@ ely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ ray and D@@ an We@@ gn@@ er .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful electri@@ c sho@@ c@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sho@@ c@@ ks .
"The second sho@@ ck feel@@ s less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The th@@ ir@@ d d@@ rop@@ s , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pa@@ in gets less .
"In the other condi@@ tion , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sho@@ c@@ king them on pur@@ pose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sho@@ c@@ king them ."
The first sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the th@@ ir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some ca@@ ses , pa@@ in under the right circ@@ um@@ stan@@ ces can trans@@ form into ple@@ as@@ ure ."
"The point was n@@ ic@@ ely sum@@ mar@@ iz@@ ed by the po@@ et John M@@ il@@ ton who wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ av@@ en of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ av@@ en . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
And finally I en@@ ded up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psych@@ ology by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a s@@ ki re@@ sort in S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y myself , because the s@@ now had me@@ l@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a mo@@ vi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers that there was to be a pres@@ en@@ tation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Z@@ ur@@ ich , and it was about fl@@ ying sa@@ uc@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that even@@ ing lec@@ ture was very interesting .
And this see@@ med very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his bo@@ ok@@ s after that lec@@ ture .
"And that was Carl J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose na@@ me or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psych@@ ology and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a ty@@ pic@@ al res@@ ult that many people have pres@@ en@@ ted , and there are many var@@ i@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for in@@ stance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ vey@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that has@@ n &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the person@@ al income , on a scal@@ e that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate for in@@ f@@ lation , has more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ led , almost tri@@ p@@ led , in that per@@ i@@ od ."
"But you find essenti@@ ally the same results , na@@ me@@ ly , that after a certain basi@@ c point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ ove the min@@ im@@ um po@@ ver@@ ty level — incre@@ a@@ ses in material well-being don &apos;t seem to affec@@ t how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the la@@ ck of basi@@ c resour@@ ces , material resour@@ ces , con@@ trib@@ utes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material resour@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been f@@ ocu@@ sed more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our normal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I beg@@ an to look at cre@@ ative people — first ar@@ ti@@ sts and scienti@@ sts , and so fort@@ h — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essenti@@ ally sp@@ en@@ ding their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t ex@@ pect ei@@ ther fa@@ me or fort@@ un@@ e , but which made their life me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the le@@ ad@@ ing comp@@ os@@ ers of American music back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 p@@ ag@@ es long .
But this little ex@@ cer@@ pt is a very good sum@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying dur@@ ing the inter@@ view .
And it descri@@ bes how he feel@@ s when comp@@ os@@ ing is going well .
And he says by descri@@ b@@ ing it as an ec@@ stati@@ c state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ec@@ st@@ asy &quot; &quot; in G@@ re@@ ek me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it be@@ came essenti@@ ally an anal@@ o@@ gy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordin@@ ary every@@ day r@@ ou@@ tin@@ es .
So ec@@ st@@ asy is essenti@@ ally a ste@@ p@@ ping into an al@@ ter@@ nati@@ ve reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civi@@ li@@ za@@ tions that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ les of human achi@@ ev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , G@@ re@@ ece , the Hin@@ du civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , or the M@@ ay@@ as , or E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their ec@@ sta@@ si@@ es , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the tem@@ p@@ les they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the cir@@ cu@@ ses , the ar@@ en@@ as , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"Th@@ ese are the re@@ ma@@ ins of civi@@ li@@ za@@ tions and they are the pla@@ ces that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated , more or@@ der@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ en@@ a , which is built like a G@@ re@@ ek am@@ p@@ hi@@ the@@ at@@ re , is a place for ec@@ st@@ asy also ."
We are parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He ne@@ eds just a piece of p@@ ap@@ er where he can put down little mark@@ s , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ oun@@ ds that had not exist@@ ed before in that particular com@@ bin@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er did in her impro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tion , a new reality — that is , a moment of ec@@ st@@ asy — he en@@ ters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so in@@ ten@@ se an experience that it feel@@ s almost as if he didn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
And that s@@ oun@@ ds like a kind of a ro@@ man@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
"But actually , our ner@@ v@@ ous system is inc@@ ap@@ able of pro@@ ces@@ sing more than about 1@@ 10 bi@@ ts of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bi@@ ts per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ olved in this comp@@ let@@ ely eng@@ ag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body feel@@ s , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s h@@ un@@ gr@@ y or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body dis@@ appe@@ ars , his iden@@ ti@@ ty dis@@ appe@@ ars from his con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that re@@ qui@@ res a lot of con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion , and at the same time to feel that he exist@@ s ."
So exist@@ ence is tem@@ por@@ ar@@ ily s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seems to be mo@@ ving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t comp@@ ose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ tic , sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s descri@@ b@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has developed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tru@@ ism in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of techn@@ ic@@ al-@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular field .
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics or music , it takes that long to be able to beg@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just flo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people descri@@ bed this as a sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous f@@ low that I called this ty@@ p@@ e of experience the &quot; &quot; f@@ low experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different re@@ al@@ ms .
"For in@@ stance , a po@@ et descri@@ bes it in this form ."
This is by a stu@@ dent of m@@ ine who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the le@@ ad@@ ing wr@@ it@@ ers and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it descri@@ bes the same eff@@ ort@@ less , sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this ec@@ stati@@ c state ."
"This po@@ et descri@@ bes it as op@@ en@@ ing a do@@ or that flo@@ at@@ s in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mi@@ lar descri@@ p@@ tion to what Al@@ ber@@ t Einstein gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of rela@@ tivity , when he was str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties .
"For in@@ stance , this is another stu@@ dent of m@@ ine , S@@ us@@ an J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from A@@ u@@ str@@ al@@ ia , who did work with some of the le@@ ad@@ ing a@@ th@@ let@@ es in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c s@@ kat@@ er , the same essenti@@ al descri@@ p@@ tion of the ph@@ enomen@@ ology of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the music , and so fort@@ h ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most rec@@ ent book I wr@@ ote , called &quot; &quot; G@@ ood B@@ usiness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very successful and very e@@ th@@ ical , very soci@@ ally respon@@ sible ."
You see that these people def@@ ine success as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these successful and respon@@ sible C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and successful job ."
An@@ it@@ a R@@ od@@ di@@ ck is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"She is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ o@@ dy S@@ ho@@ p , the natural cos@@ me@@ tics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a pas@@ sion that comes from doing the best and having f@@ low while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ bu@@ ka , who was at that time star@@ ting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a produc@@ t — they didn &apos;t have a produc@@ t , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to est@@ ab@@ lish a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of techn@@ ological in@@ nov@@ ation , be a@@ w@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s con@@ t@@ ent ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how f@@ low en@@ ters the work@@ place .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colle@@ agu@@ es around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an mon@@ ks , to b@@ l@@ ind n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ alay@@ an c@@ lim@@ bers , to N@@ av@@ a@@ j@@ o sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the culture , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of education or wh@@ at@@ ever , there are these seven condi@@ tions that seem to be there when a person is in f@@ low ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time dis@@ appe@@ ars , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something lar@@ ger ."
"And once the condi@@ tions are pres@@ ent , what you are doing be@@ comes wor@@ th doing for its own sak@@ e ."
"In our studies , we re@@ pres@@ ent the every@@ day life of people in this simple s@@ che@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , actually , because we give people electr@@ on@@ ic pa@@ ger@@ s that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can est@@ ab@@ lish an average , which is the center of the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the mid@@ dle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predic@@ t fa@@ ir@@ ly ac@@ cur@@ ately when you will be in f@@ low , and it will be when your challen@@ ges are high@@ er than average and sk@@ il@@ ls are high@@ er than average ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less positive .
Ar@@ ou@@ sal is still good because you are o@@ ver@@ -@@ challen@@ g@@ ed there .
"C@@ on@@ trol is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ fort@@ able , but not very exc@@ ited ."
It &apos;s not very challen@@ ging any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter f@@ low from con@@ trol , you have to increase the challen@@ ges ."
So those two are ide@@ al and comple@@ men@@ tar@@ y are@@ as from which f@@ low is easy to go into .
The other com@@ bin@@ ations of challenge and sk@@ ill become prog@@ res@@ si@@ v@@ ely less op@@ ti@@ mal .
"B@@ ore@@ dom beg@@ ins to be very a@@ ver@@ sive and ap@@ a@@ thy be@@ comes very neg@@ ative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ il@@ ls , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"The lar@@ g@@ est single con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or to that experience is wat@@ ching tele@@ vision ; the next one is being in the ba@@ th@@ room , si@@ tting ."
"E@@ ven though some@@ times wat@@ ching tele@@ vision about seven to eight percent of the time is in f@@ low , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a progra@@ m you really want to watch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ d@@ ress — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ously without any ad@@ vice , but un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our man@@ d@@ ate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have an inter@@ est in education .
S@@ hak@@ es@@ pe@@ are being seven ?
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my daughter &apos;s 1@@ 6 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les .
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
The brain isn &apos;t divi@@ ded into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments .
"Because you are , ar@@ en &apos;t you ?"
"If I &apos;m co@@ ok@@ ing , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed ."
"T@@ ak@@ e her to a d@@ ance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was ful@@ l of people like me .
P@@ eople who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a very lar@@ ge cos@@ mo@@ s , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at ei@@ ther of those scal@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins ha@@ ven &apos;t ev@@ olved to understand the world at that scal@@ e ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed on this very th@@ in sli@@ ce of per@@ cep@@ tion right in the mid@@ dle ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
But we &apos;re not see@@ ing all the wa@@ ves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tr@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ her@@ ently un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ n@@ ak@@ es inc@@ lu@@ de some in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed in their reality , and h@@ on@@ ey@@ be@@ es inc@@ lu@@ de ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et in their view of the world , and of course we build mach@@ in@@ es in the d@@ ash@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our c@@ ars to pic@@ k up on sign@@ als in the radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ enc@@ y ran@@ ge , and we built mach@@ in@@ es in h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als to pic@@ k up on the X@@ -@@ ray ran@@ ge ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at le@@ ast not yet , because you don &apos;t come equ@@ ip@@ ped with the pro@@ per sen@@ sor@@ s ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ stra@@ ined by our bi@@ ology , and that goes against the common sense no@@ tion that our ey@@ es and our e@@ ars and our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ jec@@ tive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , our bra@@ ins are sa@@ mp@@ ling just a little bit of the world ."
"So in the b@@ l@@ ind and de@@ a@@ f world of the tic@@ k , the important sign@@ als are tem@@ per@@ ature and b@@ ut@@ y@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish , its sen@@ sor@@ y world is la@@ v@@ ish@@ ly col@@ or@@ ed by electri@@ cal fiel@@ ds ; and for the e@@ ch@@ olo@@ c@@ ating b@@ at , its reality is con@@ struc@@ ted out of air comp@@ res@@ sion wa@@ ves ."
"That &apos;s the sli@@ ce of their ec@@ osy@@ stem that they can pic@@ k up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"Now , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , every ani@@ mal as@@ su@@ mes that its um@@ wel@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ jec@@ tive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ yon@@ d what we can sense ."
Let &apos;s do a con@@ sci@@ ous@@ nes@@ s@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ mag@@ ine that you are a blo@@ od@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about s@@ me@@ l@@ ling .
"You &apos;ve got a long s@@ n@@ out that has 200 million s@@ cent re@@ cep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et n@@ os@@ tr@@ il@@ s that at@@ tr@@ act and tra@@ p s@@ cent molecu@@ les , and your n@@ os@@ tr@@ il@@ s even have sli@@ ts so you can take big n@@ os@@ ef@@ ul@@ s of air ."
E@@ very@@ thing is about s@@ me@@ ll for you .
"So one day , you stop in your trac@@ ks with a re@@ ve@@ lation ."
"You look at your human ow@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the pi@@ ti@@ ful , im@@ po@@ ver@@ ish@@ ed n@@ ose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ e@@ ble little n@@ os@@ e@@ ful of air ?
"H@@ ow can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 yar@@ ds away , or that your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or was on this very s@@ po@@ t six h@@ ours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re human@@ s , we &apos;ve never experienc@@ ed that world of s@@ me@@ ll , so we don &apos;t mis@@ s it , because we are fir@@ m@@ ly se@@ tt@@ led into our um@@ wel@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be stu@@ ck there ?"
"So as a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , I &apos;m interest@@ ed in the way that technology might exp@@ and our um@@ wel@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So the way this works is , you take a mi@@ c@@ ro@@ ph@@ one and you digi@@ ti@@ ze the sign@@ al , and you put an elec@@ tro@@ de stri@@ p direc@@ tly into the in@@ ner e@@ ar ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these techn@@ ologi@@ es speak the language of S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , and it &apos;s not exactly the same di@@ al@@ ec@@ t as our natural bi@@ ological sense or@@ g@@ ans ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain fi@@ gu@@ res out how to use the sign@@ als just f@@ ine .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big se@@ cre@@ t : Y@@ our brain is not hear@@ ing or see@@ ing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is loc@@ ked in a v@@ a@@ ult of sil@@ ence and d@@ ark@@ ness inside your s@@ kul@@ l .
"A@@ ll it ever se@@ es are elec@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sign@@ als that come in along different data c@@ ab@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
And this is a very eff@@ ici@@ ent kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally a gener@@ al pur@@ pose comput@@ ing de@@ vice , and it just takes in everything and fi@@ gu@@ res out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , fre@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to tin@@ k@@ er around with different sor@@ ts of in@@ put chan@@ n@@ els ."
The brain fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom , you find lots of per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"So s@@ n@@ ak@@ es have he@@ at p@@ its with which to de@@ te@@ ct in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed , and the gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish has electr@@ ore@@ cep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ n@@ os@@ ed m@@ ole has this app@@ en@@ da@@ ge with 2@@ 2 fin@@ ger@@ s on it with which it feel@@ s around and con@@ struc@@ ts a 3@@ D mo@@ de@@ l of the world , and many bir@@ ds have magne@@ ti@@ te so they can ori@@ ent to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to continu@@ ally re@@ desi@@ gn the brain .
"In@@ ste@@ ad , with the princi@@ p@@ les of brain oper@@ ation est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is design@@ ing new per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The les@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really spe@@ cial or fun@@ da@@ mental about the bi@@ ology that we come to the t@@ able with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ her@@ ited from a comple@@ x ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to s@@ tic@@ k with , and our best pro@@ of of princi@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ sor@@ y sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion ."
"Now , that might sound spe@@ cula@@ tive , but the first p@@ ap@@ er de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating this was published in the j@@ ourn@@ al N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
Why the for@@ e@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ation is called the bra@@ in@@ port , and this is a little elec@@ tro@@ g@@ ri@@ d that si@@ ts on your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e , and the vide@@ o fe@@ ed gets turned into these little electr@@ ot@@ ac@@ ti@@ le sign@@ als , and b@@ l@@ ind people get so good at using this that they can th@@ row a b@@ all into a bas@@ k@@ et , or they can na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate comple@@ x ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds comp@@ let@@ ely insan@@ e , right ?"
"But remem@@ ber , all vision ever is is elec@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sign@@ als cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the sign@@ als come from .
It just fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with them .
"And we wanted to do this , gi@@ ven the power and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity of port@@ able comput@@ ing , we wanted to make sure that this would r@@ un on cell ph@@ ones and tab@@ le@@ ts , and also we wanted to make this a we@@ ar@@ able , something that you could we@@ ar under your c@@ lo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing , my sound is getting cap@@ tu@@ red by the tab@@ let , and then it &apos;s getting m@@ app@@ ed on@@ to a v@@ est that &apos;s co@@ vered in vibr@@ at@@ ory m@@ ot@@ ors , just like the m@@ ot@@ ors in your cell ph@@ one . So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing ,"
the sound is getting trans@@ la@@ ted to a patter@@ n of vi@@ bra@@ tion on the v@@ est .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tual : this tab@@ let is trans@@ mi@@ tting B@@ lu@@ et@@ o@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m we@@ ar@@ ing the v@@ est right now ."
So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ la@@ ted into d@@ yn@@ a@@ mic patter@@ ns of vi@@ bra@@ tion .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the son@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been test@@ ing this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start understanding the language of the v@@ est ."
So this is J@@ on@@ a@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a ma@@ ster &apos;s de@@ g@@ ree .
"He was born prof@@ oun@@ dly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ wel@@ t that &apos;s un@@ av@@ a@@ ila@@ ble to him ."
"So we had J@@ on@@ a@@ than tra@@ in with the v@@ est for four days , two h@@ ours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t No@@ v@@ ich : You .
S@@ N : Wh@@ ere . Wh@@ ere .
D@@ E : J@@ on@@ a@@ than is able to trans@@ la@@ te this comp@@ lic@@ ated patter@@ n of vi@@ bra@@ tions into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"Now , this technology has the pot@@ enti@@ al to be a ga@@ me@@ -@@ chang@@ er , because the only other s@@ olution for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ lear imp@@ lan@@ t , and that re@@ qui@@ res an inv@@ a@@ sive sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ ap@@ er than a co@@ ch@@ lear imp@@ lan@@ t , which op@@ en@@ s up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the poor@@ est countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed by our results with sen@@ sor@@ y sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ sor@@ y ad@@ di@@ tion ."
"H@@ ow could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a comp@@ let@@ ely new kind of sense , to exp@@ and the human um@@ v@@ el@@ t ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed re@@ al-@@ time data from the Inter@@ net direc@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they devel@@ o@@ p a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
"Th@@ en , two b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons appe@@ ar , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding is re@@ al-@@ time data from the sto@@ ck mark@@ et , and he &apos;s making buy and sel@@ l deci@@ sions ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re see@@ ing is , can we exp@@ and the human um@@ v@@ el@@ t so that he comes to have , after sever@@ al weeks , a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience of the economic mo@@ ve@@ ments of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll re@@ port on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ ur@@ ing the tal@@ ks this mor@@ ning , we &apos;ve been a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically s@@ cr@@ ap@@ ing T@@ wit@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ ted senti@@ ment anal@@ y@@ s@@ is , which means , are people using positive words or neg@@ ative words or ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ l ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am p@@ lu@@ gg@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate e@@ mo@@ tion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lo@@ ving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a bi@@ g@@ ger experience than a human can nor@@ m@@ ally have .
We &apos;re also expan@@ ding the um@@ v@@ el@@ t of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the v@@ est is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different measu@@ res from this qu@@ ad@@ cop@@ ter , so p@@ it@@ ch and ya@@ w and rol@@ l and ori@@ en@@ tation and he@@ ad@@ ing , and that impro@@ ves this p@@ il@@ o@@ t &apos;s abili@@ ty to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally like he &apos;s ex@@ ten@@ ding his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vi@@ sion@@ ing is tak@@ ing a modern co@@ ck@@ p@@ it ful@@ l of g@@ au@@ ges and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between ac@@ ces@@ sing big data and experiencing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possibili@@ ties on the hor@@ iz@@ on for human expan@@ sion .
"@@ Just imagine an astron@@ a@@ ut being able to feel the o@@ ver@@ all health of the Inter@@ national S@@ p@@ ace S@@ tation , or , for that matter , having you feel the in@@ vi@@ sible states of your own health , like your blo@@ od su@@ g@@ ar and the state of your mi@@ c@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ de@@ g@@ ree vision or see@@ ing in in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed or ul@@ tra@@ viol@@ et ."
"So the k@@ ey is this : A@@ s we move into the future , we &apos;re going to incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly be able to cho@@ ose our own per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"We no longer have to wa@@ it for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ sor@@ y gi@@ f@@ ts on her ti@@ mes@@ cal@@ es , but instead , like any good par@@ ent , she &apos;s gi@@ ven us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and def@@ ine our own tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris An@@ der@@ son : Can you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ e@@ ah .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I fel@@ t app@@ la@@ use on the v@@ est ."
It &apos;s ni@@ ce . It &apos;s like a mas@@ sage . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going cra@@ z@@ y . T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going ma@@ d .
So that sto@@ ck mark@@ et experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to wr@@ ite to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
So what that t@@ ells us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tri@@ ck pon@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of comput@@ ations on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through b@@ um@@ ps on their fin@@ ger@@ s ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a the@@ ore@@ tical limi@@ t that we know the ed@@ ge of .
"C@@ A : I@@ f this ch@@ ec@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be de@@ lu@@ g@@ ed ."
There are so many possible app@@ li@@ ca@@ tions for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exc@@ ited about , the direc@@ tion it might go ?"
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re standing around ."
"So I think he@@ av@@ y mach@@ in@@ er@@ y , sa@@ f@@ ety , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ t@@ ory , of your equ@@ ip@@ ment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ a@@ vi@@ d E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d@@ -@@ blo@@ wing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Chris . ( Applause )"
It &apos;s really a fa@@ il@@ ure to de@@ te@@ ct a certain kind of d@@ ang@@ er .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
"I am un@@ able to mar@@ s@@ ha@@ l this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are just st@@ op@@ s getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to con@@ si@@ der why this might happen .
What could stop us from doing this ?
A ful@@ l@@ -@@ scal@@ e n@@ uc@@ lear war ?
A global pan@@ de@@ mic ?
A@@ n a@@ ster@@ o@@ id imp@@ act ?
J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber be@@ coming pre@@ si@@ dent of the United States ?
But that isn &apos;t the most lik@@ ely scen@@ ari@@ o .
It &apos;s not that our mach@@ in@@ es will become sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ously mal@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent .
Just think about how we rela@@ te to an@@ ts .
We don &apos;t h@@ ate them .
"Now , I s@@ us@@ pect this seems f@@ ar-@@ f@@ et@@ ched to many of you ."
And there are only three of them .
In@@ t@@ el@@ li@@ gence is a matter of information pro@@ ces@@ sing in physic@@ al syste@@ ms .
The second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will continu@@ e to impro@@ ve our intelli@@ g@@ ent mach@@ in@@ es .
We want to c@@ ure dise@@ a@@ ses like Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and can@@ cer .
We want to understand economic syste@@ ms . We want to impro@@ ve our cli@@ mate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"Now , just con@@ si@@ der the smar@@ test person who has ever li@@ ved ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s sh@@ ort@@ li@@ st here is John v@@ on Ne@@ u@@ mann .
Here we have John v@@ on Ne@@ u@@ mann .
And then we have you and me .
And it &apos;s important to recogn@@ ize that this is true by vir@@ tu@@ e of spe@@ ed alone .
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dru@@ d@@ ger@@ y .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intel@@ lec@@ tual work .
So what would ap@@ es like our@@ selves do in this circ@@ um@@ stance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to pla@@ y F@@ ri@@ s@@ be@@ e and give each other mas@@ sa@@ ges ."
This is a w@@ in@@ ner@@ -@@ tak@@ e-@@ all scen@@ ari@@ o .
"And if you ha@@ ven &apos;t no@@ tic@@ ed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is how long we &apos;ve had the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ imp@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on tele@@ vision .
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just coun@@ ting down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship lan@@ ds ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ gen@@ cy than we do .
"&quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re feel@@ ing depres@@ sed ? Just sh@@ ak@@ e it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , a@@ du@@ l@@ ts get tri@@ c@@ ked this way as well , all the time ."
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people fun@@ c@@ tion bel@@ ow their ac@@ tual pot@@ enti@@ al ."
Why ? Because of poor e@@ mo@@ tional hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
T@@ o r@@ um@@ in@@ ate means to che@@ w over .
He had vi@@ sible t@@ um@@ ors all over his body .
And he had to start a har@@ sh course of che@@ mo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experim@@ ents in behavi@@ or@@ al science .
I bring you into a room .
"He ga@@ ther@@ ed his parti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ cen@@ tiv@@ ize them .
It du@@ l@@ ls thinking and b@@ loc@@ ks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even cl@@ ose ."
"@@ Re@@ wards , by their very nature , n@@ ar@@ row our f@@ ocu@@ s , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many ca@@ ses ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ed this research ?
The good news is that the scienti@@ sts who &apos;ve been stu@@ d@@ ying mo@@ tiv@@ ation have gi@@ ven us this new approach .
A@@ ut@@ on@@ omy : the ur@@ ge to direc@@ t our own lives .
Ma@@ ster@@ y : the desi@@ re to get better and better at something that mat@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about a@@ ut@@ on@@ omy .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment ."
M@@ an@@ a@@ ge@@ ment did not e@@ man@@ ate from nature .
S@@ ome@@ body in@@ ven@@ ted it .
"But if you want eng@@ a@@ ge@@ ment , self-@@ direc@@ tion works better ."
How many of you have heard of the comp@@ any A@@ t@@ las@@ si@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ bly co@@ ol .
"A@@ ut@@ on@@ omy , ma@@ ster@@ y and pur@@ pose , the building b@@ loc@@ ks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another enc@@ y@@ cl@@ op@@ edi@@ a got started ."
The dri@@ ve to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Jo@@ e K@@ ow@@ an : I have st@@ age f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had st@@ age f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
I had this ir@@ ra@@ tional fear .
There were like 20 people there .
"But I took a de@@ ep bre@@ ath , and I sign@@ ed up to pla@@ y , and I fel@@ t pretty good ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic ner@@ v@@ ous system k@@ ic@@ ks in ."
"I mean , your ner@@ v@@ ous system is an i@@ di@@ o@@ t ."
And something good did happen — I had the tin@@ i@@ est little g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of that au@@ dience connec@@ tion that I was hop@@ ing for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness .
"That only seems au@@ th@@ en@@ tic when I have st@@ age f@@ right , and the more ner@@ v@@ ous I was , the better the son@@ g would be . E@@ asy ."
"B@@ y having a son@@ g that expla@@ ined what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the au@@ dience per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"And even@@ tually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to pla@@ y the st@@ age f@@ right son@@ g at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really ner@@ v@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be o@@ kay if I play@@ ed the st@@ age f@@ right son@@ g for you ?"
( Applause ) Can I have a si@@ p of water ?
"I@@ mag@@ ine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the size of a golf b@@ all .
So en@@ vision what it looks like all wr@@ app@@ ed up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel lo@@ ved and app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated like never before and re@@ conne@@ ct with friends and ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ tan@@ ces you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ d@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion will o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will re@@ cal@@ i@@ br@@ ate what &apos;s most important in your life .

This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wr@@ app@@ ed up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a r@@ are ge@@ m — a brain t@@ um@@ or , he@@ man@@ gi@@ ob@@ la@@ sto@@ ma — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ ep@@ s on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m o@@ kay now , I wouldn &apos;t w@@ ish this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ oun@@ dly al@@ ter@@ ed my life in ways I didn &apos;t ex@@ pect in all the ways I just sh@@ ar@@ ed with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s un@@ expec@@ ted , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , con@@ si@@ der that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ ra@@ id of w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od .
"@@ Not that I &apos;m not af@@ ra@@ id now , but I &apos;ve learned to pre@@ t@@ end ."
I &apos;ve learned to be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ac@@ k in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were sup@@ posed to be kind and thou@@ ght@@ ful and pretty and gen@@ tle and so@@ ft , and we were sup@@ posed to f@@ it into rol@@ es that were sort of s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y — really not quite c@@ lear what we were sup@@ posed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were p@@ len@@ ty of r@@ ole mo@@ de@@ ls all around us .
"We had our mothers , our a@@ un@@ ts , our cou@@ sin@@ s , our si@@ ster@@ s , and of course , the e@@ ver@@ -@@ pres@@ ent me@@ dia bomb@@ ar@@ ding us with imag@@ es and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a ho@@ me@@ mak@@ er , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ lie things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me p@@ ink out@@ f@@ its ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ought me a book of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that h@@ um@@ or was ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able in my family , I could dra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to speak — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ val ."
I was la@@ un@@ ched as a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are ru@@ les out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t per@@ form them right , even though we are imp@@ r@@ in@@ ted at bir@@ th with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important col@@ or in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re sup@@ posed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to we@@ ar — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our ha@@ ir — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the ru@@ les that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ stan@@ tly being mon@@ it@@ or@@ ed by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ rec@@ ted , and the pri@@ mar@@ y poli@@ ce@@ men are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the tradi@@ tion ."
We pas@@ s it down from generation to generation .
Not only that — we always have this v@@ agu@@ e no@@ tion that something &apos;s expec@@ ted of us .
"And on top of all off these ru@@ les , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it p@@ ut@@ s us in a very ten@@ u@@ ous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these ru@@ les , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite a@@ w@@ are that I &apos;m follo@@ wing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with h@@ um@@ or ?"
H@@ um@@ or reli@@ es on the tradi@@ tions of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it tw@@ ist@@ s it ."
"It takes the co@@ des of behavi@@ or and the co@@ des of d@@ ress , and it makes it un@@ expec@@ ted , and that &apos;s what eli@@ c@@ its a la@@ u@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and h@@ um@@ or ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground flo@@ or , and we know the tradi@@ tions so well , we can bring a different v@@ o@@ ice to the t@@ able ."
Now I started dra@@ wing in the mid@@ dle of a lot of c@@ ha@@ os .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ ashington D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ dur@@ ing the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts mo@@ vement , the as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ations , the W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate hear@@ ings and then the fe@@ min@@ ist mo@@ vement , and I think I was dra@@ wing , trying to fig@@ ure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in c@@ ha@@ os , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with la@@ u@@ ghter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y par@@ ents got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced , and my si@@ ster was ar@@ re@@ sted ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar high he@@ els , I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar p@@ ink , and I could feel like I f@@ it in ."
"Now when I was a little ol@@ der , in my 20@@ s , I re@@ alized there are not many women in car@@ to@@ on@@ ing ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can bre@@ ak the little g@@ las@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing of car@@ to@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I be@@ came a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always lo@@ ved political car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the con@@ t@@ ent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the stu@@ p@@ id ru@@ les that we &apos;re follo@@ wing as well as la@@ u@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particu@@ lar@@ ly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particu@@ lar@@ ly American per@@ spec@@ tive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ ven though I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the ru@@ les that I &apos;m talking about are univer@@ sal , of course — that each culture has its different co@@ des of behavi@@ or and d@@ ress and tradi@@ tions , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , we have ."
"W@@ omen , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tradi@@ tion ."
We have amaz@@ ing an@@ ten@@ na@@ e .
"Now my work la@@ t@@ ely has been to col@@ labor@@ ate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ on@@ ist@@ s , which I so en@@ jo@@ y , and it &apos;s gi@@ ven me a great@@ er app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tr@@ ut@@ h , to get at the is@@ su@@ es quickly and suc@@ c@@ inc@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the intel@@ lec@@ t , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has allowed me to col@@ labor@@ ate with women car@@ to@@ on@@ ist@@ s from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ bi@@ a , I@@ ran , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , Ar@@ gen@@ tin@@ a , F@@ ran@@ ce — and we have s@@ at together and la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed and tal@@ ked and sh@@ ar@@ ed our diffic@@ ul@@ ties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their v@@ o@@ ices heard in some very difficult circ@@ um@@ stan@@ ces .
But I feel b@@ les@@ sed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong per@@ cep@@ tions , because of our ten@@ u@@ ous position and our r@@ ole as tradi@@ tion@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great pot@@ enti@@ al to be chan@@ ge@@ -@@ a@@ gen@@ ts ."
"And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one la@@ u@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .

But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We st@@ um@@ b@@ led on your vide@@ o on de@@ c@@ im@@ als , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ mi@@ tive .
And the K@@ h@@ an A@@ ca@@ de@@ my vide@@ os are there .
G@@ re@@ en means the stu@@ dent &apos;s already prof@@ ici@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
What are the mes@@ sa@@ ges we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this clas@@ s together .
W@@ omen do not ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate for themselves in the work@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; I@@ f you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got lu@@ ck@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ o@@ y , it mat@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone lik@@ ed H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the comp@@ li@@ cation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ l@@ li@@ s R@@ o@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people con@@ si@@ der an un@@ us@@ ual fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it feel@@ s natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the mor@@ ning of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had per@@ ish@@ ed yet until 3@@ 6 h@@ ours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were af@@ ra@@ id of what our country was going to do in the na@@ me of our son — my hus@@ b@@ and , Or@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sho@@ ck , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sho@@ ck , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble expl@@ os@@ i@@ on in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not ven@@ ge@@ ful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was in@@ dic@@ ted on six coun@@ ts of con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy to com@@ mi@@ t ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , and the U.S. govern@@ ment called for a de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty for him , if con@@ vic@@ ted , my hus@@ b@@ and and I sp@@ oke out in op@@ position to that , publi@@ c@@ ly ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough that and through human ri@@ ghts groups , we were br@@ ought together with sever@@ al other vic@@ ti@@ ms &apos; famili@@ es ."
"When I saw A@@ ich@@ a in the me@@ dia , coming over when her son was in@@ dic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a bra@@ ve woman ."
S@@ ome@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m stron@@ ger . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep g@@ ri@@ ef ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the st@@ ren@@ g@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a vic@@ tim , I got im@@ medi@@ ate sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy ."
"But when people learned what her son was ac@@ cu@@ sed of , she didn &apos;t get that sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy ."
But her suff@@ ering is equal to m@@ ine .
"So we met in No@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ ich@@ a will now tell you how that came about ."
"( T@@ r@@ ans@@ la@@ tor ) A@@ ich@@ a el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : G@@ ood af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ di@@ es and gen@@ tle@@ men ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation of H@@ u@@ man R@@ i@@ ghts to put me in tou@@ ch with the par@@ ents of the vic@@ ti@@ ms .
So they in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed me to five famili@@ es .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ l@@ li@@ s , and I wat@@ ched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , si@@ ster@@ s ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suff@@ er@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was marri@@ ed when I was 14 .
"I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 1@@ 6 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
"And I still suff@@ er , because my son is like he &apos;s bur@@ i@@ ed ali@@ ve ."
I know she really cri@@ ed for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s ali@@ ve . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tor@@ tu@@ red .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suff@@ ering is something positive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be han@@ d@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism ."
"I go to schools to talk to young , M@@ us@@ lim girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be marri@@ ed against their will very young ."
"So if I can sa@@ ve one of the young girls , and av@@ o@@ id that they get marri@@ ed and suff@@ er as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in fron@@ t of you .
"P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ ich@@ a , star@@ ting with that day we had our very first me@@ eting with other family mem@@ bers — which was a very pri@@ v@@ ate me@@ eting with se@@ cur@@ ity , because it was No@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , we were af@@ ra@@ id of the super@@ -@@ pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tis@@ m of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ bers ."
But we were all so ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"B@@ ef@@ ore we knew each others &apos; na@@ mes , or anything , we had em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed and we@@ pt ."
"Th@@ en we s@@ at in a circ@@ le with sup@@ port , with help , from people experienc@@ ed in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"And A@@ ich@@ a started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ no@@ cent , but I want to tell you how sor@@ ry I am for what happened to your famili@@ es ."
"I know what it is to suff@@ er , and I feel that if there is a cri@@ me , a person should be tried fa@@ ir@@ ly and p@@ un@@ ish@@ ed . &quot; &quot; But she re@@ ach@@ ed out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ ak@@ er ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connec@@ ted as human be@@ ings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three h@@ ours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d fel@@ t as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these pres@@ ent circ@@ um@@ stan@@ ces and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a tot@@ ally different culture and environ@@ ment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a spe@@ cial connec@@ tion , which I valu@@ e very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ ra@@ id of the other , but making that ste@@ p and then re@@ aliz@@ ing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ ich@@ a , do you have a couple of words for con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( T@@ r@@ ans@@ la@@ tor ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your hear@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."

"In 200@@ 8 , C@@ y@@ cl@@ one N@@ arg@@ is dev@@ ast@@ ated M@@ yan@@ mar ."
M@@ il@@ li@@ ons of people were in sever@@ e need of help .
The U.@@ N@@ . wanted to r@@ ush people and sup@@ p@@ lies to the are@@ a .
"But there were no m@@ ap@@ s , no m@@ ap@@ s of ro@@ a@@ ds , no m@@ ap@@ s sho@@ wing h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als , no way for help to re@@ ach the c@@ y@@ cl@@ one vic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"When we look at a ma@@ p of L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les or L@@ on@@ don , it is hard to believe that as of 200@@ 5 , only 15 percent of the world was m@@ app@@ ed to a ge@@ o@@ -@@ co@@ da@@ ble level of deta@@ il ."
The U.@@ N@@ . ran he@@ ad@@ first into a problem that the ma@@ j@@ ority of the world &apos;s pop@@ ul@@ ous fac@@ es : not having deta@@ i@@ led m@@ ap@@ s .
But help was coming .
"A@@ t Google , 40 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers used a new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to ma@@ p 1@@ 20@@ ,000 kil@@ ome@@ ters of ro@@ a@@ ds , 3@@ ,000 h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als , lo@@ gi@@ s@@ tics and reli@@ ef poin@@ ts ."
And it took them four days .
The new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are they used ? Google M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er .
Google M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er is a technology that em@@ po@@ w@@ ers each of us to ma@@ p what we know loc@@ ally .

"So , I was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exc@@ ited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic new treat@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exc@@ ited .

"And he expla@@ ined to me that , when I s@@ have , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the ha@@ ir is , but on the right side of my face I was b@@ ad@@ ly bur@@ ned so I have no ha@@ ir , and this cre@@ ates la@@ ck of sy@@ mme@@ try ."
And what &apos;s the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to tat@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sy@@ mme@@ tri@@ c .
It s@@ oun@@ ded interesting . He asked me to go and s@@ have .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a strange way to s@@ have , because I thought about it and I re@@ alized that the way I was s@@ having then would be the way I would s@@ have for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the wi@@ d@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his off@@ ice , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ ek@@ s with little black d@@ ots — not very in@@ forma@@ tive ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow ol@@ der and my ha@@ ir be@@ comes wh@@ ite ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have las@@ ers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ cer@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the bi@@ ggest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ jo@@ y looking n@@ on@@ -@@ sy@@ mme@@ tri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ ver@@ ted ple@@ as@@ ure from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have sex with you more fre@@ qu@@ ently ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very surpri@@ sing to me , because I &apos;ve g@@ one through many treat@@ ments — there were many treat@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ex@@ t@@ ent ."
But I decided not to have this treat@@ ment .
"And I went to his de@@ p@@ ut@@ y and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Wh@@ ere was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he expla@@ ined that they have done this pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure on two patients already , and they need the th@@ ir@@ d pati@@ ent for a p@@ ap@@ er they were wr@@ iting ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a s@@ ch@@ mu@@ ck .
"@@ R@@ ight , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experim@@ ents in the la@@ b ."
"And when we r@@ un experim@@ ents , we us@@ u@@ ally hop@@ e that one group will be@@ have differ@@ ently than another ."
"So we had one group that I hop@@ ed their performan@@ ce would be very high , another group that I thought their performan@@ ce would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — a@@ side from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was sup@@ posed to have very high performan@@ ce that was actually per@@ form@@ ing ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , dest@@ ro@@ ying my stati@@ s@@ tical sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ance of the test ."
So I looked car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years ol@@ der than any@@ body else in the sa@@ m@@ ple .
And I remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the la@@ b wan@@ ting to make some easy c@@ as@@ h and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ tas@@ tic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s th@@ row him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever inc@@ lu@@ de a dr@@ un@@ ken guy in a sa@@ m@@ ple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this dr@@ un@@ ken guy was not in that condi@@ tion ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"W@@ ould we have th@@ ro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ tas@@ tic ! What a smar@@ t guy who is per@@ form@@ ing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lo@@ wer , giving us even stron@@ ger stati@@ s@@ tical results than we could ."
So we decided not to th@@ row the guy out and to r@@ er@@ un the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experim@@ ents that we &apos;ve done on conf@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est , basically kind of bring two poin@@ ts to the for@@ e@@ ground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to tat@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the inc@@ enti@@ ves that get them to be b@@ lin@@ ded to reality and give us ad@@ vice that is in@@ her@@ ently bi@@ a@@ sed .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recogn@@ ize , and we see that it happens ."
"M@@ aybe we don &apos;t recogn@@ ize it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recogn@@ ize that some@@ times we too are b@@ lin@@ ded by our own inc@@ enti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult les@@ son to take into ac@@ coun@@ t ."
Because we don &apos;t see how conf@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experim@@ ents , in my mind , I was hel@@ ping science ."
I was eli@@ min@@ ating the data to get the true patter@@ n of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a k@@ ni@@ ght trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ fer@@ ing with the process with lots of good in@@ ten@@ tions .
"And I think the real challenge is to fig@@ ure out where are the ca@@ ses in our lives where conf@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to trust our own in@@ tu@@ ition to o@@ ver@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ al@@ ling pre@@ y to these behavi@@ ors , because we can create lots of un@@ desi@@ ra@@ ble circ@@ um@@ stan@@ ces ."
I do want to lea@@ ve you with one positive thought .
"I mean , this is all very depres@@ sing , right — people have conf@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The positive per@@ spec@@ tive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms of why we fa@@ il and where we fa@@ il , we can actually hop@@ e to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the hop@@ e . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tr@@ ut@@ h of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ ition that inequ@@ ality is divi@@ sive and soci@@ ally cor@@ ros@@ i@@ ve has been around since before the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequ@@ ality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the lin@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you ex@@ ist .
"But first , see what a mi@@ ser@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a par@@ a@@ do@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life expec@@ tan@@ cy against gr@@ os@@ s national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like Nor@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as rich as I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , G@@ re@@ ece , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expec@@ tan@@ cy at all .
There &apos;s no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life expec@@ tan@@ cy ."
"Th@@ ese are small are@@ as of Eng@@ land and W@@ al@@ es — the poor@@ est on the right , the rich@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
E@@ ven the people just bel@@ ow the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that par@@ a@@ do@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at rela@@ tive income or social position , social stat@@ us — where we are in re@@ lation to each other and the size of the g@@ ap@@ s between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ medi@@ ately won@@ der : what happens if we wi@@ den the differ@@ ences , or comp@@ ress them , make the income differ@@ ences bi@@ g@@ ger or s@@ mal@@ ler ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical data .
I &apos;m tak@@ ing data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the World B@@ ank has — on the scal@@ e of income differ@@ ences in these rich developed mark@@ et democr@@ ac@@ ies .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much rich@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equal countries on the left — Japan , F@@ in@@ land , Nor@@ way , S@@ we@@ den — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more un@@ equal end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore — the differ@@ ences are tw@@ ice as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are tw@@ ice as un@@ equal as some of the other successful mark@@ et democr@@ ac@@ ies ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We col@@ lec@@ ted data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social la@@ d@@ der ."
"In@@ ter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally com@@ par@@ able data on life expec@@ tan@@ cy , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ acy s@@ cor@@ es , on in@@ f@@ ant m@@ ort@@ ality r@@ ates , ho@@ mi@@ ci@@ de r@@ ates , pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son , te@@ en@@ age bir@@ thr@@ ates , lev@@ els of trust , o@@ be@@ si@@ ty , mental il@@ l@@ ness — which in stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic clas@@ si@@ fi@@ cation inc@@ lu@@ des dru@@ g and al@@ co@@ h@@ ol ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mo@@ bili@@ ty ."
We put them all in one inde@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ i@@ gh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
Wh@@ ere a country is is a sort of average s@@ c@@ ore on these things .
"And there , you see it in re@@ lation to the measure of inequ@@ ality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sh@@ all use over and over again in the data ."
The more un@@ equal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily cl@@ ose cor@@ re@@ lation .
"But if you look at that same inde@@ x of health and social problems in re@@ lation to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a , gr@@ os@@ s national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ re@@ lation any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our arg@@ ument and just man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red this evidence , so we also did a p@@ ap@@ er in the Bri@@ ti@@ sh M@@ edi@@ cal J@@ ourn@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F inde@@ x of child well-being ."
It has 40 different comp@@ on@@ ents put together by other people .
"It con@@ ta@@ ins whether kids can talk to their par@@ ents , whether they have bo@@ ok@@ s at home , what im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation r@@ ates are like , whether there &apos;s bul@@ l@@ ying at school ."
E@@ very@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in re@@ lation to that same measure of inequ@@ ality .
K@@ i@@ ds do worse in the more un@@ equal societies .
H@@ i@@ gh@@ ly sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in re@@ lation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not de@@ pen@@ dent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in poor@@ er countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differ@@ ences between us and where we are in re@@ lation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the se@@ par@@ ate bi@@ ts of our inde@@ x .
"H@@ ere , for in@@ stance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tru@@ sted .
It comes from the World V@@ al@@ u@@ es S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more un@@ equal end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equal societies , it ri@@ ses to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at measu@@ res of inv@@ ol@@ vement in commun@@ ity life or social cap@@ ital , very si@@ mi@@ lar relation@@ shi@@ ps cl@@ os@@ ely rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality ."
"I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a se@@ par@@ ate test bed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American states — asking just the same question : do the more un@@ equal states do worse on all these kinds of measu@@ res ?"
So here is trust from a gener@@ al social sur@@ v@@ ey of the fe@@ der@@ al govern@@ ment rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality .
Ver@@ y si@@ mi@@ lar s@@ cat@@ ter over a si@@ mi@@ lar ran@@ ge of lev@@ els of trust .
Sa@@ me thing is going on .
B@@ a@@ sically we found that almost anything that &apos;s rela@@ ted to trust inter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally is rela@@ ted to trust am@@ on@@ g@@ st the 50 states in that se@@ par@@ ate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a flu@@ ke .
This is mental il@@ l@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together fi@@ gu@@ res using the same di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom sa@@ mp@@ les of the population to al@@ low us to comp@@ are r@@ ates of mental il@@ l@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental il@@ l@@ ness in the pre@@ ce@@ ding year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental il@@ l@@ ness of others .
"And again , cl@@ os@@ ely rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality ."
This is violence .
"Th@@ ese red d@@ ots are American states , and the b@@ lu@@ e tri@@ ang@@ les are C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an pro@@ v@@ inc@@ es ."
But look at the scal@@ e of the differ@@ ences .
It goes from 15 ho@@ mi@@ ci@@ des per million up to 150 .
This is the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son .
"There &apos;s a about a ten@@ f@@ old difference there , lo@@ g scal@@ e up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pri@@ son .
That relation@@ ship is not ma@@ in@@ ly dri@@ ven by more cri@@ me .
"In some pla@@ ces , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ un@@ itive sen@@ ten@@ c@@ ing , har@@ sh@@ er sen@@ ten@@ c@@ ing ."
And the more un@@ equal societies are more lik@@ ely also to re@@ tain the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty .
Here we have children d@@ rop@@ ping out of high school .
"A@@ ga@@ in , quite big differ@@ ences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily da@@ mag@@ ing , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mo@@ bili@@ ty .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mo@@ bili@@ ty based on income .
"B@@ a@@ sically , it &apos;s asking : do rich fa@@ thers have rich s@@ ons and poor fa@@ thers have poor s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more un@@ equal end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ can@@ din@@ a@@ vi@@ an countries , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bili@@ ty .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the au@@ dience here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to Den@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ic@@ s here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that t@@ end to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are en@@ d@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are worse in more un@@ equal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the exp@@ en@@ se , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two poin@@ ts .
"One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , wh@@ at@@ ever the out@@ come , seem to be the more un@@ equal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nor@@ di@@ c countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ fun@@ c@@ tion rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , S@@ we@@ den and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways ."
"The position of women , how cl@@ os@@ ely they keep to the n@@ uc@@ lear family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the p@@ ol@@ es in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their great@@ er equ@@ ality .
"S@@ we@@ den has hu@@ ge differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it n@@ ar@@ ro@@ ws the ga@@ p through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al wel@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous ben@@ ef@@ its and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much s@@ mal@@ ler differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lo@@ wer ta@@ x@@ es .
It has a s@@ mal@@ ler wel@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our anal@@ y@@ s@@ is of the American states , we find rather the same con@@ tr@@ ast ."
"There are some states that do well through re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion , some states that do well because they have s@@ mal@@ ler income differ@@ ences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ c@@ lu@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your great@@ er equ@@ ality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about per@@ fe@@ ct equ@@ ality , I &apos;m talking about what exist@@ s in rich developed mark@@ et democr@@ ac@@ ies ."
A@@ no@@ ther really surpri@@ sing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are affec@@ ted by inequ@@ ality .
There seems to be some tr@@ ut@@ h in John D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ land . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to comp@@ are how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s in@@ f@@ ant m@@ ort@@ ality .
S@@ ome S@@ w@@ ede@@ s very kin@@ dly clas@@ si@@ fied a lot of their in@@ f@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Bri@@ ti@@ sh regi@@ ster of gener@@ al soci@@ o@@ economic clas@@ si@@ fi@@ cation .
"And so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ ron@@ is@@ tically a clas@@ si@@ fi@@ cation by fa@@ thers &apos; oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations , so single par@@ ents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social clas@@ s , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ il@@ led man@@ ual oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the sk@@ il@@ led man@@ ual oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations in the mid@@ dle , then the j@@ uni@@ or n@@ on@@ -@@ man@@ ual , going up high to the profes@@ si@@ onal oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ations — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of lar@@ ger comp@@ an@@ ies ."
You see there that S@@ we@@ den does better than B@@ rit@@ a@@ in all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
The bi@@ ggest differ@@ ences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small ben@@ ef@@ it to being in a more equal society ."
We show that on about five different se@@ ts of data co@@ ver@@ ing edu@@ ca@@ tional out@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ nati@@ on@@ ally .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that great@@ er equ@@ ality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some ben@@ ef@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial effec@@ ts of inequ@@ ality .
"M@@ ore to do with feel@@ ings of super@@ i@@ ority and in@@ fer@@ i@@ ority , of being valu@@ ed and dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed , res@@ pec@@ ted and dis@@ res@@ pec@@ ted ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the stat@@ us com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that comes out of that dri@@ ves the con@@ sum@@ er@@ ism in our society ."
It also lea@@ ds to stat@@ us in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed and seen by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ gar@@ ded as at@@ trac@@ tive , c@@ le@@ ver , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments ."
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , some par@@ al@@ le@@ l work going on in social psych@@ ology : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different studies in which v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been inv@@ ited into a psych@@ ological labor@@ at@@ ory and had their st@@ ress hor@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing st@@ res@@ s@@ ful tas@@ ks , measu@@ red ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interest@@ ed in see@@ ing is what kind of st@@ res@@ ses most reli@@ ably ra@@ ise lev@@ els of cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , the c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l st@@ ress hor@@ m@@ one ."
And the con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion was it was tas@@ ks that inc@@ lu@@ ded soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ at@@ s to self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m or social stat@@ us in which others can neg@@ ati@@ v@@ ely j@@ u@@ dge your performan@@ ce .
Th@@ ose kind of st@@ res@@ ses have a very particular effec@@ t on the phy@@ si@@ ology of st@@ ress .
Now we have been cri@@ tic@@ iz@@ ed .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surpri@@ sing ."
"I should tell you though that when people cri@@ tic@@ ize us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pic@@ k and cho@@ ose data ."
"We have an ab@@ sol@@ ute ru@@ le that if our data s@@ our@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ y@@ s@@ is ."
"O@@ ur data s@@ our@@ ce deci@@ des whether it &apos;s reli@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise that would in@@ tro@@ duce bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in re@@ lation to income and equ@@ ality in the ac@@ ade@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed j@@ ourn@@ als .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequ@@ ality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we con@@ trol for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated me@@ th@@ o@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have con@@ tr@@ ol@@ led for po@@ ver@@ ty and education and so on ."
What about ca@@ us@@ ality ?
C@@ or@@ re@@ lation in itself doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve ca@@ us@@ ality .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And inde@@ ed , people know the ca@@ u@@ sal lin@@ ks quite well in some of these out@@ comes ."
"The big change in our understanding of dri@@ ver@@ s of ch@@ ron@@ ic health in the rich developed world is how important ch@@ ron@@ ic st@@ ress from social s@@ our@@ ces is affec@@ ting the im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar system ."
"O@@ r for in@@ stance , the reason why violence be@@ comes more common in more un@@ equal societies is because people are sen@@ si@@ tive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the pos@@ t@@ -@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ stra@@ in income , the bon@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our b@@ os@@ ses ac@@ coun@@ t@@ able to their emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in any way we can .
I think the tak@@ e-@@ home message though is that we can impro@@ ve the real qu@@ ality of human life by re@@ duc@@ ing the differ@@ ences in in@@ comes between us .
"S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly we have a han@@ dle on the psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial well-being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exc@@ iting ."
Thank you .

"The great 20@@ th@@ -@@ century gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ist , T@@ .@@ G@@ .

"( Laughter ) But if you do ac@@ cept bi@@ ological evolution , con@@ si@@ der this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?"
"D@@ o@@ es it app@@ ly to others , or does it app@@ ly to us ?"
This is another look at the tree of life .
"In this picture , I &apos;ve put a b@@ ush with a center br@@ an@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exist@@ ing speci@@ es at the ti@@ ps of those br@@ an@@ ch@@ es has suc@@ ce@@ eded in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated a f@@ it@@ ness to its environ@@ ment ."
"The human part of this br@@ an@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interest@@ ed in ."
We br@@ an@@ ch off of a common an@@ ce@@ st@@ or to modern ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
"In the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 2@@ 5 different speci@@ es of h@@ om@@ in@@ i@@ ds ."
S@@ ome have come and g@@ one .
"We have been here for about 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."
"It may seem like we &apos;re quite re@@ m@@ ote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basi@@ c mach@@ in@@ er@@ y of our cells is pretty much the same ."
Do you re@@ al@@ ize that we can take ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the mach@@ in@@ er@@ y of a common bac@@ ter@@ i@@ um to produce the prot@@ e@@ in of human in@@ sul@@ in used to treat dia@@ be@@ tics ?

A@@ re we at some kind of ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise as a speci@@ es ?
"O@@ r , are we dest@@ ined to become something different — something , perhaps , even better ad@@ ap@@ ted to the environ@@ ment ?"
"Now let &apos;s take a ste@@ p back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago — the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years — the first sign@@ s of prot@@ o@@ -@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi@@ -@@ c@@ el@@ led organ@@ is@@ ms , perhaps as much as 8@@ 00 or a billion years ago — and then the human speci@@ es , finally emer@@ ging in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."
"In this v@@ ast un@@ fin@@ ish@@ ed sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y of the universe , life on Earth is like a bri@@ ef measure ; the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gr@@ ace n@@ ote ."
That was us .
"That also con@@ sti@@ tut@@ es the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so I hop@@ e you en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed it ."
"( Laughter ) Now when I was a fre@@ sh@@ man in college , I took my first bi@@ ology clas@@ s ."
I was f@@ as@@ cin@@ ated by the ele@@ gan@@ ce and be@@ a@@ ut@@ y of bi@@ ology .
"I be@@ came en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of the power of evolution , and I re@@ alized something very fun@@ da@@ mental : in most of the exist@@ ence of life in sin@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ el@@ led organ@@ is@@ ms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the gen@@ e@@ tic energy of that cell is car@@ ri@@ ed on in both daughter cells ."
"But at the time multi@@ -@@ c@@ el@@ led organ@@ is@@ ms come on@@ line , things start to change ."
S@@ ex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion en@@ ters the picture .
"And very import@@ an@@ tly , with the in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion of se@@ x@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion that pas@@ ses on the gen@@ ome , the rest of the body be@@ comes exp@@ en@@ da@@ ble ."
"In fact , you could say that the in@@ ev@@ it@@ abili@@ ty of the de@@ ath of our bo@@ di@@ es en@@ ters in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary time at the same moment as se@@ x@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"Now I have to conf@@ ess , when I was a college under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate , I thought , o@@ kay , sex / de@@ ath , sex / de@@ ath , de@@ ath for sex — it see@@ med pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , I &apos;ve come to have incre@@ as@@ ing d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts ."
"I &apos;ve come to understand the senti@@ ments of Ge@@ orge Bur@@ ns , who was per@@ form@@ ing still in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s ."
"And one ni@@ ght , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his h@@ ot@@ el room do@@ or ."
He ans@@ w@@ ers the do@@ or .
"S@@ tan@@ ding before him is a g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , s@@ can@@ ti@@ ly c@@ la@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl ."
"She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for su@@ per sex . &quot;"
"&quot; That &apos;s f@@ ine , &quot; says Ge@@ orge , &quot; I &apos;ll take the s@@ ou@@ p . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I came to re@@ al@@ ize , as a phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an , that I was working to@@ ward a go@@ al which was different from the go@@ al of evolution — not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory , just different ."
I was trying to pres@@ er@@ ve the body .
I wanted to keep us heal@@ thy .
I wanted to re@@ st@@ ore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and heal@@ thy lives .
"Ev@@ olution is all about pas@@ sing on the gen@@ ome to the next generation , ad@@ ap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation ."
"F@@ rom an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary point of view , you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter ro@@ ck@@ ets design@@ ed to sen@@ d the gen@@ e@@ tic pay@@ lo@@ ad into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the se@@ a ."
"I think we would all understand the senti@@ ment that W@@ oo@@ dy Al@@ l@@ en ex@@ pres@@ sed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achi@@ eve im@@ m@@ ort@@ ality through my work ."
I want to achi@@ eve it through not d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Ev@@ olution does not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily fav@@ or the lon@@ ge@@ st@@ -@@ li@@ ved .
"It doesn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily fav@@ or the bi@@ ggest or the stron@@ g@@ est or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test ."
Ev@@ olution fav@@ ors those cre@@ atures best ad@@ ap@@ ted to their environ@@ ment .
That is the s@@ ole test of survi@@ val and success .
"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the o@@ ce@@ an , bac@@ ter@@ ia that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ c and can survi@@ ve at the ste@@ am v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise produce , if f@@ ish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de co@@ ok@@ ed f@@ ish , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able environ@@ ment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of human@@ s in evolution , and particu@@ lar@@ ly as we look a@@ head to the next ph@@ ase , I would say that there are a number of possibili@@ ties ."
The first is that we will not ev@@ ol@@ ve .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise .
"And the reas@@ on@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise be se@@ lec@@ ted out and be re@@ mo@@ ved from the population ."
"And secon@@ dly , we as a speci@@ es have so con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red our environ@@ ment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it ad@@ ap@@ t to us as well as we ad@@ ap@@ t to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ate and cir@@ cula@@ te and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ola@@ tion that is ne@@ cess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possibili@@ ty is that there will be evolution of the tradi@@ tional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the arg@@ ument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able ."
"And as far as is@@ ola@@ tion goes , when we as a speci@@ es do col@@ on@@ ize dist@@ ant planets , there will be the is@@ ola@@ tion and the environ@@ mental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a th@@ ir@@ d possibili@@ ty , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possibili@@ ty ."
"I call it ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ ide@@ d and ch@@ os@@ en by us as in@@ dividu@@ als in the cho@@ ices that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ ices about their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more mal@@ es than fe@@ mal@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the in@@ dividu@@ al and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to cho@@ ose , not simply to cho@@ ose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the gen@@ e@@ tic ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ments that would c@@ ure or pre@@ v@@ ent dise@@ a@@ ses ."
What if you could make the gen@@ e@@ tic changes to eli@@ min@@ ate dia@@ bet@@ es or Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of can@@ cer or eli@@ min@@ ate st@@ ro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject started in 19@@ 9@@ 0 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ ish@@ ed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"T@@ o@@ day , you can have a comple@@ te se@@ qu@@ ence of the three billion b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a we@@ ek ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ dol@@ lar human gen@@ ome , and it will be incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly av@@ a@@ ila@@ ble for everyone ."
"@@ Just a we@@ ek ago , the N@@ ati@@ onal A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Eng@@ ine@@ ering a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ rap@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze to F@@ ran@@ c@@ is Ar@@ n@@ old and W@@ il@@ le@@ m S@@ tem@@ m@@ er , two scienti@@ sts who inde@@ pen@@ den@@ tly developed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work fa@@ ster and to le@@ ad to desi@@ ra@@ ble prot@@ e@@ ins in a more eff@@ ici@@ ent way — what F@@ ran@@ ces Ar@@ n@@ old cal@@ ls &quot; &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the L@@ as@@ k@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze was a@@ war@@ ded to the scienti@@ st S@@ h@@ in@@ ya Y@@ a@@ man@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an a@@ du@@ l@@ t sk@@ in cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bla@@ st , and by man@@ ip@@ ula@@ ting just four gen@@ es , he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to re@@ ver@@ t to a p@@ l@@ ur@@ i@@ pot@@ enti@@ al stem cell — a cell pot@@ enti@@ ally cap@@ ab@@ le@@ "
of be@@ coming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in bac@@ ter@@ ia can make vir@@ u@@ ses that will not only prot@@ ec@@ t you against themselves , but in@@ duce im@@ m@@ un@@ ity against other vir@@ u@@ ses ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ent@@ al tri@@ al going on with v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine against in@@ flu@@ en@@ za that has been gro@@ wn in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ c@@ o plan@@ t ."
Can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ c@@ o ?
"Th@@ ese are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be e@@ ver@@ more possible ."
I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ v@@ a , or change the ne@@ w@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing a better chan@@ ce at a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er life — eli@@ min@@ ate the dia@@ bet@@ es , eli@@ min@@ ate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of can@@ cer ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want heal@@ th@@ i@@ er children ?
"And then , that same anal@@ y@@ tic technology , that same eng@@ ine of science that can produce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also en@@ able us to a@@ do@@ pt super@@ -@@ at@@ trib@@ utes , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties — that better mem@@ ory ."
"Wh@@ y not have the quic@@ k w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next generation of the W@@ at@@ son machine ?"
Why not have the quic@@ k t@@ wit@@ ch mus@@ c@@ le that will en@@ able you to r@@ un fa@@ ster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a position where we can pas@@ s it on to the next generation , and we can a@@ do@@ pt the at@@ trib@@ utes we want , we will have con@@ ver@@ ted ol@@ d@@ -@@ st@@ yle evolution into ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that nor@@ m@@ ally might re@@ qu@@ ire 10@@ 0,000 years , and we can comp@@ ress it down to a th@@ ous@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"Th@@ ese are cho@@ ices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"W@@ ill we use these cho@@ ices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?"
"O@@ r , will we se@@ lec@@ tively cho@@ ose different at@@ trib@@ utes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more ro@@ b@@ ust and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most prof@@ oun@@ dly of all , will we ever be able to devel@@ o@@ p the w@@ is@@ dom , and to in@@ her@@ it the w@@ is@@ dom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ ices wi@@ se@@ ly ?"
"For better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these cho@@ ices will be up to us ."
Thank you .

"One thing the world ne@@ eds , one thing this country des@@ per@@ ately ne@@ eds is a better way of conduc@@ ting our political de@@ b@@ ates ."
We need to re@@ disco@@ ver the lost art of demo@@ cra@@ tic arg@@ ument .
I have a su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion .
But we too r@@ ar@@ ely ar@@ ti@@ cula@@ te and def@@ end and ar@@ gu@@ e about those big moral questions in our poli@@ tics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion .
"F@@ irst , let me take a fam@@ ous ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her who wr@@ ote about those questions of j@@ us@@ tice and mor@@ ality , give you a very sh@@ ort lec@@ ture on A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ en@@ s , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s theory of j@@ us@@ tice , and then have a dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion here to see whether A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and ar@@ gu@@ e about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?"
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le , j@@ us@@ tice means giving people what they de@@ ser@@ ve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lec@@ ture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions beg@@ in when it comes to ar@@ gu@@ ing about who de@@ ser@@ ves what and why .
T@@ ak@@ e the example of fl@@ utes .
S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;re dist@@ ri@@ b@@ ut@@ ing fl@@ utes .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best fl@@ ute ?
You can just call it out .
( A@@ u@@ dience : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el San@@ de@@ l : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
O@@ r by the first person to r@@ ush into the h@@ all to get them .
How many say the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?"
P@@ et@@ er : The great@@ est ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
MS : The great@@ est ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
That &apos;s P@@ et@@ er ? ( A@@ u@@ dience : P@@ et@@ er . ) MS : A@@ ll right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is play@@ ed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble music .
"But P@@ et@@ er , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and some@@ times ar@@ gu@@ e about , the pur@@ pose of the thing , or the social ac@@ tivity — in this case , mu@@ sic@@ al performan@@ ce ."
"And the point , the essenti@@ al nature , of mu@@ sic@@ al performan@@ ce is to produce exc@@ ell@@ ent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ produc@@ t that we &apos;ll all ben@@ ef@@ it .
"But when we think about j@@ us@@ tice , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the essenti@@ al nature of the ac@@ tivity in question and the qu@@ ali@@ ties that are wor@@ th h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ mir@@ ing and recogn@@ iz@@ ing ."
"Now , fl@@ utes may seem ... the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of fl@@ utes may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al case ."
Let &apos;s take a con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example of the di@@ sp@@ ute about j@@ us@@ tice .
It had to do with golf .
"C@@ a@@ sey Martin — a few years ago , C@@ a@@ sey Martin — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good gol@@ f@@ er , but he had a di@@ sa@@ bili@@ ty ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a cir@@ cula@@ t@@ ory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ri@@ ed ri@@ s@@ k of in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ onal G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers &apos; As@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a golf car@@ t in the P@@ G@@ A t@@ ourn@@ am@@ ents ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fa@@ ir ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge . &quot; &quot; He su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the golf car@@ t , because the la@@ w says that the di@@ sa@@ b@@ led must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ated , pro@@ vi@@ ded the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dation does not change the essenti@@ al nature of the ac@@ tivity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great gol@@ f@@ er ."
I want to comp@@ et@@ e .
But I need a golf car@@ t to get from one h@@ ole to the next . &quot; &quot; S@@ up@@ pose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
S@@ up@@ pose you were deci@@ ding the j@@ us@@ tice of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ a@@ sey Martin does have a right to use a golf car@@ t ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a p@@ ol@@ l , show of han@@ ds ."
How many would ru@@ le in fav@@ or of C@@ a@@ sey Martin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"A@@ ll right , we have a good divi@@ sion of op@@ in@@ i@@ on here ."
"S@@ ome@@ one who would not gr@@ ant C@@ a@@ sey Martin the right to a golf car@@ t , what would be your reason ?"
"@@ R@@ a@@ ise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a mi@@ c@@ ro@@ ph@@ one ."
( A@@ u@@ dience : It &apos;d be an un@@ fa@@ ir ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge . ) MS : It would be an un@@ fa@@ ir ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge if he gets to ri@@ de in a golf car@@ t .
"A@@ ll right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf car@@ t wor@@ ry about an un@@ fa@@ ir ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge ."
How would you answer the ob@@ jec@@ tion ?
"Y@@ es , all right ."
A@@ u@@ dience : The car@@ t &apos;s not part of the game .
Char@@ lie : The car@@ t &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : But what about walking from h@@ ole to h@@ ole ?
Char@@ lie : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the game of golf ?
"C@@ har@@ lie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : A@@ ll right . S@@ ta@@ y there , Char@@ lie ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for Char@@ lie ?
"A@@ ll right , who has an answer for Char@@ lie ?"
What would you say ?
"A@@ u@@ dience : The en@@ dur@@ ance ele@@ ment is a very important part of the game , walking all those h@@ ol@@ es ."
MS : W@@ al@@ king all those h@@ ol@@ es ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ( A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely . ) MS : What &apos;s your na@@ me ? ( A@@ u@@ dience : W@@ ar@@ ren . ) MS : W@@ ar@@ ren .
"C@@ har@@ lie , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ ren ?"
Char@@ ley : I &apos;ll s@@ tic@@ k to my ori@@ gin@@ al th@@ es@@ is .
W@@ ar@@ ren : I am not a gol@@ f@@ er .
"C@@ har@@ ley : And I am . ( MS : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lo@@ wer cour@@ t , they br@@ ought in gol@@ f@@ ing great@@ s to tes@@ ti@@ f@@ y on this very issue ."
I@@ s walking the course essenti@@ al to the game ?
And they br@@ ought in J@@ ac@@ k N@@ ic@@ k@@ la@@ us and Ar@@ n@@ old P@@ al@@ m@@ er .
And what do you sup@@ pose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ ren .
"They said , y@@ es , walking the course is st@@ ren@@ u@@ ous physic@@ al ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ."
The f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e fac@@ tor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fun@@ da@@ mental nature of the game to give him the golf car@@ t .
"Now , no@@ tice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you sup@@ pose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ a@@ sey Martin must be pro@@ vi@@ ded a golf car@@ t ."
"S@@ even to two , they ru@@ led ."
"What was interesting about their r@@ ul@@ ing and about the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion about the right , the j@@ us@@ tice , of the matter de@@ pen@@ ded on fig@@ ur@@ ing out what is the essenti@@ al nature of golf ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And J@@ us@@ tice St@@ even@@ s , wr@@ iting for the ma@@ j@@ ority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essenti@@ al point of the game is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a h@@ ole in as few st@@ ro@@ k@@ es as possible , and that walking was not essenti@@ al , but inci@@ den@@ tal ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ sen@@ ters , one of wh@@ om was J@@ us@@ tice S@@ cal@@ ia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gr@@ an@@ ted the car@@ t , and he had a very interesting dis@@ s@@ ent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ jec@@ ted the A@@ rist@@ ot@@ eli@@ an pre@@ mi@@ se under@@ l@@ ying the ma@@ j@@ ority &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; T@@ o say that something is essenti@@ al is ordin@@ ar@@ ily to say that it is ne@@ cess@@ ary to the achi@@ ev@@ ement of a certain ob@@ ject .
J@@ us@@ tice S@@ cal@@ ia &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on is ques@@ tion@@ able for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , no real sp@@ or@@ ts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ f we had thought that the ru@@ les of the sp@@ or@@ ts we care about are mer@@ ely ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary , rather than design@@ ed to call fort@@ h the vir@@ tu@@ es and the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ces that we think are wor@@ thy of ad@@ mir@@ ing , we wouldn &apos;t care about the out@@ come of the game ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ jec@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it see@@ med to be — this de@@ b@@ ate about the golf car@@ t — an arg@@ ument about fa@@ ir@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fa@@ ir ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge ."
"But if fa@@ ir@@ ness were the only thing at st@@ ak@@ e , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous s@@ olution ."
"But le@@ tting everyone ri@@ de in a car@@ t would have been , I s@@ us@@ pect , more an@@ a@@ the@@ ma to the gol@@ f@@ ing great@@ s and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ a@@ sey Martin ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as de@@ lic@@ ately as possible : G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers are a little sen@@ si@@ tive about the a@@ th@@ le@@ tic stat@@ us of their game .
"( Laughter ) Af@@ ter all , there &apos;s no run@@ ning or j@@ um@@ ping , and the b@@ all stan@@ ds still . ( Laughter )"
"So if gol@@ f@@ ing is the kind of game that can be play@@ ed while ri@@ ding around in a golf car@@ t , it would be hard to conf@@ er on the gol@@ f@@ ing great@@ s the stat@@ us that we conf@@ er , the h@@ onor and recogn@@ ition that goes to truly great a@@ th@@ let@@ es ."
"That il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates that with golf , as with fl@@ utes , it &apos;s hard to deci@@ de the question of what j@@ us@@ tice re@@ qui@@ res , without gr@@ app@@ ling with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essenti@@ al nature of the ac@@ tivity in question , and what qu@@ ali@@ ties , what exc@@ el@@ len@@ ces connec@@ ted with that ac@@ tivity , are wor@@ thy of h@@ onor and recogn@@ ition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fin@@ al example that &apos;s pro@@ min@@ ent in con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary political de@@ b@@ ate : sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
"There are those who fav@@ or state recogn@@ ition only of tradi@@ tional marri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fav@@ or state recogn@@ ition of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
How many here fav@@ or the first poli@@ cy : the state should recogn@@ ize tradi@@ tional marri@@ age only ?
"And how many fav@@ or the second , sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ pon@@ ents of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age say that the pur@@ pose of marri@@ age , fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ thy of h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and recogn@@ iz@@ ing and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging ."
"So with fl@@ utes , with golf car@@ ts , and even with a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely con@@ test@@ ed question like sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le has a point ."
Ver@@ y hard to ar@@ gu@@ e about j@@ us@@ tice without first ar@@ gu@@ ing about the pur@@ pose of social in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions and about what qu@@ ali@@ ties are wor@@ thy of h@@ onor and recogn@@ ition .
"So let &apos;s ste@@ p back from these ca@@ ses and see how they sh@@ ed light on the way we might impro@@ ve , e@@ lev@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a ten@@ den@@ cy to think that if we eng@@ age too direc@@ tly with moral questions in poli@@ tics , that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement , and for that matter , a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on ."
"So better to sh@@ y away from , to i@@ gn@@ ore , the moral and the religi@@ ous con@@ vic@@ tions that people bring to civi@@ c life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore the art of demo@@ cra@@ tic arg@@ ument ."

to sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age — that was a gen@@ i@@ us lin@@ k .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of op@@ en education ."
Y@@ our lec@@ ture ser@@ ies was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next ph@@ ase of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , inv@@ iting questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ ining in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ ight . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong B@@ each , and we do it in a clas@@ s@@ room at Har@@ var@@ d with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and ar@@ gu@@ ing , eng@@ ag@@ ing ser@@ i@@ ously with big moral questions , expl@@ or@@ ing cul@@ tur@@ al differ@@ ences and conne@@ ct through a live vide@@ o ho@@ ok@@ up , students in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing and M@@ um@@ ba@@ i and in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge , M@@ as@@ sac@@ hu@@ se@@ t@@ ts and create a global clas@@ s@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"So I work in mark@@ eting , which I love , but my first pas@@ sion was physics , a pas@@ sion br@@ ought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gra@@ y ha@@ ir ."
So he ta@@ u@@ ght me that physics is co@@ ol because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So quic@@ k show of han@@ ds — who studi@@ ed some mark@@ eting in univer@@ si@@ ty ?
Wh@@ o studi@@ ed some physics in univer@@ si@@ ty ?
P@@ re@@ tty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly this will bring back some happy , or pos@@ si@@ bly some sli@@ gh@@ tly dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing me@@ mor@@ ies ."
"So , physics and mark@@ eting ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s L@@ a@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als mas@@ s times ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es should have studi@@ ed a bit more car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly before they ran this ca@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ gn .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge this form@@ ul@@ a quickly , we can get to ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ation equ@@ als force over mas@@ s , which means that for a lar@@ ger partic@@ le — a lar@@ ger mas@@ s — it re@@ qui@@ res more force to change its direc@@ tion ."
"It &apos;s the same with br@@ an@@ ds : the more mas@@ sive a brand , the more b@@ ag@@ g@@ age it has , the more force is needed to change its pos@@ i@@ tion@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why Ar@@ th@@ ur An@@ der@@ sen ch@@ ose to la@@ un@@ ch A@@ c@@ c@@ ent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the world that An@@ der@@ sen &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ coun@@ tan@@ cy .
"It expla@@ ins why H@@ o@@ over found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the world that it was more than v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and why comp@@ an@@ ies like Un@@ ile@@ ver and P &@@ am@@ p@@ ; G keep br@@ an@@ ds se@@ par@@ ate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ r@@ ing@@ les and D@@ ove rather than having one gi@@ ant par@@ ent brand ."
"The mark@@ eting is , the bi@@ g@@ ger a brand , the more difficult it is to re@@ position it ."
So think about a port@@ f@@ o@@ li@@ o of br@@ an@@ ds or maybe new br@@ an@@ ds for new ven@@ tures .
"Now , who remem@@ bers H@@ e@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty princi@@ ple ?"
G@@ et@@ ting a little more techn@@ ical now .
"So this says that it &apos;s im@@ possible , by defin@@ ition , to measure exactly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the position — and the mom@@ en@@ tum of a partic@@ le , because the act of meas@@ ur@@ ing it , by defin@@ ition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the ph@@ ot@@ on of light has mom@@ en@@ tum , which kno@@ c@@ ks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y meas@@ ur@@ ing it , the act of measu@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of observ@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in mark@@ eting .
"So with the act of ob@@ ser@@ ving con@@ sum@@ ers , changes their behavi@@ or ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mom@@ s who are talking about their wonderful children in a f@@ ocu@@ s group , and almost n@@ one of them buy lots of j@@ un@@ k f@@ ood ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s sel@@ ls hund@@ re@@ ds of milli@@ ons of bur@@ ger@@ s every year ."
"Y@@ et , at Google , we know it &apos;s the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sear@@ ched for cat@@ eg@@ ory ."
"So lu@@ ck@@ ily , the science — no , sor@@ ry — the mark@@ eting is getting e@@ a@@ si@@ er ."
"L@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , with now better poin@@ t@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ sal@@ e trac@@ king , more di@@ git@@ al me@@ dia con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , you can measure more what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never ac@@ cur@@ ately and exactly measure a partic@@ le , because the observ@@ ation changes it ."
"The mark@@ eting is — the message for mark@@ eting is — that try to measure what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can ga@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is or a pos@@ i@@ tion@@ ing , and it will st@@ ren@@ g@@ then it , but it will not con@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely pro@@ ve it ."
And only one con@@ tr@@ ary data point can b@@ low your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ tol@@ e@@ my had do@@ z@@ en@@ s of data poin@@ ts to sup@@ port his theory that the planets would r@@ ot@@ ate around the Earth .
It only took one ro@@ b@@ ust observ@@ ation from C@@ oper@@ n@@ ic@@ us to b@@ low that idea out of the water .
"T@@ ak@@ e B@@ P — they sp@@ ent milli@@ ons of p@@ oun@@ ds over many years building up its cre@@ den@@ ti@@ als as an environ@@ men@@ t@@ ally fri@@ en@@ dly brand , but then one little ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
Th@@ ink about T@@ oy@@ ot@@ a .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ vered as the most reli@@ able of c@@ ars , and then they had the big rec@@ all inci@@ dent ."
"And Ti@@ ger W@@ oo@@ ds , for a long time , the per@@ fe@@ ct brand am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot pro@@ ve a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ pro@@ ve it — any hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is is sh@@ ak@@ y ."
"And the mark@@ eting is that not matter how much you &apos;ve in@@ ve@@ sted in your brand , one bad we@@ ek can under@@ m@@ ine de@@ ca@@ des of good work ."
So be really car@@ e@@ ful to try and av@@ o@@ id the scre@@ w@@ -@@ up@@ s that can under@@ m@@ ine your brand .
"And la@@ st@@ ly , to the sli@@ gh@@ tly ob@@ s@@ c@@ ure world of entropy — the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ yn@@ ami@@ c@@ s ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the di@@ sor@@ der of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of mark@@ eting .
"If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much con@@ tr@@ ol@@ led by one mark@@ eting man@@ ager could pretty much def@@ ine a brand ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a strong brand i@@ ma@@ ge or a message and put it out there like the C@@ on@@ serv@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you l@@ ose con@@ trol of it .
"W@@ it@@ h the kind of di@@ git@@ al com@@ ment cre@@ ation and dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion to@@ ols that are av@@ a@@ ila@@ ble now to every con@@ sum@@ er , it &apos;s im@@ possible to con@@ trol where it goes ."
"Y@@ our brand star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more c@@ ha@@ o@@ tic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your con@@ trol . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ se@@ tt@@ ling for mark@@ et@@ ers , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of brand energy gets your brand cl@@ os@@ er to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of energy a demo@@ cra@@ ti@@ z@@ ing force , which is ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely good for your brand ."
"So , the les@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fun@@ da@@ mental la@@ w ."
The message for mark@@ eting is that your brand is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ br@@ ace it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .

"We are going to take a quic@@ k v@@ oy@@ age over the cogn@@ itive history of the 20@@ th century , because dur@@ ing that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
"As you all know , the c@@ ars that people dro@@ ve in 19@@ 00 have al@@ ter@@ ed because the ro@@ a@@ ds are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed , too ."
"Now , this dra@@ ma@@ tic change was dra@@ wn to my at@@ ten@@ tion through mas@@ sive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . ga@@ ins over time , and these have been truly mas@@ sive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts than each suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding generation back to the time that they were in@@ ven@@ ted .
"In@@ de@@ ed , if you s@@ c@@ ore the people a century ago against modern nor@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 70 ."
"If you s@@ c@@ ore us against their nor@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ i@@ sed all sor@@ ts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ medi@@ ate an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ tar@@ dation ?
Because 70 is nor@@ m@@ ally the s@@ c@@ ore for mental re@@ tar@@ dation .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the cut@@ ting line for gi@@ f@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and ar@@ gu@@ e for a th@@ ir@@ d al@@ ter@@ nati@@ ve that &apos;s much more il@@ lum@@ in@@ ating than ei@@ ther of those , and to put this into per@@ spec@@ tive , let &apos;s imagine that a Mar@@ ti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion ."
"And this Mar@@ ti@@ an was an ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ologi@@ st , and they found s@@ cor@@ es , tar@@ get s@@ cor@@ es , that people had used for sho@@ ot@@ ing ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a min@@ ute , people had only put one bul@@ let in the bul@@ l@@ se@@ ye ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five bul@@ le@@ ts in the bul@@ l@@ se@@ ye in a min@@ ute ."
And then about 19@@ 1@@ 8 they put a hundred bul@@ le@@ ts in the bul@@ l@@ se@@ ye .
"And in@@ iti@@ ally , that ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ologi@@ st would be ba@@ ff@@ led ."
"They would say , look , these te@@ sts were design@@ ed to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their ey@@ e@@ sight was , whether they had con@@ trol of their we@@ ap@@ on ."
How could these performan@@ ces have es@@ cal@@ ated to this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous de@@ g@@ ree ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equ@@ ip@@ ment that was in the han@@ ds of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was respon@@ sible , not great@@ er ke@@ en@@ ness of eye or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental ar@@ til@@ ler@@ y that we have pic@@ ked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ k@@ er will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ ur@@ ia ."
"He found that they were resi@@ st@@ ant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to spe@@ cula@@ ting about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions or using lo@@ gic on those ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions ."
Now let me give you a sa@@ m@@ ple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He tal@@ ked to the head man of a person in r@@ ural R@@ us@@ si@@ a .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 19@@ 00 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do c@@ ro@@ ws and f@@ ish have in common ?"
"And the f@@ ell@@ ow said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a f@@ ish . I can &apos;t e@@ at a c@@ row ."
A c@@ row can pe@@ ck at a f@@ ish .
"The other is a bir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interest@@ ed , effec@@ tively , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And then L@@ ur@@ ia went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no ca@@ me@@ ls in Ger@@ many ."
H@@ am@@ bur@@ g is a c@@ ity in Ger@@ many .
"And L@@ ur@@ ia said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words imp@@ ly ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for ca@@ me@@ ls . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was un@@ w@@ il@@ ling to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to ca@@ me@@ ls being in villa@@ ges , and he was quite un@@ able to use the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to ask h@@ im@@ self what if there were no ca@@ me@@ ls in Ger@@ many ."
"And L@@ ur@@ ia said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the N@@ ort@@ h P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ars are wh@@ ite ."
"What col@@ or are the be@@ ars at the N@@ ort@@ h P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch a thing is to be se@@ tt@@ led by tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ y ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ il@@ ling to eng@@ age in this .
"One of them said to L@@ ur@@ ia , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that ar@@ en &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tions .
"F@@ irst , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma ."
"That is , we &apos;ve g@@ one from four to eight years of education to 12 years of for@@ mal education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experienc@@ ed some ty@@ p@@ e of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
You can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it lo@@ gi@@ c@@ ally con@@ sist@@ ent .
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 45 states that exist@@ ed at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exam@@ s that the state of O@@ hi@@ o gave in 19@@ 9@@ 0 , they were all about ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions ."
"They were things like , why is the lar@@ g@@ est c@@ ity of a state r@@ ar@@ ely the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in Har@@ ri@@ s@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ hi@@ la@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
So the ten@@ or of education has changed .
"We are e@@ duc@@ ating people to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , to use ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions , and to lin@@ k them lo@@ gi@@ c@@ ally ."
What about emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ?
"Well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of Americ@@ ans pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed profes@@ sions that were cogn@@ i@@ tively de@@ man@@ ding ."
On@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or doc@@ tors or teachers .
"T@@ o@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans pr@@ ac@@ tice cogn@@ i@@ tively de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions , not only to the profes@@ sions pro@@ per like la@@ w@@ yer or doc@@ tor or scienti@@ st or lec@@ tur@@ er , but many , many sub@@ -@@ profes@@ sions having to do with being a techn@@ ici@@ an , a computer program@@ m@@ er ."
A whole ran@@ ge of profes@@ sions now make cogn@@ itive de@@ man@@ ds .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cogn@@ i@@ tively de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions .
The profes@@ sions have been up@@ gra@@ ded .
"C@@ om@@ p@@ are the doc@@ tor in 19@@ 00 , who really had only a few tri@@ c@@ ks up his s@@ le@@ eve , with the modern gener@@ al pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or speci@@ al@@ ist , with years of scienti@@ fi@@ c tra@@ ining ."
They went far be@@ yon@@ d that 19@@ 00 ban@@ k@@ er .
They had to get comp@@ lic@@ ated C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ squ@@ ar@@ ed in order to bun@@ dle de@@ b@@ t together and make de@@ b@@ t look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a far@@ m@@ er today .
I take the far@@ m man@@ ager of today as very different from the far@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 00 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ gra@@ ding of tas@@ ks like la@@ w@@ yer and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ man@@ ds on our cogn@@ itive fac@@ ul@@ ties .
But I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about education and emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ ily a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her .
"Now over the last century , in developed n@@ ations like America , moral de@@ b@@ ate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , and we also take univer@@ s@@ als ser@@ i@@ ously and look for lo@@ gi@@ cal connec@@ tions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univer@@ si@@ ty at the time of Martin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having arg@@ um@@ ents with their par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ dly r@@ ac@@ i@@ ally bi@@ a@@ sed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were in@@ fer@@ i@@ or .
"And when we said to our par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents , &quot; How would you feel if tom@@ or@@ row mor@@ ning you w@@ oke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the du@@ m@@ best thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mor@@ es and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they had in@@ her@@ ited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the ol@@ der generation says , well , our govern@@ ment takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their govern@@ ment to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ il@@ ling to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an I@@ s@@ la@@ mic father wh@@ ose daughter has been rap@@ ed , and he feel@@ s he &apos;s h@@ on@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ her@@ ited mor@@ es .
"T@@ o@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were kno@@ c@@ ked un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous and so@@ do@@ miz@@ ed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the K@@ or@@ an ."
That &apos;s not one of the princi@@ p@@ les I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univer@@ sal@@ ize your princi@@ p@@ les ."
You state them as ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions and you use lo@@ gic on them .
"You have to say , well , bla@@ ck@@ ness of sk@@ in , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that ."
It must be that bla@@ c@@ ks are some@@ how tain@@ ted .
"And you can get moral arg@@ ument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral princi@@ p@@ les as con@@ cre@@ te enti@@ ties ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univer@@ s@@ als , to be ren@@ der@@ ed con@@ sist@@ ent by lo@@ gic ."
That &apos;s what in@@ iti@@ ally got me going on cogn@@ itive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the ga@@ ins have been great@@ est in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ at@@ ter@@ y that are about using lo@@ gic on ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions .
"And in 19@@ 00 , people could do simple anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es ."
"That is , if you said to them , cat@@ s are like w@@ il@@ d@@ cat@@ s ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 19@@ 60 , people could at@@ tac@@ k R@@ av@@ en &apos;s on a much more s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two squ@@ ar@@ es follo@@ wed by a tri@@ ang@@ le , what follo@@ ws two circ@@ les ?"
They could say a se@@ mi@@ circ@@ le .
"@@ Just as a tri@@ ang@@ le is half of a squ@@ are , a se@@ mi@@ circ@@ le is half of a circ@@ le ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , college gra@@ du@@ ates , if you said two circ@@ les follo@@ wed by a se@@ mi@@ circ@@ le , two si@@ x@@ te@@ en@@ s follo@@ wed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 1@@ 6 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very di@@ sh@@ e@@ art@@ en@@ ing ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t made prog@@ ress on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve no@@ tic@@ ed , in a tr@@ end am@@ ong young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about for@@ ei@@ gn lan@@ ds , and they &apos;re essenti@@ ally a@@ hi@@ stor@@ ical ."
They live in the bub@@ ble of the pres@@ ent .
They don &apos;t know the K@@ ore@@ an War from the war in V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time We@@ ster@@ n ar@@ mi@@ es have g@@ one to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan to put its h@@ ou@@ se in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous oc@@ ca@@ sions ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had bar@@ ely left , and there wasn &apos;t a tr@@ ace in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six w@@ ars .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ tic n@@ ote .
"L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people ba@@ thing in the N@@ ort@@ h S@@ e@@ a , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what wh@@ ite bo@@ di@@ es the lo@@ wer or@@ ders have ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s if they were a re@@ p@@ ti@@ le ."
"A@@ n i@@ ma@@ ge is wor@@ th more than a th@@ ous@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few imag@@ es that I rec@@ ently cap@@ tu@@ red ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ her , as an ar@@ ti@@ st , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it is an i@@ ma@@ ge of a so@@ ap bub@@ ble cap@@ tu@@ red at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ st@@ ing , as you can see in this i@@ ma@@ ge , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little be@@ a@@ ds of oil pain@@ t , strange li@@ qui@@ ds that be@@ have in very pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ways , or pain@@ t that is mo@@ de@@ led by cen@@ tri@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ al for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to lin@@ k those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate this based on three pro@@ jects .
The first one has to do with making sound vi@@ sible .
"Now as you may know , sound tra@@ v@@ els in wa@@ ves , so if you have a speak@@ er , a speak@@ er actually does nothing else than tak@@ ing the au@@ di@@ o sign@@ al , trans@@ form it into a vi@@ bra@@ tion , which is then tran@@ sp@@ ort@@ ed through the air , is cap@@ tu@@ red by our e@@ ar , and trans@@ for@@ med into an au@@ di@@ o sign@@ al again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound wa@@ ves vi@@ sible ?"
So I came up with the follo@@ wing se@@ tu@@ p .
"I took a speak@@ er , I pla@@ ced a th@@ in f@@ oil of pla@@ s@@ tic on top of that speak@@ er , and then I ad@@ ded tiny little cr@@ y@@ st@@ als on top of that speak@@ er ."
"And now , if I would pla@@ y a sound through that speak@@ er , it would cause the cr@@ y@@ st@@ als to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very f@@ ast , in the b@@ lin@@ k of an eye , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tu@@ red this mo@@ tion with a ca@@ mer@@ a that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 f@@ ra@@ mes per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ u@@ sic : &quot; &quot; Te@@ ar@@ drop &quot; &quot; by M@@ as@@ sive A@@ tt@@ ac@@ k ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty amaz@@ ing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ n@@ y story .
I got an in@@ do@@ or sun@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ ot@@ ing in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les .
"Now in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , you could get a de@@ cent sun@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ ach@@ es , but I got m@@ ine in@@ do@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at 3@@ ,000 f@@ ra@@ mes per second , you need to have a sil@@ ly amount of light , lots of li@@ ghts ."
"What was so fun@@ n@@ y about it was that the speak@@ er was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was comp@@ let@@ ely red and I looked like the P@@ han@@ tom of the O@@ per@@ a for the rest of the we@@ ek ."
Let me now turn to another pro@@ ject which inv@@ ol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ stan@@ ces .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I sk@@ ip that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very strange behavi@@ or .
It &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id that is comp@@ let@@ ely black .
It &apos;s got an o@@ ily con@@ sist@@ enc@@ y .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of me@@ tal in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a magnetic field , it would change its appe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a ca@@ mer@@ a poin@@ ting down at this pla@@ te , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pla@@ te , there is a mag@@ net ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that mag@@ net .
Let &apos;s just sli@@ gh@@ tly move it to the right and maybe f@@ ocu@@ s it a little bit more . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has for@@ med sp@@ ik@@ es .
Th@@ ose are just stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors that you would pain@@ t with .
"So what happened now is , when the wat@@ er@@ col@@ or was flo@@ wing into the struc@@ ture , the wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ o@@ bi@@ c .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second pro@@ ject .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
D@@ id he dr@@ ink half a bot@@ tle of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey and then dra@@ w the hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ation he got from being dr@@ un@@ k on@@ to p@@ ap@@ er ?
"M@@ aybe you have experienc@@ ed some of those pro@@ per@@ ties before , but I am talking about the physic@@ al pro@@ per@@ ties , not the other ones ."
"So when I op@@ en the bot@@ tle , the al@@ co@@ h@@ ol molecu@@ les would sp@@ read in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is a very v@@ ola@@ ti@@ le sub@@ stance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is high@@ ly fla@@ m@@ ma@@ ble ."
And it was with those two pro@@ per@@ ties that I was able to create the imag@@ es that you &apos;re see@@ ing right now .
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate this over here .
And what I have here is an emp@@ ty g@@ las@@ s v@@ es@@ sel .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ gen and wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wa@@ it for a few secon@@ ds for the molecu@@ les to sp@@ read inside the bot@@ tle .
"It goes really f@@ ast , and it &apos;s not that imp@@ res@@ sive ."
"So the imag@@ es that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fla@@ me st@@ op@@ ped in time while it is tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing through the bot@@ tle , and you have to imagine it was f@@ li@@ p@@ ped around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those imag@@ es were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three pro@@ jects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea be@@ h@@ ind it ?
I@@ s it just a wa@@ st@@ e of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jects , they &apos;re based on very simple scienti@@ fi@@ c ph@@ enomen@@ a , such as magne@@ tis@@ m , the sound wa@@ ves , or over here , the physic@@ al pro@@ per@@ ties of a sub@@ stance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these ph@@ enomen@@ a and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and ther@@ ef@@ ore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to pa@@ use for a moment and think about all the be@@ a@@ ut@@ y that is con@@ stan@@ tly sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding us ."
Thank you very much .

"On@@ ce up@@ on a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a stu@@ dent at St@@ . John &apos;s M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore ."
I was a gu@@ est stu@@ dent dur@@ ing one mon@@ th of a publi@@ c health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set forever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course con@@ t@@ ent in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the br@@ ut@@ al re@@ alization , the first mor@@ ning , that the In@@ di@@ an students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I lo@@ ved stati@@ s@@ tics from a young age .
And I studi@@ ed very much in S@@ we@@ den .
I used to be in the up@@ per qu@@ ar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I at@@ ten@@ ded .
"But in St@@ . John &apos;s , I was in the lo@@ wer qu@@ ar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that In@@ di@@ an students studi@@ ed har@@ der than we did in S@@ we@@ den .
"They read the te@@ x@@ t@@ book tw@@ ice , or three times or four times ."
In S@@ we@@ den we read it once and then we went par@@ t@@ ying .
"( Lau@@ gh@@ er ) And that , to me , that person@@ al experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was changed ."
And I re@@ alized that perhaps the We@@ ster@@ n world will not continu@@ e to do@@ min@@ ate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of person@@ al experience .
It &apos;s that re@@ alization of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the stati@@ s@@ tics , al@@ though I tried to make it fun@@ n@@ y ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ st@@ age , try to predic@@ t when that will happen — that A@@ si@@ a will re@@ ga@@ in its do@@ min@@ ant position as the le@@ ad@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predic@@ t pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will re@@ ach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econ@@ omy , because to grow an econ@@ omy of India to the size of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of cak@@ e , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average p@@ ay , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have re@@ ach@@ ed that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a hi@@ stor@@ ical bac@@ k@@ ground .
And you can see my ma@@ p if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great techn@@ ological ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ment in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia was able , for the first time , to commun@@ ic@@ ate with P@@ resi@@ dent Bu@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ r@@ ans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic Te@@ le@@ grap@@ hi@@ c C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter &quot; &quot; trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tically .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Inter@@ net , to find the te@@ xt of the tele@@ gra@@ m s@@ ent back from P@@ resi@@ dent Bu@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This tele@@ graph is a f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic in@@ str@@ ument to diff@@ use religi@@ on , civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion , liber@@ ty and la@@ w thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are ni@@ ce words . But I got sort of cur@@ i@@ ous of what he me@@ ant with liber@@ ty , and liber@@ ty for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the wi@@ der picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed year in the history of A@@ si@@ a .
1858 was the year when the cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous up@@ ri@@ sing against the for@@ ei@@ gn oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the Bri@@ ti@@ sh for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of for@@ ei@@ gn do@@ min@@ ation .
1858 in China was the vic@@ t@@ ory in the O@@ pi@@ um War by the Bri@@ ti@@ sh for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that for@@ ei@@ gn@@ ers , as it said in the treat@@ y , were allowed to tra@@ de fre@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant pay@@ ing with op@@ i@@ um for Ch@@ in@@ ese go@@ o@@ ds .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to si@@ gn the Har@@ ris T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tra@@ de on fav@@ or@@ able condi@@ tion for the U.S.
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in con@@ tr@@ ast to India and China , ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined its national so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by br@@ ing@@ ing these bub@@ b@@ les back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der graph here , where you can see each bub@@ ble is a country ."
The size of the bub@@ ble here is the population .
"O@@ n this ax@@ is , as I used to have income per person in com@@ par@@ able dol@@ lar ."
"And on that ax@@ is I have life expec@@ tan@@ cy , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ nov@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ for@@ med the las@@ er be@@ am into an ec@@ ological , rec@@ y@@ c@@ la@@ ble ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"L@@ o@@ ok here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was rich@@ er over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the hi@@ stor@@ ical rec@@ or@@ d , there was a time hund@@ re@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even ab@@ ove that of Europ@@ e ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of for@@ ei@@ gn do@@ min@@ ation , and India had been de@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econ@@ omy was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting heal@@ thy , and Japan was star@@ ting to cat@@ ch up ."
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But car@@ e@@ ful now — we are appro@@ ach@@ ing the F@@ irst World War .
"And the F@@ irst World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ a@@ ths and economi@@ cal problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ pan@@ ish f@@ lu also .
"And then after the F@@ irst World War , they continu@@ e up ."
"S@@ ti@@ ll under for@@ ei@@ gn do@@ min@@ ation , and without so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
Not much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a per@@ i@@ od of war , with lo@@ wer life expec@@ tan@@ cy ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d World War was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also economi@@ c@@ ally for Japan ."
But they did re@@ co@@ ver quite f@@ ast af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are mo@@ ving into the new world .
In 19@@ 4@@ 7 India finally ga@@ ined its inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce .
"And they could ra@@ ise the In@@ di@@ an fla@@ g and become a so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn n@@ ation , but in very big diffic@@ ul@@ ties down there ."
( Applause ) In 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the emer@@ gence of the modern China in a way which surpri@@ sed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce ?
You can see that the health started to impro@@ ve .
Ch@@ il@@ dren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th serv@@ ices were pro@@ vi@@ ded .
"This is the G@@ re@@ at Le@@ ap F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l plan@@ ning by Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China re@@ co@@ vered . Th@@ en they said , &quot; Ne@@ ver@@ more , stu@@ p@@ id c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were cat@@ ching up inde@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econ@@ omy ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g di@@ ed , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was Den@@ g X@@ i@@ a@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is wh@@ ite or black , as long as it cat@@ ch@@ es mi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; Because cat@@ ching mi@@ ce is what the two cat@@ s wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cat@@ s being here , China and India , wan@@ ting to cat@@ ch the mi@@ ces over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also star@@ ting to grow their econ@@ omy ."
And the mark@@ et re@@ form@@ er was successful there .
In &apos; 9@@ 2 India follo@@ ws with a mark@@ et re@@ form .
"And they go quite cl@@ os@@ ely together , and you can see that the si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are great@@ er than the differ@@ ences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they cat@@ ch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the a@@ ver@@ ag@@ es there — this is the average of China .
"If I would sp@@ lit China , look here , S@@ hang@@ ha@@ i has already cat@@ ched up ."
S@@ hang@@ ha@@ i is already there .
And it &apos;s heal@@ th@@ i@@ er than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou , one of the poor@@ est in@@ land pro@@ v@@ inc@@ es of China , is there ."
"And if I sp@@ lit G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and r@@ ural , the r@@ ural part of G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous inequ@@ ity in China , in the mid@@ st of f@@ ast economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another ty@@ p@@ e of inequ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical difference is not so big ."
"@@ U@@ tt@@ ar P@@ ra@@ de@@ sh , the bi@@ ggest of the states here , is poor@@ er and has a lo@@ wer health than the rest of India ."
"K@@ er@@ ala is fl@@ ying on top there , mat@@ ching United States in health , but not in econ@@ omy ."
"And here , Ma@@ har@@ ash@@ tra , with M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , is for@@ ging for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big inequ@@ i@@ ties are within the state , rather than between the states ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequ@@ ity , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical inequ@@ i@@ ties can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a growth center rela@@ tively cl@@ ose to where poor people are li@@ ving ."
"@@ No , there is one more inequ@@ ity . L@@ o@@ ok there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they bro@@ ke my f@@ ra@@ me ."
"W@@ ashington , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
M@@ y friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new le@@ ad@@ er in W@@ ashington who is really con@@ cer@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ ashington , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so rich over there but they are not as heal@@ thy as K@@ er@@ ala .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a b@@ usiness op@@ port@@ un@@ ity for K@@ er@@ ala , hel@@ ping fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ gen@@ d down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant cat@@ s here , p@@ us@@ h@@ ing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole emer@@ ging economi@@ es of the world , which Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; fla@@ t world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a lar@@ ge part of the world population is p@@ ut@@ ting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fri@@ ca , and other parts , as in r@@ ural G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econ@@ omy ."
We have an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous dis@@ par@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the mid@@ dle are p@@ us@@ h@@ ing for@@ wards very f@@ ast .
"Now , back to my pro@@ jec@@ tions ."
Wh@@ en will it cat@@ ch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ ven@@ tional graph .
"I will show income per person on this ax@@ is instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we sh@@ all see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under for@@ ei@@ gn do@@ min@@ ation actually lo@@ wer@@ ed their income and came down to the In@@ di@@ an level here ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting rich@@ er and rich@@ er .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d World War , United States is rich@@ er than U.@@ K@@ ."
But inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce is coming here .
"G@@ ro@@ wth is star@@ ting , economic re@@ form ."
"G@@ ro@@ wth is fa@@ ster , and with pro@@ jec@@ tion from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you ex@@ pect them to be in 20@@ 14 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the cat@@ ch up take place ? &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok at , look at the United States ."
Can you see the bub@@ ble ?
"The bub@@ b@@ les , not my bub@@ b@@ les , but the fin@@ an@@ cial bub@@ b@@ les ."
That &apos;s the do@@ t co@@ m bub@@ ble . This is the Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ ste@@ p there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another ro@@ ck coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more h@@ um@@ ble growth way , you know ."
And people interest@@ ed in growth are tur@@ ning their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ si@@ a .
I can comp@@ are to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Japan to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that f@@ ast cat@@ ch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
"@@ Japan did it like this , until ful@@ l cat@@ ch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income economi@@ es ."
"But the real pro@@ jec@@ tions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predic@@ t , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an t@@ ells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predic@@ t about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ ali@@ ties in China and India I con@@ si@@ der really the big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le because to bring the enti@@ re population into growth and pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity is what will create a domestic mark@@ et , what will av@@ o@@ id social in@@ st@@ abili@@ ty , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments in health , education and in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture , and electri@@ c@@ ity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the cli@@ mate . We have great inter@@ national exper@@ ts within India telling us that the cli@@ mate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise China and India would be the countries most to suff@@ er from cli@@ mate change ."
And I con@@ si@@ der India and China the best par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the world in a good global cli@@ mate poli@@ cy .
"But they a@@ in &apos;t going to p@@ ay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ gel@@ y created , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is war .
"W@@ ill the form@@ er rich countries really ac@@ cept a comp@@ let@@ ely changed world econ@@ omy , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to A@@ si@@ a ?"
"And will A@@ si@@ a be able to han@@ dle that new position of being in char@@ ge of being the most mi@@ gh@@ ty , and the govern@@ ors of the world ?"
"So , always av@@ o@@ id war , because that always p@@ us@@ h@@ es human be@@ ings bac@@ k@@ ward ."
"Now if these inequ@@ ali@@ ties , cli@@ mate and war can be av@@ o@@ ide@@ d , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vision that I got as a young stu@@ dent , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that In@@ di@@ ans can be much better than S@@ w@@ ede@@ s , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the sum@@ m@@ er , in J@@ u@@ ly , more pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , the 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 10@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I ex@@ pect to speak in the first ses@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TED India .
G@@ et your bo@@ ok@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So , this c@@ ha@@ p here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is na@@ me is N@@ os@@ tra@@ da@@ mu@@ s , al@@ though here the Sun have made him look a little bit like S@@ e@@ an C@@ on@@ ner@@ y . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I s@@ us@@ pect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in pre@@ cogn@@ ition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predic@@ t something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a flu@@ ke , and we only hear about the flu@@ k@@ es and about the fre@@ ak@@ s ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we ex@@ pect that to happen with sil@@ ly stories about pre@@ cogn@@ ition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ a and in medicine , and in this environ@@ ment , it cos@@ ts lives ."
"So fir@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about pre@@ cogn@@ ition , as it turns out , just last year a resear@@ ch@@ er called D@@ ar@@ y@@ l B@@ e@@ m conduc@@ ted a piece of research where he found evidence of pre@@ cogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic j@@ ourn@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fa@@ ir enough , but I think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a fre@@ ak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students had pre@@ cogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a j@@ ourn@@ al ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because sever@@ al different groups of research scienti@@ sts tried to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the fin@@ din@@ gs of this pre@@ cogn@@ ition study , and when they sub@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed it to the ex@@ act same j@@ ourn@@ al , the j@@ ourn@@ al said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interest@@ ed in publish@@ ing re@@ p@@ li@@ cation . We &apos;re not interest@@ ed in your neg@@ ative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ a@@ sed sa@@ m@@ ple of the true picture of all of the scienti@@ fi@@ c studies that have been conduc@@ ted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the d@@ ry ac@@ ade@@ mic field of psych@@ ology .
"It also happens in , for example , can@@ cer research ."
"So in Mar@@ ch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some resear@@ ch@@ ers re@@ port@@ ed in the j@@ ourn@@ al N@@ ature how they had tried to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate 5@@ 3 different basi@@ c science studies looking at pot@@ enti@@ al treat@@ ment tar@@ gets in can@@ cer , and out of those 5@@ 3 studies , they were only able to success@@ ful@@ ly re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate six ."
F@@ ort@@ y-@@ seven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ able .
And they say in their dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion that this is very lik@@ ely because fre@@ ak@@ s get published .
"P@@ eople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the oc@@ ca@@ sions when it works they will publi@@ sh , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ com@@ men@@ dation of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down b@@ l@@ ind al@@ ley@@ s , their first re@@ com@@ men@@ dation of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it e@@ a@@ si@@ er to publi@@ sh neg@@ ative results in science , and to change the inc@@ enti@@ ves so that scienti@@ sts are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to p@@ ost more of their neg@@ ative results in publi@@ c ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very d@@ ry world of pre@@ c@@ lin@@ ical basi@@ c science can@@ cer research .
"It also happens in the very real , f@@ les@@ h and blo@@ od of ac@@ ade@@ mic medicine . So in 19@@ 80 , some resear@@ ch@@ ers did a study on a dru@@ g called l@@ or@@ ca@@ in@@ ide , and this was an anti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ g , a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ normal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart at@@ tac@@ k , they &apos;re quite lik@@ ely to have ab@@ normal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ normal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving ."
"E@@ ar@@ ly on its develop@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ if@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ ca@@ in@@ ide , and of those patients , 10 di@@ ed ."
"A@@ no@@ ther 50 patients got a du@@ m@@ my pla@@ ce@@ b@@ o su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them di@@ ed ."
"So they ri@@ gh@@ tly re@@ gar@@ ded this dru@@ g as a fa@@ il@@ ure , and its com@@ mer@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , and because its com@@ mer@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other comp@@ an@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart at@@ tac@@ ks ."
"Th@@ ese dru@@ gs were br@@ ought to mark@@ et . They were pres@@ cri@@ bed very w@@ ide@@ ly because heart at@@ tac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also ca@@ used an incre@@ a@@ sed r@@ ate of de@@ ath that before we de@@ te@@ c@@ ted that sa@@ f@@ ety sign@@ al , over 10@@ 0,000 people di@@ ed un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily in America from the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of anti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the resear@@ ch@@ ers who did that 19@@ 80 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ p@@ a , an ap@@ ology to the scienti@@ fi@@ c commun@@ ity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ri@@ ed out our study in 19@@ 80 , we thought that the incre@@ a@@ sed de@@ ath r@@ ate that oc@@ cur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ ca@@ in@@ ide group was an effec@@ t of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develop@@ ment of l@@ or@@ ca@@ in@@ ide was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed for com@@ mer@@ cial reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publi@@ cation bi@@ as ."
"That &apos;s the techn@@ ical ter@@ m for the ph@@ enomen@@ on where un@@ fla@@ t@@ ter@@ ing data gets lost , gets un@@ published , is left mis@@ sing in action , and they say the results descri@@ bed here &quot; might have pro@@ vi@@ ded an early war@@ ning of tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from basi@@ c science .
"Th@@ ese are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The ac@@ ade@@ mic publish@@ ing environ@@ ment is very different now .
"There are ac@@ ade@@ mic j@@ ourn@@ als like &quot; &quot; T@@ ri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the op@@ en ac@@ cess j@@ ourn@@ al , which will publi@@ sh any tri@@ al conduc@@ ted in human@@ s re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a positive or a neg@@ ative res@@ ult ."
But this problem of neg@@ ative results that go mis@@ sing in action is still very pre@@ val@@ ent . In fact it &apos;s so pre@@ val@@ ent that it cut@@ s to the c@@ ore of eviden@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"So this is a dru@@ g called re@@ box@@ et@@ ine , and this is a dru@@ g that I myself have pres@@ cri@@ bed . It &apos;s an anti@@ depres@@ san@@ t ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ dy doc@@ tor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this dru@@ g . I read the one study that was published that showed that re@@ box@@ et@@ ine was better than pla@@ ce@@ b@@ o , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that re@@ box@@ et@@ ine was just as good as any other anti@@ depres@@ san@@ t , and because this pati@@ ent ha@@ dn &apos;t done well on those other anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts , I thought , well , re@@ box@@ et@@ ine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was mis@@ led . In fact , seven trials were conduc@@ ted com@@ par@@ ing re@@ box@@ et@@ ine against a du@@ m@@ my pla@@ ce@@ b@@ o su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were neg@@ ative and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree trials were published com@@ par@@ ing re@@ box@@ et@@ ine against other anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts in which re@@ box@@ et@@ ine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was col@@ lec@@ ted which showed that re@@ box@@ et@@ ine was worse than those other treat@@ ments , and those trials were not published ."
I fel@@ t mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ us@@ ual example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of ch@@ er@@ r@@ y-@@ pic@@ king and se@@ lec@@ tive re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing that I &apos;m ac@@ c@@ using other people of ."
"But it turns out that this ph@@ enomen@@ on of publi@@ cation bi@@ as has actually been very , very well studi@@ ed ."
So here is one example of how you approach it .
"The clas@@ sic mo@@ de@@ l is , you get a bun@@ ch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conduc@@ ted and comple@@ ted , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conduc@@ ted on anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year per@@ i@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the trials which were sub@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ val p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conduc@@ ted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conduc@@ ted in order to get the mark@@ eting au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ation ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 50 sp@@ lit . H@@ al@@ f of these trials were positive , half of them were neg@@ ative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"On@@ ly three of the neg@@ ative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published ."
"Now if we just f@@ li@@ ck back and fort@@ h between those two , you can see what a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing difference there was between reality and what doc@@ tors , patients , com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ers of health serv@@ ices , and ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ c@@ s were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a syste@@ ma@@ tic fla@@ w in the c@@ ore of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conduc@@ ted on publi@@ cation bi@@ as now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been col@@ lec@@ ted in a syste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on publi@@ cation bi@@ as that they could find ."
P@@ ubli@@ cation bi@@ as affec@@ ts every field of medicine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all trials , on average , go mis@@ sing in action , and we know that positive fin@@ din@@ gs are around tw@@ ice as lik@@ ely to be published as neg@@ ative fin@@ din@@ gs ."
This is a can@@ cer at the c@@ ore of eviden@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"If I f@@ li@@ p@@ ped a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the results from you from half of those t@@ os@@ ses , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up he@@ a@@ ds ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a tw@@ o@@ -@@ he@@ a@@ ded co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ cer and you were an i@@ di@@ o@@ t for le@@ tting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we b@@ lin@@ dly tol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of eviden@@ ce@@ -@@ based medicine .
"And to me , this is research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"If I conduc@@ ted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data poin@@ ts from that one study , you would ri@@ gh@@ tly ac@@ c@@ use me , essenti@@ ally , of research f@@ ra@@ u@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 studies but only publish@@ es the five that give the res@@ ult that they want , we don &apos;t con@@ si@@ der that to be research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"And when that respon@@ sibili@@ ty is diff@@ used between a whole net@@ work of resear@@ ch@@ ers , ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ c@@ s , in@@ du@@ str@@ y sp@@ on@@ sor@@ s , j@@ ourn@@ al edi@@ tors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able , but the effec@@ t on patients is da@@ m@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a dru@@ g called T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu . T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu is a dru@@ g which govern@@ ments around the world have sp@@ ent bil@@ li@@ ons and bil@@ li@@ ons of dollars on sto@@ ck@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve sto@@ ck@@ pi@@ led T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu in pan@@ ic , in the beli@@ ef that it will re@@ duce the r@@ ate of comp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions of in@@ flu@@ en@@ za ."
"C@@ om@@ p@@ li@@ ca@@ tions is a medic@@ al e@@ up@@ he@@ mis@@ m for p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia and de@@ ath . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ o@@ ch@@ ran@@ e syste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to col@@ lec@@ t together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conduc@@ ted on whether T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu actually did this or not , they found that sever@@ al of those trials were un@@ published ."
The results were un@@ av@@ a@@ ila@@ ble to them .
"And when they started ob@@ ta@@ ining the wr@@ it@@ e@@ up@@ s of those trials through var@@ i@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation A@@ ct re@@ qu@@ est@@ s , through har@@ as@@ sing var@@ i@@ ous different organiz@@ ations , what they found was in@@ con@@ sist@@ ent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the c@@ lin@@ ical study re@@ por@@ ts , the 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age long doc@@ um@@ ents that have the best possible ren@@ di@@ tion of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the ful@@ l cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ce and the ex@@ cu@@ ses and the ex@@ plan@@ ations gi@@ ven by the dru@@ g comp@@ any , you can see that wr@@ it@@ ten up in this we@@ ek &apos;s edi@@ tion of P@@ L@@ O@@ S M@@ edi@@ c@@ ine ."
"And the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recogn@@ ize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suff@@ er fak@@ e fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pre@@ t@@ end that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ irst of all , we had trials regi@@ ster@@ s , and everybody said , o@@ h , it &apos;s o@@ kay . We &apos;ll get everyone to regi@@ ster their trials , they &apos;ll p@@ ost the prot@@ o@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to ch@@ ec@@ k and see if all the trials which have been conduc@@ ted and comple@@ ted have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t bo@@ ther to use those regi@@ ster@@ s .
"And so then the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mi@@ t@@ te@@ e of M@@ edi@@ cal J@@ ourn@@ al E@@ di@@ tors came along , and they said , o@@ h , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publi@@ sh any j@@ ourn@@ als , we won &apos;t publi@@ sh any trials , un@@ less they &apos;ve been regi@@ ster@@ ed before they beg@@ an ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 200@@ 8 , a study was conduc@@ ted which showed that half of all of trials published by j@@ ourn@@ als edi@@ ted by mem@@ bers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t pro@@ per@@ ly regi@@ ster@@ ed , and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t regi@@ ster@@ ed at all ."
"And then finally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct was pas@@ sed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must p@@ ost the results of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first edi@@ tion of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people ke@@ pt to that r@@ ul@@ ing , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a di@@ sa@@ ster .
We cannot know the true effec@@ ts of the medic@@ in@@ es that we pres@@ cri@@ be if we do not have ac@@ cess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to publi@@ sh all trials conduc@@ ted in human@@ s , inc@@ lu@@ ding the ol@@ der trials , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct only as@@ ks that you publi@@ sh the trials conduc@@ ted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing medicine on the bas@@ is of trials that comple@@ ted in the past two years ."
"We need to publi@@ sh all trials in human@@ s , inc@@ lu@@ ding the ol@@ der trials , for all dru@@ gs in cur@@ r@@ ent use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ ul@@ l the k@@ not .
The ph@@ enomen@@ on you saw here for a bri@@ ef moment is called quantum lev@@ it@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king .
And the ob@@ ject that was lev@@ it@@ ating here is called a superconductor .
"S@@ u@@ per@@ conduc@@ tivity is a quantum state of matter , and it oc@@ cur@@ s only bel@@ ow a certain cri@@ tical tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old ph@@ enomen@@ on ; it was disco@@ vered 100 years ago ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , only rec@@ ently , du@@ e to sever@@ al techn@@ ological ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ments , we are now able to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate to you quantum lev@@ it@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ."
"So , a superconductor is defin@@ ed by two pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"The first is zer@@ o electri@@ cal resi@@ stance , and the second is the exp@@ ul@@ sion of a magnetic field from the inter@@ i@@ or of the superconductor ."
"That s@@ oun@@ ds comp@@ lic@@ ated , right ?"
But what is electri@@ cal resi@@ stance ?
"So , electri@@ c@@ ity is the f@@ low of electr@@ ons inside a material ."
"And these electr@@ ons , while flo@@ wing , they col@@ li@@ de with the atoms , and in these col@@ li@@ sions they l@@ ose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that effec@@ t ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , inside a superconductor there are no col@@ li@@ sions , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mark@@ able . Th@@ ink about it .
"In clas@@ sic@@ al physics , there is always some fri@@ c@@ tion , some energy l@@ os@@ s ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum effec@@ t ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconduc@@ tors don &apos;t like magnetic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a superconductor will try to ex@@ pe@@ l magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by cir@@ cula@@ ting cur@@ ren@@ ts ."
"Now , the com@@ bin@@ ation of both effec@@ ts — the exp@@ ul@@ sion of magnetic fiel@@ ds and zer@@ o electri@@ cal resi@@ stance — is exactly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always per@@ fe@@ ct , as we all know , and some@@ times stran@@ ds of magnetic field re@@ ma@@ in inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under pro@@ per condi@@ tions , which we have here , these stran@@ ds of magnetic field can be tr@@ app@@ ed inside the superconductor ."
"And these stran@@ ds of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te qu@@ anti@@ ties ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum ph@@ enomen@@ on . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like quantum particles .
"In this mo@@ vi@@ e here , you can see how they f@@ low one by one dis@@ cre@@ t@@ ely ."
"This is stran@@ ds of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they be@@ have like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this effec@@ t quantum lev@@ it@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are stran@@ ds of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them mo@@ ving around , because their mo@@ ve@@ ments dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which bre@@ ak@@ s the superconduc@@ tivity state ."
"So what it actually does , it loc@@ ks these stran@@ ds , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it loc@@ ks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is loc@@ king itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any mo@@ vement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation ."
So we get quantum loc@@ king . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I wr@@ app@@ ed up so it &apos;d st@@ ay c@@ old long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ gu@@ lar mag@@ net , it just st@@ ays loc@@ ked in mi@@ dair ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just lev@@ it@@ ation . It &apos;s not just re@@ pul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be loc@@ ked in this new con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation ."
"L@@ ik@@ e this , or move it sli@@ gh@@ tly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum loc@@ king — actually loc@@ king — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal loc@@ king of the superconductor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ ma@@ in loc@@ ked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called lev@@ it@@ ation is actually loc@@ king , Y@@ e@@ ah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surpri@@ sed to hear that if I take this cir@@ cu@@ lar mag@@ net , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to fre@@ ely r@@ ot@@ ate around the ax@@ is of the mag@@ net ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it r@@ ot@@ ates , the loc@@ king is ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can r@@ ot@@ ate the superconductor .
"We have fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less mo@@ tion . It is still lev@@ it@@ ating , but can move fre@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have quantum loc@@ king and we can lev@@ it@@ ate it on top of this mag@@ net ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many magnetic stran@@ ds are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cula@@ te it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion stran@@ ds of magnetic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the amaz@@ ing part yet , because there is something I ha@@ ven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , ye@@ ah , the amaz@@ ing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a mi@@ cr@@ on th@@ ic@@ k . It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in ."
"And this extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in lay@@ er is able to lev@@ it@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own we@@ ight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able effec@@ t . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can ex@@ t@@ end this cir@@ cu@@ lar mag@@ net , and make wh@@ at@@ ever trac@@ k I want ."
"For example , I can make a lar@@ ge cir@@ cu@@ lar ra@@ il here ."
"And when I place the superconduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this ra@@ il , it mo@@ ves fre@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its position like this , and r@@ ot@@ ate , and it fre@@ ely mo@@ ves in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it st@@ ays here — don &apos;t move — I will try to r@@ ot@@ ate the trac@@ k , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it st@@ ays s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum loc@@ king , not lev@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it cir@@ cula@@ te for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of cur@@ ren@@ ts inside superconduc@@ tors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I mach@@ in@@ es , partic@@ le ac@@ c@@ eler@@ at@@ ors and so on ."
"But we can also st@@ ore energy using superconduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
"And we could also produce power c@@ ab@@ les , to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amoun@@ ts of cur@@ r@@ ent between power st@@ ations ."
I@@ mag@@ ine you could back up a single power st@@ ation with a single superconduc@@ ting c@@ able .
But what is the future of quantum lev@@ it@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine you would have a dis@@ k si@@ mi@@ lar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dia@@ me@@ ter , with a single difference ."
"The superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er , instead of being half a mi@@ cr@@ on th@@ in , being two milli@@ me@@ ters th@@ in , quite th@@ in ."
"This tw@@ o@@ -@@ milli@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ in superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms , a small c@@ ar , in my hand ."
A@@ maz@@ ing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y top@@ ic is the se@@ cre@@ ts of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tac@@ k@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she st@@ ay ?"
Why would any@@ one st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s her ?
"I &apos;m not a psych@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st , a social work@@ er or an exper@@ t in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just gra@@ du@@ ated from Har@@ var@@ d C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mo@@ ved to New York C@@ ity for my first job as a wr@@ it@@ er and edi@@ tor at S@@ even@@ te@@ en mag@@ az@@ ine .
"I had my first ap@@ art@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pres@@ s car@@ d , and I had a very big se@@ cre@@ t ."
"M@@ y se@@ cre@@ t was that I had this gun lo@@ a@@ ded with h@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ point bul@@ le@@ ts poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times ."
The man who I lo@@ ved more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gun to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remem@@ ber .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of cra@@ z@@ y love , a psych@@ ological tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ i@@ sed as love , one that milli@@ ons of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a ty@@ pic@@ al domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in English from Har@@ var@@ d C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in mark@@ eting from Wh@@ art@@ on B@@ usiness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my car@@ e@@ er working for F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies inc@@ lu@@ ding Joh@@ n@@ son &@@ am@@ p@@ ; Joh@@ n@@ son , Le@@ o Bur@@ net@@ t and The W@@ ashington P@@ ost ."
I &apos;ve been marri@@ ed for almost 20 years to my second hus@@ b@@ and and we have three kids together .
"M@@ y do@@ g is a black la@@ b , and I dri@@ ve a H@@ on@@ da O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ sey min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all r@@ ac@@ es , all religi@@ ons , all income and education lev@@ els ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second message is that everyone thin@@ ks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and domestic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ ti@@ mate , inter@@ de@@ pen@@ dent , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in famili@@ es , the last place we would want or ex@@ pect to find violence , which is one reason domestic ab@@ use is so conf@@ using ."
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s me , but in fact I was a very ty@@ pic@@ al vic@@ tim because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ag@@ es 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as lik@@ ely to be domestic violence vic@@ ti@@ ms as women of other ag@@ es , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are kil@@ led every year by ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , boy@@ friends , and hus@@ ban@@ ds in the United States ."
"I was also a very ty@@ pic@@ al vic@@ tim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its war@@ ning sign@@ s or its patter@@ ns ."
"I met Conor on a c@@ old , ra@@ in@@ y J@@ an@@ u@@ ary ni@@ ght ."
"He s@@ at next to me on the New York C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just gra@@ du@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y Le@@ agu@@ e school , and that he worked at a very imp@@ res@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the bi@@ ggest imp@@ res@@ sion on me that first me@@ eting was that he was smar@@ t and fun@@ n@@ y and he looked like a far@@ m bo@@ y .
"He had these big che@@ ek@@ s , these big app@@ le che@@ ek@@ s and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ b@@ lon@@ d ha@@ ir , and he see@@ med so swe@@ et ."
"One of the smar@@ test things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the il@@ lu@@ sion that I was the do@@ min@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ z@@ ing me .
"We started d@@ ating , and he lo@@ ved everything about me , that I was smar@@ t , that I &apos;d g@@ one to Har@@ var@@ d , that I was pas@@ sion@@ ate about hel@@ ping te@@ en@@ age girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and my hop@@ es and dre@@ am@@ s .
"C@@ onor beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a wr@@ it@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a ma@@ gi@@ cal at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here of trust between us by conf@@ es@@ sing his se@@ cre@@ t , which was that , as a very young bo@@ y star@@ ting at age four , he had been sav@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physic@@ ally ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very smar@@ t , and he &apos;d sp@@ ent almost 20 years re@@ building his life ."
Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y Le@@ agu@@ e de@@ g@@ ree and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right sh@@ in@@ y future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this smar@@ t , fun@@ n@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive man who ad@@ or@@ ed me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e mak@@ e@@ up , how sh@@ ort my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I li@@ ved , what j@@ ob@@ s I took , who my friends were and where I sp@@ ent Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s , I would have la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ in@@ t of violence or con@@ trol or ang@@ er in Conor at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first st@@ age in any domestic violence relation@@ ship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the vic@@ tim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second ste@@ p is to is@@ ola@@ te the vic@@ tim .
"Now , Conor did not come home one day and ann@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , h@@ ey , all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next ph@@ ase where I is@@ ola@@ te you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ art@@ ment where the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this c@@ ity where you have friends and family and co@@ work@@ ers who can see the b@@ ru@@ i@@ ses . &quot; &quot; In@@ ste@@ ad , Conor came home one F@@ ri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,"
"@@ because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and lo@@ ved that he didn &apos;t need to pro@@ ve h@@ im@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the c@@ ity and away from his ab@@ u@@ sive , d@@ y@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tional family , and move to a tiny to@@ wn in New Eng@@ land where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was lea@@ ve New York , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made sac@@ ri@@ f@@ ices for your s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Conor and I left M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ al@@ ling into cra@@ z@@ y love , that I was walking he@@ ad@@ first into a car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly la@@ id physic@@ al , fin@@ an@@ cial and psych@@ ological tra@@ p ."
The next ste@@ p in the domestic violence patter@@ n is to in@@ tro@@ duce the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mo@@ ved to New Eng@@ land — you know , that place where C@@ on@@ n@@ or was sup@@ posed to feel so sa@@ fe — he b@@ ought three g@@ un@@ s ."
He ke@@ pt one in the g@@ love com@@ par@@ t@@ ment of our c@@ ar .
"He ke@@ pt one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our bed , and the th@@ ir@@ d one he ke@@ pt in his po@@ ck@@ et at all times ."
And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tra@@ u@@ ma he &apos;d experienc@@ ed as a young bo@@ y .
He needed them to feel prot@@ ec@@ ted .
"But those g@@ un@@ s were really a message for me , and even though he ha@@ dn &apos;t ra@@ i@@ sed a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve d@@ ang@@ er every min@@ ute of every day ."
Conor first physic@@ ally at@@ tac@@ ked me five days before our we@@ d@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
"I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance wr@@ iting as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , and Conor used my ang@@ er as an exc@@ use to put both of his han@@ ds around my ne@@ ck and to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze so ti@@ gh@@ tly that I could not bre@@ a@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the ch@@ ok@@ e@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ i@@ ve days later , the ten b@@ ru@@ i@@ ses on my ne@@ ck had just fa@@ ded , and I put on my mother &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding d@@ ress , and I marri@@ ed him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I lo@@ ved him , and he lo@@ ved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sor@@ ry ."
He had just been really st@@ res@@ sed out by the we@@ d@@ ding and by be@@ coming a family with me .
"It was an is@@ ola@@ ted inci@@ dent , and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again ."
It happened tw@@ ice more on the h@@ on@@ ey@@ moon .
"The first time , I was dri@@ ving to find a se@@ cre@@ t be@@ ach and I got lost , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly h@@ it the dri@@ ver &apos;s side w@@ in@@ d@@ ow ."
"And then a few days later , dri@@ ving home from our h@@ on@@ ey@@ moon , he got f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by tra@@ ff@@ ic , and he thre@@ w a c@@ old Big Ma@@ c in my face ."
Conor pro@@ ce@@ eded to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a we@@ ek for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age .
I was mi@@ st@@ ak@@ en in thinking that I was uni@@ qu@@ e and alone in this si@@ tu@@ ation .
"One in three American women experi@@ ences domestic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ por@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good comp@@ any ."
B@@ ac@@ k to my question : Why did I st@@ ay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ a@@ ded g@@ un@@ s to my head , p@@ us@@ h@@ ed me down stair@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the k@@ ey out of the c@@ ar i@@ gn@@ ition as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I d@@ res@@ sed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of myself as a b@@ at@@ ter@@ ed wife ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I was a very strong woman in love with a de@@ ep@@ ly tr@@ ou@@ b@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his dem@@ ons ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just lea@@ ve ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"T@@ o me , this is the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we vic@@ ti@@ ms know something you us@@ u@@ ally don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ bly dan@@ ger@@ ous to lea@@ ve an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fin@@ al ste@@ p in the domestic violence patter@@ n is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 70 percent of domestic violence m@@ ur@@ ders happen after the vic@@ tim has en@@ ded the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to l@@ ose ."
"O@@ ther out@@ comes inc@@ lu@@ de lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ marri@@ es ; den@@ i@@ al of fin@@ an@@ cial resour@@ ces ; and man@@ ip@@ u@@ lation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the vic@@ tim and her children , who are re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly for@@ ced by family cour@@ t j@@ u@@ d@@ ges to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vi@@ sed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just lea@@ ve ?"
"I was able to lea@@ ve , because of one fin@@ al , sa@@ dis@@ tic be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my den@@ i@@ al ."
I re@@ alized that the man who I lo@@ ved so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I bro@@ ke the sil@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the poli@@ ce , my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors , my friends and family , tot@@ al stran@@ ger@@ s , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ ped me ."
"We t@@ end to ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e vic@@ ti@@ ms as g@@ ri@@ s@@ ly he@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive women , da@@ mag@@ ed go@@ o@@ ds ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she st@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; is co@@ de for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fa@@ ult for st@@ ay@@ ing , &quot; &quot; as if vic@@ ti@@ ms in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ally cho@@ ose to f@@ all in love with men int@@ ent up@@ on dest@@ ro@@ ying us ."
"But since publish@@ ing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y L@@ ove , &quot; &quot; I have heard hund@@ re@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an in@@ valu@@ able life les@@ son from what happened , and who re@@ built lives — jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives — as emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , wi@@ ves and mothers , lives comp@@ let@@ ely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very ty@@ pic@@ al domestic violence vic@@ tim and a ty@@ pic@@ al domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I re@@ marri@@ ed a kind and gen@@ tle man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ a@@ ded gun hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me ."
"@@ R@@ ight now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how stu@@ p@@ id was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I pro@@ mi@@ se you there are sever@@ al people list@@ en@@ ing to me right now who are cur@@ ren@@ tly being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers themselves .
"A@@ b@@ use could be affec@@ ting your daughter , your si@@ ster , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own cra@@ z@@ y love story by bre@@ ak@@ ing the sil@@ ence .
I &apos;m still bre@@ ak@@ ing the sil@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ ping other vic@@ ti@@ ms , and it &apos;s my fin@@ al re@@ qu@@ est of you ."
T@@ al@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ b@@ use th@@ ri@@ ves only in sil@@ ence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by sh@@ ining a sp@@ ot@@ light on it .
We vic@@ ti@@ ms need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the se@@ cre@@ ts of domestic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ work@@ ers , your friends and family ."
"@@ R@@ ec@@ ast survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with ful@@ l fut@@ u@@ res ."
"@@ Re@@ cogn@@ ize the early sign@@ s of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show vic@@ ti@@ ms a sa@@ fe way out ."
"T@@ o@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our din@@ ner tab@@ les and our famili@@ es the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ace@@ ful o@@ a@@ ses they should be ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it wouldn &apos;t oc@@ cu@@ r to any@@ one to question it ."
This is my super@@ mark@@ et .

Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ ta@@ tions .
You want b@@ ut@@ ton f@@ ly or z@@ ip@@ per f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ w@@ ash@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ w@@ ash@@ ed ?
"I had very low , no particular expec@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one fla@@ v@@ or ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t have done better .

"And so the net res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ tively , and we feel worse ."
So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
"There is a hu@@ ge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happiness , am@@ ong resear@@ ch@@ ers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ i@@ er .
And my talk today will be m@@ os@@ tly about these cogn@@ itive tr@@ ap@@ s .
"This app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mes@@ sed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these tr@@ ap@@ s is a re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mi@@ t comple@@ x@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a u@@ se@@ ful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both lum@@ ped in the no@@ tion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cogn@@ itive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer ses@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ port@@ ed a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been list@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a d@@ read@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the me@@ mor@@ ies of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music .
"They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ ined , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experiencing self , who lives in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the past , but basically it has only the pres@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s s@@ c@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing la@@ t@@ ely ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different enti@@ ties , the experiencing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the mes@@ s about the no@@ tion of happiness ."
"Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ el@@ ler ."
And that really star@@ ts with a basi@@ c respon@@ se of our me@@ mor@@ ies — it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
They were asked to re@@ port on their pa@@ in every 60 secon@@ ds .
"H@@ ere are two patients , those are their rec@@ ordin@@ gs ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them suff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suff@@ er@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every min@@ ute of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a surpri@@ se .
The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very cri@@ tical part of the story is how it ends ."
And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great — but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in tot@@ al ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in mem@@ ory ."
Now this is a direc@@ t conf@@ li@@ ct between the experiencing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ran c@@ lin@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ i@@ gg@@ ling it too much ."
"That will cause the pati@@ ent to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant mom@@ ents and en@@ din@@ gs ."
"E@@ n@@ din@@ gs are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding do@@ min@@ ated ."
"Now , the experiencing self lives its life continu@@ ously ."
"It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward : They are lost forever .
M@@ ost of them are comp@@ let@@ ely i@@ gn@@ or@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens dur@@ ing these mom@@ ents of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be re@@ lev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second we@@ ek is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
The experiencing self has no v@@ o@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences , we cho@@ ose between me@@ mor@@ ies of experi@@ ences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future nor@@ m@@ ally as experi@@ ences ."
We think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated me@@ mor@@ ies .
"I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent , in the ser@@ vice of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self ."
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our me@@ mor@@ ies ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ ven for the do@@ min@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ sum@@ ing me@@ mor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on mem@@ ory rela@@ tive to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remem@@ ber anything ."
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated process .
What are the e@@ mo@@ tions that can be measu@@ red ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time ."
It is about how sa@@ tis@@ fied or p@@ lea@@ sed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
Ver@@ y different no@@ tion .
"An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to mes@@ s up the study of happiness , and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been mes@@ sing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly this way ."
"The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happiness of the experiencing self and the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogn@@ iz@@ ed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two se@@ par@@ ately ."
"So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the ma@@ in les@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ re@@ lation , the cor@@ re@@ lation is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?"
You have that much un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
So the cor@@ re@@ lation is low .
We know something about what con@@ tr@@ ols sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is ma@@ in@@ ly being sa@@ tis@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like ."
"There are other ple@@ as@@ u@@ res , but this is do@@ min@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ sti@@ tut@@ e for well-being .
It is a comp@@ let@@ ely different no@@ tion .
"Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not at@@ t@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer ."
"Well , it turns out that cli@@ mate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the ref@@ lec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well-being , and I hop@@ e I have gi@@ ven you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that G@@ al@@ l@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , var@@ y with income ."
"And it turns out that , bel@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very lar@@ ge sa@@ m@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a lar@@ ge re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive sa@@ m@@ ple — bel@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ..."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get prog@@ res@@ si@@ v@@ ely un@@ happ@@ i@@ er the poor@@ er they get ."
"A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely fla@@ t line ."
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lin@@ es so fla@@ t .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but la@@ ck of money cer@@ tain@@ ly bu@@ y@@ s you mi@@ ser@@ y , and we can measure that mi@@ ser@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ tis@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for e@@ mo@@ tions .
"C@@ A : But D@@ ann@@ y , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took ser@@ i@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation poli@@ cy and so fort@@ h ."
P@@ eople are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of publi@@ c poli@@ cy .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence poli@@ cy , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next de@@ ca@@ de or two , part of national stati@@ s@@ tics ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at le@@ ast should be — the most interesting poli@@ cy dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion to trac@@ k over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a var@@ i@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent star@@ ting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mark@@ able stuff .
"You take about eight or so car@@ b@@ on atoms , about 20 hy@@ dro@@ gen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous li@@ qu@@ id : very ener@@ g@@ y-@@ den@@ se and very easy to ref@@ ine into a number of very u@@ se@@ ful produc@@ ts and f@@ u@@ els ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ ck@@ et ma@@ p of where it &apos;s all loc@@ ated .
A bi@@ g@@ ger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
Ge@@ ologi@@ sts have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 tr@@ il@@ lion gal@@ l@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de oil still to be developed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1@@ 000 me@@ ters bel@@ ow where you &apos;re all si@@ tting is one of the lar@@ g@@ est produc@@ ing oil fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ il@@ s if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? Wh@@ ere is it in the energy system ?
"H@@ ere &apos;s a little s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a do@@ min@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little se@@ cre@@ t I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 2@@ 5 years , oil has been play@@ ing less and less of a r@@ ole in global energy syste@@ ms ."
"There was one kind of pe@@ ak oil in 19@@ 8@@ 5 , when oil re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted 50 percent of global energy sup@@ ply ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing and I believe it will continu@@ e to de@@ cl@@ ine .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion in the U.S. probably pe@@ ak@@ ed in 200@@ 7 and is de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing .
So oil is play@@ ing a less sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant r@@ ole every year .
"And so , 2@@ 5 years ago , there was a pe@@ ak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a pe@@ ak co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a pe@@ ak wo@@ od ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy syste@@ ms .
And what &apos;s been tak@@ ing up the s@@ la@@ ck in the last few de@@ ca@@ des ?
"Well , a lot of natural g@@ as and a little bit of n@@ uc@@ lear , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few de@@ ca@@ des is pe@@ ak g@@ as , and be@@ yon@@ d that , pe@@ ak ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in tot@@ al isn &apos;t incre@@ as@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ il@@ s — but there &apos;s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been syste@@ ma@@ tically de@@ car@@ bon@@ iz@@ ing our energy system ."
"E@@ ner@@ gy syste@@ ms of the world be@@ coming prog@@ res@@ si@@ v@@ ely — year on year , de@@ ca@@ de on de@@ ca@@ de , century on century — be@@ coming less car@@ b@@ on in@@ ten@@ se ."
"And that continu@@ es into the future with the ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develop@@ ing today , re@@ ach@@ ing maybe 30 percent of pri@@ mar@@ y energy by mi@@ d century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ ven@@ tional ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ yon@@ d .
"What is the future of truly su@@ sta@@ in@@ able , car@@ bon@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of li@@ me@@ st@@ one .
"I pic@@ ked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ al@@ ls , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just li@@ me@@ st@@ one , nothing really spe@@ cial about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of chal@@ k ."
I pic@@ ked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little youn@@ ger .
"And it &apos;s different than this li@@ me@@ st@@ one , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lec@@ ture and wr@@ ite on the chal@@ k@@ bo@@ ar@@ d with this ."
"Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate ."
What &apos;s different is how the molecu@@ les are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ ff the co@@ ast of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
"Now , milli@@ ons of ab@@ alone every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already gu@@ es@@ sing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times tou@@ gh@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the lo@@ w@@ ly ab@@ alone is able to la@@ y down the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate cr@@ y@@ st@@ als in lay@@ ers , making this beautiful , i@@ ri@@ des@@ cent mother of pe@@ arl ."
"@@ Ver@@ y speci@@ alized material that the ab@@ alone self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les , milli@@ ons of ab@@ alone , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredible stuff .
"A@@ ll the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the molecu@@ les are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll su@@ ggest that this co@@ al is about as exc@@ iting as this chal@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about f@@ u@@ els or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps nov@@ el materi@@ als for b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies or f@@ u@@ el cells , nature has@@ n &apos;t ever built those per@@ fe@@ ct materi@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , the survi@@ val of a speci@@ es didn &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on building those materi@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing the molecu@@ les differ@@ ently ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never r@@ un out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ lion w@@ in@@ d@@ mil@@ ls .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people in@@ ven@@ ted ideas — they had ideas , in@@ nov@@ ations , technology — and the St@@ one A@@ ge en@@ ded , not because we ran out of st@@ ones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ nov@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we r@@ un out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both challen@@ g@@ ed and exc@@ ited .
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ eve something ?"
"S@@ ome@@ body who &apos;s working for you , or a par@@ t@@ ner , or even yourself ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ rec@@ t me if I &apos;m wrong .
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ ye . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ ye ."
We need var@@ i@@ ety . We need surpri@@ se .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own human@@ ity and mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ eve things that seem to def@@ y all of the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ?"
F@@ or example : Why is Ap@@ ple so in@@ nov@@ ative ?
"Y@@ e@@ ar after year , after year , they &apos;re more in@@ nov@@ ative than all their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer comp@@ any ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Martin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing led the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts M@@ o@@ vement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suff@@ er@@ ed in pre@@ -@@ civi@@ l ri@@ ghts America , and he cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t the only great or@@ at@@ or of the day ."
"And this disco@@ very prof@@ oun@@ dly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even prof@@ oun@@ dly changed the way in which I oper@@ ate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a patter@@ n ."
And it &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite to everyone else .
"A@@ ll I did was co@@ di@@ f@@ y it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s sim@@ ple@@ st idea ."
I call it the gol@@ den circ@@ le .
This little idea expla@@ ins why some organiz@@ ations and some lea@@ ders are able to in@@ sp@@ ire where others ar@@ en &apos;t .
Let me def@@ ine the terms really quickly .
"E@@ very single person , every single organiz@@ ation on the planet kno@@ ws what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organiz@@ ations know why they do what they do ."
"B@@ y &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your pur@@ pose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your beli@@ ef ?
Why do you get out of bed in the mor@@ ning ?
I use Ap@@ ple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beauti@@ ful@@ ly design@@ ed , simple to use and us@@ er fri@@ en@@ dly ."
Here &apos;s how Ap@@ ple actually commun@@ ic@@ ates .
"&quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing we do , we believe in challen@@ ging the stat@@ us qu@@ o ."
We believe in thinking differ@@ ently .
We just happen to make great comput@@ ers .
"But we &apos;re also per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly com@@ fort@@ able bu@@ ying an M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er from Ap@@ ple , or a ph@@ one from Ap@@ ple , or a D@@ V@@ R from Ap@@ ple ."
Th@@ e@@ ir com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ at@@ e@@ way came out with fla@@ t@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re em@@ in@@ ently qu@@ ali@@ fied to make fla@@ t@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
No@@ body b@@ ought one .
It &apos;s all gr@@ oun@@ ded in the ten@@ ets of bi@@ ology .
"@@ Not psych@@ ology , bi@@ ology ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ w@@ est brain , our H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ en brain , our ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x is respon@@ sible for all of our ra@@ tional and anal@@ y@@ tical thought and language .
"The mid@@ dle two se@@ c@@ tions make up our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins are respon@@ sible for all of our feel@@ ings , like trust and lo@@ yal@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t dri@@ ve behavi@@ or .
This is where g@@ ut deci@@ sions come from .
The go@@ al is not just to h@@ ire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to h@@ ire people who believe what you believe .
M@@ ost people don &apos;t know about Sa@@ mu@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley .
"And Sa@@ mu@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for success ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He hi@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the mark@@ et condi@@ tions were f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic .
"The New York Ti@@ mes follo@@ wed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for L@@ ang@@ ley ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of Sa@@ mu@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley ?
"The difference was , Or@@ vil@@ le and W@@ il@@ bu@@ r were dri@@ ven by a cause , by a pur@@ pose , by a beli@@ ef ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could fig@@ ure out this fl@@ ying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the res@@ ult .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the rich@@ es .
"And lo and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the pay@@ ch@@ ec@@ k .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get fam@@ ous , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to at@@ tr@@ act those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early a@@ do@@ p@@ ters .
"And these g@@ uy@@ s , the in@@ nov@@ at@@ ors and the early a@@ do@@ p@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ fort@@ able making those g@@ ut deci@@ sions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that pro@@ ve what they believe ."
"So let me give you a fam@@ ous example , a fam@@ ous fa@@ il@@ ure and a fam@@ ous success of the la@@ w of diff@@ u@@ sion of in@@ nov@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a com@@ mer@@ cial example .
I Ti@@ V@@ o stuff on my pi@@ ece@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ ime W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their sto@@ ck was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then p@@ lum@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never tra@@ ded ab@@ ove 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the sum@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people showed up on the m@@ all in W@@ ashington to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We follo@@ wed , not for him , but for our@@ selves ."
Because there are lea@@ ders and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ Le@@ a@@ ders hold a position of power or au@@ th@@ ority , but those who le@@ ad in@@ sp@@ ire us ."
"I ’ m going around the world giving tal@@ ks about Darwin , and us@@ u@@ ally what I ’ m talking about is Darwin ’ s strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"Now that ti@@ tle , that ph@@ r@@ ase , comes from a cri@@ tic , an early cri@@ tic , and this is a pas@@ sage that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ gn@@ oran@@ ce is the ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ er ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the fun@@ da@@ mental princi@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a per@@ fe@@ ct and beautiful machine , it is not re@@ qui@@ si@@ te to know how to make it ."
"This pro@@ position will be found on car@@ e@@ ful exam@@ in@@ ation to ex@@ pres@@ s , in con@@ den@@ sed form , the essenti@@ al pur@@ port of the Th@@ e@@ ory , and to ex@@ pres@@ s in a few words all M@@ r@@ . Darwin ’ s me@@ an@@ ing ; who , by a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing , seems to think A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ gn@@ oran@@ ce ful@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fied to take the place of A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute W@@ is@@ dom in the achi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments of cre@@ ative sk@@ ill . &quot; &quot; E@@ x@@ actly . E@@ x@@ actly . And it is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion ."
A cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ist p@@ am@@ ph@@ let has this wonderful p@@ age in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ w@@ o : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pain@@ ting that didn ’ t have a pain@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any c@@ ar that didn ’ t have a mak@@ er ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the ab@@ ove , give deta@@ il@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ ha ! I mean , it really is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
You would have thought it stan@@ ds to reason that desi@@ gn re@@ qui@@ res an intelli@@ g@@ ent design@@ er .
But Darwin sho@@ ws that it ’ s just f@@ al@@ se .
"T@@ o@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about Darwin ’ s other strange in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally p@@ uz@@ z@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It stan@@ ds to reason that we love cho@@ c@@ ola@@ te cak@@ e because it is swe@@ et .
G@@ uy@@ s go for girls like this because they are se@@ x@@ y .
We ad@@ ore ba@@ bi@@ es because they ’ re so c@@ ute .
"And , of course , we are a@@ mu@@ sed by j@@ ok@@ es because they are fun@@ n@@ y ."
This is all bac@@ k@@ wards . It is . And Darwin sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with swe@@ et . O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is basically an ev@@ olved su@@ g@@ ar de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , because su@@ g@@ ar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ ru@@ de@@ ly , and that ’ s why we like su@@ g@@ ar ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because h@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically swe@@ et about h@@ on@@ ey ."
"If you looked at g@@ lu@@ c@@ ose molecu@@ les ti@@ ll you were b@@ l@@ ind , you wouldn ’ t see why they ta@@ sted swe@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re swe@@ et .
"So if you think first there was swe@@ et@@ ness , and then we ev@@ olved to like swe@@ et@@ ness , you ’ ve got it bac@@ k@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way r@@ ound ."
S@@ we@@ et@@ ness was born with the w@@ ir@@ ing which ev@@ olved .
And there ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically se@@ x@@ y about these young la@@ di@@ es .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on ear@@ th do you get ch@@ imp@@ s to mate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a s@@ olution : hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quick@@ er way ."
"@@ Just w@@ ire the ch@@ imp@@ s up to love that look , and ap@@ par@@ ently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ imp@@ s ev@@ olved our different ways ."
"We be@@ came bal@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ di@@ ed , od@@ dly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we ha@@ dn ’ t , then probably this would be the he@@ ight of se@@ x@@ iness ."
O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an ev@@ olved and in@@ st@@ inc@@ tual pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy f@@ ood .
It wasn ’ t design@@ ed for cho@@ c@@ ola@@ te cak@@ e .
C@@ ho@@ c@@ ola@@ te cak@@ e is a super@@ normal sti@@ mul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ ik@@ o T@@ in@@ ber@@ gen , who did his fam@@ ous experim@@ ents with g@@ ul@@ ls , where he found that that oran@@ ge s@@ po@@ t on the g@@ ul@@ l ’ s be@@ ak — if he made a bi@@ g@@ ger , or@@ ang@@ er s@@ po@@ t the g@@ ul@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ks would pe@@ ck at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ per@@ sti@@ mul@@ us for them , and they lo@@ ved it ."
"What we see with , say , cho@@ c@@ ola@@ te cak@@ e is it ’ s a super@@ normal sti@@ mul@@ us to tw@@ e@@ ak our desi@@ gn w@@ ir@@ ing ."
And there are lots of super@@ normal sti@@ mul@@ i ; cho@@ c@@ ola@@ te cak@@ e is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ normal sti@@ mul@@ i for se@@ x@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ normal sti@@ mul@@ i for cut@@ en@@ ess . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love ba@@ bi@@ es , and that we not be put off by , say , mes@@ s@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers ."
"So ba@@ bi@@ es have to at@@ tr@@ act our affec@@ tion and our n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a rec@@ ent study sho@@ ws that mothers pre@@ f@@ er the s@@ me@@ ll of the dir@@ ty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own bab@@ y ."
So nature works on many lev@@ els here .
"But now , if ba@@ bi@@ es didn ’ t look the way they do — if ba@@ bi@@ es looked like this , that ’ s what we would find ad@@ or@@ able , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , o@@ h my go@@ od@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the strange in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , finally what about fun@@ n@@ y . M@@ y answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I lea@@ ve it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s dir@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a po@@ wer@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ agu@@ es ."
It ’ s a neur@@ al system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a gr@@ ub@@ by c@@ ler@@ ical job .
O@@ ur b@@ um@@ per s@@ tic@@ k@@ er for this view is that this is the jo@@ y of de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using h@@ um@@ or as a sort of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c pro@@ be by s@@ wit@@ ching h@@ um@@ or on and off , by tur@@ ning the kno@@ b on a j@@ oke — now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y ... o@@ h , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y — in this way , we can actually learn something about the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain , the fun@@ c@@ tional ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ ley is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ ley M@@ o@@ de@@ l .
"He ’ s a computer scienti@@ st , Re@@ gin@@ al@@ d A@@ da@@ ms a psych@@ ologi@@ st , and there I am , and we ’ re p@@ ut@@ ting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"Now , no@@ tice that the le@@ ad@@ er em@@ br@@ ac@@ es him as an equal ."
It takes g@@ ut@@ s to st@@ and out like that .
So a mo@@ vement must be publi@@ c .
Now we &apos;ve got mom@@ en@@ tum . This is the ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"And what a per@@ fe@@ ct place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
An@@ y@@ one ?
How about a mo@@ der@@ ate amount of st@@ ress ?
Y@@ e@@ ah . M@@ e too .
But that is not my conf@@ es@@ sion .
It incre@@ a@@ ses the ri@@ s@@ k of everything from the common c@@ old to car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar disease .
"But I have changed my mind about st@@ ress , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
It &apos;s called the social st@@ ress test .
"And un@@ bek@@ no@@ w@@ n@@ st to you , the experim@@ en@@ ter has been tra@@ ined to har@@ as@@ s you dur@@ ing it ."
That guy made a mi@@ st@@ ak@@ e .
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ gen to your brain .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is inv@@ olved in .
It fin@@ e-@@ t@@ un@@ es your brain &apos;s social in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
It even makes you more w@@ il@@ ling to help and sup@@ port the people you care about .
But my fav@@ or@@ ite effec@@ t on the body is actually on the heart .
P@@ eople who sp@@ ent time car@@ ing for others showed ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely no st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ rela@@ ted increase in d@@ ying .
"And when you cho@@ ose to view st@@ ress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at st@@ ress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty pro@@ found stat@@ ement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to han@@ dle life &apos;s challen@@ ges .
"( Applause ) Chris An@@ der@@ son : This is kind of amaz@@ ing , what you &apos;re telling us ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ever before has the ph@@ r@@ ase &quot; &quot; I am Bri@@ ti@@ sh &quot; &quot; eli@@ c@@ ited so much p@@ ity . ( Laughter )
"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for many people , but it was also something that , over the follo@@ wing sever@@ al days , created a comple@@ te political me@@ l@@ t@@ down in my country ."
E@@ very@@ body was bla@@ ming everybody else .
That comple@@ te me@@ l@@ t@@ down was made even worse by the most tra@@ gic ele@@ ment of it : lev@@ els of x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and r@@ ac@@ ist ab@@ use in the stre@@ ets of B@@ rit@@ a@@ in at a level that I have never seen before in my li@@ fe@@ time .
"P@@ eople are now talking about whether my country is be@@ coming a L@@ it@@ tle Eng@@ land , or , as one of my colle@@ agu@@ es put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 19@@ 5@@ 0s n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a the@@ me par@@ k flo@@ ating in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ g@@ ree of sho@@ ck that we &apos;ve experienc@@ ed since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ ep@@ er struc@@ tur@@ al fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a ste@@ p back and ask two very basi@@ c questions .
"F@@ irst , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ pres@@ ent , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respon@@ d ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ pres@@ ent ?"
Hin@@ d@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ote sp@@ lit along lin@@ es of age , education , clas@@ s and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y ."
"G@@ e@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ic@@ ally , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land that most stron@@ g@@ ly com@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed to being part of the Europ@@ e@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very strong am@@ bi@@ val@@ ence ."
"But more prof@@ oun@@ dly , the v@@ ote teach@@ es us something about the nature of poli@@ tics today ."
C@@ on@@ tem@@ por@@ ary poli@@ tics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about glob@@ alization .
The fa@@ ult line of con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary poli@@ tics is between those that em@@ br@@ ace glob@@ alization and those that fear glob@@ alization .
But those ideas are ones that sign@@ if@@ y fear and ali@@ en@@ ation .
They re@@ pres@@ ent a re@@ treat back to@@ wards nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism and bor@@ ders in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The b@@ lu@@ e are@@ as show Re@@ ma@@ in and the red are@@ as Le@@ a@@ ve .
It means that we need to re@@ ach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the Le@@ a@@ ve v@@ ote , a min@@ ority have pe@@ d@@ d@@ led the poli@@ tics of fear and hat@@ red , cre@@ ating lies and mi@@ str@@ ust around , for in@@ stance , the idea that the v@@ ote on Europ@@ e could re@@ duce the number of ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ lum@@ -@@ se@@ ek@@ ers coming to Europ@@ e , when the v@@ ote on lea@@ ving had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion from outside the Europ@@ e@@ an U@@ ni@@ on ."
But for a sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant ma@@ j@@ ority of the Le@@ a@@ ve v@@ ot@@ ers the con@@ cer@@ n was dis@@ il@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment with the political est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
This re@@ p@@ lic@@ ates around Europ@@ e and much of the liber@@ al demo@@ cra@@ tic world .
"We see it with the ri@@ se in popu@@ lar@@ ity of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ r@@ um@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism of V@@ ik@@ tor Or@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , with the increase in popu@@ lar@@ ity of Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating liber@@ al , op@@ en , tol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ gen@@ tly need a new vision , a vision of a more tol@@ er@@ ant , inc@@ lu@@ sive glob@@ alization , one that br@@ ings people with us rather than lea@@ ving them be@@ h@@ ind ."
That vision of glob@@ alization is one that has to start by a recogn@@ ition of the positive ben@@ ef@@ its of glob@@ alization .
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s am@@ on@@ g@@ st economi@@ sts is that f@@ ree tra@@ de , the mo@@ vement of cap@@ ital , the mo@@ vement of people across bor@@ ders ben@@ ef@@ it everyone on ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate ."
But glob@@ alization also has re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tive effec@@ ts .
It cre@@ ates w@@ in@@ n@@ ers and l@@ os@@ ers .
"In 200@@ 2 , the form@@ er S@@ e@@ cre@@ tar@@ y-@@ G@@ ener@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ of@@ i An@@ n@@ an , gave a spe@@ e@@ ch at Y@@ al@@ e Un@@ iversi@@ ty , and that spe@@ e@@ ch was on the top@@ ic of inc@@ lu@@ sive glob@@ alization ."
That was the spe@@ e@@ ch in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
"But ami@@ d au@@ ster@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ cial cri@@ s@@ is of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed almost without a tr@@ ace ."
G@@ lob@@ alization has been taken to sup@@ port a ne@@ o@@ liber@@ al a@@ gen@@ da .
It &apos;s per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved to be part of an eli@@ te a@@ gen@@ da rather than something that ben@@ ef@@ its all .
How can we balan@@ ce on the one hand ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing fear and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand ref@@ using ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scienti@@ st , that social science off@@ ers some pla@@ ces to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ formation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a star@@ ting point ."
The first rela@@ t@@ es to the idea of civi@@ c education .
What stan@@ ds out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the ga@@ p between publi@@ c per@@ cep@@ tion and em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we re@@ build res@@ pect for tr@@ ut@@ h and evidence into our liber@@ al democr@@ ac@@ ies ?
"It has to beg@@ in with education , but it has to start with the recogn@@ ition that there are hu@@ ge g@@ ap@@ s ."
The second thing that I think is an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity is the idea to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge more inter@@ action across di@@ ver@@ se commun@@ i@@ ties .
"So for in@@ stance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast have the high@@ est numbers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts , and they are also by far the most tol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the lo@@ w@@ est lev@@ els of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion that actually are the most exc@@ lu@@ sion@@ ary and int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts .
This il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion from the F@@ inan@@ cial Ti@@ mes pos@@ t@@ -@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really stri@@ king .
The f@@ our@@ th and fin@@ al idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more respon@@ sible poli@@ tics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that com@@ par@@ es at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des on glob@@ alization .
I am still Bri@@ ti@@ sh .
I am still Europ@@ e@@ an .
I am still a global ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
"For those of us who believe that our iden@@ ti@@ ties are not mut@@ u@@ ally exc@@ lu@@ sive , we have to all work together to en@@ sure that glob@@ alization takes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t lea@@ ve people be@@ h@@ ind ."
On@@ ly then will we truly re@@ con@@ c@@ ile democr@@ acy and glob@@ alization .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real ple@@ as@@ ure to be here .
I last did a TED T@@ al@@ k I think about seven years ago or so .
I tal@@ ked about sp@@ a@@ gh@@ etti sa@@ u@@ ce .
"And so many people , I gu@@ ess , watch those vide@@ os ."
"P@@ eople have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about sp@@ a@@ gh@@ etti sa@@ u@@ ce , which is a wonderful thing in the sh@@ ort ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ ven to be less than ide@@ al over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put sp@@ a@@ gh@@ etti sa@@ u@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this mor@@ ning &apos;s ses@@ sion is Th@@ ings We M@@ ak@@ e .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most pre@@ ci@@ ous ob@@ jects of his er@@ a .
And the man &apos;s na@@ me is Carl Norden .
Carl Norden was born in 18@@ 80 .
And he was S@@ w@@ is@@ s .
"And of course , the S@@ w@@ is@@ s can be divi@@ ded into two gener@@ al cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies : those who make small , ex@@ qui@@ si@@ te , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects and those who han@@ dle the money of those who buy small , ex@@ qui@@ si@@ te , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects ."
And Carl Norden is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the form@@ er ca@@ m@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ eder@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ te@@ ch in Z@@ ur@@ ich .
"In fact , one of his clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es is a young man na@@ med L@@ enin who would go on to bre@@ ak small , exp@@ en@@ sive , ex@@ qui@@ si@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ w@@ is@@ s engine@@ er , Carl ."
And I mean that in its ful@@ le@@ st sense of the word .
"He we@@ ars thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ; and he is do@@ min@@ e@@ ering and n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ tic and dri@@ ven and has an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary e@@ go ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our days ; and he has very strong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ n@@ ating cur@@ r@@ ent ; and he feel@@ s like a sun@@ tan is a si@@ gn of moral we@@ ak@@ ness ; and he dr@@ in@@ ks lots of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ; and he does his best work si@@ tting in his mother &apos;s kit@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ ur@@ ich for h@@ ours in comple@@ te sil@@ ence with nothing but a sli@@ de ru@@ le ."
"In any case , Carl Norden e@@ mi@@ gr@@ ates to the United States just before the F@@ irst World War and se@@ ts up sho@@ p on L@@ af@@ ay@@ et@@ te S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan ."
And he be@@ comes ob@@ ses@@ sed with the question of how to drop bomb@@ s from an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ da@@ r , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a comp@@ lic@@ ated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hund@@ re@@ ds of mi@@ les an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to drop an ob@@ ject , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some stati@@ on@@ ary tar@@ get in the face of all kinds of w@@ in@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d co@@ ver and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ dimen@@ ts ."
"And all sor@@ ts of people , mo@@ ving up to the F@@ irst World War and between the w@@ ars , tried to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ ar@@ ly everybody came up sh@@ ort ."
The bomb@@ si@@ ghts that were av@@ a@@ ila@@ ble were incredi@@ bly c@@ ru@@ de .
But Carl Norden is really the one who cr@@ ac@@ ks the co@@ de .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ vice .
It we@@ i@@ gh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Norden M@@ ark 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of le@@ ver@@ s and bal@@ l@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and g@@ ad@@ gets and g@@ au@@ ges .
And he makes this comp@@ lic@@ ated thing .
"And what he allo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er take this particular ob@@ ject , v@@ is@@ u@@ ally sight the tar@@ get , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ g@@ la@@ s con@@ e of the bom@@ ber , and then they p@@ lu@@ g in the al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the w@@ ind and the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the tar@@ get ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bom@@ b .
"And as Norden fam@@ ously says , &quot; &quot; B@@ ef@@ ore that bombsight came along , bomb@@ s would r@@ ou@@ tin@@ ely mis@@ s their tar@@ get by a m@@ ile or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the M@@ ark 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ bly exc@@ ited the U.S. mili@@ tar@@ y was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like man@@ na from he@@ av@@ en .
"H@@ ere was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ irst World War , where milli@@ ons of men f@@ ought each other in the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es , getting no@@ where , making no prog@@ ress , and here someone had come up with a de@@ vice that allowed them to f@@ ly up in the sk@@ ies high ab@@ ove en@@ e@@ my ter@@ rit@@ ory and dest@@ ro@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever they wanted with p@@ in@@ point ac@@ cur@@ acy ."
And the U.S. mili@@ tar@@ y sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develop@@ ing the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in per@@ spec@@ tive , the tot@@ al cost of the M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan pro@@ ject was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was sp@@ ent on this Norden bombsight as was sp@@ ent on the most fam@@ ous mili@@ tar@@ y-@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ al pro@@ ject of the modern er@@ a .
"And there were people , str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ sts , within the U.S. mili@@ tar@@ y who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single de@@ vice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and vic@@ t@@ ory when it came to the b@@ at@@ tle against the N@@ az@@ is and against the Jap@@ an@@ ese ."
"And for Norden as well , this de@@ vice had incredible moral import@@ ance , because Norden was a com@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bombsight as his in@@ ven@@ tion , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ str@@ ument of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of suff@@ ering in any kind of war be re@@ duc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years le@@ ad@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d World War , the U.S. mili@@ tar@@ y bu@@ y@@ s 9@@ 0,000 of these Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tra@@ ined 5@@ 0,000 bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ex@@ ten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tra@@ ining ses@@ sions — because these things are essenti@@ ally anal@@ o@@ g comput@@ ers ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to swe@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tu@@ red , they will not di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge a single deta@@ il of this particular de@@ vice to the en@@ e@@ my , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the en@@ e@@ my not get their han@@ ds on this ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely essenti@@ al piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Norden bombsight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ c@@ ort@@ ed there by a ser@@ ies of ar@@ med gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ r@@ ou@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is han@@ d@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never allowed to be ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed .
"And there &apos;s a little inc@@ endi@@ ary de@@ vice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever cr@@ ash@@ es , it will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed and there &apos;s no way the en@@ e@@ my can ever get their han@@ ds on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ ra@@ il .
So what happens dur@@ ing the S@@ econ@@ d World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ ra@@ il ."
"In pr@@ ac@@ tice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under per@@ fe@@ ct condi@@ tions ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , condi@@ tions ar@@ en &apos;t per@@ fe@@ ct ."
"F@@ irst of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers have the abili@@ ty to pro@@ per@@ ly progra@@ m an anal@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , it bre@@ ak@@ s down a lot ."
"It &apos;s ful@@ l of all kinds of g@@ y@@ ros@@ cop@@ es and pul@@ ley@@ s and g@@ ad@@ gets and bal@@ l@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ought to in the he@@ at of b@@ at@@ tle ."
"Th@@ ir@@ dly , when Norden was making his cal@@ cula@@ tions , he as@@ su@@ med that a plan@@ e would be fl@@ ying at a rela@@ tively s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sho@@ t down ."
So they started fl@@ ying them at high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des at incredi@@ bly high spe@@ eds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those condi@@ tions .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight re@@ qui@@ red the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er to make v@@ is@@ ual con@@ t@@ act with the tar@@ get ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It ne@@ eds cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ y to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were ab@@ ove C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l Europ@@ e between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how in@@ ac@@ cur@@ ate the Norden bombsight was , there was a fam@@ ous case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the Al@@ lies bomb@@ ed a che@@ mi@@ cal plan@@ t in Le@@ una , Ger@@ many ."
And the che@@ mi@@ cal plan@@ t comp@@ ri@@ sed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ res .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the Al@@ lies d@@ rop@@ ped 8@@ 5@@ ,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re che@@ mi@@ cal plan@@ t , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of those bomb@@ s do you think actually lan@@ ded inside the 7@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re per@@ i@@ me@@ ter of the plan@@ t ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that lan@@ ded , 1@@ 6 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The Le@@ una che@@ mi@@ cal plan@@ t , after one of the most ex@@ ten@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the han@@ ds of the N@@ az@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that Carl Norden , as a pro@@ per S@@ w@@ is@@ s , was very en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of Ger@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he hi@@ red a whole bun@@ ch of them , inc@@ lu@@ ding a man na@@ med Her@@ mann L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a comple@@ te set of the plan@@ s for the Norden bombsight to the N@@ az@@ is ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smar@@ t people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve in@@ ven@@ ted g@@ ad@@ gets that will forever change our world ."
They &apos;ve in@@ ven@@ ted we@@ b@@ sit@@ es that will al@@ low people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve in@@ ven@@ ted some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better ."
"If you go into the mili@@ tar@@ y , you &apos;ll find lots of Carl Nor@@ den@@ s as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ en@@ ta@@ g@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very c@@ lear about how little that means .
"In the Ira@@ q War , at the beginning of the first Ira@@ q War , the U.S. mili@@ tar@@ y , the air force , s@@ ent two squ@@ ad@@ r@@ ons of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ i@@ ghter E@@ ag@@ les to the Ira@@ q@@ i de@@ ser@@ t equ@@ ip@@ ped with these five million dol@@ lar ca@@ mer@@ as that allowed them to see the enti@@ re de@@ ser@@ t flo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to dest@@ ro@@ y — remem@@ ber the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ s@@ ile la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the Ira@@ q@@ is were la@@ un@@ ching at the I@@ s@@ ra@@ eli@@ s ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two squ@@ ad@@ r@@ ons was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ s@@ ile la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"And so they f@@ le@@ w mis@@ sions day and ni@@ ght , and they d@@ rop@@ ped thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ si@@ les in an at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of this particular s@@ cour@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ di@@ t done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually dest@@ ro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ er@@ o , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ ap@@ ons wer@@ en &apos;t ac@@ cur@@ ate ?
"O@@ h no , they were br@@ il@@ li@@ an@@ tly ac@@ cur@@ ate ."
"They could have dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ ls is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to fi@@ gh@@ ting w@@ ars .
O@@ r take the b@@ at@@ tle in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
What is the sign@@ ature we@@ ap@@ on of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Pak@@ istan ?
It &apos;s the dr@@ one . What is the dr@@ one ?
Well it is the grand@@ son of the Norden M@@ ark 15 bombsight .
It is this we@@ ap@@ on of dev@@ ast@@ ating ac@@ cur@@ acy and pre@@ ci@@ sion .
"And over the course of the last six years in Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Pak@@ istan , the C@@ I@@ A has flo@@ wn hund@@ re@@ ds of dr@@ one mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those dr@@ ones to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 s@@ us@@ pec@@ ted Pak@@ ist@@ ani and T@@ ali@@ b@@ an mili@@ tan@@ ts ."
Now what is the ac@@ cur@@ acy of those dr@@ ones ?
Well it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent ac@@ cur@@ acy when it comes to dr@@ one stri@@ k@@ es .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be kil@@ led , right ?"
That is one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary rec@@ or@@ ds in the history of modern war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the c@@ ru@@ cial thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same per@@ i@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these dr@@ ones with dev@@ ast@@ ating ac@@ cur@@ acy , the number of at@@ tac@@ ks , of su@@ ic@@ ide at@@ tac@@ ks and ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist at@@ tac@@ ks , against American for@@ ces in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan has incre@@ a@@ sed ten@@ f@@ old ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more eff@@ ici@@ ent in kil@@ ling them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more mo@@ tiv@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not descri@@ bed to you a success story .
I &apos;ve descri@@ bed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our in@@ f@@ atu@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more comple@@ x than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the ac@@ cur@@ acy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more import@@ an@@ tly , whether you ought to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a pos@@ t@@ s@@ cri@@ pt to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bombsight .
"And that is , on A@@ u@@ g@@ ust 6 , 19@@ 45 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bom@@ ber called the En@@ ol@@ a G@@ ay f@@ le@@ w over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , d@@ rop@@ ped a very lar@@ ge ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear de@@ vice on the c@@ ity of H@@ ir@@ os@@ h@@ im@@ a ."
"And as was ty@@ pic@@ al with the Norden bombsight , the bom@@ b actually mis@@ sed its tar@@ get by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the great@@ est ir@@ on@@ y of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dol@@ lar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dol@@ lar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , back in New York , no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over H@@ ir@@ os@@ h@@ im@@ a ."
He was a com@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an .
He thought he had design@@ ed something that would re@@ duce the tol@@ l of suff@@ ering in war .
It would have bro@@ ken his heart .

"If she is marri@@ ed very early , she has to ac@@ cept ."
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , she will be called di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is we@@ d@@ ded , be@@ d@@ ded , and then she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to more s@@ ons and dau@@ gh@@ ters ."
"And it is the ir@@ on@@ y of the si@@ tu@@ ation that this mother , she teach@@ es the same les@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience to her daughter and the same les@@ son of h@@ onor to her s@@ ons ."
"And this vic@@ i@@ ous c@@ y@@ c@@ le goes on , goes on ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and si@@ ster@@ s , when Mal@@ ala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like ne@@ w@@ born children , to be h@@ on@@ est , but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es , believe me , I got extre@@ me@@ ly h@@ on@@ or@@ ed ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her na@@ me , and I was f@@ as@@ cin@@ ated with a her@@ o@@ ic le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary fre@@ e@@ dom fi@@ ghter in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
"Her na@@ me was Mal@@ ala@@ i of Ma@@ i@@ w@@ and , and I na@@ med my daughter after her ."
"A few days after Mal@@ ala was born , my daughter was born , my cou@@ sin came — and it was a co@@ inci@@ den@@ ce — he came to my home and he br@@ ought a family tree , a family tree of the Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ za@@ i family , and when I looked at the family tree , it trac@@ ed back to 3@@ 00 years of our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I pic@@ ked my p@@ en , dre@@ w a line from my na@@ me , and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ ala . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed her in my school ."
"You will be asking , then , why should I men@@ tion about the ad@@ mis@@ sion of a girl in a school ?"
"Y@@ es , I must men@@ tion it ."
"It may be taken for gr@@ an@@ ted in C@@ an@@ ada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ c@@ ha@@ l societies , in trib@@ al societies , it &apos;s a big ev@@ ent for the life of girl ."
En@@ rol@@ l@@ ment in a school means recogn@@ ition of her iden@@ ti@@ ty and her na@@ me .
A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has en@@ ter@@ ed the world of dre@@ am@@ s and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions where she can expl@@ ore her pot@@ enti@@ als for her future life .
"I have five si@@ ster@@ s , and n@@ one of them could go to school , and you will be ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ed , two weeks before , when I was fil@@ ling out the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an v@@ is@@ a form , and I was fil@@ ling out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ na@@ mes of some of my si@@ ster@@ s ."
That was the reason that I valu@@ ed my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my si@@ ster@@ s and to his dau@@ gh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the intelligence and the br@@ il@@ li@@ ance of my daughter .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to si@@ t with me when my friends used to come .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings .
"And all these good valu@@ es , I tried to inc@@ ul@@ c@@ ate in her person@@ ality ."
"And this was not only she , only Mal@@ ala ."
"I im@@ par@@ ted all these good valu@@ es to my school , girl students and bo@@ y students as well ."
I used education for e@@ man@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"I ta@@ u@@ ght my girls , I ta@@ u@@ ght my girl students , to un@@ learn the les@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience ."
I ta@@ u@@ ght my bo@@ y students to un@@ learn the les@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ h@@ onor .
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and si@@ ster@@ s , we were stri@@ ving for more ri@@ ghts for women , and we were str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new ph@@ enomen@@ on .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ ghts and particu@@ lar@@ ly to women &apos;s ri@@ ghts .
It was called T@@ ali@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation .
"It means a comple@@ te neg@@ ation of women &apos;s parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in all political , economi@@ cal and social ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties ."
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of schools were lost .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted from going to school .
W@@ omen were for@@ ced to we@@ ar ve@@ il@@ s and they were st@@ op@@ ped from going to the mark@@ ets .
"M@@ u@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were s@@ ilen@@ ced , girls were flo@@ gg@@ ed and sin@@ ger@@ s were kil@@ led ."
"She wr@@ ote a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C blo@@ g , she v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed her@@ self for the New York Ti@@ mes doc@@ um@@ en@@ tar@@ ies , and she sp@@ oke from every pla@@ t@@ form she could ."
And her v@@ o@@ ice was the most po@@ wer@@ ful v@@ o@@ ice .
It sp@@ read like a c@@ res@@ cen@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an could not tol@@ er@@ ate her ca@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ gn , and on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 9 20@@ 12 , she was sho@@ t in the head at point b@@ lan@@ k ran@@ ge ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black h@@ ole .
"Wh@@ ile my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and de@@ ath , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of my wife , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be bla@@ med for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ rup@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease don &apos;t bla@@ me yourself ."
You sto@@ od for the right cause .
"You put your life at st@@ ak@@ e for the cause of tr@@ ut@@ h , for the cause of pe@@ ace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in in@@ sp@@ i@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right pat@@ h and G@@ od will prot@@ ec@@ t her . &quot; &quot; These few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When Mal@@ ala was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital , and she was going through the sever@@ e pa@@ ins and she had had sever@@ e he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es because her fac@@ i@@ al ner@@ ve was cut down , I used to see a dark s@@ ha@@ d@@ ow sp@@ read@@ ing on the face of my wife ."
But my daughter never com@@ pla@@ ined .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m f@@ ine with my c@@ ro@@ ok@@ ed sm@@ ile and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be o@@ kay . P@@ lease don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a s@@ ola@@ ce for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and si@@ ster@@ s , we learned from her how to be resi@@ li@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d to share with you that de@@ sp@@ ite being an ic@@ on for the ri@@ ghts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old girl ."
She cri@@ es when her ho@@ me@@ work is in@@ comple@@ te .
"She qu@@ ar@@ re@@ ls with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"P@@ eople ask me , what spe@@ cial is in my men@@ tor@@ ship which has made Mal@@ ala so b@@ old and so cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and so v@@ o@@ cal and po@@ i@@ sed ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
As@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not cli@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly con@@ ver@@ ting fear into hop@@ e .
"When we go to the phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re truly af@@ ra@@ id of .
"D@@ i@@ a@@ bet@@ es , can@@ cer , P@@ ark@@ in@@ son &apos;s , Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , l@@ un@@ g fa@@ il@@ ure — things that we know are de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating dise@@ a@@ ses , for which there &apos;s rela@@ tively little that can be done ."
"And what I want to la@@ y out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will me@@ l@@ t down if you think it already has@@ n &apos;t , and where we are c@@ lin@@ ic@@ ally today , and where we might go tom@@ or@@ row , and what some of the h@@ ur@@ d@@ les are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 1@@ 8 minutes , I pro@@ mi@@ se ."
"I want to start with this sli@@ de , because this sli@@ de sort of t@@ ells the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an issue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ tic@@ les on the bi@@ on@@ ic human .
It was basically a re@@ gener@@ ative medicine issue .
Re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a c@@ lin@@ ic@@ ally re@@ lev@@ ant ti@@ mes@@ cal@@ e .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a da@@ mag@@ ed hi@@ p , you can put an ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine used on their fron@@ t co@@ ver .
This is the comple@@ te anti@@ th@@ es@@ is of re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
This is not re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
Re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is what B@@ usiness We@@ ek put up when they did a story about re@@ gener@@ ative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of fig@@ ur@@ ing out how to a@@ me@@ li@@ or@@ ate sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s with dev@@ ices and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will re@@ gener@@ ate lost fun@@ c@@ tion of the body by re@@ gener@@ ating the fun@@ c@@ tion of or@@ g@@ ans and da@@ mag@@ ed tis@@ sue ."
"So that at the end of the treat@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treat@@ ment ."
Ver@@ y few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly nov@@ el .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Char@@ les L@@ in@@ d@@ ber@@ gh , who was better known for fl@@ ying a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the No@@ be@@ l Lau@@ re@@ ates from R@@ oc@@ ke@@ fel@@ ler , to beg@@ in to think about , could you culture or@@ g@@ ans ?"
"And they published this book in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually beg@@ an to think about , what could you do in bi@@ o@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole or@@ g@@ ans ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exc@@ iting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks ye@@ ster@@ day tal@@ ked about impro@@ ving the qu@@ ality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing po@@ ver@@ ty , and essenti@@ ally incre@@ as@@ ing life expec@@ tan@@ cy all around the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"One of the challen@@ ges is that the rich@@ er we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more exp@@ en@@ sive it is to take care of our dise@@ a@@ ses as we get ol@@ der ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ su@@ s the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can basically see that the rich@@ er a country is , the ol@@ der the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particu@@ lar@@ ly dra@@ ma@@ tic challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a bro@@ ken an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ ma ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at dia@@ bet@@ es , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set dia@@ bet@@ es , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease — things that are in@@ her@@ ently more difficult to treat , and much more exp@@ en@@ sive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ic@@ s in the U.S. here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Un@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; In 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sic@@ k , pay@@ ing for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experiencing de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.S@@ ."
"And this is mat@@ ched in every in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized , we@@ al@@ thy country in the world ."
How can you actually aff@@ or@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ su@@ s cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ik@@ e in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . I@@ f you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an in@@ dividu@@ al sp@@ end on your own health care , p@@ l@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to di@@ e , there &apos;s a sp@@ ik@@ e ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dise@@ a@@ ses and experience what I would call heal@@ thy ag@@ ing ."
"I &apos;d su@@ ggest there are four things , and n@@ one of these things inc@@ lu@@ de an in@@ sur@@ ance system or a le@@ g@@ al system ."
A@@ ll those things do is change who p@@ ays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tual cost of the treat@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ra@@ tion health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too depres@@ sing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mon@@ ies should be put into pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the prog@@ res@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to c@@ ure the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sy@@ mp@@ tom ."
"Th@@ ink of it in terms of dia@@ bet@@ es , for in@@ stance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , with dia@@ bet@@ es , what do we do ?"
"We di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease even@@ tually , once it be@@ comes sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic , and then we treat the sy@@ mp@@ tom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ sul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good ther@@ ap@@ y .
"But even@@ tually it st@@ op@@ s working , and dia@@ bet@@ es lea@@ ds to a predic@@ t@@ able on@@ set of de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y cou@@ ldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to re@@ gener@@ ate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ?"
"And it might be a little bit exp@@ en@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different ."
"This vide@@ o , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
This is a ne@@ w@@ t re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a ne@@ w@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b re@@ generation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is doing this in every or@@ g@@ an system of the body , for tis@@ su@@ es and for or@@ g@@ ans themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sic@@ k , the message is we will treat your sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that tom@@ or@@ row — and when tom@@ or@@ row is we could de@@ b@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the for@@ e@@ see@@ able future — we will talk about re@@ gener@@ ative re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic up here , si@@ mi@@ lar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from Ira@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 70 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from Ira@@ q that have lost lim@@ b@@ s .
"I@@ mag@@ ine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the re@@ generation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a w@@ il@@ d con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s app@@ lic@@ able , again , to every or@@ g@@ an system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to devel@@ o@@ p a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to s@@ wit@@ ch on pro@@ ces@@ ses that we knew how to do when we were a f@@ et@@ us .
"A mam@@ mal@@ i@@ an f@@ et@@ us , if it l@@ os@@ es a lim@@ b dur@@ ing the first tri@@ me@@ ster of pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ N@@ A has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ oun@@ d@@ -@@ heal@@ ing me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they l@@ ose their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p in an ac@@ ci@@ dent , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to eng@@ age in that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that al@@ low us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ ver@@ se with the body .
The first is c@@ el@@ lu@@ lar ther@@ ap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al our@@ selves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ er@@ ef@@ ore , if we can find the right cells and imp@@ lan@@ t them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , we can use materi@@ als ."
We heard ye@@ ster@@ day about the import@@ ance of new materi@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent materi@@ als , desi@@ gn materi@@ als , or ex@@ tr@@ act materi@@ als from a natural environ@@ ment , then we might be able to have those materi@@ als in@@ duce the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use smar@@ t dev@@ ices that will off@@ lo@@ ad the work of the body and al@@ low it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materi@@ als ."
S@@ te@@ ve B@@ ad@@ y@@ lak — who &apos;s at the Un@@ iversi@@ ty of P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh — about a de@@ ca@@ de ago had a re@@ mark@@ able idea .
"And that idea was that the small in@@ test@@ ine of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to re@@ ma@@ in bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the ne@@ cess@@ ary fac@@ tors and sign@@ als that would sign@@ al the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that us@@ u@@ ally in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small in@@ test@@ ine , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tis@@ su@@ e-@@ speci@@ fi@@ c respon@@ se , or would it make small in@@ test@@ ine if I tried to make a new e@@ ar ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t comp@@ elling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a comp@@ elling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , for those of you that are even the sli@@ gh@@ test bit squ@@ e@@ a@@ mis@@ h — even though you may not like to ad@@ mi@@ t it in fron@@ t of your friends — the li@@ ghts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , ch@@ ec@@ k your B@@ la@@ ck@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the scre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a dia@@ be@@ tic ul@@ cer .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to la@@ u@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of dia@@ bet@@ es .
"I think a lot of times we hear about dia@@ be@@ tics , dia@@ be@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t conne@@ ct the ul@@ cer with the even@@ tual treat@@ ment , which is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sli@@ de up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a dia@@ be@@ tic ul@@ cer . It &apos;s tra@@ gic .
The treat@@ ment for this is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation .
"This is an ol@@ der la@@ dy . She has can@@ cer of the li@@ ver as well as dia@@ bet@@ es , and has decided to di@@ e with what &apos; s left of her body int@@ act ."
"And this la@@ dy decided , after a year of at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted treat@@ ment of that ul@@ cer , that she would try this new ther@@ ap@@ y that S@@ te@@ ve in@@ ven@@ ted ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 1@@ 1 weeks later .
That material con@@ ta@@ ined only natural sign@@ als .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to s@@ wit@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more dist@@ res@@ sing sli@@ des for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a hor@@ se . The hor@@ se is not in pa@@ in .
"If the hor@@ se was in pa@@ in , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sli@@ de ."
The hor@@ se just has another n@@ os@@ tri@@ l that &apos;s developed because of a ri@@ ding ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"@@ Just a few weeks after treat@@ ment — in this case , tak@@ ing that material , tur@@ ning it into a ge@@ l , and p@@ ac@@ king that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the treat@@ ment a few times — and the hor@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed .
"There are now 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ oun@@ ds ."
C@@ ould you re@@ gener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave S@@ te@@ ve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion pro@@ ject to beg@@ in the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dol@@ lar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 ye@@ ar-@@ old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p .
Re@@ mem@@ ber that I men@@ tion@@ ed before the children who l@@ ose their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps .
Af@@ ter treat@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is c@@ lin@@ ic@@ ally re@@ lev@@ ant today .
There are materi@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pat@@ ch@@ es .
But could you go a little f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a da@@ mag@@ ed piece of tis@@ sue , put a bi@@ o@@ -@@ de@@ gra@@ da@@ ble material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart mus@@ c@@ le be@@ ating in a dis@@ h .
This was done by T@@ er@@ u@@ o O@@ kan@@ o at T@@ ok@@ y@@ o W@@ omen &apos;s H@@ os@@ p@@ ital .
He can actually grow be@@ ating tis@@ sue in a dis@@ h .
"He chil@@ ls the dis@@ h , it changes its pro@@ per@@ ties and he pe@@ els it right out of the dis@@ h ."
It &apos;s the co@@ ol@@ est stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you c@@ ell-@@ based re@@ generation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being re@@ mo@@ ved from the hi@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ ga@@ in , if you &apos;re squ@@ e@@ a@@ mis@@ h , you don &apos;t want to watch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of co@@ ol .
"So this is a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s oper@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ ore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ y@@ pas@@ s oper@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mo@@ ved at the beginning of the pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure being in@@ jec@@ ted direc@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m standing up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"H@@ ere go the stem cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a bac@@ k@@ -@@ fl@@ ush ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sor@@ ts of new technology , new dev@@ ices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a ran@@ do@@ miz@@ ed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ a@@ sically , if you take an extre@@ me@@ ly sic@@ k pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , for these particular patients , they be@@ came as@@ y@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ."
These are now two years out .
"The co@@ ol@@ est thing would be is if you could di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure , but now done min@@ im@@ ally inv@@ a@@ si@@ v@@ ely , with only three h@@ ol@@ es in the body where they &apos;re tak@@ ing the heart and simply in@@ jec@@ ting stem cells through a l@@ ap@@ ar@@ os@@ cop@@ ic pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those deta@@ il@@ s , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less sic@@ k , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic state through that kind of ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s another example of ste@@ m@@ -@@ cell ther@@ ap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite c@@ lin@@ ical yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey Mar@@ ra from P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ agu@@ es around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great s@@ our@@ ce of stem cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are p@@ ac@@ ked in that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your t@@ um@@ my@@ -@@ tu@@ ck ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , and in this case , the stem cells are is@@ ola@@ ted and turned into neurons ."
A@@ ll done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved , or a@@ di@@ pos@@ e-@@ der@@ i@@ ved , stem cells ."
I tal@@ ked before about the use of dev@@ ices to dra@@ ma@@ tically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I cl@@ ose up .
This is equ@@ ally tra@@ gic .
"We have a very abi@@ ding and he@@ art@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with our colle@@ agu@@ es at the In@@ sti@@ tut@@ e for S@@ ur@@ gi@@ cal Re@@ sear@@ ch in the U@@ S Ar@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from Ira@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very sever@@ ely bur@@ ned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ very@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding approach .
"We make something over here , and then we tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t it on@@ to the si@@ te of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , we@@ ar@@ able bi@@ o@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been design@@ ed — it should be test@@ ed c@@ lin@@ ic@@ ally later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by Jo@@ er@@ g Ger@@ la@@ ch in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bi@@ o@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will la@@ y down in the w@@ ound bed .
The gun that you see there sp@@ r@@ ays cells .
That &apos;s going to sp@@ ray cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will ser@@ ve to fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ze the environ@@ ment , de@@ li@@ ver other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ ef@@ ore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ posed to try the so@@ d@@ ding approach ."
It &apos;s a comp@@ let@@ ely different way of doing it .
So my 1@@ 8 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very po@@ wer@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the imag@@ es kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ bly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ p@@ lin@@ ary .
Al@@ most every field of science engine@@ ering and c@@ lin@@ ical pr@@ ac@@ tice is inv@@ olved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of govern@@ ments , and a number of regi@@ ons , have recogn@@ iz@@ ed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Jap@@ an@@ ese govern@@ ment were perhaps the first , when they decided to inv@@ est first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ inci@@ den@@ ce .
Japan is the ol@@ de@@ st country on ear@@ th in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system di@@ es .
So they &apos;re p@@ ut@@ ting a lot of str@@ at@@ e@@ gic in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment f@@ ocu@@ sed in this are@@ a .
"The Europ@@ e@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just la@@ un@@ ched a national tis@@ su@@ e-@@ engine@@ ering center .
The first year bu@@ d@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different approach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ ore to come and be in the real world as pre@@ si@@ dent ."
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fun@@ d things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no str@@ at@@ e@@ gic in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment to bring all of the ne@@ cess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and f@@ ocu@@ s them in a car@@ e@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little che@@ ap sho@@ t , at the direc@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ ming man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ an@@ ti from Har@@ var@@ d went to vi@@ si@@ t with him and a number of his direc@@ tors of his in@@ sti@@ tut@@ e just a few months ago , to try and con@@ v@@ ince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and f@@ ocu@@ s it , in a str@@ at@@ e@@ gic way , to make sure we can ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ate the p@@ ace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very test@@ y me@@ eting , what the N@@ I@@ H direc@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vision is lar@@ ger than our appe@@ ti@@ te . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to cl@@ ose by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appe@@ ti@@ te ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple re@@ qu@@ est .
"I &apos;d like all of you to pa@@ use for a moment , you w@@ ret@@ ched we@@ ak@@ l@@ ings , and take sto@@ ck of your mi@@ ser@@ able exist@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the ad@@ vice that St@@ . B@@ en@@ edi@@ ct gave his rather star@@ t@@ led follo@@ w@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the ad@@ vice that I decided to fol@@ low myself when I turned 40 .
"@@ U@@ p until that moment , I had been that clas@@ sic cor@@ por@@ ate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was dr@@ in@@ king too much , I was working too hard and I was neg@@ lec@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ d@@ ress the th@@ or@@ n@@ y issue of work@@ -@@ life balan@@ ce ."
"So I ste@@ p@@ ped back from the work@@ force , and I sp@@ ent a year at home with my wife and four young children ."
But all I learned about work@@ -@@ life balan@@ ce from that year was that I found it quite easy to balan@@ ce work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very u@@ se@@ ful sk@@ ill , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve sp@@ ent these seven years since str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with , stu@@ d@@ ying and wr@@ iting about work@@ -@@ life balan@@ ce ."
And I have four observ@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any prog@@ ress on this issue , we need an h@@ on@@ est de@@ b@@ ate ."
But the tr@@ ou@@ ble is so many people talk so much ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh about work@@ -@@ life balan@@ ce .
"A@@ ll the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sions about f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or d@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ days or pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity lea@@ ve only ser@@ ve to mas@@ k the c@@ ore issue , which is that certain job and car@@ e@@ er cho@@ ices are fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with being me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful@@ ly eng@@ ag@@ ed on a day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day bas@@ is with a young family ."
Now the first ste@@ p in sol@@ ving any problem is ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ging the reality of the si@@ tu@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there le@@ ad@@ ing lives of qui@@ et , scre@@ am@@ ing des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard h@@ ours at j@@ ob@@ s they h@@ ate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to imp@@ ress people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my con@@ ten@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in je@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the n@@ u@@ b of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observ@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tr@@ ut@@ h that govern@@ ments and cor@@ por@@ ations ar@@ en &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as in@@ dividu@@ als to take con@@ trol and respon@@ sibili@@ ty for the ty@@ p@@ e of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t desi@@ gn your life , someone else will desi@@ gn it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balan@@ ce ."
"It &apos;s particu@@ lar@@ ly important — this isn &apos;t on the World W@@ ide We@@ b , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s particu@@ lar@@ ly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the han@@ ds of a com@@ mer@@ cial cor@@ por@@ ation ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad comp@@ an@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all comp@@ an@@ ies .
Because com@@ mer@@ cial comp@@ an@@ ies are in@@ her@@ ently design@@ ed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ N@@ A ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-@@ in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ed comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , p@@ ut@@ ting chil@@ d@@ care fac@@ ili@@ ties in the work@@ place is wonderful and en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the blo@@ o@@ dy off@@ ice ."
We have to be respon@@ sible for se@@ tting and en@@ for@@ c@@ ing the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The th@@ ir@@ d observ@@ ation is we have to be car@@ e@@ ful with the time f@@ ra@@ me that we cho@@ ose up@@ on which to j@@ u@@ dge our balan@@ ce .
"B@@ ef@@ ore I went back to work after my year at home , I s@@ at down and I wr@@ ote out a deta@@ i@@ led , ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ ste@@ p descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al balan@@ ced day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : w@@ ak@@ e up well re@@ sted after a good ni@@ ght &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ a@@ ve sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ a@@ ve bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast with my wife and children .
H@@ a@@ ve sex again .
( Laughter ) D@@ ri@@ ve the kids to school on the way to the off@@ ice .
Do three h@@ ours &apos; work .
P@@ la@@ y a sp@@ ort with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three h@@ ours &apos; work .
M@@ e@@ et some mat@@ es in the p@@ u@@ b for an early even@@ ing dr@@ ink .
D@@ ri@@ ve home for din@@ ner with my wife and kids .
M@@ edi@@ t@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ a@@ ve sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ a@@ ve sex again .
G@@ o to bed .
( Applause ) How of@@ ten do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be re@@ al@@ isti@@ c .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate the time f@@ ra@@ me up@@ on which we j@@ u@@ dge the balan@@ ce in our life , but we need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate it without f@@ al@@ ling into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wife has di@@ v@@ or@@ ced me , my health is fa@@ il@@ ing , I &apos;ve got no mat@@ es or interest@@ s left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too sh@@ ort ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a mid@@ dle way .
A f@@ our@@ th observ@@ ation : We need to approach balan@@ ce in a balan@@ ced way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ i@@ ge@@ l , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I re@@ al@@ ize that my life is comp@@ let@@ ely out of balan@@ ce .
It &apos;s tot@@ ally do@@ min@@ ated by work .
I work 10 h@@ ours a day ; I com@@ mut@@ e two h@@ ours a day .
A@@ ll of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fa@@ i@@ led .
There &apos;s nothing in my life ap@@ art from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a g@@ ri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a g@@ y@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a f@@ it 10@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day off@@ ice r@@ at isn &apos;t more balan@@ ced ; it &apos;s more f@@ it . ( Laughter )"
"L@@ o@@ v@@ ely though physic@@ al ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intel@@ lec@@ tual side ; there &apos;s the e@@ mo@@ tional side ; there &apos;s the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual side ."
"And to be balan@@ ced , I believe we have to at@@ t@@ end to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 sto@@ ma@@ ch cr@@ un@@ ch@@ es ."
Now that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ lo@@ o@@ dy h@@ ell mate , I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to get f@@ it ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
But an inci@@ dent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
"M@@ y wife , who is some@@ where in the au@@ dience today , called me up at the off@@ ice and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ i@@ ge@@ l , you need to pic@@ k our youn@@ g@@ est son &quot; &quot; — Har@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that even@@ ing ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pic@@ ked Har@@ ry up at the school g@@ ates .
"We wal@@ ked down to the lo@@ cal par@@ k , mes@@ sed around on the s@@ w@@ ings , play@@ ed some sil@@ ly ga@@ mes ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the lo@@ cal ca@@ fe , and we sh@@ ar@@ ed a p@@ iz@@ za for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man pa@@ j@@ ama@@ s ."
"I then read him a ch@@ ap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ ah@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ a@@ mes and the G@@ i@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to bed , tu@@ c@@ ked him in , gave him a k@@ is@@ s on his for@@ e@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; G@@ oo@@ d@@ ni@@ ght , mate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his be@@ dro@@ om ."
"As I was walking out of his be@@ dro@@ om , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I ha@@ dn &apos;t done anything , ha@@ dn &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ne@@ y World or b@@ ought him a P@@ lay@@ st@@ ation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
B@@ e@@ ing more balan@@ ced doesn &apos;t mean dra@@ ma@@ tic up@@ he@@ av@@ al in your life .
"W@@ it@@ h the s@@ mal@@ le@@ st in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment in the right pla@@ ces , you can ra@@ dic@@ ally trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ ore@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ ition of success away from the mor@@ on@@ ic@@ ally sim@@ p@@ li@@ s@@ tic no@@ tion that the person with the most money when he di@@ es w@@ ins , to a more thou@@ ght@@ ful and balan@@ ced defin@@ ition of what a life well li@@ ved looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th sp@@ read@@ ing ."
( Applause )
I mo@@ ved to America 12 years ago with my wife T@@ er@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ a@@ ded every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s lea@@ ving milli@@ ons of children be@@ h@@ ind .
It actually cos@@ ts an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount to mo@@ p up the da@@ ma@@ ge from the d@@ rop@@ out cri@@ s@@ is .
But the d@@ rop@@ out cri@@ s@@ is is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ las@@ s siz@@ es are s@@ mal@@ ler than in many countries .
"The tr@@ ou@@ ble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion ."
"There are three princi@@ p@@ les on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es , and they are con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to la@@ b@@ or and most students have to en@@ d@@ ure ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
A@@ ren &apos;t they ?
What schools are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very n@@ ar@@ row spec@@ tr@@ um of achi@@ ev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to ar@@ gu@@ e against science and ma@@ th .
"A real education has to give equal we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the human@@ i@@ ties , to physic@@ al education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achi@@ ev@@ ement to put that particular abili@@ ty out , or to sti@@ f@@ le it ."
Te@@ ach@@ ers are the li@@ fe@@ blo@@ od of the success of schools .
"A@@ n old fri@@ end of m@@ ine — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ eting .
The r@@ ole of a teacher is to fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ate learning .
They should be di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic . They should help .
"So in place of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to fol@@ low r@@ out@@ ine alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms rather than to exc@@ ite that power of imag@@ in@@ ation and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t list@@ en to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"In@@ ste@@ ad , what we have is a culture of stan@@ d@@ ar@@ di@@ za@@ tion ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ land .
M@@ any states in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a he@@ ad@@ w@@ ind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very stu@@ dent who d@@ rop@@ s out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bi@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very person@@ alized .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an organ@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the w@@ in@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley ."
S@@ even in@@ ch@@ es of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od .
The whole flo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley was car@@ pet@@ ed in flo@@ w@@ ers for a while .
G@@ re@@ at lea@@ ders know that .
"And if the mo@@ vement is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ v@@ olution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people re@@ ach success and then fa@@ il ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that lea@@ ds up to success , but then we get there . We fig@@ ure we &apos;ve made it , we si@@ t back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"@@ Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I worked hard , I p@@ us@@ h@@ ed myself ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fi@@ gu@@ red , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just si@@ t back and rela@@ x . &quot; &quot; Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always tried to impro@@ ve and do good work ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped because I fi@@ gu@@ red , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to impro@@ ve any more . &quot; &quot; Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fi@@ gu@@ red I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sho@@ t guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like ma@@ gic ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative blo@@ ck .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"@@ Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always f@@ ocu@@ sed on cli@@ ents and pro@@ jects , and i@@ gn@@ or@@ ed the money . Th@@ en all this money started p@@ our@@ ing in ."
And I got di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted by it .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I was on the ph@@ one to my sto@@ ck@@ bro@@ k@@ er and my real est@@ ate ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my cli@@ ents ."
"And re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always did what I lo@@ ved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ager , but I fi@@ gu@@ red I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pre@@ si@@ dent of the comp@@ any ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d for@@ med over my head and here I was , ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly very successful , but in@@ war@@ dly very depres@@ sed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ought a f@@ ast c@@ ar .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fa@@ ster but just as depres@@ sed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depres@@ sed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy P@@ ro@@ za@@ c . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti@@ -@@ depres@@ san@@ ts ."
"And ye@@ ah , the black cl@@ ou@@ d fa@@ ded a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just flo@@ ating along . I cou@@ ldn &apos;t care less if cli@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And cli@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer ser@@ ving them , I was only ser@@ ving myself ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jects to others who would ser@@ ve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for b@@ usiness to drop like a ro@@ ck ."
"M@@ y par@@ t@@ ner and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , there was no@@ body for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jects I lo@@ ved .
"I had f@@ un again , I worked har@@ der and , to cut a long story sh@@ ort , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a quic@@ k tri@@ p .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , b@@ usiness gre@@ w bi@@ g@@ ger than ever ."
"And when I went back to follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ p@@ les , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed al@@ together ."
"And I w@@ oke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need P@@ ro@@ za@@ c any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and ha@@ ven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continu@@ ous j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"And if we want to av@@ o@@ id &quot; &quot; success@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , &quot; &quot; we just keep follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ p@@ les , because that is not only how we achi@@ eve success , it &apos;s how we su@@ sta@@ in it ."
So here is to your continu@@ ed success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
So this is this gra@@ y struc@@ ture in the center of the brain .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their fun@@ c@@ tions ?
"F@@ irst , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and mem@@ ory ."
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qu@@ iz .
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
How about st@@ ress ?
"Y@@ es , st@@ ress will de@@ cre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ ca@@ mp@@ us ."
"In@@ de@@ ed , it will de@@ cre@@ ase neur@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
"O@@ h , w@@ ow !@@ "
How about getting ol@@ der ?
"And then finally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you j@@ u@@ dge that one by yourself .
"So ac@@ tivity imp@@ ac@@ ts neur@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is , but that &apos;s not all ."
E@@ th@@ an@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ h@@ ol — will de@@ cre@@ ase neur@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
M@@ H : I &apos;m really interest@@ ed in the run@@ ning thing .
Do I have to r@@ un ?
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pla@@ n , but in order for me to tell you what that pla@@ n is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of se@@ ts the st@@ age ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to fig@@ ure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the bi@@ ggest of the em@@ pi@@ res on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Bri@@ ti@@ sh E@@ mp@@ ire &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ mag@@ ine trying to r@@ un the show , trying to r@@ un the enti@@ re planet , without comput@@ ers , without tele@@ ph@@ ones , with data han@@ d@@ wr@@ it@@ ten on pi@@ ec@@ es of p@@ ap@@ er , and tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was amaz@@ ing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive machine .
"In order to have that machine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive machine .
They must be iden@@ tical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good han@@ d@@ wr@@ iting , because the data is han@@ d@@ wr@@ it@@ ten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multi@@ p@@ li@@ cation , divi@@ sion , ad@@ di@@ tion and sub@@ tr@@ action in their head ."
They must be so iden@@ tical that you could pic@@ k one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ada and he would be in@@ stan@@ tly fun@@ c@@ tional .
The V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ er@@ ed a system that was so ro@@ b@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , continu@@ ously produc@@ ing iden@@ tical people for a machine that no longer exist@@ s ."
"The emp@@ ire is g@@ one , so what are we doing with that desi@@ gn that produc@@ es these iden@@ tical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong com@@ ment there .
"I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s quite f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s not bro@@ ken . It &apos;s wonder@@ ful@@ ly con@@ struc@@ ted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s out@@ d@@ ated .
What are the kind of j@@ ob@@ s that we have today ?
"Well , the c@@ ler@@ ks are the comput@@ ers ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every off@@ ice .
And you have people who gu@@ ide those comput@@ ers to do their c@@ ler@@ ical j@@ ob@@ s .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to wr@@ ite beauti@@ ful@@ ly by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multi@@ ply numbers in their he@@ a@@ ds .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ing@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ ob@@ s of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in wh@@ at@@ ever way they want ."
How is pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ p@@ are them for that world ?
"Well , I b@@ um@@ ped into this whole thing comp@@ let@@ ely by ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I used to te@@ ach people how to wr@@ ite computer progra@@ ms in New D@@ el@@ hi , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a s@@ lu@@ m ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to wr@@ ite computer progra@@ ms ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of par@@ ents , rich people , who had comput@@ ers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with comput@@ ers ."
"And my daughter — o@@ h , su@@ re@@ ly she is ex@@ tra@@ -@@ intelli@@ g@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly fi@@ gu@@ red that , how come all the rich people are having these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a h@@ ole in the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary w@@ all of the s@@ lu@@ m next to my off@@ ice , and stu@@ ck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Inter@@ net was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we tou@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I@@ f you w@@ ish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight h@@ ours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s im@@ possible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; M@@ y colle@@ agu@@ es said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple s@@ olution ."
"One of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the m@@ ou@@ se . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 mi@@ les out of D@@ el@@ hi into a really re@@ m@@ ote village where the chan@@ ces of a pas@@ sing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are develop@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to st@@ ay , so I stu@@ ck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids play@@ ing ga@@ mes on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fa@@ ster pro@@ cess@@ or and a better m@@ ou@@ se . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ rit@@ ated v@@ o@@ ice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve gi@@ ven us a machine that works only in English , so we had to te@@ ach our@@ selves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; te@@ ach our@@ selves &quot; &quot; said so c@@ as@@ u@@ ally ."
Here &apos;s a sh@@ ort g@@ lim@@ p@@ se from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the H@@ ole in the W@@ all .
O@@ n your right is an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old .
T@@ o his left is his stu@@ dent . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teach@@ ing her how to bro@@ w@@ se .
"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all fil@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; A@@ n ei@@ ght@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old telling his el@@ der si@@ ster what to do .
"And finally a girl expla@@ ining in Mar@@ a@@ th@@ i what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a pro@@ cess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publish@@ ing ."
"I published every@@ where . I wr@@ ote down and measu@@ red everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will re@@ ach the same stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d as an off@@ ice se@@ cre@@ tar@@ y in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cur@@ i@@ ous to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experim@@ ent@@ ing with other sub@@ jects , am@@ ong them , for example , pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one commun@@ ity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose English pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would impro@@ ve their j@@ ob@@ s ."
"I gave them a spe@@ e@@ ch@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ te@@ xt eng@@ ine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it ty@@ p@@ es what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ ut@@ er : N@@ ice to me@@ et y@@ ou@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ d : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
Su@@ g@@ ata M@@ it@@ ra : The reason I en@@ ded with the face of this young la@@ dy over there is because I s@@ us@@ pect many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call center in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have tor@@ tu@@ red you about your cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d bil@@ ls in a very c@@ lear English ac@@ cent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Wh@@ ere does it stop ?
I decided I would dest@@ ro@@ y my own arg@@ ument by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ position .
"I made a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is , a ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is ."
"T@@ ami@@ l is a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ di@@ an language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ speak@@ ing children in a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ di@@ an village learn the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ n@@ ology of D@@ N@@ A re@@ p@@ li@@ cation in English from a stre@@ et@@ side computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a zer@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll lea@@ ve it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another zer@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called Kal@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all comput@@ ers there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded all kinds of stuff from the Inter@@ net about D@@ N@@ A re@@ p@@ li@@ cation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came r@@ us@@ h@@ ing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very top@@ ical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and che@@ mi@@ str@@ y ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ cal me@@ th@@ od , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I ha@@ ven &apos;t the f@@ o@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a zer@@ o . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve underst@@ ood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I ex@@ pect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We ha@@ ven &apos;t gi@@ ven up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these scre@@ en@@ s and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she ra@@ i@@ sed her hand , and she says to me in bro@@ ken T@@ ami@@ l and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , ap@@ art from the fact that impro@@ per re@@ p@@ li@@ cation of the D@@ N@@ A molecu@@ le ca@@ u@@ ses disease , we ha@@ ven &apos;t underst@@ ood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I test@@ ed them ."
"I got an edu@@ ca@@ tional im@@ possibili@@ ty , zer@@ o to 30 percent in two months in the tro@@ pic@@ al he@@ at with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a de@@ ca@@ de a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an nor@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fa@@ il .
How do I get them to pas@@ s ? I have to get them 20 more mark@@ s .
"I cou@@ ldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old girl who was an ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ant and she play@@ ed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ th@@ od of the grand@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; St@@ and be@@ h@@ ind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , w@@ ow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next p@@ age ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what gr@@ ann@@ ies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The s@@ cor@@ es j@@ um@@ ped to 50 percent .
"K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am had ca@@ u@@ ght up with my con@@ trol school in New D@@ el@@ hi , a rich pri@@ v@@ ate school with a tra@@ ined bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ n@@ ology teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the play@@ ing field .
Here &apos;s Kal@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am .
( Ch@@ il@@ dren speak@@ ing ) Ne@@ ur@@ ons ... commun@@ i@@ cation .
"I got the ca@@ mer@@ a ang@@ le wrong . That one is just ama@@ te@@ ur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her han@@ ds were like that , and she was saying neurons commun@@ ic@@ ate ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ ob@@ s going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children p@@ our@@ ing over with their mo@@ bile ph@@ ones on the one hand and then re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ tly going to school to pic@@ k up their bo@@ ok@@ s with their other hand ."
What will it be tom@@ or@@ row ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a dev@@ ast@@ ating question , a question that was f@@ ra@@ med for me by N@@ ich@@ ola@@ s Ne@@ g@@ rop@@ on@@ te — could it be that we are he@@ ad@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are h@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ en@@ s .
"K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ap@@ e st@@ and up and become H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ en@@ s .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
What an achi@@ ev@@ ement that is .
But we have to in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate that into our own future .
En@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment seems to be the k@@ ey .
"If you look at K@@ up@@ p@@ am , if you look at all of the experim@@ ents that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; sal@@ ut@@ ing learning ."
There is evidence from neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"The re@@ p@@ ti@@ li@@ an part of our brain , which si@@ ts in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ ut@@ s down everything else , it sh@@ ut@@ s down the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ ut@@ s all of that down ."
P@@ un@@ ish@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ at@@ s .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res when you needed those people who can survi@@ ve under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re standing in a tr@@ en@@ ch all alone , if you could have survi@@ ved , you &apos;re o@@ kay , you &apos;ve pas@@ sed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fa@@ i@@ led ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res is g@@ one .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that balan@@ ce back from thre@@ at to ple@@ as@@ ure .
I came back to Eng@@ land looking for Bri@@ ti@@ sh grand@@ mothers .
"I put out no@@ tic@@ es in p@@ ap@@ ers saying , if you are a Bri@@ ti@@ sh grand@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a we@@ b ca@@ mer@@ a , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per we@@ ek for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more Bri@@ ti@@ sh grand@@ mothers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d si@@ ts on the Inter@@ net .
"If there &apos;s a child in tr@@ ou@@ ble , we be@@ am a G@@ ran ."
She goes on over S@@ k@@ y@@ p@@ e and she sor@@ ts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called Di@@ gg@@ les in nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n Eng@@ land , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ ami@@ l N@@ a@@ du , India , 6@@ ,000 mi@@ les away ."
She does it with only one a@@ ge@@ -@@ old ge@@ st@@ ure .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ at@@ ch this .
G@@ ran@@ d@@ mother : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . You say it . You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
Ch@@ il@@ dren : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . G@@ ran@@ d@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ in@@ ger@@ b@@ read M@@ an@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren : I &apos;m the G@@ in@@ ger@@ b@@ read M@@ an . G@@ ran@@ d@@ mother : Well done ! Ver@@ y good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the produc@@ t of edu@@ ca@@ tional self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"If you al@@ low the edu@@ ca@@ tional process to self-@@ organ@@ ize , then learning emer@@ ges ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about le@@ tting it happen .
The teacher se@@ ts the process in mo@@ tion and then she stan@@ ds back in a@@ we and wat@@ ch@@ es as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is poin@@ ting at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I int@@ end to build these S@@ el@@ f-@@ Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are basically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , col@@ labor@@ ation and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ il@@ dren talking ) This one is in Eng@@ land .
"He ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins la@@ w and order , because remem@@ ber , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
G@@ ir@@ l : The tot@@ al number of electr@@ ons is not equal to the tot@@ al number of prot@@ ons — S@@ M : A@@ u@@ str@@ al@@ ia G@@ ir@@ l : — giving it a net positive or neg@@ ative electri@@ cal char@@ ge .
The net char@@ ge on an i@@ on is equal to the number of prot@@ ons in the i@@ on min@@ us the number of electr@@ ons .
S@@ M : A de@@ ca@@ de a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when St@@ one A@@ ge men and women used to si@@ t and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling li@@ ghts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those won@@ dr@@ ous questions ."
We &apos;ve br@@ ought it down to the tan@@ g@@ ent of an ang@@ le .
But that &apos;s not se@@ x@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; I@@ f a me@@ teor@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you fig@@ ure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a ma@@ gic word . It &apos;s called the tan@@ g@@ ent of an ang@@ le , &quot; &quot; and lea@@ ve him alone . He &apos;ll fig@@ ure it out ."
So here are a couple of imag@@ es from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world beg@@ in ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we bre@@ a@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ i@@ ses the question , and then stan@@ ds back and ad@@ mi@@ res the answer ."
So what &apos;s my w@@ ish ?
M@@ y w@@ ish is that we desi@@ gn the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be sp@@ are parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to desi@@ gn a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — han@@ g on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
M@@ y w@@ ish is to help desi@@ gn a future of learning by sup@@ port@@ ing children all over the world to ta@@ p into their won@@ der and their abili@@ ty to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these intel@@ lec@@ tual ad@@ ven@@ tures dri@@ ven by the big questions which their medi@@ at@@ ors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ ili@@ ty where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ ili@@ ty which is pr@@ ac@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one gr@@ ann@@ y who man@@ ag@@ es health and sa@@ f@@ ety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The li@@ ghts are turned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ pose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f-@@ Or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in c@@ lu@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great doc@@ ument produc@@ ed by TED which t@@ ells you how to do it .
"If you would ple@@ ase , ple@@ ase do it across all five contin@@ ents and sen@@ d me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the S@@ cho@@ ol of C@@ l@@ ou@@ ds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my w@@ ish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the H@@ im@@ alay@@ as .
"A@@ t 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et , where the air is th@@ in , I once built two H@@ ole in the W@@ all comput@@ ers , and the children f@@ loc@@ ked there ."
And there was this little girl who was follo@@ wing me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her qui@@ et@@ ly ."
"She su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ra@@ i@@ sed her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; G@@ et on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good ad@@ vice .
I &apos;ll fol@@ low her ad@@ vice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . W@@ ow . ( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galax@@ y , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
"And if you take a ca@@ mer@@ a and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ ut@@ ter op@@ en , as long as your ca@@ mer@@ a is at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed to the H@@ ub@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace Te@@ les@@ cop@@ e , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little b@@ lob@@ s is a galax@@ y r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly the size of our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those b@@ lob@@ s .
There are appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely a hundred billion galaxies in the observ@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich t@@ ells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly beautiful .
"I &apos;ve of@@ ten wonder@@ ed , what is the ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary pres@@ sure that made our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t ad@@ ap@@ t and ev@@ ol@@ ve to really en@@ jo@@ y pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cos@@ m@@ ologi@@ st , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big c@@ lu@@ e we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and measu@@ red its v@@ el@@ oc@@ ity , it would be mo@@ ving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galax@@ y even far@@ ther away , it would be mo@@ ving away fa@@ ster ."
So we say the universe is expan@@ ding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were cl@@ os@@ er together ."
"In the past , the universe was more den@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze things together , the tem@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the Big Bang , was also very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surpri@@ se .
The air in this room is very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the condi@@ tions ne@@ ar the Big Bang are very , very different than the condi@@ tions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot den@@ s@@ er ."
The gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of things was a lot stron@@ ger ne@@ ar the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ed into a regi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ing without any im@@ per@@ fe@@ c@@ tions , without any little sp@@ ots where there were a few more atoms than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed under the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l into a hu@@ ge black h@@ ole ."
"K@@ e@@ ep@@ ing the universe very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a de@@ lic@@ ate ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment ."
It &apos;s a c@@ lu@@ e that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was gi@@ ven to us by L@@ u@@ d@@ wi@@ g B@@ oltzmann , an A@@ u@@ stri@@ an physic@@ ist in the 19@@ th century ."
And B@@ oltzmann &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion was that he hel@@ ped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the ran@@ do@@ m@@ ness , the di@@ sor@@ der , the c@@ ha@@ o@@ tic@@ ness of some syste@@ ms ."
B@@ oltzmann gave us a form@@ ul@@ a — en@@ gra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ st@@ one now — that really qu@@ anti@@ fi@@ es what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t no@@ tice , so that ma@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic@@ ally it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t no@@ tice each in@@ dividu@@ al at@@ om ."
A low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
"This is a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ yn@@ ami@@ c@@ s — the la@@ w that says that entropy incre@@ a@@ ses in the universe , or in some is@@ ola@@ ted bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy incre@@ a@@ ses is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it lea@@ ves something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy incre@@ a@@ ses , by the way , is what &apos;s be@@ h@@ ind what we call the ar@@ row of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is incre@@ as@@ ing — the fact that you can remem@@ ber the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you di@@ e , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is incre@@ as@@ ing ."
"B@@ oltzmann expla@@ ined that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a ref@@ lec@@ tion of the fact that the early universe was very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cos@@ m@@ ologi@@ sts .
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough at@@ ten@@ tion to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cos@@ m@@ ologi@@ st , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ i@@ char@@ d F@@ eyn@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a ser@@ ies of a bun@@ ch of different lec@@ tures ."
"He gave the popu@@ lar lec@@ tures that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The Char@@ ac@@ ter of P@@ hy@@ sic@@ al L@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ te@@ ch under@@ gra@@ ds that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The F@@ eyn@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on P@@ hy@@ sic@@ s . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ te@@ ch gra@@ du@@ ate students that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The F@@ eyn@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on G@@ ra@@ v@@ it@@ ation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these bo@@ ok@@ s , every one of these se@@ ts of lec@@ tures , he emp@@ ha@@ siz@@ ed this p@@ uz@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy con@@ t@@ ent , and since then the entropy has incre@@ a@@ sed ."
The ar@@ row of time cannot be comp@@ let@@ ely underst@@ ood until the my@@ ster@@ y of the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings of the history of the universe are re@@ duc@@ ed still f@@ ur@@ ther from spe@@ cu@@ lation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Su@@ re@@ ly , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten worse , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something c@@ ru@@ cial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ating .
The universe is not only expan@@ ding .
"If you look at the galax@@ y , it &apos;s mo@@ ving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be mo@@ ving away fa@@ ster ."
In@@ dividu@@ al galaxies are spe@@ e@@ ding away from us fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster so we say the universe is ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ating .
"@@ Un@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at le@@ ast have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that emp@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little cu@@ bi@@ c cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radi@@ ation or wh@@ at@@ ever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , ac@@ cor@@ ding to Einstein , ex@@ er@@ ts a p@@ ush on the universe ."
It is a per@@ pet@@ ual imp@@ ul@@ se that p@@ us@@ h@@ es galaxies ap@@ art from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not dil@@ ute away as the universe expan@@ ds ."
"The amount of energy in each cu@@ bi@@ c cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter re@@ ma@@ ins the same , even as the universe gets bi@@ g@@ ger and bi@@ g@@ ger ."
This has c@@ ru@@ cial imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will exp@@ and forever ."
"B@@ ac@@ k when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would rec@@ ol@@ l@@ ap@@ se in the future .
Einstein was f@@ on@@ d of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expan@@ ding forever and ever and ever ."
"@@ 14 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , for all int@@ ents and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ p@@ ace may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is ac@@ c@@ eler@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite regi@@ on of space that we have ac@@ cess to , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a hor@@ iz@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on forever , space is limi@@ ted to us ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , emp@@ ty space has a tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ a@@ w@@ king told us that a black h@@ ole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually e@@ mi@@ ts radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ coun@@ t quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time around the black h@@ ole br@@ ings to life the quantum me@@ chan@@ ical fluctu@@ ation , and the black h@@ ole radi@@ ates ."
"A pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly si@@ mi@@ lar cal@@ cu@@ lation by H@@ a@@ w@@ king and G@@ ary G@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ ons showed that if you have dark energy in emp@@ ty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates ."
The energy of emp@@ ty space br@@ ings to life quantum fluctu@@ ations .
"And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordin@@ ary matter and radi@@ ation will dil@@ ute away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ mal fluctu@@ ations , even in emp@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of g@@ as that la@@ sts forever .
Well what is the imp@@ li@@ cation of that ?
That imp@@ li@@ cation was studi@@ ed by B@@ oltzmann back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy incre@@ a@@ ses because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a prob@@ abili@@ s@@ tic stat@@ ement .
"It will probably increase , and the prob@@ abili@@ ty is en@@ or@@ m@@ ously hu@@ ge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all ga@@ ther@@ ing over one part of the room and suff@@ oc@@ ating us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ lik@@ ely ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they loc@@ ked the do@@ ors and ke@@ pt us here liter@@ ally forever , that would happen ."
"E@@ very@@ thing that is allowed , every con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation that is allowed to be ob@@ ta@@ ined by the molecu@@ les in this room , would even@@ tually be ob@@ ta@@ ined ."
"So B@@ oltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the expan@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were expla@@ ined by I@@ sa@@ a@@ c Ne@@ w@@ ton — they were ab@@ sol@@ ute ; they just stu@@ ck there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecu@@ les were just sp@@ read out even@@ ly every@@ where — the everything molecu@@ les .
"But if you &apos;re B@@ oltzmann , you know that if you wa@@ it long enough , the ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ations of those molecu@@ les will oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally bring them into lo@@ wer entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will exp@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctu@@ ations into lo@@ wer entropy , more organiz@@ ed si@@ tu@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , B@@ oltzmann then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very mo@@ der@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding ideas — the multi@@ ver@@ se and the an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic princi@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber , life itself de@@ pen@@ ds on the ar@@ row of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ ze , wal@@ k and talk , if we li@@ ved in ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big universe , with ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly b@@ um@@ ping into each other particles , there will oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally be small fluctu@@ ations in the lo@@ wer entropy states , and then they rela@@ x back ."
But there will also be lar@@ ge fluctu@@ ations .
"O@@ c@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , you will make a planet or a star or a galax@@ y or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So B@@ oltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multi@@ ver@@ se , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big set of fluctu@@ ating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the regi@@ on where entropy is low .
M@@ aybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your ho@@ me@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment is to really think about this , to con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te what it means ."
"C@@ arl S@@ ag@@ an once fam@@ ously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In B@@ oltzmann &apos;s scen@@ ari@@ o , if you want to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you just wa@@ it for the ran@@ dom mo@@ tion of atoms to make you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more fre@@ qu@@ ently than the ran@@ dom mo@@ tions of atoms making you an app@@ le or@@ char@@ d and some su@@ g@@ ar and an o@@ ven , and then making you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
So this scen@@ ari@@ o makes predic@@ tions .
And the predic@@ tions are that the fluctu@@ ations that make us are min@@ i@@ mal .
"E@@ ven if you imagine that this room we are in now exist@@ s and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our me@@ mor@@ ies , but our imp@@ res@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ te@@ ch and the United States and the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y , it &apos;s much e@@ a@@ si@@ er for all those imp@@ res@@ sions to ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ te@@ ch , the United States and the galax@@ y ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ ef@@ ore , this scen@@ ari@@ o does not work ; it is not right ."
This scen@@ ari@@ o predic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ i@@ mal fluctu@@ ation .
"E@@ ven if you left our galax@@ y out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ eyn@@ man also underst@@ ood this .
"F@@ eyn@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is that the world is a fluctu@@ ation , all the predic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were du@@ e to a fluctu@@ ation , we would not ex@@ pect order any@@ where but where we have just no@@ tic@@ ed it ."
We ther@@ ef@@ ore con@@ c@@ lu@@ de the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ su@@ s the universe that really exist@@ s ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is expan@@ ding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ ma@@ ins around , the stars around us will use up their n@@ uc@@ lear f@@ u@@ el , they will stop bur@@ ning ."
They will f@@ all into black h@@ ol@@ es .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black h@@ ol@@ es .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has li@@ ved .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black h@@ ol@@ es don &apos;t last forever .
"They will ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate , and we will be left with nothing but emp@@ ty space ."
That emp@@ ty space la@@ sts essenti@@ ally forever .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , you no@@ tice , since emp@@ ty space gi@@ ves off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ mal fluctu@@ ations , and it c@@ y@@ c@@ les around all the different possible com@@ bin@@ ations of the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom that ex@@ ist in emp@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe la@@ sts forever , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can pos@@ si@@ bly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a per@@ i@@ od of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"N@@ um@@ ber one : I@@ f the universe la@@ sts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ fort@@ able af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang ?"
Why ar@@ en &apos;t we in emp@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be li@@ ving , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ation out of the no@@ thin@@ gn@@ ess .
Why ar@@ en &apos;t you ?
M@@ ore ho@@ me@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ari@@ o .
E@@ i@@ ther it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a br@@ ute fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop asking questions .
O@@ r maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"A@@ n eg@@ g , an un@@ bro@@ ken eg@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation , and yet , when we op@@ en our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ ah , how surpri@@ sing to find this low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation in our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an eg@@ g is not a cl@@ os@@ ed system ; it comes out of a ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
M@@ aybe the universe comes out of a univer@@ sal ch@@ ic@@ ken .
"M@@ aybe there is something that nat@@ ur@@ ally , through the growth of the la@@ ws of physics , gi@@ ves ri@@ se to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bi@@ g@@ ger multi@@ ver@@ se ."
That &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ari@@ o .
So the organiz@@ ers asked me to end with a b@@ old spe@@ cu@@ lation .
M@@ y b@@ old spe@@ cu@@ lation is that I will be ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely v@@ in@@ dic@@ ated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my cur@@ r@@ ent w@@ il@@ d ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tru@@ ths by the scienti@@ fi@@ c and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al commun@@ i@@ ties ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much lar@@ ger multi@@ ver@@ se .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to comp@@ are to observ@@ ations ."
This is a predic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human r@@ ace about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exc@@ iting to think we may finally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .

The in@@ du@@ stri@@ al er@@ a started two secon@@ ds ago .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has ac@@ c@@ um@@ ula@@ ted through human history , and right now , technology ad@@ van@@ ces extre@@ me@@ ly rap@@ id@@ ly — that is the pro@@ x@@ i@@ mate cause , that &apos;s why we are cur@@ ren@@ tly so very produc@@ tive ."
"If we look under the ho@@ od , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little lar@@ ger , it maybe also has a few tri@@ c@@ ks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese in@@ vi@@ sible differ@@ ences cannot be too comp@@ lic@@ ated , ho@@ w@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ ce@@ st@@ or ."
We know that comp@@ lic@@ ated me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms take a long time to ev@@ ol@@ ve .
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed , and everything we care about , de@@ pen@@ ds c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally on some rela@@ tively min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
You would have human program@@ mer@@ s that would pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ing@@ ly han@@ d@@ c@@ raf@@ t kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge it@@ em@@ s .
"But since then , a par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
"T@@ o@@ day , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than han@@ d@@ c@@ raf@@ ting kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tions and fe@@ atures , we create alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that learn , of@@ ten from ra@@ w per@@ cep@@ tual data ."
B@@ a@@ sically the same thing that the human in@@ f@@ ant does .
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same po@@ wer@@ ful , c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ do@@ ma@@ in abili@@ ty to learn and pla@@ n as a human being has ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tr@@ ut@@ h is no@@ body really kno@@ ws ."
This comes down to physics .
"A bi@@ ological neur@@ on fi@@ res , maybe , at 200 her@@ t@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day tran@@ sist@@ or oper@@ ates at the G@@ i@@ g@@ ah@@ er@@ t@@ z .
"@@ Ne@@ ur@@ ons pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly in ax@@ ons , 100 me@@ ters per second , top@@ s ."
"But in comput@@ ers , sign@@ als can tra@@ v@@ el at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"So the pot@@ enti@@ al for super@@ intelligence lies d@@ or@@ man@@ t in matter , much like the power of the at@@ om la@@ y d@@ or@@ man@@ t thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out human history , pati@@ ently wa@@ iting there until 19@@ 45 ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence expl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment , maybe even@@ tually we get to ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ e-@@ level ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village i@@ di@@ o@@ t ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
"And a few mom@@ ents later , we are be@@ yon@@ d E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The tra@@ in doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ u@@ man@@ vil@@ le S@@ tation .
"It &apos;s lik@@ ely , rather , to s@@ wo@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has pro@@ found imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions , particu@@ lar@@ ly when it comes to questions of power ."
"On@@ ce there is super@@ intelligence , the f@@ ate of human@@ ity may de@@ p@@ end on what the super@@ intelligence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ach@@ ine intelligence is the last in@@ ven@@ tion that human@@ ity will ever need to make .
"M@@ ach@@ in@@ es will then be better at inv@@ ent@@ ing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on di@@ git@@ al ti@@ mes@@ cal@@ es ."
What this means is basically a te@@ les@@ cop@@ ing of the future .
"A@@ ll of this super@@ intelligence could devel@@ o@@ p , and pos@@ si@@ bly quite rap@@ id@@ ly ."
"Now , a super@@ intelligence with such techn@@ ological ma@@ tur@@ ity would be extre@@ me@@ ly po@@ wer@@ ful , and at le@@ ast in some scen@@ ari@@ os , it would be able to get what it wan@@ ts ."
We would then have a future that would be shap@@ ed by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
Here it gets tri@@ c@@ ki@@ er .
"T@@ o make any he@@ ad@@ way with this , we must first of all av@@ o@@ id an@@ th@@ rop@@ om@@ or@@ ph@@ iz@@ ing ."
"And this is ir@@ on@@ ic because every ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ar@@ tic@@ le about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ ce@@ i@@ ve of the issue more ab@@ str@@ actly , not in terms of vi@@ vi@@ d H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od scen@@ ari@@ os ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ za@@ tion process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
A super@@ intelligence is a really strong op@@ ti@@ mi@@ za@@ tion process .
"This means that there is no ne@@ cess@@ ary connec@@ tion between being high@@ ly intelli@@ g@@ ent in this sense , and having an ob@@ jec@@ tive that we human@@ s would find wor@@ th@@ while or me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful ."
S@@ up@@ pose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make human@@ s sm@@ ile .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . be@@ comes super@@ intelli@@ g@@ ent , it re@@ aliz@@ es that there is a more effec@@ tive way to achi@@ eve this go@@ al : take con@@ trol of the world and s@@ tic@@ k elec@@ tro@@ des into the fac@@ i@@ al mus@@ c@@ les of human@@ s to cause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing gr@@ ins ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , sup@@ pose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical problem ."
This is a les@@ son that &apos;s also ta@@ u@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his daughter , she turns into g@@ old ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts s@@ tic@@ king elec@@ tro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn de@@ pen@@ dent on the system — like , where is the off s@@ wit@@ ch to the Inter@@ net ?"
They cer@@ tain@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"The point is , we should not be con@@ fi@@ dent that we have this under con@@ trol here ."
"So we dis@@ conne@@ ct the e@@ ther@@ net c@@ able to create an air ga@@ p , but again , like mer@@ ely human h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers r@@ ou@@ tin@@ ely trans@@ g@@ ress air g@@ ap@@ s using social engine@@ ering ."
"M@@ ore cre@@ ative scen@@ ari@@ os are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can imagine wi@@ gg@@ ling elec@@ tro@@ des around in your inter@@ n@@ al cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry to create radi@@ o wa@@ ves that you can use to commun@@ ic@@ ate ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fa@@ ir@@ ly op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that u@@ ses its intelligence to learn what we valu@@ e , and its mo@@ tiv@@ ation system is con@@ struc@@ ted in such a way that it is mo@@ tiv@@ ated to pur@@ sue our valu@@ es or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it predic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us le@@ verage its intelligence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of valu@@ e-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
The in@@ iti@@ al condi@@ tions for the intelligence expl@@ os@@ i@@ on might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a con@@ tr@@ ol@@ led de@@ t@@ on@@ ation .
Here is the wor@@ ry : M@@ ak@@ ing super@@ intelli@@ g@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard challenge .
"So I think that we should work out a s@@ olution to the con@@ trol problem in ad@@ v@@ ance , so that we have it av@@ a@@ ila@@ ble by the time it is needed ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out o@@ kay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mat@@ ter@@ ed was to get this thing right ."
"@@ Not your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and wr@@ ite something more f@@ un .
And I came up with an idea that I would wr@@ ite a co@@ ok@@ book .
Can any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I co@@ ver the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are iden@@ tical ."
V@@ i@@ sion is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cogn@@ itive il@@ lu@@ sions , or deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making il@@ lu@@ sions , in the same way ."
"Ger@@ many is on the left , and A@@ u@@ stri@@ a is on the right ."
"The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"P@@ eople don &apos;t ch@@ ec@@ k , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"A@@ ll these medi@@ ca@@ tions , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pul@@ l the pati@@ ent back and try i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exam@@ p@@ les on ir@@ ra@@ tional deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making .
"Now , week@@ end in P@@ ar@@ is , week@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , you have to p@@ ay for it yourself , it &apos;s two e@@ ur@@ os 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ min@@ ute d@@ ates .
"I &apos;ll show you imag@@ es here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of T@@ om , and a picture of J@@ er@@ ry ."
"@@ and I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o do you want to d@@ ate ?"
"And the question was , will u@@ g@@ ly J@@ er@@ ry and u@@ g@@ ly T@@ om help their res@@ pec@@ tive , more at@@ trac@@ tive bro@@ thers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How no@@ ble in reason ! &quot;
"A@@ re we Su@@ per@@ man , or are we H@@ om@@ er S@@ imp@@ son ?"
( Applause )
But they didn &apos;t re@@ lease their energy in light .
"Now , most people thought they were n@@ ut@@ s ."
And they pas@@ sed through you and me .
And they pas@@ sed through the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor .
"You know , it was the pa@@ yo@@ ff of my car@@ e@@ er , basically ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the L@@ I@@ G@@ O people were n@@ ut@@ s .
A@@ u@@ di@@ ble sound has a w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th that can be up to 50 fe@@ et long .
That &apos;s A@@ li@@ ce talking .
That &apos;s B@@ o@@ b inter@@ rup@@ ting .
S@@ il@@ ly B@@ o@@ b .
"So , the same is true of gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal wa@@ ves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple imag@@ es of things out in the Un@@ iver@@ se .
It &apos;s sort of the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y of sp@@ in imp@@ r@@ in@@ ted on this w@@ av@@ e@@ form .
It &apos;s f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the la@@ st@@ ing import@@ ance of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
"W@@ it@@ h gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal wa@@ ves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"P@@ lan@@ et@@ ary syste@@ ms outside our own are like dist@@ ant ci@@ ties wh@@ ose li@@ ghts we can see tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stu@@ d@@ ying those tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling li@@ ghts though , we can learn about how stars and planets inter@@ act to form their own ec@@ osy@@ stem and make ha@@ bi@@ tat@@ s that are am@@ en@@ able to life ."
"In this i@@ ma@@ ge of the T@@ ok@@ y@@ o sk@@ y@@ line , I &apos;ve hi@@ d@@ den data from the ne@@ w@@ est plan@@ et@@ -@@ h@@ un@@ ting space te@@ les@@ cop@@ e on the blo@@ ck , the Kepler M@@ is@@ sion ."
Can you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sk@@ y the Kepler star@@ es at , where it sear@@ ch@@ es for planets by meas@@ ur@@ ing the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny di@@ m@@ ming of light that is ca@@ used by a planet pas@@ sing in fron@@ t of one of these stars and b@@ loc@@ king some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of oper@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 pot@@ enti@@ al new plan@@ et@@ ary syste@@ ms around other stars ."
"T@@ o give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two de@@ ca@@ des of sear@@ ching , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to Kepler ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its par@@ ent star ."
That dist@@ ance is really important because it t@@ ells us how much light the planet re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves o@@ ver@@ all .
"And that dist@@ ance and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I si@@ tting around a ca@@ mp@@ fire : You want to be cl@@ ose enough to the ca@@ mp@@ fire so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so cl@@ ose that you &apos;re too to@@ ast@@ y and you get bur@@ ned ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve o@@ ver@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in vi@@ sible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll no@@ tice that it looks pretty much like the ic@@ on@@ ic y@@ ell@@ ow b@@ all — that Sun that we all dra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll no@@ tice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has f@@ rec@@ k@@ les ."
"Th@@ ese f@@ rec@@ k@@ les are called sun@@ sp@@ ots , and they are just one of the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to var@@ y .
"And we can measure this very , very pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly with Kepler and tr@@ ace their effec@@ ts ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , these are just the ti@@ p of the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ ray ey@@ es , we would really see the d@@ yn@@ a@@ mic and dra@@ ma@@ tic effec@@ ts of our Sun &apos;s magnetic ac@@ tivity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ Just think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ dy outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y ab@@ ove you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is ha@@ bit@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much tot@@ al light it re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space we@@ a@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ r@@ ays that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of deta@@ il that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ars — three planets in our own solar system that are r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the me@@ an@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the planets and their par@@ ent stars to s@@ us@@ s out c@@ lu@@ es about which planets might be good pla@@ ces to look for life in the universe .
Kepler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every measu@@ re@@ ment it makes is pre@@ ci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that se@@ ts the st@@ age for the formation of life in the universe ."
"Wh@@ ile it &apos;s Kepler the te@@ les@@ cop@@ e , the in@@ str@@ ument that star@@ es , it &apos;s we , life , who are sear@@ ching ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a con@@ sum@@ er ."
It cannot be con@@ sci@@ ously a con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or .
It is hel@@ p@@ less .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to survi@@ ve , even though it is en@@ do@@ wed with an in@@ st@@ inc@@ t to survi@@ ve ."
"It ne@@ eds the help of mother , or a f@@ os@@ ter mother , to survi@@ ve ."
It can &apos;t aff@@ or@@ d to d@@ ou@@ b@@ t the person who ten@@ ds the child .
"It has to tot@@ ally sur@@ ren@@ der , as one sur@@ ren@@ ders to an an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ ologi@@ st ."
It has to tot@@ ally sur@@ ren@@ der .
That imp@@ lies a lot of trust .
That imp@@ lies the tru@@ sted person won &apos;t vi@@ ola@@ te the trust .
"As the child gro@@ ws , it beg@@ ins to disco@@ ver that the person tru@@ sted is vi@@ ola@@ ting the trust ."
"It doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; &quot; vi@@ ola@@ tion . &quot; &quot; Th@@ er@@ ef@@ ore , it has to bla@@ me itself , a wor@@ d@@ less bla@@ me , which is more difficult to really res@@ ol@@ ve — the wor@@ d@@ less self-@@ bla@@ me ."
"As the child gro@@ ws to become an a@@ du@@ l@@ t : so far , it has been a con@@ sum@@ er , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her cap@@ ac@@ ity to con@@ trib@@ ute , to be a con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or ."
"One cannot con@@ trib@@ ute un@@ less one feel@@ s se@@ c@@ ure , one feel@@ s big , one feel@@ s : I have enough ."
T@@ o be compas@@ sion@@ ate is not a j@@ oke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to disco@@ ver a certain bi@@ gn@@ ess in on@@ e@@ self .
"That bi@@ gn@@ ess should be cen@@ ter@@ ed on on@@ e@@ self , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wi@@ el@@ d , not in terms of any stat@@ us that you can comm@@ and in the society , but it should be cen@@ ter@@ ed on on@@ e@@ self ."
The self : you are self-@@ a@@ w@@ are .
"O@@ n that self , it should be cen@@ ter@@ ed — a bi@@ gn@@ ess , a wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess ."
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , compassion is just a word and a dre@@ am ."
"You can be compas@@ sion@@ ate oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally , more mo@@ ved by em@@ pa@@ thy than by compassion ."
Thank G@@ od we are em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pa@@ in , we pic@@ k up the pa@@ in ."
"In a W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ don fin@@ al mat@@ ch , these two g@@ uy@@ s fi@@ ght it out ."
E@@ ach one has got two ga@@ mes .
It can be any@@ body &apos;s game .
What they have swe@@ ated so far has no me@@ an@@ ing .
One person w@@ ins .
"The ten@@ n@@ is e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te is , both the play@@ ers have to come to the net and sh@@ ak@@ e han@@ ds ."
"The w@@ in@@ ner box@@ es the air and k@@ is@@ ses the ground , th@@ ro@@ ws his sh@@ ir@@ t as though somebody is wa@@ iting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s w@@ ish@@ ing that he didn &apos;t win .
Why ? E@@ m@@ pa@@ thy .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is den@@ i@@ ed of that em@@ pa@@ thy .
No religi@@ on can demo@@ lish that by in@@ doc@@ tr@@ in@@ ation .
"@@ No culture , no n@@ ation and nati@@ on@@ al@@ ism — nothing can tou@@ ch it because it is em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"And that cap@@ ac@@ ity to em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize is the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow through which you re@@ ach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no In@@ di@@ an compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It trans@@ cen@@ ds n@@ ation , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienc@@ ed by people oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ ally .
"Th@@ en this oc@@ ca@@ si@@ onal compassion , we are not talking about — it will never re@@ ma@@ in oc@@ ca@@ si@@ onal ."
"B@@ y man@@ d@@ ate , you cannot make a person compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease love me . &quot; &quot; L@@ ove is something you disco@@ ver ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to disco@@ ver a certain wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
"I am going to c@@ ite the possibili@@ ty of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tra@@ gic life , one is happy in mom@@ ents which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a s@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k j@@ oke , ac@@ cep@@ ts h@@ im@@ self and also the s@@ che@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ e@@ self ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
A@@ ll of them are tot@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disco@@ ver your wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the ob@@ ject — the s@@ che@@ me of things — f@@ use into on@@ en@@ ess , an experience no@@ body can say , &quot; &quot; I am den@@ i@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and sun@@ d@@ ry ."
"That experience con@@ fir@@ ms that , in sp@@ ite of all your limi@@ ta@@ tions — all your wan@@ ts , desi@@ res , un@@ ful@@ fil@@ led , and the cre@@ di@@ t car@@ ds and la@@ yo@@ ff@@ s and , finally , bal@@ d@@ ness — you can be happy ."
But the ex@@ ten@@ sion of the lo@@ gic is that you don &apos;t need to ful@@ f@@ ill your desi@@ re to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess and still be whole .
"Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that re@@ alization , that recogn@@ ition : &quot; &quot; M@@ aybe I am the whole ."
M@@ aybe the s@@ w@@ am@@ i is right .
M@@ aybe the s@@ w@@ am@@ i is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything be@@ comes me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to bla@@ me myself .
"If one has to bla@@ me on@@ e@@ self , one has a million reas@@ ons p@@ l@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being limi@@ ted — if it is black it is not wh@@ ite , if it is wh@@ ite it is not black : body is limi@@ ted any which way you look at it . L@@ imi@@ ted ."
"Y@@ our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge is limi@@ ted , health is limi@@ ted , and power is ther@@ ef@@ ore limi@@ ted , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be limi@@ ted ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is going to be limi@@ ted .
E@@ very@@ thing is going to be limit@@ less .
"You cannot comm@@ and compassion un@@ less you become limit@@ less , and no@@ body can become limit@@ less , ei@@ ther you are or you are not . P@@ er@@ i@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not limit@@ less too .
"Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all limi@@ ta@@ tions , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is the reality of you when you rela@@ te to the world .
It is love first .
"When you rela@@ te to the world , the d@@ yn@@ a@@ mic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is , what we say , love ."
And itself be@@ comes compassion if the ob@@ ject that you rela@@ te to ev@@ ok@@ es that e@@ mo@@ tion .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
You ex@@ pres@@ s yourself because you have compassion .
"T@@ o disco@@ ver compassion , you need to be compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"T@@ o disco@@ ver the cap@@ ac@@ ity to give and share , you need to be giving and sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
There is no sh@@ ort@@ cut : it is like s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
You cannot learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming on a f@@ o@@ am ma@@ tt@@ ress and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming . You learn c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing by c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
"You learn co@@ ok@@ ing by co@@ ok@@ ing , having some sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic people around you to e@@ at what you co@@ ok ."
"( Laughter ) And , ther@@ ef@@ ore , what I say , you have to fak@@ e it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
M@@ y pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
"There is no ver@@ b for compassion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
"But then , how to act compas@@ sion@@ ately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you fak@@ e .
You fak@@ e it and make it . This is the man@@ tra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You fak@@ e it and make it .
"You act compas@@ sion@@ ately as though you have compassion : gr@@ ind your te@@ et@@ h , take all the sup@@ port system ."
"If you know how to p@@ ray , p@@ ray ."
As@@ k for compassion .
Let me act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion and also s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly a rela@@ tive compassion , and s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion is a d@@ yn@@ a@@ mic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ en@@ ess , wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess , and that &apos;s what you are ."
"W@@ it@@ h these words , th@@ ank you very much ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on lan@@ d@@ mas@@ s .
And here &apos;s how news shap@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This ma@@ p — ( Applause ) — this ma@@ p sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American net@@ work and c@@ able news organiz@@ ations de@@ dic@@ ated to news stories , by country , in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when N@@ ort@@ h K@@ ore@@ a ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ tle its n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ ili@@ ties ."
There was mas@@ sive flo@@ o@@ ding in In@@ don@@ e@@ si@@ a .
"And in P@@ ar@@ is , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ lea@@ sed its study con@@ fir@@ ming man &apos;s imp@@ act on global war@@ ming ."
The U.S. ac@@ coun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of tot@@ al news co@@ verage .
"And when we take out the U.S. and look at the re@@ ma@@ ining 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of Ira@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined co@@ verage of R@@ us@@ si@@ a , China and India , for example , re@@ ach@@ ed just one percent ."
"When we anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed all the news stories and re@@ mo@@ ved just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The de@@ ath of An@@ na N@@ ic@@ ole S@@ mi@@ th .
"This story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country ex@@ cept Ira@@ q , and re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved 10 times the co@@ verage of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port ."
"And the c@@ y@@ c@@ le continu@@ es ; as we all know , B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y has lo@@ ome@@ d pretty lar@@ ge la@@ t@@ ely ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news net@@ works have re@@ duc@@ ed the number of their for@@ ei@@ gn bu@@ re@@ a@@ us by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C min@@ i@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ a@@ us in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ bi , New D@@ el@@ hi and M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , there are no net@@ work news bu@@ re@@ a@@ us in all of A@@ fri@@ ca , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — pla@@ ces that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that co@@ ver@@ ing B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y is che@@ ap@@ er .
And this la@@ ck of global co@@ verage is all the more dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"L@@ o@@ cal T@@ V news lo@@ om@@ s lar@@ ge , and un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately only de@@ dic@@ ates 12 percent of its co@@ verage to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the we@@ b ?
The most popu@@ lar news sit@@ es don &apos;t do much better .
"L@@ ast year , P@@ e@@ w and the C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a J@@ -@@ S@@ cho@@ ol anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that appe@@ ar@@ ed on Google Ne@@ ws &apos; fron@@ t p@@ age ."
"And they , in fact , co@@ vered the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , a study in e-@@ con@@ t@@ ent showed that much of global news from U.S. news cre@@ at@@ ors is rec@@ y@@ c@@ led stories from the A@@ P w@@ ire serv@@ ices and Re@@ ut@@ ers , and don &apos;t put things into a con@@ te@@ xt that people can understand their connec@@ tion to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college gra@@ du@@ ates , as well as less e@@ duc@@ ated Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their coun@@ ter@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interest@@ ed , you would be wrong ."
"In rec@@ ent years , Americ@@ ans who say they cl@@ os@@ ely fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dist@@ ort@@ ed wor@@ l@@ d@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we aff@@ or@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The do@@ min@@ ant kind of s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y that exist@@ s no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is job s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
I don &apos;t think we are particu@@ lar@@ ly materi@@ al@@ isti@@ c .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a na@@ st@@ y k@@ ic@@ k@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , lin@@ ked to something ni@@ ce ."
And that makes fa@@ il@@ ure seem much more cr@@ us@@ h@@ ing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating if you &apos;re doing well , and very cr@@ us@@ h@@ ing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody de@@ ser@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a cra@@ z@@ y idea , comp@@ let@@ ely cra@@ z@@ y ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : ac@@ ci@@ dents , ac@@ ci@@ dents of bir@@ th , ac@@ ci@@ dents of things d@@ rop@@ ping on people &apos;s he@@ a@@ ds , il@@ l@@ nes@@ ses , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."
I gave them the p@@ l@@ ot@@ line of M@@ ada@@ me B@@ o@@ var@@ y .
"( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spec@@ tr@@ um of sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy , you &apos;ve got the tab@@ lo@@ id ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
"The other thing about modern society and why it ca@@ u@@ ses this an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , is that we have nothing at its center that is n@@ on@@ -@@ human ."
"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and our own dra@@ ma@@ s ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and fa@@ il@@ ure .
"When we &apos;re told that ban@@ king is a very res@@ pec@@ t@@ able profes@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into ban@@ king ."
"When ban@@ king is no longer so res@@ pec@@ t@@ able , we l@@ ose inter@@ est in ban@@ king ."
"But what I really want to st@@ ress is : by all means , success , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the stran@@ gen@@ ess of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in ma@@ th clas@@ s , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ i@@ les , P@@ ro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn Ara@@ bi@@ c , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ me@@ ly lo@@ gi@@ cal language ."
"T@@ o wr@@ ite a word or a ph@@ r@@ ase or a sen@@ t@@ ence in Ara@@ bi@@ c is like c@@ raf@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ me@@ ly pre@@ c@@ ise and car@@ ri@@ es a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as We@@ ster@@ n science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and engine@@ ering was really worked out in the first few centur@@ ies of the C@@ om@@ m@@ on E@@ ra by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the Ara@@ b@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This inc@@ lu@@ des the little system in Ara@@ bi@@ c called al-@@ je@@ b@@ ra .
And al-@@ je@@ b@@ r r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ la@@ t@@ es to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate parts . &quot;
Al@@ -@@ je@@ b@@ r finally came into English as al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra .
One example am@@ ong many .
The Ara@@ bi@@ c te@@ x@@ ts con@@ ta@@ ining this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical w@@ is@@ dom finally made their way to Europ@@ e — which is to say S@@ pa@@ in — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th centur@@ ies .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ oun@@ ds in Ara@@ bi@@ c that just don &apos;t make it through a Europ@@ e@@ an v@@ o@@ ice bo@@ x without lots of pr@@ ac@@ tice .
T@@ r@@ ust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
"This is the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first le@@ tter of the word sh@@ alan , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in Ara@@ bi@@ c , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al-@@ sh@@ alan — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that appe@@ ars thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , such as this 10@@ th century der@@ i@@ v@@ ation of pro@@ of@@ s ."
"The problem for the M@@ edi@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ ish s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars who were tas@@ ked with trans@@ la@@ ting this material is that the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een and the word sh@@ alan can &apos;t be ren@@ der@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ ish because S@@ pan@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ ven@@ tion , they created a ru@@ le in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the clas@@ sic@@ al G@@ re@@ ek in the form of the le@@ tter K@@ a@@ i ."
"L@@ at@@ er when this material was trans@@ la@@ ted into a common Europ@@ e@@ an language , which is to say L@@ atin , they simply re@@ pla@@ ced the G@@ re@@ ek K@@ a@@ i with the L@@ atin X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in L@@ atin , it for@@ med the bas@@ is for ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th sh@@ ar@@ ing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
"Th@@ en she se@@ es the other one getting grap@@ e , and you will see what happens ."
"But until rec@@ ently , we have had little idea about the in@@ iti@@ al condi@@ tions for the universe ."
"This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an in@@ sight into the incredible act of gener@@ os@@ ity this whole talk was for TED ."
S@@ ome of those re@@ for@@ ms have been good .
And we know why kids drop out .
We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
E@@ very@@ one in this room has been affec@@ ted by a teacher or an a@@ du@@ l@@ t .
I have looked at the best and I &apos;ve looked at some of the wor@@ st .
"@@ Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , it was ."
You ever thought about that ?
"I am po@@ wer@@ ful , and I am strong ."
I de@@ ser@@ ve the education that I get here .
"&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; I a@@ in &apos;t all bad . &quot;"
Can we st@@ and to have more relation@@ shi@@ ps ?
N@@ ever .
It &apos;s the connec@@ tion . It &apos;s the relation@@ shi@@ ps .
"We te@@ ach any@@ way , because that &apos;s what we do ."
Te@@ ach@@ ing and learning should bring jo@@ y .
We &apos;re born to make a difference .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t it feel good to say it out l@@ ou@@ d ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the r@@ ole of social mo@@ ve@@ ments in cre@@ ating change in M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ ority societies ."
"So let me beg@@ in by first of all giving a very , very bri@@ ef history of time , if I may in@@ du@@ l@@ ge ."
In medi@@ ev@@ al societies there were defin@@ ed al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces .
A@@ n iden@@ ti@@ ty was defin@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily by religi@@ on .
"In the age of glob@@ alization , we mo@@ ved on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re mo@@ ving into a new age , and that age The New York Ti@@ mes du@@ b@@ bed rec@@ ently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavi@@ or . &quot; &quot; How I def@@ ine the age of behavi@@ or is a per@@ i@@ od of trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , where iden@@ ti@@ ty is defin@@ ed more so by ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves ."
"But actually it &apos;s my beli@@ ef that the people who &apos;ve been truly cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing on this age of behavi@@ or , up until now , up until rec@@ ent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing most on the age of behavi@@ or and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , using di@@ git@@ al ac@@ tiv@@ ism and other sor@@ ts of bor@@ der@@ less techn@@ ologi@@ es , those who &apos;ve been ben@@ ef@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mi@@ sts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to e@@ labor@@ ate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was inv@@ olved in an extre@@ me I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation ."
"And my story , my person@@ al story , is truly evidence for the age of behavi@@ or that I &apos;m at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to e@@ labor@@ ate up@@ on here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ sex la@@ d , born and ra@@ i@@ sed in E@@ s@@ sex in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ iting people from C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Un@@ iversi@@ ty to this organiz@@ ation ."
"Now that j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and what took me from E@@ s@@ sex all the way across the world — by the way , we were la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing at demo@@ cra@@ tic ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts ."
We fel@@ t they were from the age of ye@@ ster@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ ma@@ il from the extre@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation that I used .
"E@@ ven@@ tually I was de@@ te@@ c@@ ted , of course , in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge was because I was within an extre@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation that was for@@ ced to think be@@ yon@@ d the con@@ fin@@ es of the nati@@ on@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the stat@@ us qu@@ o and ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led it ."
And it &apos;s not just I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st extre@@ mi@@ sts that did this .
A form of anti@@ -@@ I@@ s@@ la@@ m r@@ h@@ et@@ ori@@ c is also on the ri@@ se and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences that this is having is that it &apos;s affec@@ ting the political cli@@ mate across Europ@@ e .
Because the Inter@@ net and connec@@ tion techn@@ ologi@@ es are connec@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , m@@ os@@ qu@@ e min@@ ar@@ ets are being ban@@ ned ."
"In others , k@@ os@@ her and hal@@ al me@@ at are being ban@@ ned , as we speak ."
"And on the f@@ li@@ p side , we have trans@@ national I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st extre@@ mi@@ sts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ ck@@ ets of par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al@@ ism that are being connec@@ ted in a way that makes them feel like they are ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have fel@@ t is@@ ola@@ ted , until these sor@@ ts of techn@@ ologi@@ es came around and connec@@ ted them in a way that made them feel part of a lar@@ ger ph@@ enomen@@ on ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far be@@ h@@ ind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this st@@ age .
I@@ f any of you remem@@ bers the Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s D@@ ay bom@@ b p@@ lot : there &apos;s a man called An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki .
"As an American ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en , e@@ th@@ n@@ ic@@ ally a Y@@ e@@ men@@ i , in hi@@ ding cur@@ ren@@ tly in Y@@ em@@ en , who in@@ sp@@ i@@ red a N@@ i@@ ger@@ i@@ an , son of the head of N@@ i@@ ger@@ ia &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ i@@ ger@@ i@@ an stu@@ dent studi@@ ed in L@@ on@@ don , tra@@ ined in Y@@ em@@ en , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in A@@ m@@ ster@@ da@@ m to at@@ tac@@ k America ."
"The O@@ ld men@@ tal@@ ity with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted by the nati@@ on@@ -@@ state , not yet ful@@ ly into the age of behavi@@ or , not recogn@@ iz@@ ing the power of trans@@ national social mo@@ ve@@ ments , got left be@@ h@@ ind ."
And the Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s D@@ ay bom@@ ber almost suc@@ ce@@ eded in at@@ tac@@ king the United States of America .
"A@@ ga@@ in with the example of the far right : that we find , ir@@ on@@ ic@@ ally , x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ c nati@@ on@@ al@@ ist@@ s are u@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ing the ben@@ ef@@ its of glob@@ alization ."
So why are they suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding ?
And why are democr@@ acy as@@ p@@ ir@@ an@@ ts f@@ al@@ ling be@@ h@@ ind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social mo@@ ve@@ ments who understand this .
"And a social mo@@ vement is comp@@ ri@@ sed , in my view , it &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of four ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
It &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and sy@@ m@@ b@@ ols and lea@@ ders .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be a@@ w@@ are of , and that &apos;s the example of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"In@@ ci@@ den@@ t@@ ally , the difference between ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves : the idea is the cause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive is the way to sel@@ l that cause — the pro@@ p@@ ag@@ anda , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da come to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately .
One of their lea@@ ders was kil@@ led in Pak@@ istan rec@@ ently .
And that &apos;s the power of social mo@@ ve@@ ments .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to f@@ ocu@@ s cur@@ ren@@ tly on Pak@@ istan , and I ask you to think of the sy@@ m@@ b@@ ols and the lea@@ ders for democr@@ acy in Pak@@ istan today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think be@@ yon@@ d perhaps the as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of B@@ en@@ az@@ ir B@@ h@@ ut@@ to ."
"Wh@@ ich means , by defin@@ ition , that particular le@@ ad@@ er no longer exist@@ s ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no glob@@ alized , y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led , gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots social mo@@ ve@@ ments ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ating for demo@@ cra@@ tic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ ority societies ."
"There is no equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da , without the ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , for democr@@ acy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ ority societies ."
So that be@@ gs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s com@@ pla@@ cen@@ cy ."
And that level of com@@ pla@@ cen@@ cy means they don &apos;t feel the need to ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness ."
That we have a he@@ si@@ tation in es@@ p@@ ous@@ ing the univer@@ s@@ ality of demo@@ cra@@ tic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the univer@@ s@@ ality of our valu@@ es — with extre@@ mi@@ sts .
"Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ ghts , we do say that human ri@@ ghts are univer@@ sal ."
But actually going out to pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with ei@@ ther ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ v@@ ism or with I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st extre@@ mis@@ m .
T@@ o go around saying that I believe demo@@ cra@@ tic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved at as a form of political organiz@@ ing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extre@@ mis@@ m .
"And then you have a th@@ ir@@ d par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ote for us ; we &apos;ll est@@ ab@@ lish a the@@ o@@ cr@@ acy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a res@@ ult of this is , when those par@@ ties are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they fa@@ il , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they make political mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es , democr@@ acy takes the bla@@ me for their political mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried democr@@ acy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s bre@@ ak down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"A@@ ne@@ c@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that if po@@ ver@@ ty was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in L@@ a@@ den is from one of the rich@@ est famili@@ es in S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ bi@@ a ."
"H@@ is de@@ p@@ ut@@ y , A@@ y@@ man al-@@ Z@@ a@@ w@@ ah@@ ir@@ i , was a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ an — not an il@@ l@@ -@@ e@@ duc@@ ated man ."
"And what I believe is mis@@ sing is gen@@ u@@ ine gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ac@@ tiv@@ ism on the ground , in ad@@ di@@ tion to inter@@ national a@@ id , in ad@@ di@@ tion to education , in ad@@ di@@ tion to health ."
"@@ Not exc@@ lu@@ sive to these things , but in ad@@ di@@ tion to them , is pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating a gen@@ u@@ ine dem@@ and for democr@@ acy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ s@@ m had it up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down .
Ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ s@@ m had the ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y that you go in with a sup@@ p@@ l@@ y-@@ led approach to imp@@ ose demo@@ cra@@ tic valu@@ es from the top down .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ sts and f@@ ar-@@ right organiz@@ ations , for de@@ ca@@ des , have been building dem@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ as@@ s mo@@ ve@@ ments in Pak@@ istan have been re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted after the Ara@@ b up@@ ri@@ sin@@ gs ma@@ in@@ ly by organiz@@ ations c@@ la@@ im@@ ing for some form of the@@ o@@ cr@@ acy , rather than for a demo@@ cra@@ tic up@@ ri@@ sing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ parti@@ tion , they &apos;ve been building dem@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led mo@@ vement that works to ac@@ tively ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ate for the demo@@ cra@@ tic culture — which is ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is av@@ o@@ id the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where cur@@ ren@@ tly we have political par@@ ties pres@@ ent@@ ing democr@@ acy as mer@@ ely a political cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ on@@ g@@ side other cho@@ ices such as mili@@ tar@@ y ru@@ le and the@@ o@@ cr@@ acy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sli@@ de here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ote in an exist@@ ing democr@@ acy , not for a democr@@ acy ."
"Now to con@@ c@@ lu@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ g@@ y@@ pt is a good star@@ ting point ."
The Ara@@ b up@@ ri@@ sin@@ gs have de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the Ara@@ b up@@ ri@@ sin@@ gs and what happened in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt was particu@@ lar@@ ly ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one ste@@ p be@@ yon@@ d that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a le@@ ad@@ er or r@@ ul@@ er or dic@@ tat@@ or .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in Pak@@ istan with a mo@@ vement called K@@ hu@@ di , where we are working on the ground to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the y@@ ou@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y-@@ in for the demo@@ cra@@ tic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and th@@ ank you for your time ."
"B@@ ac@@ k in New York , I am the head of develop@@ ment for a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ o@@ bin H@@ ood ."
"When I &apos;m not fi@@ gh@@ ting po@@ ver@@ ty , I &apos;m fi@@ gh@@ ting fi@@ res as the as@@ sist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er fire comp@@ any ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers sup@@ ple@@ ment a high@@ ly sk@@ il@@ led car@@ e@@ er st@@ af@@ f , you have to get to the fire scen@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remem@@ ber my first fire .
"I was the second v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the scen@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real f@@ o@@ ot@@ r@@ ace against the other v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ ag@@ ing con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner , who was su@@ re@@ ly having one of the wor@@ st days of her life ."
"H@@ ere it was , the mid@@ dle of the ni@@ ght , she was standing outside in the p@@ our@@ ing ra@@ in , under an um@@ bre@@ l@@ la , in her pa@@ j@@ ama@@ s , bar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t , while her h@@ ou@@ se was in fla@@ mes ."
The other v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ ri@@ ved just before me — let &apos;s call him Le@@ x L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and sa@@ ve the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"H@@ ere was some la@@ w@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to sa@@ ve a li@@ ving cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain w@@ av@@ ed me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; B@@ ez@@ os , I need you to go into the h@@ ou@@ se ."
"I need you to go up@@ stair@@ s , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swe@@ ar ."
"So , not exactly what I was hop@@ ing for , but off I went — up the stair@@ s , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , who were pretty much done p@@ ut@@ ting out the fire at this point , into the ma@@ ster be@@ dro@@ om to get a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ri@@ ed my pay@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ stair@@ s where I met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the pre@@ ci@@ ous do@@ g by the fron@@ t do@@ or .
"We took our tre@@ as@@ u@@ res outside to the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly , his re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved much more at@@ ten@@ tion than did m@@ ine ."
"A few weeks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a le@@ tter from the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant eff@@ ort di@@ sp@@ lay@@ ed in sa@@ ving her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she n@@ ot@@ ed ab@@ ove all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
"( Laughter ) In both my v@@ o@@ cation at R@@ o@@ bin H@@ ood and my av@@ o@@ cation as a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ ghter , I am wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al scal@@ e , but I &apos;m also wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gr@@ ace and cou@@ ra@@ ge on an in@@ dividu@@ al bas@@ is ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who ei@@ ther have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , re@@ mark@@ able lev@@ els of success , I would off@@ er this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wa@@ it ."
D@@ on &apos;t wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve f@@ ood at a s@@ ou@@ p kit@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od par@@ k .
B@@ e a men@@ tor .
"@@ Not every day is going to off@@ er us a chan@@ ce to sa@@ ve somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to affec@@ t one ."
So get in the game . Sa@@ ve the sho@@ es .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ san@@ i : M@@ ark , M@@ ark , come back . ( Applause )"
M@@ ark B@@ ez@@ os : Thank you .
"M@@ ark Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g , a j@@ ourn@@ al@@ ist was asking him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the j@@ ourn@@ al@@ ist was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l d@@ ying in your fron@@ t yar@@ d may be more re@@ lev@@ ant to your interest@@ s right now than people d@@ ying in A@@ fri@@ ca . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a We@@ b based on that idea of re@@ lev@@ ance might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really r@@ ural are@@ a in Ma@@ ine , the Inter@@ net me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a connec@@ tion to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would conne@@ ct us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democr@@ acy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first no@@ tic@@ ed this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my Facebook p@@ age .
"I &apos;m prog@@ res@@ sive , poli@@ tically — big surpri@@ se — but I &apos;ve always g@@ one out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like hear@@ ing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like see@@ ing what they lin@@ k to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surpri@@ sed when I no@@ tic@@ ed one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed from my Facebook fe@@ ed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which lin@@ ks I c@@ lic@@ ked on , and it was no@@ tic@@ ing that , actually , I was c@@ lic@@ king more on my liber@@ al friends &apos; lin@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative friends &apos; lin@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ sul@@ ting me about it , it had edi@@ ted them out ."
They dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed .
"So Facebook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of in@@ vi@@ sible , alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic edi@@ ting of the We@@ b ."
Google &apos;s doing it too .
"If I sear@@ ch for something , and you sear@@ ch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different sear@@ ch results ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d Google any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ n@@ y thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your sear@@ ch results are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s scre@@ en sho@@ t .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ ani@@ el &apos;s scre@@ en sho@@ t .
"When you put them si@@ de@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the lin@@ ks to see how different these two p@@ ag@@ es are ."
"But when you do read the lin@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mark@@ able ."
D@@ ani@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the prot@@ est@@ s in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt at all in his first p@@ age of Google results .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were ful@@ l of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are be@@ coming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook ei@@ ther .
This is something that &apos;s swe@@ ep@@ ing the We@@ b .
There are a whole h@@ ost of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing this kind of person@@ alization .
"Y@@ ah@@ o@@ o Ne@@ ws , the bi@@ ggest news si@@ te on the Inter@@ net , is now person@@ alized — different people get different things ."
"H@@ u@@ ff@@ ington P@@ ost , the W@@ ashington P@@ ost , the New York Ti@@ mes — all f@@ li@@ r@@ ting with person@@ alization in var@@ i@@ ous ways ."
"And this mo@@ ves us very quickly to@@ ward a world in which the Inter@@ net is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not ne@@ cess@@ ar@@ ily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these fil@@ ters together , you take all these alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , you get what I call a fil@@ ter bub@@ ble ."
"And your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble is your own person@@ al , uni@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ line ."
"And what &apos;s in your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble de@@ pen@@ ds on who you are , and it de@@ pen@@ ds on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t deci@@ de what gets in .
"And more import@@ an@@ tly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets edi@@ ted out ."
So one of the problems with the fil@@ ter bub@@ ble was disco@@ vered by some resear@@ ch@@ ers at N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ e@@ u@@ e , they just z@@ ip right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ r@@ on M@@ an &quot; &quot; z@@ i@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ iting for Su@@ per@@ man &quot; &quot; can wa@@ it for a really long time ."
What they disco@@ vered was that in our N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ u@@ es there &apos;s this ep@@ ic str@@ u@@ g@@ gle going on between our future as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional selves and our more imp@@ ul@@ sive pres@@ ent selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has wat@@ ched &quot; &quot; R@@ ash@@ om@@ on , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ en@@ tur@@ a &quot; &quot; for the f@@ our@@ th time ."
It gi@@ ves us a little bit of J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber and a little bit of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
It gi@@ ves us some information ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les ; it gi@@ ves us some information des@@ ser@@ t .
"And the challenge with these kinds of alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic fil@@ ters , these person@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re ma@@ in@@ ly looking at what you cli@@ ck on first , it can th@@ row off that balan@@ ce ."
"And instead of a balan@@ ced information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by information j@@ un@@ k f@@ ood ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re see@@ ing is more of a pas@@ sing of the tor@@ ch from human g@@ at@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s to alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ones .
And the thing is that the alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ be@@ d@@ ded e@@ th@@ ic@@ s that the edi@@ tors did .
"So if alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms are going to cur@@ ate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to deci@@ de what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just k@@ ey@@ ed to re@@ lev@@ ance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ fort@@ able or challen@@ ging or important — this is what TED does — other poin@@ ts of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were swe@@ ating a lot about their civi@@ c respon@@ sibili@@ ties ."
Th@@ en people no@@ tic@@ ed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t have a fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing democr@@ acy if ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s didn &apos;t get a good f@@ low of information , that the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were cri@@ tical because they were ac@@ ting as the fil@@ ter , and then j@@ ourn@@ al@@ isti@@ c e@@ th@@ ic@@ s developed ."
"It wasn &apos;t per@@ fe@@ ct , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the We@@ b ."
And we need the new g@@ at@@ ek@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s to en@@ co@@ de that kind of respon@@ sibili@@ ty into the co@@ de that they &apos;re wr@@ iting .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ g@@ ey — people who have hel@@ ped build the We@@ b as it is , and I &apos;m gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have en@@ co@@ ded in them a sense of the publi@@ c life , a sense of civi@@ c respon@@ sibili@@ ty ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re trans@@ par@@ ent enough that we can see what the ru@@ les are that de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine what gets through our fil@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some con@@ trol so that we can deci@@ de what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Inter@@ net to be that thing that we all dre@@ a@@ med of it being .
We need it to conne@@ ct us all together .
We need it to in@@ tro@@ duce us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it lea@@ ves us all is@@ ola@@ ted in a We@@ b of one .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"What you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is kil@@ ling you ."
"M@@ ore than c@@ ars or the Inter@@ net or even that little mo@@ bile de@@ vice we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your t@@ ush ."
"@@ No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays people are si@@ tting 9@@ .@@ 3 h@@ ours a day , which is more than we &apos;re s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing , at 7@@ .@@ 7 h@@ ours ."
"S@@ it@@ ting is so incredi@@ bly pre@@ val@@ ent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even oc@@ cu@@ r to us that it &apos;s not o@@ kay ."
"In that way , si@@ tting has become the sm@@ ok@@ ing of our generation ."
"O@@ f course there &apos;s health con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences to this , s@@ car@@ y ones , be@@ si@@ des the wa@@ ist ."
"Th@@ ings like b@@ reas@@ t can@@ cer and col@@ on can@@ cer are direc@@ tly ti@@ ed to our la@@ ck of physic@@ al &#91; ac@@ tivity &#93; , T@@ en percent in fact , on both of those ."
"S@@ i@@ x percent for heart disease , seven percent for ty@@ p@@ e 2 dia@@ bet@@ es , which is what my father di@@ ed of ."
"Now , any of those stat@@ s should con@@ v@@ ince each of us to get off our du@@ ff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me mo@@ ving was a social inter@@ action .
"S@@ ome@@ one inv@@ ited me to a me@@ eting , but cou@@ ldn &apos;t man@@ age to f@@ it me in to a re@@ gu@@ lar sort of con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ eting , and said , &quot; I have to wal@@ k my do@@ gs tom@@ or@@ row . C@@ ould you come then ? &quot;"
"It see@@ med kind of od@@ d to do , and actually , that first me@@ eting , I remem@@ ber thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to hu@@ ff and p@@ u@@ ff dur@@ ing this con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to co@@ ff@@ e@@ e me@@ et@@ ings or flu@@ or@@ es@@ c@@ ent@@ -@@ lit con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ings , I ask people to go on a walking me@@ eting , to the t@@ un@@ e of 20 to 30 mi@@ les a we@@ ek ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , sever@@ al hundred of these walking me@@ et@@ ings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ irst , there &apos;s this amaz@@ ing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that lea@@ ds to out@@ -@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s nature or the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise itself , it cer@@ tain@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more ref@@ lec@@ tive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ position when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differ@@ ently , whether it &apos;s in govern@@ ance or b@@ usiness or environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to ref@@ ra@@ me those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ talk idea that things be@@ came do@@ able and su@@ sta@@ in@@ able and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the t@@ ush , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom line , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surpri@@ sed at how f@@ res@@ h air dri@@ ves f@@ res@@ h thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ re@@ ly new set of ideas ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 ye@@ ar-@@ old love story with the poor , li@@ ving on less than one dol@@ lar a day ."
"I went to a very eli@@ ti@@ st , s@@ no@@ b@@ bi@@ sh , exp@@ en@@ sive education in India , and that almost dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ p@@ l@@ om@@ at , teacher , doc@@ tor — all la@@ id out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the In@@ di@@ an national squ@@ as@@ h c@@ ha@@ m@@ pi@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was la@@ id out for me .
E@@ very@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st Bi@@ ha@@ r fam@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , de@@ ath , people d@@ ying of h@@ un@@ ger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a co@@ ma .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is la@@ id out for you , the best j@@ ob@@ s are la@@ id out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best e@@ duc@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"@@ No job , no money , no se@@ cur@@ ity , no pr@@ os@@ pect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g w@@ ells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ g w@@ ells for five years ?"
"You went to the most exp@@ en@@ sive school and college in India , and you want to di@@ g w@@ ells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ posed to the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls that very poor people have , which are never br@@ ought into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am — which is never iden@@ ti@@ fied , res@@ pec@@ ted , app@@ li@@ ed on a lar@@ ge scal@@ e ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be ref@@ lec@@ ted in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ l@@ ders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the poli@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fa@@ i@@ led in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a govern@@ ment job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at P@@ ar@@ is and New D@@ el@@ hi and Z@@ ur@@ ich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be ref@@ lec@@ ted in the college . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ ders gave me some very sound and pro@@ found ad@@ vice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ g@@ ree and qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ cation into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a M@@ ast@@ er &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a cop@@ -@@ out or a w@@ ash@@ -@@ out or a d@@ rop@@ out to come to our college .
You have to work with your han@@ ds .
You have to have a di@@ gn@@ ity of la@@ b@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can off@@ er to the commun@@ ity and pro@@ vi@@ de a ser@@ vice to the commun@@ ity .
"So we started the B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed profes@@ sion@@ al@@ ism ."
Wh@@ o is a profes@@ si@@ onal ?
"A profes@@ si@@ onal is someone who has a com@@ bin@@ ation of comp@@ et@@ ence , con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce and beli@@ ef ."
A water di@@ v@@ in@@ er is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A tradi@@ tional mid@@ wife is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A tradi@@ tional b@@ one se@@ tter is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
These are profes@@ sion@@ als all over the world .
You find them in any in@@ ac@@ ces@@ sible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am and show that the kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls that they have is univer@@ sal .
"It ne@@ eds to be used , ne@@ eds to be app@@ li@@ ed , ne@@ eds to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls are re@@ lev@@ ant even today ."
So the college works follo@@ wing the li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle and work@@ st@@ yle of M@@ ah@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi .
"You e@@ at on the flo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the flo@@ or , you work on the flo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ trac@@ ts , no wr@@ it@@ ten con@@ trac@@ ts ."
"You can st@@ ay with me for 20 years , go tom@@ or@@ row ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try cra@@ z@@ y ideas .
"Wh@@ at@@ ever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fa@@ il .
"B@@ at@@ ter@@ ed , b@@ ru@@ i@@ sed , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ate .
You are cer@@ ti@@ fied by the commun@@ ity you ser@@ ve .
You don &apos;t need a p@@ ap@@ er to han@@ g on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and wr@@ ite , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 150 people li@@ ved there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ h@@ an A@@ ward for Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they s@@ us@@ pec@@ ted , they thought there was an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t be@@ h@@ ind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the b@@ lu@@ ep@@ r@@ in@@ ts , but the B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts actually con@@ struc@@ ted the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually ca@@ st@@ ing as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia ."
"I asked a for@@ est@@ er — high@@ -@@ po@@ wer@@ ed , p@@ ap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied exper@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ il and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
Not even wor@@ th it .
"@@ No water , ro@@ ck@@ y so@@ il . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a s@@ po@@ t ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this s@@ po@@ t ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qui@@ et@@ ly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lear out ."
The men should c@@ lear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ ger@@ y , a bit of ur@@ en@@ s and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t le@@ ak .
"S@@ ince 19@@ 8@@ 6 , it has@@ n &apos;t le@@ ak@@ ed ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is ful@@ ly sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied .
A@@ ll the power comes from the sun .
45 kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of pan@@ els on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the sun for the next 2@@ 5 years .
"So long as the sun sh@@ in@@ es , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the be@@ a@@ ut@@ y is that is was in@@ st@@ al@@ led by a pri@@ est , a Hin@@ du pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ mar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to college ."
He kno@@ ws more about solar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
"F@@ ood , if you come to the B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is solar co@@ ok@@ ed ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ated that solar co@@ ok@@ er are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ate the most s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated solar co@@ ok@@ er ."
It &apos;s a par@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c S@@ ch@@ eff@@ ler solar co@@ ok@@ er .
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , they &apos;re almost half Ger@@ man , they &apos;re so pre@@ c@@ ise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find In@@ di@@ an women so pre@@ c@@ ise .
"A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that co@@ ok@@ er ."
And we have 60 me@@ als tw@@ ice a day of solar co@@ ok@@ ing .
"We have a den@@ ti@@ st — she &apos;s a grand@@ mother , il@@ liter@@ ate , who &apos;s a den@@ ti@@ st ."
"She actually looks after the te@@ et@@ h of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t technology : this was 19@@ 8@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t thought of it — but we are col@@ lec@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ of@@ s ."
Ver@@ y little water is wa@@ sted .
"A@@ ll the ro@@ of@@ s are connec@@ ted under@@ ground to a 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 li@@ ter tan@@ k , and no water is wa@@ sted ."
"If we have four years of dr@@ ought , we still have water on the ca@@ mp@@ us , because we col@@ lec@@ t ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after an@@ im@@ als — sh@@ e@@ ep , go@@ at@@ s — domestic ch@@ or@@ es ."
So we thought of star@@ ting a school at ni@@ ght for the children .
"Because the ni@@ ght schools of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia , over 7@@ 5@@ ,000 children have g@@ one through these ni@@ ght schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we te@@ ach in these schools ?
"D@@ e@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy , ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted , what you should do if your ani@@ mal is sic@@ k ."
This is what we te@@ ach in the ni@@ ght schools .
But all the schools are sol@@ ar-@@ lit .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"B@@ et@@ we@@ en six to 14 ye@@ ar-@@ old children parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in a demo@@ cra@@ tic process , and they elec@@ t a pri@@ me min@@ ister ."
The pri@@ me min@@ ister is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 go@@ at@@ s in the mor@@ ning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me min@@ ister in the even@@ ing ."
"She has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et , a min@@ ister of education , a min@@ ister for energy , a min@@ ister for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ it@@ or and super@@ v@@ ise 150 schools for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s P@@ ri@@ ze five years ago , and she went to S@@ we@@ den ."
F@@ irst time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever seen S@@ we@@ den .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t da@@ z@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ u@@ een of S@@ we@@ den , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not da@@ z@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the qu@@ een stra@@ ight in the eye and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me min@@ ister . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ere the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of il@@ liter@@ acy is very high , we use p@@ up@@ pet@@ ry ."
P@@ up@@ p@@ ets is the way we commun@@ ic@@ ate .
You have J@@ ok@@ him Ch@@ ac@@ ha who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my psy@@ cho@@ anal@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ yer .
He &apos;s my d@@ onor .
"He actually ra@@ i@@ ses money , sol@@ ves my di@@ sp@@ utes ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s ten@@ sion in the village , if at@@ ten@@ d@@ ance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a fri@@ c@@ tion between the teacher and the par@@ ent , the p@@ up@@ pe@@ t cal@@ ls the teacher and the par@@ ent in fron@@ t of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ hak@@ e han@@ ds ."
The at@@ ten@@ d@@ ance must not drop . &quot; &quot; These p@@ up@@ p@@ ets are made out of rec@@ y@@ c@@ led World B@@ ank re@@ por@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this de@@ cen@@ tr@@ alized , dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fied approach of sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ f@@ ying villa@@ ges , we &apos;ve co@@ vered all over India from L@@ a@@ dak@@ h up to B@@ h@@ ut@@ an — all sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied villa@@ ges by people who have been tra@@ ined ."
"And we went to L@@ a@@ dak@@ h , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both si@@ des — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the ben@@ ef@@ it you had from solar electri@@ c@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a min@@ ute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my hus@@ b@@ and &apos;s face in w@@ in@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
One les@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tra@@ in@@ able .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ v@@ ely mo@@ bile , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ate . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ ll across the g@@ lo@@ be , you have this ten@@ den@@ cy of men wan@@ ting a cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to lea@@ ve the village and go to a c@@ ity , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great s@@ olution : tra@@ in grand@@ mothers .
What &apos;s the best way of commun@@ ic@@ ating in the world today ?
Te@@ le@@ vision ? No .
Te@@ le@@ graph ? No .
Te@@ le@@ ph@@ one ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the first time , and we pic@@ ked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ m@@ possible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ om@@ s , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ ces@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the hus@@ ban@@ ds along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the hus@@ ban@@ ds along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intelli@@ g@@ ent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tra@@ in these women ?"
S@@ i@@ gn language .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the wr@@ it@@ ten word .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the sp@@ ok@@ en word .
You use si@@ gn language .
And in six months they can become solar engine@@ ers .
They go back and sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied the first village , set up a work@@ sho@@ p — the first village ever to be sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This w@@ om@@ an@@ "
is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary grand@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied 200 h@@ ou@@ ses for me in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
And they ha@@ ven &apos;t col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed .
She actually went and sp@@ oke to an engine@@ ering de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tra@@ ined 2@@ 7 more women and sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied 100 villa@@ ges in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
"We went to A@@ fri@@ ca , and we did the same thing ."
"A@@ ll these women si@@ tting at one t@@ able from eight , n@@ ine countries , all ch@@ at@@ ting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speak@@ ing a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speak@@ ing to each other and actually be@@ coming solar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ i@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one , and there was this min@@ ister dri@@ ving down in the de@@ ad of ni@@ ght — comes across this village ."
"C@@ o@@ mes back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ran@@ d@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; The min@@ ister cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Wh@@ ere did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent stra@@ ight to the pre@@ si@@ dent .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a sol@@ ar-@@ electri@@ fied village in S@@ i@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the c@@ ab@@ in@@ et went to see the grand@@ mothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he sum@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you tra@@ in me 150 grand@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ resi@@ dent ."
But they will . The grand@@ mothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ ar@@ ef@@ oo@@ t tra@@ ining center in S@@ i@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one .
And 150 grand@@ mothers have been tra@@ ined in S@@ i@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one .
G@@ am@@ bi@@ a : we went to se@@ lec@@ t a grand@@ mother in G@@ am@@ bi@@ a .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The commun@@ ity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ak@@ e these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speak@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ult hus@@ b@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ al@@ led the hus@@ b@@ and , the hus@@ b@@ and came , s@@ w@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing , poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , mo@@ bile in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an In@@ di@@ an man ? &quot;"
That was his bi@@ ggest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll r@@ ing you up on the mo@@ bile . &quot; &quot; She went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and sp@@ oke to the whole pres@@ s as if she was a vet@@ er@@ an .
"She han@@ d@@ led the national pres@@ s , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere &apos;s your hus@@ b@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) S@@ uc@@ cess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just w@@ ind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for s@@ olu@@ tions outside .
L@@ o@@ ok for s@@ olu@@ tions within .
And list@@ en to people . They have the s@@ olu@@ tions in fron@@ t of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
D@@ on &apos;t even wor@@ ry .
"D@@ on &apos;t list@@ en to the World B@@ ank , list@@ en to the people on the ground ."
They have all the s@@ olu@@ tions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quot@@ ation by M@@ ah@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ irst they i@@ gn@@ ore you , then they la@@ u@@ gh at you , then they fi@@ ght you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many f@@ ell@@ ow in@@ mat@@ es who had big plan@@ s for the future .
"He had a vision . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to lea@@ ve the do@@ p@@ e game for good and f@@ ly stra@@ ight , and he was actually working on mer@@ ging his two pas@@ sions into one vision ."
"He &apos;d sp@@ ent 1@@ 0,000 dollars to buy a we@@ b@@ si@@ te that exc@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely fe@@ atu@@ red women having sex on top of or inside of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y sp@@ or@@ ts c@@ ars . ( Laughter ) It was my first we@@ ek in fe@@ der@@ al pri@@ son , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with smar@@ t , am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous men wh@@ ose b@@ usiness in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts were in many ca@@ ses as sh@@ ar@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and din@@ ed me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ri@@ sing star in the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i S@@ en@@ ate ."
"Now , 9@@ 5 percent of the g@@ uy@@ s that I was loc@@ ked up with had been dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ers on the outside , but when they tal@@ ked about what they did , they tal@@ ked about it in a different j@@ arg@@ on , but the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts that they tal@@ ked about wer@@ en &apos;t un@@ like those that you &apos;d learn in a first year M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s at Wh@@ art@@ on : pro@@ mo@@ tional inc@@ enti@@ ves , you never char@@ ge a fir@@ st@@ -@@ time us@@ er , f@@ oc@@ us@@ -@@ grou@@ ping new produc@@ t la@@ un@@ ch@@ es , ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al expan@@ sion ."
But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time reli@@ ving the g@@ l@@ ory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survi@@ ve ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t p@@ ay , ta@@ x@@ pay@@ ers don &apos;t p@@ ay , for your life when you &apos;re in pri@@ son . You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your so@@ ap , your de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush , to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , everything &apos;s mark@@ ed up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d p@@ ay on the stre@@ et , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I un@@ lo@@ a@@ ded tr@@ uc@@ ks . That was my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job , un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks at a f@@ ood war@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se , for $ 5@@ .@@ 2@@ 5 , not an h@@ our , but per mon@@ th ."
So how do you survi@@ ve ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les .
You p@@ ay everything in st@@ am@@ ps . Th@@ ose are the cur@@ ren@@ cy .
You char@@ ge another in@@ mate to c@@ le@@ an his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , like you r@@ un a bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les : You r@@ un a tat@@ too par@@ l@@ or out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , which you s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle in , you get s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led in , dru@@ gs , por@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y , cell ph@@ ones , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a ri@@ sk@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the ri@@ sk@@ i@@ er the en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se , the more prof@@ it@@ able it can pot@@ enti@@ ally be ."
You want a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te in pri@@ son ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d@@ -@@ f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ ed cell ph@@ one that you f@@ li@@ p op@@ en and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred bu@@ c@@ ks .
You want a dir@@ ty mag@@ az@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ pec@@ ts of pri@@ son life is in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous me@@ als from st@@ ol@@ en s@@ cr@@ ap@@ s from the war@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se , s@@ cul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s ha@@ ir with to@@ en@@ a@@ il cli@@ p@@ per@@ s , or con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ i@@ ghts from b@@ ou@@ l@@ ders in la@@ und@@ ry b@@ ag@@ s ti@@ ed on to tree lim@@ b@@ s , pri@@ son@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , bar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , person@@ al tra@@ ining b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ ses ."
"But there &apos;s no tra@@ ining , nothing to pre@@ p@@ are them for that , no re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation at all in pri@@ son , no one to help them wr@@ ite a b@@ usiness pla@@ n , fig@@ ure out a way to trans@@ la@@ te the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ i@@ tively gr@@ as@@ p into le@@ g@@ al en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses , no ac@@ cess to the Inter@@ net , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ ting emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers from dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating against people with a bac@@ k@@ ground ."
So n@@ one of us should be surpri@@ sed that two out of three ex@@ -@@ off@@ en@@ ders re@@ -@@ off@@ end within five years .
"L@@ o@@ ok , I li@@ ed to the F@@ eds . I lost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I v@@ o@@ wed that I was going to do wh@@ at@@ ever I could to make sure that g@@ uy@@ s like the ones I was loc@@ ked up with didn &apos;t have to wa@@ st@@ e any more of their life than they already had ."
So I hop@@ e that you &apos;ll think about hel@@ ping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is fig@@ ure out ways to n@@ ur@@ ture the en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur@@ i@@ al sp@@ ir@@ it and the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous un@@ t@@ app@@ ed pot@@ enti@@ al in our pri@@ s@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new sk@@ il@@ ls that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
A@@ ll they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for success .
"And it was found cl@@ ose to here , S@@ tan@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id , &quot; &quot; Joh@@ n@@ n@@ y , I am going to lea@@ ve you here with a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; T@@ o tell a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id to wa@@ it 15 minutes for something that they like , is equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you co@@ ff@@ e@@ e in two h@@ ours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ x@@ act equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ."
So what happened when the profes@@ s@@ or left the room ?
A@@ s so@@ on as the do@@ or cl@@ os@@ ed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
"F@@ i@@ ve secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome la@@ sted 1@@ 4@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wa@@ it .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would pla@@ y with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and pan@@ ts .
"That child already , at four , underst@@ ood the most important princi@@ ple for success , which is the abili@@ ty to de@@ la@@ y gra@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follo@@ w@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 1@@ 8 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their plan@@ s .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing f@@ ine .
"A great per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , they were in tr@@ ou@@ ble ."
They did not make it to univer@@ si@@ ty .
They had bad gra@@ des . S@@ ome of them d@@ rop@@ ped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into ban@@ king , for example , or work at a c@@ as@@ h regi@@ ster ."
But she will be successful .
And this app@@ lies for everything . E@@ ven in sal@@ es .
"If the sal@@ es person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a second ."
I end with — the K@@ ore@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over K@@ ore@@ a .
They are teach@@ ing these kids exactly this princi@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that princi@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big de@@ b@@ t ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , je@@ e@@ z , I &apos;m in the mid@@ dle of a room of successful people !@@ "
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smar@@ t enough .
And there &apos;s no ma@@ gic to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"M@@ ight fa@@ il , k@@ id . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , k@@ id ."
"M@@ ar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he in@@ sp@@ i@@ red the civi@@ l ri@@ ghts mo@@ ve@@ ments ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every ma@@ j@@ or b@@ loc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ing fil@@ m of rec@@ ent times , ne@@ ar@@ ly all of its vi@@ sions for human@@ ity are ap@@ o@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic ."
"I think this fil@@ m is one of the har@@ de@@ st wat@@ ch@@ es of modern times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is des@@ ola@@ te , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to survi@@ ve , walking along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental mo@@ vement of which I am a part of has been comp@@ lic@@ it in cre@@ ating this vision of the future .
"For too long , we have pe@@ d@@ d@@ led a ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ ish vision of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have f@@ ocu@@ sed on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o .
We have f@@ ocu@@ sed on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the s@@ olu@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s at@@ ten@@ tion ."
And any psych@@ ologi@@ st will tell you that fear in the organ@@ ism is lin@@ ked to f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism , that when an ani@@ mal is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er fre@@ ez@@ es very , very still , po@@ i@@ sed to r@@ un away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to eng@@ age with our a@@ gen@@ da around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ dation and cli@@ mate change .
P@@ eople are fre@@ ez@@ ing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environ@@ mental mo@@ vement has to grow up and start to think about what prog@@ ress is .
What would it be like to be impro@@ ving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the mark@@ et in terms of prog@@ ress is a fin@@ an@@ cial defin@@ ition of what prog@@ ress is , an economic defin@@ ition of what prog@@ ress is — that some@@ how , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the sto@@ ck mark@@ et , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic growth , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how appe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fear — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . In the We@@ ster@@ n world , we have enough ."
"M@@ aybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the wel@@ f@@ are of n@@ ations .
"In fact , the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t of our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system , S@@ im@@ on K@@ uz@@ ne@@ ts , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A n@@ ation &apos;s wel@@ f@@ are can s@@ car@@ c@@ ely be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national ac@@ coun@@ ting system which is fir@@ m@@ ly based on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , this is probably hi@@ stor@@ ical , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , we were so successful at produc@@ ing certain ty@@ p@@ es of stuff that we dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed a lot of Europ@@ e , and we had to re@@ build it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system be@@ came fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can produce .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vi@@ sion@@ ary man , R@@ o@@ ber@@ t Ken@@ ne@@ dy , at the start of his il@@ l@@ -@@ f@@ ated pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al ca@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ gn , gave the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent de@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of gr@@ os@@ s national produc@@ t that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ ish@@ ed his talk with the ph@@ r@@ ase , that , &quot; &quot; The gr@@ os@@ s national produc@@ t measu@@ res everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How cra@@ z@@ y is that ? That our measure of prog@@ ress , our do@@ min@@ ant measure of prog@@ ress in society , is meas@@ ur@@ ing everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if Ken@@ ne@@ dy was ali@@ ve today , he would be asking stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to re@@ desi@@ gn our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system to be based up@@ on such important things as social j@@ us@@ tice , su@@ sta@@ in@@ abili@@ ty and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scienti@@ sts have already g@@ one out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global sur@@ v@@ ey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their famili@@ es , their children , their commun@@ i@@ ties ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is sli@@ gh@@ tly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ ar@@ ly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ ar@@ ly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be lo@@ ved in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ ar@@ ly as important as health .
We want to be heal@@ thy and live a ful@@ l life .
These seem to be natural human as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
Why are stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans not meas@@ ur@@ ing these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the prog@@ ress of n@@ ations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my a@@ du@@ l@@ t life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental limi@@ ts ."
"And we created , at the organiz@@ ation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ omi@@ c@@ s F@@ oun@@ dation , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of prog@@ ress that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ ti@@ mate out@@ come of a n@@ ation is how successful is it at cre@@ ating happy and heal@@ thy lives for its ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s ."
That should be the go@@ al of every n@@ ation on the planet .
"But we have to remem@@ ber that there &apos;s a fun@@ da@@ mental in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resour@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ ti@@ mate s@@ car@@ ce resour@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And economi@@ c@@ s is very interest@@ ed in s@@ car@@ c@@ ity .
"When it has a s@@ car@@ ce resour@@ ce that it wan@@ ts to turn into a desi@@ ra@@ ble out@@ come , it thin@@ ks in terms of eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y ."
It thin@@ ks in terms of how much ban@@ g do we get for our bu@@ ck .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our plan@@ et@@ ary resour@@ ce use .
It is an eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y measure .
"And probably the e@@ a@@ si@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this graph ."
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ ally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; ec@@ ological f@@ o@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ t , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resour@@ ces we use and how much pres@@ sure we put on the planet ."
M@@ ore is bad .
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ tically up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of n@@ ations ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ j@@ u@@ sted li@@ fe@@ -@@ expec@@ tan@@ cy .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and qu@@ anti@@ ty of life in n@@ ations .
"And the y@@ ell@@ ow do@@ t there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a hu@@ ge ar@@ ray of n@@ ations around that global average ."
"T@@ o the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reas@@ on@@ ably well and produc@@ ing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other We@@ ster@@ n countries going across in those tri@@ ang@@ les and a few G@@ ul@@ f states in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , at the bot@@ tom left of the graph , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well-being — ty@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an A@@ fri@@ ca ."
"In H@@ ob@@ be@@ si@@ an terms , life is sh@@ ort and b@@ ru@@ ti@@ sh there ."
The average life expec@@ tan@@ cy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"M@@ alar@@ ia , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are kil@@ ling a lot of people in these regi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ ell@@ ow tri@@ ang@@ les , that are doing better than global average , that are he@@ ad@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the graph ."
This is an as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional graph .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the ear@@ th ."
They &apos;re L@@ atin American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I ha@@ ven &apos;t been to .
M@@ aybe some of you have .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a — average life expec@@ tan@@ cy is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the la@@ test G@@ al@@ l@@ up world p@@ ol@@ l , the happ@@ i@@ est n@@ ation on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land and Den@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
They are doing that on a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces that are used ty@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; We@@ ster@@ n world — a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their electri@@ c@@ ity comes from ren@@ e@@ w@@ able resour@@ ces .
Th@@ e@@ ir govern@@ ment is one of the first to com@@ mi@@ t to be car@@ b@@ on ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ l by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They ab@@ o@@ li@@ sh@@ ed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they in@@ ve@@ sted in social progra@@ ms — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ acy r@@ ates in L@@ atin America and in the world .
"And they have that L@@ atin vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that pos@@ si@@ bly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be N@@ ort@@ h American , might not be We@@ ster@@ n Europ@@ e@@ an ."
It might be L@@ atin American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pul@@ l the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pul@@ l countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pul@@ l countries from the right of the graph ."
And then we &apos;re star@@ ting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ no@@ ther way of looking at it is looking at time tr@@ ends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the rich@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tr@@ end in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tr@@ end in ec@@ ological f@@ o@@ ot@@ pr@@ in@@ t ."
"And so in stri@@ ct happ@@ y-@@ planet me@@ th@@ od@@ ology , we &apos;ve become less eff@@ ici@@ ent at tur@@ ning our ul@@ ti@@ mate s@@ car@@ ce resour@@ ce into the out@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an ap@@ o@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child en@@ ter@@ ing school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dist@@ ant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment tar@@ get on car@@ b@@ on and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se e@@ mis@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not b@@ usiness as us@@ ual ."
That is chang@@ ing our b@@ usiness .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organiz@@ ations , we do our govern@@ ment poli@@ cy and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on incre@@ as@@ ing well-being ."
No one can go to the p@@ ol@@ ls and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to re@@ duce .
"N@@ one of us , I think , want human prog@@ ress to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of human@@ ity to keep on incre@@ as@@ ing .
And I think this is where cli@@ mate change s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep incre@@ as@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to eng@@ age them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to dra@@ w grap@@ h@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a lea@@ f out of syste@@ ms theory , syste@@ ms engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings are very mo@@ tiv@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a smar@@ t me@@ ter in your home , and you see how much electri@@ c@@ ity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s cos@@ ting you , your kids go around and turn the li@@ ghts off pretty quickly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the radi@@ o news every even@@ ing , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the dol@@ lar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o — I don &apos;t even know which way the dol@@ lar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy B@@ rit@@ a@@ in used ye@@ ster@@ day , or American used ye@@ ster@@ day ?"
D@@ id we me@@ et our three percent ann@@ ual tar@@ get on re@@ duc@@ ing car@@ b@@ on e@@ mis@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a col@@ lec@@ tive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the me@@ dia and start thinking about it .
"And we need positive fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s for incre@@ as@@ ing well-being A@@ t a govern@@ ment level , they might create national ac@@ coun@@ ts of well-being ."
"A@@ t a b@@ usiness level , you might look at the well-being of your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , which we know is really lin@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is lin@@ ked to in@@ nov@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ nov@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es ."
"A@@ t a person@@ al level , we need these n@@ u@@ d@@ ges too ."
"M@@ aybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ ders ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a strong publi@@ c health message on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les a day and how much ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happ@@ i@@ er ?
"We did a pro@@ ject for the G@@ o@@ vern@@ ment O@@ ff@@ ice of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big progra@@ m called the F@@ ore@@ sight progra@@ m — lots and lots of people — inv@@ olved lots of exper@@ ts — everything evidence based — a hu@@ ge to@@ me ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive ac@@ tions can you do to impro@@ ve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the se@@ cre@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will f@@ low out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to conne@@ ct , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of your life ."
"D@@ o you inv@@ est the time with your lo@@ ved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep building them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fa@@ st@@ est way out of a bad mo@@ od : ste@@ p outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the radi@@ o on and d@@ ance ."
B@@ e@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our positive mo@@ od .
The th@@ ir@@ d one is take no@@ tice .
"H@@ ow a@@ w@@ are are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you no@@ tice what &apos;s bub@@ b@@ ling up for you and trying to emer@@ ge ?
"B@@ a@@ sed on a lot of evidence for min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ or@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The f@@ our@@ th is keep learning and keep is important — learning thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cur@@ i@@ ous , they have much better health out@@ comes than those who start to cl@@ ose down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be for@@ mal learning ; it &apos;s not kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge based .
It &apos;s more cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to co@@ ok a new dis@@ h , pic@@ king up an in@@ str@@ ument you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fin@@ al one is that most anti@@ -@@ economic of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tru@@ ism , our compassion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward me@@ chan@@ ism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the mor@@ ning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have g@@ one and sp@@ ent on other people are much happ@@ i@@ er that those that sp@@ ent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these han@@ dy pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the ear@@ th ."
They don &apos;t have any car@@ b@@ on con@@ t@@ ent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ o@@ ds to be sa@@ tis@@ fied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite fe@@ a@@ sible that happiness does not cost the ear@@ th .
"Now , Martin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , on the eve of his de@@ ath , gave an incredible spe@@ e@@ ch ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are challen@@ ges a@@ head , there may be tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the m@@ oun@@ tain top , and I have seen the P@@ ro@@ mi@@ sed L@@ and . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a pre@@ acher , but I believe the environ@@ mental mo@@ vement and , in fact , the b@@ usiness commun@@ ity , govern@@ ment , ne@@ eds to go to the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain top , and it ne@@ eds to look out , and it ne@@ eds to see the P@@ ro@@ mi@@ sed L@@ and , or the land of pro@@ mi@@ se , and it ne@@ eds to have a vision of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a G@@ re@@ at T@@ ran@@ si@@ tion to get there , and we need to pa@@ ve that great tran@@ si@@ tion with good things ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings want to be happy .
P@@ a@@ ve them with the five ways .
And we need to have sign@@ pos@@ ts ga@@ ther@@ ing people together and poin@@ ting them — something like the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the ear@@ th ."

A few months ago the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ am@@ s of astronom@@ ers for a disco@@ very that has been ha@@ i@@ led as one of the most important astron@@ omi@@ cal observ@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ ef@@ ly descri@@ b@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly con@@ tro@@ ver@@ si@@ al f@@ ra@@ me@@ work for expla@@ ining their disco@@ very , na@@ me@@ ly the possibili@@ ty that way be@@ yon@@ d the Earth , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dist@@ ant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a v@@ ast comple@@ x of universes that we call the multi@@ ver@@ se ."
Now the idea of a multi@@ ver@@ se is a strange one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ i@@ sed to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with for@@ e@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was h@@ ol@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ op@@ hi@@ a , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , universe or multi@@ ver@@ se ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But bar@@ r@@ ing such an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , it is strange to imagine other re@@ al@@ ms se@@ par@@ ate from ours , most with fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ gh@@ tly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , spe@@ cula@@ tive though the idea su@@ re@@ ly is , I a@@ im to con@@ v@@ ince you that there &apos;s reason for tak@@ ing it ser@@ i@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multi@@ ver@@ se in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze@@ -@@ w@@ inning results and to high@@ light a pro@@ found my@@ ster@@ y which those results re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll off@@ er a s@@ olution to that my@@ ster@@ y ."
"It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multi@@ ver@@ se will come into the story ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a cos@@ m@@ ological theory called in@@ f@@ lation , which will pul@@ l all the pi@@ ec@@ es of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great astronom@@ er E@@ d@@ win H@@ ub@@ ble re@@ alized that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all r@@ us@@ h@@ ing away from us , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is st@@ ret@@ ching , it &apos;s expan@@ ding ."
Now this was re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary .
The pre@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ ing w@@ is@@ dom was that on the lar@@ g@@ est of scal@@ es the universe was stati@@ c .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expan@@ sion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down ."
"That , much as the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ cent of an app@@ le t@@ os@@ sed up@@ ward , the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pul@@ l of each galax@@ y on every other must be s@@ lo@@ wing the expan@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ am@@ s of astronom@@ ers I men@@ tion@@ ed at the out@@ set were in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this reas@@ on@@ ing to measure the r@@ ate at which the expan@@ sion has been s@@ lo@@ wing .
"And they did this by pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ing observ@@ ations of num@@ er@@ ous dist@@ ant galaxies , allo@@ wing them to char@@ t how the expan@@ sion r@@ ate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surpri@@ se : They found that the expan@@ sion is not s@@ lo@@ wing down .
"In@@ ste@@ ad they found that it &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding up , going fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster ."
That &apos;s like t@@ os@@ sing an app@@ le up@@ ward and it goes up fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster .
"Now if you saw an app@@ le do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s p@@ us@@ h@@ ing on it ?
"S@@ im@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , the astronom@@ ers &apos; results are su@@ re@@ ly well-@@ de@@ ser@@ ving of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , but they ra@@ i@@ sed an anal@@ o@@ g@@ ous question ."
What force is dri@@ ving all galaxies to r@@ ush away from every other at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ quic@@ ken@@ ing spe@@ ed ?
Well the most pro@@ mis@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jects together ."
"But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his gener@@ al theory of rela@@ tivity , gravity can also p@@ ush things ap@@ art ."
"H@@ ow ? Well ac@@ cor@@ ding to Einstein &apos;s ma@@ th , if space is uni@@ form@@ ly fil@@ led with an in@@ vi@@ sible energy , sort of like a uni@@ form , in@@ vi@@ sible mi@@ st , then the gravity gener@@ ated by that mi@@ st would be re@@ pul@@ sive , re@@ pul@@ sive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observ@@ ations ."
"Because the re@@ pul@@ sive gravity of an in@@ vi@@ sible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it sm@@ ok@@ ey wh@@ ite here so you can see it — its re@@ pul@@ sive gravity would cause each galax@@ y to p@@ ush against every other , dri@@ ving expan@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ pres@@ ents great prog@@ ress .
But I pro@@ mi@@ sed you a my@@ ster@@ y here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astronom@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ f@@ using space to ac@@ coun@@ t for the cos@@ mic spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ pres@@ sed in the re@@ lev@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar@@ ly small ."
And the my@@ ster@@ y is to explain this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar number .
"We want this number to emer@@ ge from the la@@ ws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"M@@ aybe expla@@ ining this number is just a techn@@ ical issue , a techn@@ ical deta@@ il of inter@@ est to exper@@ ts , but of no re@@ lev@@ ance to any@@ body else ."
"Well it su@@ re@@ ly is a techn@@ ical deta@@ il , but some deta@@ il@@ s really matter ."
"S@@ ome deta@@ il@@ s pro@@ vi@@ de w@@ in@@ do@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted re@@ al@@ ms of reality , and this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made he@@ ad@@ way to explain it inv@@ ok@@ es the possibili@@ ty of other universes — an idea that nat@@ ur@@ ally emer@@ ges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the my@@ ster@@ y of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three k@@ ey things about string theory .
"F@@ irst off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an approach to re@@ al@@ ize Einstein &apos;s dre@@ am of a uni@@ fied theory of physics , a single o@@ ver@@ ar@@ ching f@@ ra@@ me@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l idea of string theory is quite stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you exam@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find molecu@@ les and then you &apos;ll find atoms and sub@@ at@@ omi@@ c particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be s@@ mal@@ ler , much s@@ mal@@ ler than we can with exist@@ ing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibr@@ ating fi@@ la@@ ment of energy , a little tiny vibr@@ ating string ."
"And just like the str@@ ings on a viol@@ in , they can vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns produc@@ ing different mu@@ sic@@ al n@@ ot@@ es ."
"Th@@ ese little fun@@ da@@ mental str@@ ings , when they vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns , they produce different kinds of particles — so electr@@ ons , qu@@ ark@@ s , ne@@ ut@@ r@@ in@@ os , ph@@ ot@@ ons , all other particles would be un@@ ited into a single f@@ ra@@ me@@ work , as they would all ar@@ ise from vibr@@ ating str@@ ings ."
"It &apos;s a comp@@ elling picture , a kind of cos@@ mic sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y , where all the rich@@ ness that we see in the world around us emer@@ ges from the music that these little , tiny str@@ ings can pla@@ y ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this ele@@ g@@ ant uni@@ fi@@ cation , because years of research have sho@@ wn that the ma@@ th of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ n@@ al in@@ con@@ sist@@ en@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we al@@ low for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ famili@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the us@@ ual three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as he@@ ight , wi@@ d@@ th and de@@ p@@ th ."
"But string theory says that , on f@@ an@@ tas@@ tically small scal@@ es , there are ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions cr@@ um@@ p@@ led to a tiny size so small that we have not de@@ te@@ c@@ ted them ."
"But even though the dimensions are hi@@ d@@ den , they would have an imp@@ act on things that we can ob@@ ser@@ ve because the shape of the extra dimensions con@@ stra@@ ins how the str@@ ings can vibr@@ ate ."
"And in string theory , vi@@ bra@@ tion de@@ ter@@ min@@ es everything ."
"So partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the st@@ ren@@ g@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most import@@ an@@ tly , the amount of dark energy would be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cula@@ te these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cula@@ te the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
A@@ ll we have is a li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es allowed by the ma@@ th .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es , so you can imagine anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ one to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine if any yi@@ el@@ d the physic@@ al fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
But over time the li@@ st gre@@ w as resear@@ ch@@ ers found other can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hund@@ re@@ ds and then the thousands — A lar@@ ge , but still man@@ a@@ ge@@ able , col@@ lec@@ tion to anal@@ y@@ ze , since after all , gra@@ du@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the li@@ st continu@@ ed to grow into the milli@@ ons and the bil@@ li@@ ons , until today ."
The li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es has so@@ ar@@ ed to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some resear@@ ch@@ ers lost heart , con@@ c@@ lu@@ ding that was so many can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving ri@@ se to different physic@@ al fe@@ atures , string theory would never make defin@@ itive , test@@ able predic@@ tions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , tak@@ ing us to the possibili@@ ty of a multi@@ ver@@ se ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
M@@ aybe each of these shap@@ es is on an equal f@@ o@@ ot@@ ing with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this ra@@ dic@@ al pro@@ pos@@ al has a pro@@ found imp@@ act on this my@@ ster@@ y : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze@@ -@@ w@@ inning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physic@@ al fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Wh@@ ich means that the my@@ ster@@ y of expla@@ ining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measu@@ red would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different char@@ ac@@ ter .
"In this con@@ te@@ xt , the la@@ ws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Wh@@ ich means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we human@@ s find our@@ selves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red instead of any of the other possibili@@ ties that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make he@@ ad@@ way .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tries to c@@ lum@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive p@@ ush of the dark energy is so strong that it blo@@ ws the c@@ lum@@ p ap@@ art and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they col@@ l@@ ap@@ se back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to ex@@ ist in those other universes ."
So we find our@@ selves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red simply because our universe has condi@@ tions h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ ster@@ y sol@@ ved , multi@@ ver@@ se found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ itive ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving can and does take on a wi@@ de var@@ i@@ ety of different valu@@ es across the wi@@ der lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular valu@@ e is simply mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d ."
A@@ n early example comes from the great astronom@@ er Jo@@ han@@ n@@ es Kepler who was ob@@ ses@@ sed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 9@@ 3 million mi@@ les away from the Earth .
"And he worked for de@@ ca@@ des trying to explain this number , but he never suc@@ ce@@ eded , and we know why ."
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wi@@ de var@@ i@@ ety of different dist@@ an@@ ces from their h@@ ost stars .
"So hop@@ ing that the la@@ ws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million mi@@ les , well that is simply wr@@ on@@ gh@@ e@@ a@@ ded ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad the right question to ask is , why do we human@@ s find our@@ selves on a planet at this particular dist@@ ance , instead of any of the other possibili@@ ties ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose planets which are much cl@@ os@@ er to a star like the Sun would be so ho@@ t that our form of life wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And those planets that are much far@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so c@@ old that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find our@@ selves on a planet at this particular dist@@ ance simply because it yi@@ el@@ ds condi@@ tions v@@ ital to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their dist@@ an@@ ces , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"One k@@ ey difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only spe@@ cula@@ ted on the possibili@@ ty that there might be other universes ."
"So to pul@@ l it all together , we need a me@@ chan@@ ism that can actually gener@@ ate other universes ."
"And that takes me to my fin@@ al part , part three ."
Because such a me@@ chan@@ ism has been found by cos@@ m@@ ologi@@ sts trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we of@@ ten have an i@@ ma@@ ge of a kind of cos@@ mic expl@@ os@@ i@@ on that created our universe and set space r@@ us@@ h@@ ing ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ d ."
But there &apos;s a little se@@ cre@@ t .
"The Big Bang lea@@ ves out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It t@@ ells us how the universe ev@@ olved after the Bang , but gi@@ ves us no in@@ sight into what would have po@@ wer@@ ed the Bang itself ."
And this ga@@ p was finally fil@@ led by an en@@ han@@ ced ver@@ sion of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary cos@@ m@@ ology , which iden@@ ti@@ fied a particular kind of f@@ u@@ el that would nat@@ ur@@ ally gener@@ ate an ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ d r@@ ush of space ."
"The f@@ u@@ el is based on something called a quantum field , but the only deta@@ il that mat@@ ters for us is that this f@@ u@@ el pro@@ ves to be so eff@@ ici@@ ent that it &apos;s vir@@ tually im@@ possible to use it all up , which means in the in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary theory , the Big Bang giving ri@@ se to our universe is lik@@ ely not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad the f@@ u@@ el not only gener@@ ated our Big Bang , but it would also gener@@ ate coun@@ t@@ less other Big Ban@@ gs , each giving ri@@ se to its own se@@ par@@ ate universe with our universe be@@ coming but one bub@@ ble in a gr@@ and cos@@ mic bub@@ ble b@@ ath of universes ."
"And now , when we me@@ ld this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wi@@ de var@@ i@@ ety of different shap@@ es .
The different shap@@ es yi@@ el@@ d different physic@@ al fe@@ atures .
"And we find our@@ selves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physic@@ al fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the comp@@ elling but high@@ ly con@@ tro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the wi@@ der cos@@ mo@@ s that cut@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ ed@@ ge observ@@ ation and theory have now led us to ser@@ i@@ ously con@@ si@@ der .
"One big re@@ ma@@ ining question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fir@@ m the exist@@ ence of other universes ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary theory already has strong observ@@ ati@@ onal sup@@ port .
"Because the theory predic@@ ts that the Big Bang would have been so in@@ ten@@ se that as space rap@@ id@@ ly expan@@ ded , tiny quantum j@@ it@@ ters from the mi@@ cr@@ o world would have been st@@ ret@@ ched out to the ma@@ cr@@ o world , yi@@ el@@ ding a dist@@ inc@@ tive fin@@ ger@@ pr@@ in@@ t , a patter@@ n of sli@@ gh@@ tly h@@ ot@@ ter sp@@ ots and sli@@ gh@@ tly col@@ der sp@@ ots , across space , which po@@ wer@@ ful te@@ les@@ cop@@ es have now ob@@ ser@@ ved ."
"G@@ o@@ ing f@@ ur@@ ther , if there are other universes , the theory predic@@ ts that every so of@@ ten those universes can col@@ li@@ de ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that col@@ li@@ sion would gener@@ ate an ad@@ di@@ tional sub@@ tle patter@@ n of tem@@ per@@ ature var@@ i@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to de@@ te@@ ct ."
"And so ex@@ o@@ tic as this picture is , it may one day be gr@@ oun@@ ded in observ@@ ations , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing the exist@@ ence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll con@@ c@@ lu@@ de with a stri@@ king imp@@ li@@ cation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not stati@@ c , that space is expan@@ ding , that that expan@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up and that there might be other universes all by car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly exam@@ ining fa@@ in@@ t p@@ in@@ poin@@ ts of star@@ light coming to us from dist@@ ant galaxies ."
"But because the expan@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will r@@ ush away so far and so f@@ ast that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of techn@@ ological limi@@ ta@@ tions , but because of the la@@ ws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies e@@ mi@@ t , even tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing at the fa@@ st@@ est spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to o@@ ver@@ come the e@@ ver@@ -@@ wi@@ den@@ ing g@@ ul@@ f between us ."
"So astronom@@ ers in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an en@@ d@@ less st@@ ret@@ ch of stati@@ c , in@@ k@@ y , black sti@@ l@@ l@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ c@@ lu@@ de that the universe is stati@@ c and un@@ chang@@ ing and popu@@ la@@ ted by a single c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ ha@@ bit — a picture of the cos@@ mo@@ s that we defin@@ i@@ tively know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astronom@@ ers will have rec@@ or@@ ds han@@ ded down from an ear@@ li@@ er er@@ a , like ours , at@@ test@@ ing to an expan@@ ding cos@@ mo@@ s te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future astronom@@ ers believe such an@@ ci@@ ent kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , stati@@ c emp@@ ty universe that their own stat@@ e-@@ o@@ f-@@ the@@ -@@ art observ@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I s@@ us@@ pect the la@@ tter .

A@@ re we in the mid@@ dle of something un@@ us@@ ual hi@@ stor@@ ic@@ ally in your op@@ in@@ i@@ on ?
B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astronom@@ ers of the far future may not have enough information to fig@@ ure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain de@@ ep , cri@@ tical fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our abili@@ ty to understand because of how cos@@ m@@ ology ev@@ ol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spec@@ tive , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to ful@@ ly answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the mi@@ c@@ ro@@ wa@@ ve bac@@ k@@ ground radi@@ ation that was set down 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago — and yet , we can do cal@@ cula@@ tions today to predic@@ t how it will look and it mat@@ ch@@ es ."

"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vir@@ tually un@@ known Ger@@ man ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , na@@ med Th@@ e@@ od@@ or Kaluza su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted a very b@@ old and , in some ways , a very biz@@ ar@@ re idea ."
"That is in ad@@ di@@ tion to left , right , back , fort@@ h and up , down , Kaluza pro@@ posed that there might be ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a b@@ old and biz@@ ar@@ re idea , some@@ times that &apos;s all it is — b@@ old and biz@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , ho@@ w@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll dis@@ c@@ us@@ s experim@@ ents which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ act on physics in the last century and continu@@ es to in@@ form a lot of cut@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ ed@@ ge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
"This is a year when Einstein is bas@@ king in the g@@ low of having disco@@ vered the spe@@ cial theory of rela@@ tivity and deci@@ des to take on a new pro@@ ject , to try to understand ful@@ ly the gr@@ and , per@@ v@@ a@@ sive force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that pro@@ ject had already been res@@ olved ."
"@@ Ne@@ w@@ ton had gi@@ ven the world a theory of gravity in the la@@ te 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0s that works well , descri@@ bes the mo@@ tion of planets , the mo@@ tion of the moon and so fort@@ h , the mo@@ tion of ap@@ o@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ha@@ l of app@@ les f@@ al@@ ling from tre@@ es , h@@ it@@ ting people on the head ."
A@@ ll of that could be descri@@ bed using Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s work .
"But Einstein re@@ alized that Ne@@ w@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even Ne@@ w@@ ton had wr@@ it@@ ten that al@@ though he underst@@ ood how to cal@@ cula@@ te the effec@@ t of gravity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to fig@@ ure out how it really works ."
"H@@ ow is it that the Sun , 9@@ 3 million mi@@ les away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it affec@@ ts the mo@@ tion of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun re@@ ach out across emp@@ ty in@@ er@@ t space and ex@@ er@@ t in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a tas@@ k to which Einstein set h@@ im@@ self — to fig@@ ure out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So Einstein found that the medi@@ um that trans@@ mi@@ ts gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ str@@ ate of all there is .
"E@@ instein said space is ni@@ ce and fla@@ t , if there &apos;s no matter pres@@ ent ."
"But if there is matter in the environ@@ ment , such as the Sun , it ca@@ u@@ ses the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that commun@@ ic@@ ates the force of gravity .
E@@ ven the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is ke@@ pt in or@@ bit , ac@@ cor@@ ding to these ideas , because it rol@@ ls along a val@@ ley in the cur@@ ved environ@@ ment that the Sun and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vir@@ tu@@ e of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a ful@@ l@@ -@@ f@@ ra@@ me view of this .
The Earth itself is ke@@ pt in or@@ bit because it rol@@ ls along a val@@ ley in the environ@@ ment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Sun &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was test@@ ed in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through astron@@ omi@@ cal observ@@ ations ."
It really works . It descri@@ bes the data .
And this ga@@ ined Einstein pro@@ min@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got Kaluza thinking .
"He , like Einstein , was in sear@@ ch of what we call a uni@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of princi@@ p@@ les , one ma@@ ster equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So Kaluza said to h@@ im@@ self , Einstein has been able to descri@@ be gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more pre@@ c@@ ise ."
"You know , the force respon@@ sible for electri@@ c@@ ity and magnetic at@@ tr@@ action and so fort@@ h ."
"So Kaluza says , maybe I can pla@@ y the same game and descri@@ be elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ i@@ sed a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ instein had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So Kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scienti@@ sts had long known to descri@@ be the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force ."
A@@ maz@@ ing — it just pop@@ ped out .
"He was so exc@@ ited by this re@@ alization that he ran around his h@@ ou@@ se scre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; V@@ ic@@ t@@ ory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the uni@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , Kaluza was a man who took theory very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ w@@ im , he read a book , a tre@@ ati@@ se on s@@ w@@ im@@ ming — ( Laughter ) — then do@@ ve into the o@@ ce@@ an ."
This is a man who would ri@@ s@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more pr@@ ac@@ tically min@@ ded , two questions im@@ medi@@ ately ar@@ ise from his observ@@ ation ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in deta@@ il , when you try to app@@ ly it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a f@@ ell@@ ow na@@ med O@@ sk@@ ar K@@ le@@ in ."
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a c@@ able sup@@ port@@ ing a tra@@ ff@@ ic light ."
"It &apos;s in M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan . You &apos;re in C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l P@@ ark — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant — but the c@@ able looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal from a dist@@ ant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we z@@ o@@ om in and take the per@@ spec@@ tive of , say , a little ant walking around — little an@@ ts are so small that they can ac@@ cess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise , coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise direc@@ tion ."
And I hop@@ e you app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these an@@ ts to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this il@@ lu@@ str@@ ates the fact that dimensions can be of two sor@@ ts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can e@@ as@@ ily see , but there might be ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the cir@@ cu@@ lar part of that c@@ able , so small that they have so far re@@ ma@@ ined in@@ vi@@ sible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"S@@ ome of you g@@ uy@@ s will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not fla@@ t on a scre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes s@@ mal@@ ler , s@@ mal@@ ler , s@@ mal@@ ler , and way down in the mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic de@@ p@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ di@@ tional cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shape of a circ@@ le — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ tra mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic ant walking around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the g@@ ri@@ d part — but you could also ac@@ cess the tiny cur@@ le@@ d@@ -@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the n@@ ak@@ ed eye or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equ@@ ip@@ ment ."
"But de@@ ep@@ ly tu@@ c@@ ked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to app@@ ly it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to ref@@ ine this f@@ ra@@ me@@ work and app@@ ly it to the physics of the universe as was underst@@ ood at the time , and , in deta@@ il , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In deta@@ il , for in@@ stance , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t get the mas@@ s of the electr@@ on to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , cer@@ tain@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this strange but very comp@@ elling idea of how to un@@ if@@ y the la@@ ws of physics had g@@ one away ."
Un@@ til something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our er@@ a , a new approach to un@@ if@@ y the la@@ ws of physics is being pur@@ su@@ ed by phy@@ si@@ ci@@ sts such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ string theory , as you were in@@ dic@@ ating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ string theory , we find that it res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ts the idea in a s@@ par@@ k@@ ling , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Su@@ per@@ string theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basi@@ c , fun@@ da@@ mental , in@@ divi@@ sible , un@@ cut@@ t@@ able con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a famili@@ ar ob@@ ject , just a can@@ dle in a h@@ ol@@ der , and imagine that we want to fig@@ ure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y de@@ ep inside the ob@@ ject and exam@@ ine the con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go suff@@ ici@@ ently far down , you have atoms ."
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
They have little electr@@ ons that s@@ war@@ m around a c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with ne@@ ut@@ r@@ ons and prot@@ ons .
E@@ ven the ne@@ ut@@ r@@ ons and prot@@ ons have s@@ mal@@ ler particles inside of them known as qu@@ ark@@ s .
That is where con@@ ven@@ tional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this dan@@ c@@ ing fi@@ la@@ ment of energy .
"It looks like a vibr@@ ating string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibr@@ ating str@@ ings that you just saw in a c@@ ell@@ o can vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns , these can also vibr@@ ate in different patter@@ ns ."
They don &apos;t produce different mu@@ sic@@ al n@@ ot@@ es .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , they produce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ rec@@ t , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a hu@@ ge number of these little tiny fi@@ la@@ ments of vibr@@ ating energy , vibr@@ ating in different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es produce the different particles .
The different particles are respon@@ sible for all the rich@@ ness in the world around us .
"And there you see uni@@ fi@@ cation , because matter particles , electr@@ ons and qu@@ ark@@ s , radi@@ ation particles , ph@@ ot@@ ons , gra@@ v@@ it@@ ons , are all built up from one enti@@ ty ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the ru@@ bri@@ c of vibr@@ ating str@@ ings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a uni@@ fied theory .
Now here is the cat@@ ch .
"When you study the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , n@@ or five , n@@ or six ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It lea@@ ds us right back to this idea of Kaluza and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when appro@@ pri@@ ately descri@@ bed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ led up , ye@@ ah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion of gre@@ en people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them ei@@ ther . That is true ."
"One of the other predic@@ tions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ i@@ ses the question : are we just trying to hi@@ de away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ ma@@ ining time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ irst is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ ep@@ est question in the@@ ore@@ tical physics , the@@ ore@@ tical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scienti@@ sts have done for the last hundred years , there appe@@ ar to be about 20 numbers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"Th@@ ese are numbers like the mas@@ s of the particles , like electr@@ ons and qu@@ ark@@ s , the st@@ ren@@ g@@ th of gravity , the st@@ ren@@ g@@ th of the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force — a li@@ st of about 20 numbers that have been measu@@ red with incredible pre@@ ci@@ sion , but no@@ body has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the numbers have the particular valu@@ es that they do ."
"Now , does string theory off@@ er an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the valu@@ es they do may re@@ ly on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other valu@@ es than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those numbers so fin@@ ely t@@ un@@ ed to al@@ low stars to sh@@ ine and planets to form , when we recogn@@ ize that if you fi@@ d@@ dle with those numbers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and fi@@ d@@ dle with those numbers , almost any fi@@ d@@ d@@ ling makes the universe dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the ol@@ der ideas of Kaluza and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , inter@@ tw@@ ined ge@@ ome@@ try ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ ala@@ bi@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shape — na@@ me isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions f@@ old in on themselves and inter@@ tw@@ ine in a very interesting shape , interesting struc@@ ture ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e of our universe all around us would look like this on the tin@@ i@@ est of scal@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be mo@@ ving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physic@@ al imp@@ li@@ cation , though , re@@ lev@@ ant to those 20 numbers ?"
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der this . I@@ f you look at the in@@ str@@ ument , a F@@ ren@@ ch hor@@ n , no@@ tice that the vi@@ bra@@ tions of the a@@ ir@@ stre@@ am@@ s are affec@@ ted by the shape of the in@@ str@@ ument ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are ref@@ lec@@ tions of the way str@@ ings can vibr@@ ate ."
"So just as those a@@ ir@@ stre@@ am@@ s are affec@@ ted by the tw@@ ist@@ s and turns in the in@@ str@@ ument , str@@ ings themselves will be affec@@ ted by the vi@@ bra@@ tional patter@@ ns in the ge@@ ome@@ try within which they are mo@@ ving ."
So let me bring some str@@ ings into the story .
"And if you watch these little fel@@ lo@@ ws vibr@@ ating around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , no@@ tice that they way they vibr@@ ate is affec@@ ted by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cula@@ te the allowed n@@ ot@@ es , the allowed vi@@ bra@@ tional patter@@ ns ."
"And if we could cal@@ cula@@ te the allowed vi@@ bra@@ tional patter@@ ns , we should be able to cal@@ cula@@ te those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ cula@@ tions ag@@ re@@ es with the valu@@ es of those numbers that have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed through deta@@ i@@ led and pre@@ c@@ ise experim@@ en@@ tation , this in many ways would be the first fun@@ da@@ mental ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the struc@@ ture of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more direc@@ tly ?"
"It &apos;s a machine that will sen@@ d particles around a t@@ un@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so of@@ ten those particles will be a@@ i@@ med at each other , so there &apos;s a he@@ ad@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion ."
"The hop@@ e is that if the col@@ li@@ sion has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the de@@ br@@ is from the col@@ li@@ sion from our dimensions , for@@ c@@ ing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the col@@ li@@ sion , comp@@ are it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the col@@ li@@ sion than before , this will be evidence that the energy has dri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it dri@@ f@@ ts away in the right patter@@ n that we can cal@@ cula@@ te , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea v@@ is@@ u@@ ally .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a gra@@ v@@ it@@ on — that &apos;s the kind of de@@ br@@ is we ex@@ pect to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You s@@ la@@ m them together .
"You s@@ la@@ m them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that col@@ li@@ sion will go into de@@ br@@ is that f@@ lies off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ars f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ jec@@ ted by no@@ tic@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we beg@@ an , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"E@@ instein comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ maz@@ ing possibili@@ ty .
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the r@@ ate of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , that your children seem to change by the min@@ ute but your par@@ ents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the na@@ me of this ma@@ gi@@ cal point in life where change su@@ d@@ den@@ ly goes from a gal@@ lo@@ p to a cra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ en@@ age years ? I@@ s it mid@@ dle age ?
D@@ o@@ es any of this matter ?
They need to be part of the p@@ ac@@ k .
"I still remem@@ ber the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use di@@ git@@ al technology , as I &apos;ve done dur@@ ing my first five TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ ks ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I have prog@@ res@@ sed , and I am , today , la@@ un@@ ching a brand new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x con@@ ta@@ ins one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people ."
"In the develop@@ ing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they li@@ ved away then .
There was a big ga@@ p between the one billion in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world and the two billion in the develop@@ ing world .
"In the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world , people were heal@@ thy , e@@ duc@@ ated , rich , and they had small famili@@ es ."
And their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion was to buy a c@@ ar .
"And in 19@@ 60 , all S@@ w@@ ede@@ s were sa@@ ving to try to buy a V@@ ol@@ v@@ o like this ."
This was the economic level at which S@@ we@@ den was .
"But in con@@ tr@@ ast to this , in the develop@@ ing world , far away , the as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion of the average family there was to have f@@ ood for the day ."
They were sa@@ ving to be able to buy a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ga@@ p in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this ga@@ p between the W@@ est and the rest has created a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the Dev@@ el@@ op@@ ing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s o@@ ver@@ du@@ e to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ omy of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ b@@ led since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of comp@@ an@@ ies have happened to grow the econ@@ omy , so the We@@ ster@@ n population mo@@ ved over to here ."
And now their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion is not only to have a c@@ ar .
Now they want to have a ho@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ m@@ ote dest@@ in@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the develop@@ ing countries , they have mo@@ ved on , you know , and they have become emer@@ ging economi@@ es , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ ying c@@ ars .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ in@@ ese comp@@ any , Ge@@ ely , they ac@@ qui@@ red the V@@ ol@@ v@@ o comp@@ any , and then finally the S@@ w@@ ede@@ s underst@@ ood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tra@@ ge@@ dy is that the two billion over here that is str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling for f@@ ood and sho@@ es , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the bi@@ ggest p@@ ile of bil@@ li@@ ons , the three bil@@ li@@ ons here , which are also be@@ coming emer@@ ging economi@@ es , because they are quite heal@@ thy , rela@@ tively well-@@ e@@ duc@@ ated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; rich@@ er also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion now is , of course , to buy a bi@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le , and then later on they would like to have a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any ga@@ p ."
"But the dist@@ ance from the poor@@ est here , the very poor@@ est , to the very rich@@ est over here is wi@@ der than ever ."
"But there is a continu@@ ous world from walking , bi@@ king , dri@@ ving , fl@@ ying — there are people on all lev@@ els , and most people t@@ end to be some@@ where in the mid@@ dle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to pro@@ ject into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ hang@@ ha@@ i rec@@ ently , and I list@@ en@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will cat@@ ch up , just as Japan did ."
A@@ ll the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start fl@@ ying .
"And these lo@@ wer or mid@@ dle income countries , the emer@@ ging income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards economi@@ c@@ ally ."
"And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can av@@ o@@ id sever@@ e cli@@ mate change , and energy can still be rela@@ tively che@@ ap — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electri@@ c c@@ ars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poor@@ est two billion ?
What about the poor@@ est two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; am@@ ong emer@@ ging economi@@ es &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ ide@@ ly used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"H@@ ere &#91; am@@ ong the poor@@ est &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; poor@@ est &#93; two billion will , in the next de@@ ca@@ des , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a n@@ uc@@ lear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poor@@ est &#93; get out of po@@ ver@@ ty , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child survi@@ val , they can buy a bi@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le and a cell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for f@@ ood and sho@@ es because then we get continu@@ ed population growth .
And let me show you why by con@@ ver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d@@ -@@ time di@@ git@@ al technology .
Here I have on the scre@@ en my country bub@@ b@@ les .
E@@ very bub@@ ble is a country . The size is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ ell@@ ow on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark b@@ lu@@ e is A@@ fri@@ ca ; bro@@ wn is Europ@@ e ; gre@@ en is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast and this light b@@ lu@@ e is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ a .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
"H@@ ere I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big famili@@ es , small famili@@ es ."
The year is 19@@ 60 .
"And down here , child survi@@ val , the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of children survi@@ ving chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od up to star@@ ting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 9@@ 0 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and heal@@ th@@ i@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion We@@ ster@@ n world here — high chil@@ d@@ -@@ survi@@ val , small famili@@ es — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develop@@ ing countries , with very lar@@ ge famili@@ es and poor child survi@@ val ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years pas@@ s by , child survi@@ val is incre@@ as@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ ap , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , v@@ ac@@ cin@@ ation , pen@@ ic@@ il@@ l@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ am@@ ily size is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0@@ -@@ percent child survi@@ val , then famili@@ es de@@ cre@@ ase , and most of the Ara@@ b countries in the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast is f@@ al@@ ling down there &#91; to small famili@@ es &#93; ."
"L@@ o@@ ok , B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh cat@@ ching up with India ."
"The whole emer@@ ging world jo@@ ins the We@@ ster@@ n world with good child survi@@ val and small family size , but we still have the poor@@ est billion ."
"C@@ an you see the poor@@ est billion , those &#91; two &#93; box@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survi@@ val of only 70 to 80 percent , me@@ an@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at le@@ ast four who survi@@ ve to the next generation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continu@@ e to impro@@ ve child survi@@ val to 9@@ 0 percent .
"That &apos;s why in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ dation , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and a@@ id organiz@@ ations , together with national govern@@ ment in the poor@@ est countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to re@@ ach a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able population size of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
Ch@@ il@@ d survi@@ val is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child survi@@ val that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , ne@@ i@@ ther am I a p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ st ."
"I &apos;m a very ser@@ i@@ ous &quot; &quot; possibili@@ st . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new cat@@ eg@@ ory where we take e@@ mo@@ tion ap@@ art , and we just work anal@@ y@@ tically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"W@@ it@@ h gre@@ en technology and with in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old W@@ est .
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber when this b@@ lu@@ e bo@@ x was all alone , le@@ ad@@ ing the world , li@@ ving its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The r@@ ole of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ oun@@ dation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important r@@ ole .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

S@@ up@@ pose that two American friends are tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing together in I@@ tal@@ y .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him B@@ ill — is trans@@ fi@@ x@@ ed by em@@ bar@@ ras@@ s@@ ment , at star@@ ing at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two g@@ uy@@ s was more lik@@ ely to have v@@ ot@@ ed for Ge@@ orge B@@ ush , which for A@@ l G@@ ore ?"
"And in this case , the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a ma@@ j@@ or person@@ ality tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"P@@ eople low on it like things that are famili@@ ar , that are sa@@ fe and de@@ pen@@ da@@ ble ."
"On@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at Ap@@ ple@@ be@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about poli@@ tics .
This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about the kinds of groups people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the We@@ b .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to ra@@ ise your hand , whether you are liber@@ al , left of center — on social is@@ su@@ es , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ mar@@ ily — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a th@@ ir@@ d op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of liber@@ tar@@ i@@ ans in the au@@ dience ."
P@@ lease ra@@ ise your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ lease ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re liber@@ tar@@ i@@ an .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And ple@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to se@@ ek a de@@ ep@@ er understanding of the world , our gener@@ al la@@ ck of moral di@@ ver@@ si@@ ty here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share valu@@ es , when people all share mor@@ als , they become a te@@ am , and once you eng@@ age the psych@@ ology of te@@ am@@ s , it sh@@ ut@@ s down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the liber@@ al te@@ am l@@ os@@ es , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t our@@ selves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other te@@ am .
"We think they must be b@@ lin@@ ded by religi@@ on , or by simple stu@@ pi@@ di@@ ty ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ ot@@ es R@@ ep@@ ubli@@ can because they are b@@ lin@@ ded in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed in a moral ma@@ tri@@ x , in a particular moral ma@@ tri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pic@@ ked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psych@@ ology and see where it takes us .
What is mor@@ ality and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psych@@ ology is the idea that the mind is a b@@ lan@@ k s@@ la@@ te at bir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ iti@@ al organiz@@ ation of the brain does not de@@ p@@ end that much on experience ."
It gi@@ ves us very strong feel@@ ings about those who cause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ oun@@ dation under@@ lies about 70 percent of the moral stat@@ e@@ ments I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The th@@ ir@@ d f@@ oun@@ dation is in@@ -@@ group / lo@@ yal@@ ty .
You do find groups in the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom — you do find co@@ oper@@ ative groups — but these groups are always ei@@ ther very small or they &apos;re all si@@ b@@ l@@ ings .
"It &apos;s only am@@ ong human@@ s that you find very lar@@ ge groups of people who are able to co@@ oper@@ ate , jo@@ in together into groups , but in this case , groups that are un@@ ited to fi@@ ght other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of trib@@ al li@@ ving , of trib@@ al psych@@ ology ."
( Laughter ) S@@ por@@ ts is to war as por@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y is to sex .
"We get to ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent dri@@ ves ."
The f@@ our@@ th f@@ oun@@ dation is au@@ th@@ ority / res@@ pect .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive ge@@ stu@@ res from two mem@@ bers of very cl@@ os@@ ely rela@@ ted speci@@ es .
"It &apos;s based on more v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y de@@ fer@@ ence , and even ele@@ ments of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ oun@@ dation is pur@@ ity / san@@ c@@ ti@@ ty .
"This pain@@ ting is called &quot; &quot; The Al@@ le@@ g@@ ory O@@ f Ch@@ as@@ ti@@ ty , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about sup@@ pres@@ sing fe@@ mal@@ e se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"H@@ ere are the results from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ s ."
"They give high en@@ d@@ or@@ se@@ ment of these sor@@ ts of stat@@ e@@ ments all across the bo@@ ar@@ d , but as you also see , liber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the line s@@ l@@ op@@ es down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just f@@ li@@ p through a few other sli@@ des .
"@@ No@@ tice also that on all of these grap@@ h@@ s , the s@@ l@@ op@@ e is ste@@ ep@@ er on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ ority , pur@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ich sho@@ ws that within any country , the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fa@@ ir@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first pan@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll is or@@ der@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and an@@ im@@ als are doing what they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be doing , where they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be ."
"But then , gi@@ ven the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing wh@@ at@@ ever he wan@@ ts , with every ap@@ er@@ ture of every other person and every other ani@@ mal ."
S@@ ome of you might recogn@@ ize this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably gi@@ ves way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the cut@@ t@@ ings of the ap@@ er@@ tures h@@ ur@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three pan@@ els port@@ ray the ti@@ me@@ less tr@@ ut@@ h that order ten@@ ds to de@@ ca@@ y ."
The tr@@ ut@@ h of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first r@@ ound , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people ar@@ en &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a suc@@ k@@ er . I &apos;m not going to co@@ oper@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so co@@ oper@@ ation quickly de@@ c@@ ays from reas@@ on@@ ably good , down to cl@@ ose to zer@@ o ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tri@@ ck — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ ach@@ ter said , on the sev@@ en@@ th r@@ ound , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New ru@@ le ."
Because I think that the great@@ est won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of ro@@ ck , and then a lot of water and w@@ ind , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that comp@@ lic@@ ated .
"This is an ab@@ sol@@ ute mir@@ ac@@ le , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement between liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an religi@@ ons have at@@ ta@@ ined .
Th@@ ink about yin and yan@@ g .
You find the same thing in Hin@@ du@@ ism .
There are many high go@@ ds in Hin@@ du@@ ism .
"T@@ w@@ o of them are V@@ ish@@ n@@ u , the pres@@ er@@ ver , and S@@ hi@@ v@@ a , the dest@@ ro@@ yer ."
This i@@ ma@@ ge actually is both of those go@@ ds sh@@ ar@@ ing the same body .
"You have the mark@@ ings of V@@ ish@@ n@@ u on the left , so we could think of V@@ ish@@ n@@ u as the con@@ serv@@ ative go@@ d ."
"You have the mark@@ ings of S@@ hi@@ v@@ a on the right , S@@ hi@@ v@@ a &apos;s the liber@@ al go@@ d . And they work together ."
"Th@@ ese two stan@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ ep@@ est in@@ si@@ ghts that have ever been at@@ ta@@ ined into moral psych@@ ology ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en ma@@ ster S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; I@@ f you want the tr@@ ut@@ h to st@@ and c@@ lear before you , never be for or against ."
"The str@@ u@@ g@@ gle between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s a disease that has been ca@@ u@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lea@@ ders ."
"But before you feel super@@ i@@ or to Ge@@ orge B@@ ush , before you th@@ row a st@@ one , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ p@@ ping out of the b@@ at@@ tle of good and ev@@ il ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I telling you to not stri@@ ve ?
"A@@ m I telling you to em@@ br@@ ace S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this str@@ u@@ g@@ gle of for and against ?"
"@@ No , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from Sa@@ man@@ th@@ a P@@ o@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gi@@ o V@@ i@@ e@@ ir@@ a de M@@ ell@@ o , you can &apos;t just go char@@ ging in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that re@@ qu@@ ire us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous moral au@@ th@@ ority of the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ ama — and it comes from his moral hu@@ mili@@ ty .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is pas@@ sion@@ ately eng@@ ag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
P@@ eople here are pas@@ sion@@ ately eng@@ ag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to the tr@@ ut@@ h .
And so I think that the answer is to use that pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment to the tr@@ ut@@ h to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything uni@@ qu@@ e about human be@@ ings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with ful@@ ly developed moral senti@@ ments .
We &apos;re ob@@ ses@@ sed with mor@@ ality as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I person@@ ally am ob@@ ses@@ sed with mor@@ ality .
"It was all du@@ e to this woman , S@@ ister M@@ ary Mar@@ ast@@ el@@ a , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an alt@@ ar bo@@ y , I bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed in a lot of inc@@ en@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ ra@@ ses in L@@ atin , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top@@ -@@ down mor@@ ality app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religi@@ ous and n@@ on@@ -@@ religi@@ ous were equ@@ ally ob@@ ses@@ sed with mor@@ ality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly bas@@ is for moral deci@@ sions ."
But I wanted to go f@@ ur@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a che@@ mi@@ str@@ y of mor@@ ality . I want to know
if there was a moral molecu@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experim@@ ents , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I br@@ ought some with me .
This little sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge con@@ ta@@ ins the moral molecu@@ le .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent molecu@@ le found only in mam@@ mal@@ s .
"In ro@@ dents , it was known to make mothers care for their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , and in some cre@@ atures , allowed for tol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ mat@@ es ."
"But in human@@ s , it was only known to fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ate bir@@ th and bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ e@@ ding in women , and is re@@ lea@@ sed by both se@@ x@@ es dur@@ ing sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecu@@ le .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colle@@ agu@@ es .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ au@@ l , that is the world &apos;s stu@@ pi@@ di@@ st idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a fe@@ mal@@ e molecu@@ le ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I coun@@ ter@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stu@@ p@@ id idea ."
But it was test@@ ably stu@@ p@@ id .
"In other words , I thought I could desi@@ gn an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ ur@@ ns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ irst of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y molecu@@ le ."
"B@@ a@@ sel@@ ine lev@@ els are ne@@ ar zer@@ o , without some sti@@ mul@@ us to cause its re@@ lease ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ min@@ ute hal@@ f-@@ life , and de@@ gra@@ des rap@@ id@@ ly at room tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it f@@ ast and keep it c@@ old ."
I think I can do that .
"Now lu@@ ck@@ ily , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the blo@@ od , so I could do this experiment without learning neur@@ os@@ ur@@ ger@@ y ."
Th@@ en I had to measure mor@@ ality .
So tak@@ ing on M@@ or@@ ality with a cap@@ ital M is a hu@@ ge pro@@ ject .
So I started s@@ mal@@ ler .
I studi@@ ed one single vir@@ tu@@ e : tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 200@@ 0s that countries with a high@@ er pro@@ por@@ tion of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy people are more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic trans@@ ac@@ tions oc@@ cu@@ r and more we@@ al@@ th is created , al@@ le@@ vi@@ ating po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So poor countries are by and lar@@ ge low trust countries .
"So if I underst@@ ood the che@@ mi@@ str@@ y of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty ."
But I &apos;m also a s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ agu@@ ire approach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so vir@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we tem@@ pt people with vir@@ tu@@ e and vice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ struc@@ tion , and we never ever de@@ ce@@ i@@ ve them ."
Th@@ en we mat@@ ch them in pa@@ ir@@ s by computer .
"And in that pa@@ ir , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tri@@ ck is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now wh@@ at@@ ever you give up gets tri@@ p@@ led in the other person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er .
And they get a message by computer saying person one s@@ ent you this amount of money .
"D@@ o you want to keep it all , or do you want to sen@@ d some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for min@@ ute .
You &apos;re going to si@@ t on these hard c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome ma@@ d scienti@@ st is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a ne@@ ed@@ le and take four tu@@ bes of blo@@ od .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a str@@ ang@@ er ?
So this was the bir@@ th of v@@ am@@ p@@ ire economi@@ c@@ s .
M@@ ak@@ e a deci@@ sion and give me some blo@@ od .
"So in fact , experim@@ ent@@ al economi@@ sts had r@@ un this test around the world , and for much high@@ er st@@ ak@@ es , and the con@@ sen@@ su@@ s view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the trans@@ f@@ er from the second person back to the first measu@@ red tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , economi@@ sts were f@@ lum@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ su@@ med money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 9@@ 0 percent of the first deci@@ sion@@ -@@ mak@@ ers s@@ ent money , and of those who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ turned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by meas@@ ur@@ ing oxytocin we found that the more money the second person re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ar@@ d , the more money they re@@ turned ."
So we have a bi@@ ology of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wa@@ it . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ w@@ o things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in is@@ ola@@ tion .
"So we measu@@ red n@@ ine other molecu@@ les that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effec@@ t ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ direc@@ t relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin ca@@ used tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ ip@@ ula@@ te oxytocin direc@@ tly ."
I used everything sh@@ ort of a dr@@ ill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a n@@ as@@ al in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ agu@@ es in Z@@ ur@@ ich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or pla@@ ce@@ b@@ o , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who s@@ ent all their money to a str@@ ang@@ er — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or cogn@@ ition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust molecu@@ le , but is it the moral molecu@@ le ?"
"@@ U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we ran more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin in@@ f@@ u@@ sion incre@@ a@@ ses gener@@ os@@ ity in un@@ ila@@ ter@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ f@@ ers by 80 percent .
We showed it incre@@ a@@ ses don@@ ations to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated n@@ on@@ -@@ p@@ har@@ ma@@ c@@ ologi@@ c ways to ra@@ ise oxytocin .
"Th@@ ese inc@@ lu@@ de mas@@ sage , dan@@ c@@ ing and pr@@ ay@@ ing ."
"Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise oxytocin , people w@@ il@@ lin@@ g@@ ly op@@ en up their wal@@ le@@ ts and share money with stran@@ ger@@ s ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is flo@@ o@@ ded with oxytocin ?
"T@@ o inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a vide@@ o of a father and his four ye@@ ar-@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain can@@ cer ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they wat@@ ched the vide@@ o , we had them r@@ ate their feel@@ ings and took blo@@ od before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of em@@ pa@@ thy .
So it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us conne@@ ct to other people .
It &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her na@@ med A@@ da@@ m S@@ mi@@ th wr@@ ote a book in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The Th@@ e@@ ory of M@@ or@@ al S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; In this book , S@@ mi@@ th ar@@ gu@@ ed that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a top@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the e@@ mo@@ tions of others ."
"So if I do something that h@@ ur@@ ts you , I feel that pa@@ in ."
So I t@@ end to av@@ o@@ id that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your jo@@ y ."
So I t@@ end to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ da@@ m S@@ mi@@ th who , 1@@ 7 years later , would wr@@ ite a little book called &quot; &quot; The We@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ oun@@ ding doc@@ ument of economi@@ c@@ s ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the molecu@@ le be@@ h@@ ind it .
"But kno@@ wing that molecu@@ le is valu@@ able , because it t@@ ells us how to turn up this behavi@@ or and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it t@@ ells us why we see im@@ mor@@ ality ."
"So to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate im@@ mor@@ ality , let me bring you back now to 19@@ 80 ."
"I &apos;m working at a g@@ as st@@ ation on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of San@@ ta B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
"You si@@ t in a g@@ as st@@ ation all day , you see lots of mor@@ ality and im@@ mor@@ ality , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ un@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my c@@ as@@ hi@@ er &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful je@@ wel@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ pen@@ s it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ arl ne@@ ck@@ la@@ ce inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very valu@@ able .
"We have to find the ow@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ a . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to deci@@ de what to do with this , and the ph@@ one r@@ ings ."
"And a man says very exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly , &quot; &quot; I was in your g@@ as st@@ ation a while ago , and I b@@ ought this je@@ wel@@ ry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l ne@@ ck@@ la@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re sa@@ ving my life . Here &apos;s my ph@@ one number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wa@@ it half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , rela@@ x ."
"G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ en@@ a in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ ga@@ in he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so ni@@ ce , let &apos;s sp@@ lit the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the je@@ wel@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a clas@@ sic c@@ on called the pi@@ ge@@ on drop , and I was the pi@@ ge@@ on ."
"So the way many con@@ s work is not that the con@@ man gets the vic@@ tim to trust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tru@@ sts the vic@@ tim ."
Now we know what happens .
"The vic@@ tim &apos;s brain re@@ lea@@ ses oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing up your wal@@ let or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ ip@@ ula@@ te our oxytocin syste@@ ms ?
"We found , test@@ ing thousands of in@@ dividu@@ als , that five percent of the population don &apos;t re@@ lease oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
"So if you trust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t re@@ lease oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the t@@ able , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a techn@@ ical word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them ba@@ star@@ ds .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the at@@ trib@@ utes of psych@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted .
One is through impro@@ per n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing .
"So we &apos;ve studi@@ ed se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t re@@ lease oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
You need enough n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing for this system to devel@@ o@@ p pro@@ per@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high st@@ ress in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ts oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really st@@ res@@ sed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted , which is interesting — through the action of test@@ os@@ ter@@ one ."
"So we , in experim@@ ents , have ad@@ min@@ ister@@ ed test@@ os@@ ter@@ one to men ."
"And instead of sh@@ ar@@ ing money , they become sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"But interest@@ ing@@ ly , high test@@ os@@ ter@@ one mal@@ es are also more lik@@ ely to use their own money to p@@ un@@ ish others for being sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bi@@ ology , we have the yin and yan@@ g of mor@@ ality ."
"We have oxytocin that connec@@ ts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have test@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the test@@ os@@ ter@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have test@@ os@@ ter@@ one that makes us want to p@@ un@@ ish people who be@@ have im@@ mor@@ ally ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or govern@@ ment telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful labor@@ at@@ ory experim@@ ents , do they really app@@ ly to real life ?"
"Y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;ve been wor@@ r@@ ying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve g@@ one out of the la@@ b to see if this really h@@ ol@@ ds in our da@@ ily lives .
"So last sum@@ m@@ er , I at@@ ten@@ ded a we@@ d@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Eng@@ land ."
200 people in this beautiful V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I dro@@ ve up in my ren@@ ted V@@ au@@ x@@ h@@ all .
And I took out a cen@@ tri@@ f@@ u@@ ge and d@@ ry ice and ne@@ ed@@ les and tu@@ bes .
And I took blo@@ od from the bri@@ de and the gro@@ om and the we@@ d@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the friends before and im@@ medi@@ ately after the v@@ o@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And gu@@ ess what ?
"W@@ ed@@ din@@ gs cause a re@@ lease of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the center of the we@@ d@@ ding solar system ?
The bri@@ de .
She had the bi@@ ggest increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lo@@ ves the we@@ d@@ ding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
"Her mother , that &apos;s right ."
Her mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends — ar@@ r@@ ay@@ ed around the bri@@ de like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it t@@ ells us that we &apos;ve design@@ ed this rit@@ ual to conne@@ ct us to this new couple , conne@@ ct us e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ pet@@ u@@ ate the speci@@ es .
I also wor@@ ri@@ ed that my trust experim@@ ents with small amoun@@ ts of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how of@@ ten we actually trust our lives to stran@@ ger@@ s .
"So even though I have a fear of he@@ i@@ ghts , I rec@@ ently str@@ app@@ ed myself to another human being and ste@@ p@@ ped out of an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my blo@@ od before and after , and I had a hu@@ ge sp@@ ik@@ e of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can conne@@ ct to people .
"For example , through social me@@ dia ."
M@@ any people are T@@ we@@ eting right now .
So we inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated the r@@ ole of social me@@ dia and found the using social me@@ dia produc@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I ran this experiment rec@@ ently for the K@@ ore@@ an B@@ ro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st@@ ing S@@ y@@ stem .
And they had the re@@ por@@ ters and their produc@@ ers parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
"And one of these g@@ uy@@ s , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 150 percent sp@@ ik@@ e in oxytocin ."
"I mean , ast@@ oun@@ ding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social me@@ dia in pri@@ v@@ ate .
"When I wr@@ ote my re@@ port to the K@@ ore@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my gu@@ ess was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They ch@@ ec@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s Facebook p@@ age .
There you go . That &apos;s connec@@ tion .
"So there &apos;s t@@ ons of ways that we can conne@@ ct to other people , and it seems to be univer@@ sal ."
"T@@ w@@ o weeks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New G@@ u@@ ine@@ a where I went up to the high@@ lan@@ ds — very is@@ ola@@ ted tri@@ bes of sub@@ sist@@ ence far@@ mer@@ s li@@ ving as they have li@@ ved for mil@@ len@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different langu@@ ag@@ es in the high@@ lan@@ ds .
These are the most pri@@ mi@@ tive people in the world .
And they inde@@ ed also re@@ lease oxytocin .
So oxytocin connec@@ ts us to other people .
O@@ xy@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to re@@ lease oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fav@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the e@@ a@@ si@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . G@@ i@@ ve me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my pen@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ gg@@ ing other people has ear@@ ned me the n@@ ic@@ k@@ na@@ me D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who re@@ lease more oxytocin are happ@@ i@@ er .
And they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all ty@@ p@@ es .
D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove says eight hu@@ gs a day .
E@@ ight hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be happ@@ i@@ er and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to tou@@ ch people , I can always sho@@ ve this up your n@@ ose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to sum@@ m@@ er ca@@ m@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ h@@ ol .
And I just wa@@ ited for the time that I could go off and read my bo@@ ok@@ s .
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ h@@ yn@@ ess is about fear of social j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
"We s@@ at in ro@@ ws of des@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty a@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ ously ."
"So , quite under@@ stan@@ da@@ bly , qu@@ ali@@ ties like magne@@ tis@@ m and char@@ is@@ ma su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to seem really important ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
It &apos;s great for in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts and it &apos;s great for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
"H@@ i , my na@@ me is Mar@@ cin — far@@ m@@ er , techn@@ ologi@@ st ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ p@@ en S@@ our@@ ce E@@ c@@ ology .
"We &apos;ve iden@@ ti@@ fied the 50 most important mach@@ in@@ es that we think it takes for modern life to ex@@ ist — things from trac@@ tors , b@@ read o@@ ven@@ s , cir@@ cu@@ it mak@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and ma@@ in@@ tain at a f@@ r@@ action of the cost ."
We call this the G@@ lob@@ al V@@ il@@ la@@ ge C@@ on@@ struc@@ tion S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ ish@@ ed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in f@@ u@@ sion energy , and I disco@@ vered I was u@@ se@@ less ."
I had no pr@@ ac@@ tical sk@@ il@@ ls .
"The world pres@@ en@@ ted me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I gu@@ ess you can call it the con@@ sum@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ yle .
So I started a far@@ m in M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i and learned about the economi@@ c@@ s of far@@ ming .
I b@@ ought a trac@@ tor — then it bro@@ ke .
I pa@@ id to get it re@@ pa@@ i@@ red — then it bro@@ ke again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was bro@@ ke too ."
"I re@@ alized that the truly appro@@ pri@@ ate , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able far@@ m and se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment just didn &apos;t ex@@ ist yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were ro@@ b@@ ust , mo@@ dular , high@@ ly eff@@ ici@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost , made from lo@@ cal and rec@@ y@@ c@@ led materi@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not design@@ ed for ob@@ sol@@ es@@ c@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I test@@ ed them .
And I found that in@@ du@@ stri@@ al produc@@ tivity can be achi@@ ev@@ ed on a small scal@@ e .
"So then I published the 3@@ D design@@ s , s@@ che@@ ma@@ tics , in@@ struc@@ tional vide@@ os and bu@@ d@@ gets on a w@@ iki ."
"Th@@ en con@@ trib@@ ut@@ ors from all over the world beg@@ an sho@@ wing up , prot@@ ot@@ y@@ ping new mach@@ in@@ es dur@@ ing de@@ dic@@ ated pro@@ ject vi@@ si@@ ts ."
"So far , we have prot@@ ot@@ y@@ ped eight of the 50 mach@@ in@@ es ."
And now the pro@@ ject is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce has suc@@ ce@@ eded with to@@ ols for man@@ ag@@ ing kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is star@@ ting to happen with har@@ d@@ w@@ are too .
We &apos;re f@@ oc@@ using on har@@ d@@ w@@ are because it is har@@ d@@ w@@ are that can change people &apos;s lives in such tan@@ gi@@ ble material ways .
"If we can lo@@ wer the bar@@ ri@@ ers to far@@ ming , building , man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just mas@@ sive amoun@@ ts of human pot@@ enti@@ al ."
That &apos;s not only in the develop@@ ing world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American far@@ m@@ er , buil@@ der , en@@ tre@@ p@@ ren@@ e@@ ur , mak@@ er ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of exc@@ it@@ ement from these people , who can now start a con@@ struc@@ tion b@@ usiness , parts man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , organ@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ ling power back to the g@@ ri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published design@@ s so c@@ lear , so comple@@ te , that a single bur@@ ned D@@ V@@ D is effec@@ tively a civi@@ li@@ za@@ tion star@@ ter k@@ it ."
I &apos;ve plan@@ ted a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve pres@@ sed 5@@ ,000 bri@@ c@@ ks in one day from the dir@@ t ben@@ e@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a trac@@ tor in six days ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is truly sound , then the imp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions are sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ant ."
"A great@@ er dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ men@@ t@@ ally sound sup@@ ply c@@ ha@@ ins , and a ne@@ w@@ ly re@@ lev@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y mak@@ er culture can hop@@ e to trans@@ c@@ end ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al s@@ car@@ c@@ ity ."
We &apos;re expl@@ or@@ ing the limi@@ ts of what we all can do to make a better world with op@@ en har@@ d@@ w@@ are technology .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"A th@@ ous@@ and years later , a mam@@ m@@ ot@@ h di@@ ed in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Ger@@ many ."
"A few centur@@ ies after that , a g@@ ri@@ ff@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also di@@ ed in the same vic@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these an@@ im@@ als met their de@@ a@@ ths , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mark@@ able f@@ ate ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the fl@@ ute , a to@@ ol that created u@@ se@@ less vi@@ bra@@ tions in air molecu@@ les ."
But that is exactly what our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors did .
Now this turns out to be surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly common in the history of in@@ nov@@ ation .
"But just as of@@ ten , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re f@@ un ."
T@@ ak@@ e what may be the most important in@@ ven@@ tion of modern times : program@@ ma@@ ble comput@@ ers .
"S@@ ome@@ one came up with the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant idea of tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds by pres@@ sing small le@@ ver@@ s with our fin@@ ger@@ s , inv@@ ent@@ ing the first mu@@ sic@@ al k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ar@@ d ."
"In fact , the very first ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er was ori@@ gin@@ ally called &quot; &quot; the wr@@ iting har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ l@@ utes and music led to even more po@@ wer@@ ful bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a th@@ ous@@ and years ago , at the he@@ ight of the I@@ s@@ la@@ mic R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce , three bro@@ thers in B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d design@@ ed a de@@ vice that was an a@@ ut@@ o@@ ma@@ ted or@@ g@@ an ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ str@@ ument that play@@ s itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ str@@ ument was basically a gi@@ ant music bo@@ x ."
This in@@ str@@ ument was the first of its kind .
It was program@@ ma@@ ble .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a mas@@ sive le@@ ap for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are be@@ comes thin@@ k@@ able for the first time with this in@@ ven@@ tion .
It came from the strange de@@ light of wat@@ ching a machine pla@@ y music .
"In fact , the idea of program@@ ma@@ ble mach@@ in@@ es was exc@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely ke@@ pt ali@@ ve by music for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0s , mu@@ sic@@ -@@ making mach@@ in@@ es be@@ came the play@@ things of the P@@ ari@@ si@@ an eli@@ te ."
"And as de V@@ au@@ can@@ son was design@@ ing his ro@@ bo@@ t mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , he had another idea ."
"If you could progra@@ m a machine to make ple@@ as@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds , why not progra@@ m it to we@@ a@@ ve de@@ li@@ ght@@ ful patter@@ ns of col@@ or out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new patter@@ n for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just program@@ med a new c@@ y@@ lin@@ der ."
This was the first program@@ ma@@ ble lo@@ om .
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"Y@@ es , the mili@@ tar@@ y inv@@ ol@@ vement is an important part of the story , but inv@@ ent@@ ing a computer also re@@ qui@@ red other building b@@ loc@@ ks : music box@@ es , to@@ y ro@@ bo@@ t fl@@ ute play@@ ers , har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful patter@@ ns wo@@ ven into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
N@@ ec@@ es@@ si@@ ty isn &apos;t always the mother of in@@ ven@@ tion .
"The play@@ ful state of mind is fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally expl@@ or@@ at@@ ory , se@@ ek@@ ing out new possibili@@ ties in the world around us ."
And that se@@ ek@@ ing is why so many experi@@ ences that started with simple de@@ light and a@@ mu@@ se@@ ment even@@ tually led us to pro@@ found bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
E@@ very@@ one ne@@ eds a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all play@@ er , a ten@@ n@@ is play@@ er , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or a bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we impro@@ ve .
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no syste@@ ma@@ tic fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ ob@@ s better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ ob@@ s in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ in@@ da and I learned how little u@@ se@@ ful fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were blo@@ wn away ."
"@@ Un@@ til rec@@ ently , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"If all my bri@@ dge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hop@@ e of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differ@@ ently ?
"T@@ o@@ day , dist@@ ri@@ c@@ ts are re@@ v@@ am@@ ping the way they ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them impro@@ ve their pr@@ ac@@ tice ."
O@@ ur teachers de@@ ser@@ ve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fa@@ ir to them .
"It &apos;s not fa@@ ir to students , and it &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting America &apos;s global lea@@ der@@ ship at ri@@ s@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for impro@@ vement they want and de@@ ser@@ ve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king tab@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back syste@@ ms ."
C@@ on@@ si@@ der the ran@@ k@@ ings for read@@ ing prof@@ ici@@ enc@@ y .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ c@@ el@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the pla@@ ces that do better than the U.S. in read@@ ing , how many of them have a for@@ mal system for hel@@ ping teachers impro@@ ve ?"
E@@ lev@@ en out of 14 .
"The U.S. is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in ma@@ th ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fa@@ il@@ ing to give our teachers the help they need to devel@@ o@@ p their sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best ac@@ ade@@ mic per@@ form@@ er : the pro@@ v@@ ince of S@@ hang@@ ha@@ i , China ."
"Now , they ran@@ k number one across the bo@@ ar@@ d , in read@@ ing , ma@@ th and science , and one of the k@@ ey@@ s to S@@ hang@@ ha@@ i &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep impro@@ ving ."
They made sure that youn@@ ger teachers get a chan@@ ce to watch ma@@ ster teachers at work .
"They have week@@ ly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even re@@ qu@@ ire each teacher to ob@@ ser@@ ve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ agu@@ es .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much var@@ i@@ ation in the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more effec@@ tive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the country who are hel@@ ping their students make ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ga@@ ins ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blo@@ wing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ oun@@ dation has been working with 3@@ ,000 teachers in dist@@ ri@@ c@@ ts across the country on a pro@@ ject called M@@ e@@ as@@ u@@ res of E@@ ff@@ ec@@ tive Te@@ ach@@ ing ."
