T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expec@@ ted disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology in@@ du@@ str@@ y .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force our@@ selves into the environ@@ ment by pay@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to ...
... pay@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing .
It &apos;s just a quic@@ k vide@@ o of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ an@@ g on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just sk@@ ip — I &apos;ll just sk@@ ip through the vide@@ o instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ u@@ sic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ o@@ lar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ac@@ k , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ di@@ t of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves s@@ mal@@ ler ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ cin@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particu@@ lar@@ ly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a sm@@ ile , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ sh@@ ak@@ e ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York Ti@@ mes .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about commun@@ i@@ cation ."
"When we think about commun@@ i@@ cation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make swe@@ ep@@ ing j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or pro@@ m@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Un@@ iversi@@ ty , sho@@ ws that when people watch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that phy@@ si@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them poor@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our phy@@ si@@ ology ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psych@@ ologi@@ st . I study pre@@ j@@ u@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive b@@ usiness school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ yn@@ ami@@ c@@ s ."
I be@@ came es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interest@@ ed in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and do@@ min@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and do@@ min@@ ance ?
"So in the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about expan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you st@@ ret@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca T@@ r@@ acy has studi@@ ed ."
We make our@@ selves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really po@@ wer@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make our@@ selves s@@ mal@@ ler . We don &apos;t mir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I no@@ tice ?"
"When they si@@ t down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ tice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ omen feel ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally less po@@ wer@@ ful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So b@@ usiness schools have been str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we sm@@ ile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to sm@@ ile by h@@ ol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ di@@ es , but is it also true that our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the po@@ wer@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the po@@ wer@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the po@@ wer@@ less look like ?
"So po@@ wer@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at ga@@ mes of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ri@@ s@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to st@@ ress ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ ad@@ er that &apos;s do@@ min@@ ant , high on test@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really st@@ ress re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at le@@ ast at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that r@@ ole changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a r@@ ole change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ i@@ mal level , like this tiny man@@ ip@@ u@@ lation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be si@@ tting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on test@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about our@@ selves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also our@@ selves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative si@@ tu@@ ations , like social thre@@ at si@@ tu@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being he@@ ck@@ led ."
P@@ eople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re b@@ l@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is . They &apos;re b@@ l@@ ind to the condi@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ e@@ ch .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effec@@ t , or medi@@ ating the effec@@ t ."
"So I said , fak@@ e it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad c@@ ar ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a c@@ ar , rol@@ led sever@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the c@@ ar .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had iden@@ ti@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish college ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ ik@@ e , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"L@@ ik@@ e , she can fak@@ e it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fak@@ e it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ak@@ e it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ al@@ ize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to lea@@ ve you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ e@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your test@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t lea@@ ve that si@@ tu@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ den@@ ce , R@@ ho@@ de I@@ s@@ land to P@@ ort@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ a@@ ds through state par@@ ks and national for@@ est@@ s — basically the lon@@ g@@ est r@@ ou@@ te we can pos@@ si@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the mid@@ dle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mi@@ les ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep see@@ ing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
M@@ y fri@@ end looks at me tot@@ ally b@@ lan@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a gen@@ tle@@ man in the fron@@ t row who &apos;s doing a per@@ fe@@ ct imi@@ tation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sign@@ s we keep see@@ ing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fam@@ ous Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about si@@ tu@@ ations exactly like this — why we some@@ times mi@@ sun@@ der@@ st@@ and the sign@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a strange car@@ e@@ er move , but it actually has one great ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at le@@ ast to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possibili@@ ty that we our@@ selves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es .
"The human speci@@ es , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I hold , here in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bili@@ ty goes out the w@@ in@@ d@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go to the p@@ ol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se .
"So effec@@ tively , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bub@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as in@@ dividu@@ als , in our person@@ al and profes@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us col@@ lec@@ tively as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ ince you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single great@@ est moral , intel@@ lec@@ tual and cre@@ ative le@@ ap you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you g@@ uy@@ s something — or actually , let me ask you g@@ uy@@ s something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You g@@ uy@@ s are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to re@@ al@@ ize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ ast@@ ating , it can be re@@ ve@@ la@@ t@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ p@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mi@@ st@@ ak@@ e ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remem@@ ber that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at le@@ ast if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and re@@ aliz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ al@@ ls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we re@@ al@@ ize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s g@@ one off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tur@@ al reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ ght@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too la@@ te ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school .
"You &apos;re si@@ tting there in clas@@ s , and your teacher is han@@ ding back qu@@ iz p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ ap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his ho@@ me@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es ."
We learn these really bad les@@ s@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I s@@ us@@ pect , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just be@@ coming per@@ fe@@ ct little A students , per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ist@@ s , o@@ ver@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phy@@ si@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possibili@@ ty that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ edi@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ ger@@ y ."
B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for Har@@ var@@ d — one of the best h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have g@@ one f@@ ine .
"And she w@@ ak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perfor@@ med a ma@@ j@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ oke about this inci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply fel@@ t that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very dan@@ ger@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ ght@@ ness that we all experience so of@@ ten is not a reli@@ able gu@@ ide to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ining the possibili@@ ty that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million gal@@ l@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global econ@@ omy ."
So this is a hu@@ ge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a hu@@ ge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly ref@@ lec@@ t reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we us@@ u@@ ally do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re i@@ gn@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ ec@@ es of the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a th@@ ir@@ d as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion : they know the tr@@ ut@@ h , and they are de@@ liber@@ ately dist@@ ort@@ ing it for their own mal@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
This at@@ t@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ ght@@ ness ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mi@@ st@@ ak@@ es when we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely need to and ca@@ u@@ ses us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly trans@@ lu@@ cent w@@ in@@ do@@ ws and we just g@@ az@@ e out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to g@@ az@@ e out of the same w@@ in@@ d@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remem@@ ber the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same ni@@ ght sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ ef@@ ore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ al@@ l@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ ef@@ ore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing de@@ fe@@ ct in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or o@@ ver@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fun@@ da@@ mental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ im@@ als , we are ob@@ ses@@ sed with trying to fig@@ ure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ ses@@ sion is the s@@ our@@ ce and ro@@ o@@ t of all of our produc@@ tivity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"L@@ ast year , for var@@ i@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ en@@ ing to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ ubli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ gn@@ ess la@@ dy .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we j@@ oke that every single ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ sal and wr@@ on@@ gn@@ ess to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as re@@ a@@ ders , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ ist@@ s and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se en@@ din@@ gs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"G@@ e@@ orge B@@ ush thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de Ira@@ q , find a bun@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of mas@@ s de@@ struc@@ tion , liber@@ ate the people and bring democr@@ acy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dic@@ tat@@ or of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sic@@ k and could pas@@ s the re@@ i@@ gn@@ s of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school swe@@ e@@ the@@ art and move back to your ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody hat@@ es for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ al@@ ize .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ on@@ ish@@ es us ."
"@@ No off@@ en@@ se , but this enti@@ re con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ ument to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just sp@@ ent an enti@@ re we@@ ek talking about in@@ nov@@ ations and ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those in@@ nov@@ ations and ad@@ van@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) Di@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ac@@ k , Chris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you g@@ uy@@ s have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ ster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ aybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you g@@ uy@@ s . ( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of f@@ un ."
( Applause )
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ les@@ sing as a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ cess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I famili@@ ar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have vi@@ si@@ ted more than 1@@ 45 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"So our o@@ ver@@ all com@@ mi@@ t@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pro@@ m@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ cation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , stran@@ gel@@ y , not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed quite of@@ ten , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ irst of all is the mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of religi@@ ous s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , h@@ ol@@ y s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , in the Bi@@ ble , O@@ ld Te@@ st@@ am@@ ent , New Te@@ st@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ ur@@ an and so fort@@ h , and these have been mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant pos@@ i@@ tions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the m@@ os@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily re@@ le@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary position com@@ par@@ ed to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
But the basi@@ c thing is the s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant position .
"That is an al@@ l@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ a@@ sive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive hus@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ yer , for in@@ stance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equal in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als myself ?"
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous b@@ light that ca@@ u@@ ses this problem is the ex@@ ces@@ sive re@@ sort to violence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"@@ No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a sev@@ en@@ f@@ old increase .
And we ran@@ k right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all ele@@ ments of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging the de@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ u@@ ses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a limi@@ ted amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
"And some@@ times , in more extre@@ me ca@@ ses but not very r@@ are ca@@ ses , they se@@ w the ori@@ fi@@ ce up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , for in@@ stance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ mal@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted in that way ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the girl br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rela@@ t@@ es to women particu@@ lar@@ ly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people s@@ old from A@@ fri@@ ca into s@@ la@@ very in the New World back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now li@@ ving in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a man@@ d@@ ate from C@@ on@@ g@@ ress to give a re@@ port every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are s@@ old across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those s@@ old are women , into se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are li@@ ving in human bon@@ da@@ ge , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ m@@ ory Un@@ iversi@@ ty , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people s@@ old into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to buy a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned girl br@@ ings sever@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ eds the tot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good approach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed if they are in se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ imp@@ s and the mal@@ e cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has g@@ one down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ le@@ g@@ al sex tra@@ de , 2@@ 5 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"In the mili@@ tar@@ y , they are now anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing how many se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"On@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding off@@ ic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ i@@ on in the Ar@@ my or a comp@@ any in the Mar@@ in@@ es — the com@@ man@@ ding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ute a rap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are tak@@ ing place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w ne@@ eds to be changed .
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the la@@ ck of equal p@@ ay for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is some@@ times mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I be@@ came pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 2@@ 5 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d World War .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying o@@ ver@@ head d@@ rop@@ ping bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that at@@ tac@@ k people and so fort@@ h ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to violence and the mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of the h@@ ol@@ y s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ u@@ ses , are the basi@@ c ca@@ u@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more basi@@ c cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a da@@ m@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qui@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed position that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y , and this is very si@@ mi@@ lar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equal had exist@@ ed ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed position ."
So what is the basi@@ c thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her dau@@ gh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ la@@ ted and so fort@@ h .
Thank you very much .
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ li@@ ons of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the valu@@ e of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es on my right eye ."
And I beg@@ an the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the valu@@ e of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I studi@@ ed , I met with medic@@ al doc@@ tors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new fe@@ min@@ ist issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ li@@ ty sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four h@@ ours s@@ le@@ ep the ni@@ ght before .
"And I fel@@ t like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I fel@@ t like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ ashington , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck is too la@@ te for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence cal@@ ls and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly b@@ us@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tr@@ ut@@ h is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ il@@ li@@ ant lea@@ ders in b@@ usiness , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good le@@ ad@@ er , because the es@@ s@@ ence of lea@@ der@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ s .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ister@@ s , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were b@@ us@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have no@@ tic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ ok@@ en up from a sev@@ en@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght@@ -@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a person@@ al level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own car@@ e@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disco@@ ver the great ideas that lie inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ in@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Chris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ ute about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te itself con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ting on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the h@@ ol@@ y gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of neur@@ ology , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous or@@ g@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of prot@@ op@@ las@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this ac@@ tivity emer@@ ges the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of abili@@ ties that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One approach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ar@@ d re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of b@@ l@@ un@@ ting of your cogn@@ itive abili@@ ty ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly se@@ lec@@ tive l@@ os@@ s of one fun@@ c@@ tion , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ den@@ ce in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ c@@ tion on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ p@@ les of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ p@@ les , six minutes each , dur@@ ing this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ por@@ al lo@@ bes , fron@@ tal lo@@ bes , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lo@@ bes , O@@ K — the lo@@ bes that con@@ sti@@ tut@@ e the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the tem@@ por@@ al lo@@ bes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the f@@ u@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer recogn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogn@@ ize them from their v@@ o@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogn@@ ize yourself in the mir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it w@@ in@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is well known as ca@@ used by da@@ ma@@ ge to the f@@ u@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even neur@@ ologi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as de@@ lu@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise comp@@ let@@ ely normal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , comes out of co@@ ma , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise comp@@ let@@ ely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intelli@@ g@@ ent in all other res@@ pec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his de@@ lu@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the psych@@ i@@ at@@ ry te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this c@@ ha@@ p — and the same arg@@ ument app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about g@@ uy@@ s ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a strong se@@ x@@ ual at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ edi@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ts these la@@ t@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these la@@ t@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fla@@ ming to the sur@@ face , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this arg@@ ument ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an arg@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same de@@ lu@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same de@@ lu@@ sion , about his pe@@ t po@@ o@@ dle . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ if@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ if@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the la@@ t@@ ent b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality in all human@@ s , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cur@@ i@@ ous di@@ sor@@ der , we look at the struc@@ ture and fun@@ c@@ tions of the normal v@@ is@@ ual pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ Nor@@ m@@ ally , v@@ is@@ ual sign@@ als come in , into the ey@@ e@@ bal@@ ls , go to the v@@ is@@ ual are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after pro@@ ces@@ sing all that , the message goes to a small struc@@ ture called the f@@ u@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the abili@@ ty to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the message c@@ as@@ ca@@ des into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the e@@ mo@@ tional c@@ ore of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the e@@ mo@@ tional sign@@ if@@ ic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ d@@ at@@ or ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of chal@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can comp@@ let@@ ely i@@ gn@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ ges then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the a@@ ut@@ on@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cu@@ lar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s fort@@ un@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in resi@@ stance produc@@ ed by swe@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ou@@ sed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ ute .
"So my idea was , when this c@@ ha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the v@@ is@@ ual are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s pro@@ ces@@ sed in the f@@ u@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recogn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a plan@@ t , or a t@@ able , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the message c@@ as@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the a@@ ut@@ on@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this c@@ ha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the e@@ mo@@ tional c@@ ore of the brain , is cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the f@@ u@@ si@@ form is int@@ act , the c@@ ha@@ p can still recogn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is cut to the e@@ mo@@ tional cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ ef@@ ore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able la@@ ck of e@@ mo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in fron@@ t of a scre@@ en , and measure your gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a t@@ able or an um@@ bre@@ l@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start swe@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measure his gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fla@@ t ."
"There &apos;s no e@@ mo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the v@@ is@@ ual are@@ as to the e@@ mo@@ tional cen@@ ters is cut ."
"So his vision is normal because the v@@ is@@ ual are@@ as are normal , his e@@ mo@@ tions are normal — he &apos;ll la@@ u@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so fort@@ h — but the w@@ ire from vision to e@@ mo@@ tions is cut and ther@@ ef@@ ore he has this de@@ lu@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ v@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a biz@@ ar@@ re , seem@@ ing@@ ly in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sible , neur@@ al psych@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ d@@ ar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ c@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neur@@ al an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no de@@ lu@@ sion through the ph@@ one ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the e@@ mo@@ tional cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the ph@@ one he recogn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we approach this problem by con@@ si@@ der@@ ing another cur@@ i@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , for g@@ ang@@ ren@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the Ira@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you continu@@ e to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al v@@ is@@ cer@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the ut@@ er@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom ut@@ er@@ us , inc@@ lu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ str@@ ual cra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stu@@ dent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ MS ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for scienti@@ fi@@ c en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s c@@ la@@ im that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the ph@@ one when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a c@@ len@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the ori@@ gin@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ p@@ l@@ ying the ar@@ m was sever@@ ed , was cut , by say , a m@@ ot@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ p@@ ut@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous c@@ lin@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ic@@ ide , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ p@@ l@@ ying the ar@@ m had been cut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for sever@@ al months before the am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the fron@@ t of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting v@@ is@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body i@@ ma@@ ge and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"H@@ ow do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , so you can reli@@ eve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him v@@ is@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ aybe you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ tom cra@@ m@@ p ."
"H@@ ow do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts milli@@ ons of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding a@@ gen@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ar@@ d bo@@ x with a mir@@ ro@@ r in the mid@@ dle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ ek , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ achi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he cou@@ ldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent p@@ ut@@ s his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is c@@ len@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and the normal hand on the right side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the c@@ len@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the ref@@ lec@@ tion of the normal ar@@ m in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ g@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ ger@@ s , or move your real fin@@ ger@@ s while looking in the mir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the v@@ is@@ ual imp@@ res@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again , and the pa@@ in , the c@@ len@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remem@@ ber , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) M@@ y first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok at your ref@@ lec@@ tion of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r ref@@ lec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He cl@@ os@@ es his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s c@@ len@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , op@@ en your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s mo@@ ving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and the cri@@ tical r@@ ole of v@@ is@@ ual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a comp@@ let@@ ely u@@ se@@ less abili@@ ty , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started re@@ aliz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is that you see in neur@@ ology , like st@@ ro@@ ke , f@@ o@@ cal d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can o@@ ver@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , D@@ er@@ ek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , D@@ er@@ ek , take it home and pr@@ ac@@ tice with it for a we@@ ek or two ."
"M@@ aybe , after a per@@ i@@ od of pr@@ ac@@ tice , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the mir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and start mo@@ ving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ak@@ e it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s g@@ one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s g@@ one ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was g@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body i@@ ma@@ ge , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ic@@ s and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ ek , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ ef@@ ore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no c@@ len@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom for@@ ear@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are g@@ one away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ ger@@ s d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the desi@@ gn and put it on my for@@ e@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and eli@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ ger@@ s ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ sor@@ y conf@@ li@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ ges from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ c@@ le sign@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this conf@@ li@@ ct , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the sign@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the bon@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ed pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ z@@ en@@ s of patients by other groups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be valu@@ able as a treat@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , and inde@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be o@@ ver@@ come using mir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also g@@ one through c@@ lin@@ ical trials , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the th@@ ir@@ d part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ i@@ ous ph@@ enomen@@ on called sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ alt@@ on in the n@@ in@@ et@@ e@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ sin of Char@@ les Darwin .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise comp@@ let@@ ely normal , had the follo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ or@@ ed ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is b@@ lu@@ e , seven is y@@ ell@@ ow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are comp@@ let@@ ely normal in other res@@ pec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — some@@ times , t@@ ones ev@@ oke col@@ or ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is b@@ lu@@ e , F sh@@ ar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ ell@@ ow , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ alt@@ on called it sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ inc@@ t ."
These people mu@@ d@@ dle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pec@@ ts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ yn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in famili@@ es , so G@@ alt@@ on said this is a her@@ edi@@ tar@@ y bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a is eight times more common am@@ ong ar@@ ti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ u@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One theory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fi@@ c theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tr@@ ut@@ h to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an Di@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the th@@ ir@@ d theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask our@@ selves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ u@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remem@@ ber — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in famili@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the c@@ lu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ normal gen@@ e , a mut@@ ation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ u@@ ses this ab@@ normal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ isti@@ c mo@@ dular ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the a@@ du@@ l@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mut@@ ates , then you get def@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what ar@@ ti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the abili@@ ty to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king seem@@ ing@@ ly un@@ rela@@ ted ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fire ?"
"I mean , s@@ ch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic@@ s do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"@@ Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the sun , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the sun ."
"In@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this great@@ er c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a great@@ er pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common inci@@ den@@ ce of sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ ets , ar@@ ti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ological view of sy@@ nes@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one min@@ ute ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ nes@@ th@@ et@@ es , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ bet . Just like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ bet , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ e@@ mes , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ bet ."
"One of them is K@@ iki , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ iki and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ iki and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your han@@ ds .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mut@@ an@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ iki ? R@@ a@@ ise your han@@ ds ."
