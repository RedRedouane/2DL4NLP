"When I was 11 , I remember wak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my house ."
"My father was lis@@ ten@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C N@@ e@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y ra@@ di@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ usu@@ al then , because the news mos@@ tly de@@ pres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ ban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ ban took over A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan and made it il@@ le@@ ga@@ l for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ s@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der sis@@ ter , who was no longer allo@@ wed to be outside alone , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would su@@ spe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our book@@ s in gro@@ cer@@ y ba@@ gs so it would see@@ m we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teach@@ er , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ ce@@ led for a week because T@@ ali@@ ban were su@@ sp@@ ic@@ ious ."
We always won@@ de@@ red what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
D@@ o they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ c@@ ky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and da@@ ugh@@ ters were tre@@ asu@@ red .
My gr@@ and@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ick from a re@@ mot@@ e pro@@ v@@ ince of A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , he in@@ sis@@ ted that his da@@ ughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ o@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted mother became a teach@@ er .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ ive an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ ive an education , inclu@@ ding his da@@ ugh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ ban , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ a@@ ter risk in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ uring T@@ ali@@ ban years , I remember there were times I would get so fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ ten , my da@@ ughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be sto@@ l@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to se@@ ll our blo@@ od to pa@@ y your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was rai@@ sed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed by deca@@ des of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ yon@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I stand here a pr@@ oud gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hen I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , my gr@@ and@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his da@@ ugh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my col@@ le@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the st@@ ree@@ ts of K@@ a@@ bu@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ ams even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ ky for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ b@@ ition gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at opportunity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ pos@@ ition ."
"L@@ ike A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his da@@ ughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their vil@@ la@@ ge , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he sen@@ t his da@@ ughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my da@@ ughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realiz@@ e about A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ z@@ es the val@@ ue in his da@@ ughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t key in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ v@@ in@@ cing ne@@ got@@ i@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their da@@ ugh@@ ters , but in the con@@ text of a society like in A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , we must have the supp@@ ort of men ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ ban , girls who went to school num@@ be@@ red in the hundre@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ le@@ ga@@ l ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Amer@@ ic@@ ans see the f@@ ra@@ g@@ ility in changes .
I fe@@ ar that these changes will not last much be@@ yon@@ d the U.S@@ . tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ wa@@ l .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ sting change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bil@@ ities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ ike me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have se@@ para@@ ted .
And sl@@ igh@@ tly more complex things appe@@ ar .
That &apos;s t@@ w@@ ice as long as humans have been on this planet .
"And dee@@ p ben@@ e@@ ath those oce@@ ans , at cr@@ ac@@ ks in the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , you &apos;ve got he@@ at see@@ ping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great di@@ versity of ele@@ ments ."
"But of course , life is more than just ex@@ ot@@ ic chem@@ is@@ try ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings start pu@@ tting each other into bo@@ x@@ es the second that they see each other — I@@ s that person dan@@ ger@@ ous ? A@@ re they at@@ trac@@ tive ?
A@@ re they a poten@@ tial ma@@ te ? A@@ re they a poten@@ tial net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation when we me@@ et people to make a mental re@@ sume for them .
What &apos;s your name ? W@@ here are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Th@@ en we get more person@@ al with it .
H@@ a@@ ve you ever had any dise@@ a@@ ses ?
H@@ a@@ ve you ever been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
D@@ o@@ es your bre@@ ath s@@ me@@ ll bad while you &apos;re ans@@ wer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation right now ?
What are you into ? W@@ ho are you into ?
What gen@@ der do you like to s@@ le@@ e@@ p with ?
I get it .
We are neur@@ o@@ log@@ ically har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to see@@ k out people like ourselves .
We start for@@ ming c@@ li@@ qu@@ es as so@@ on as we &apos;re old enough to know what ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce feel@@ s like .
"We b@@ on@@ d together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce , r@@ ace , gen@@ der , the blo@@ ck that we gre@@ w up on ."
We see@@ k out environ@@ ments that re@@ in@@ force our person@@ al cho@@ ices .
"S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s open@@ ing a tin@@ y little box and as@@ king you to squ@@ ee@@ ze yourself inside of it ."
"Because the ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting ."
The bo@@ x@@ es are too nar@@ row .
And this can get really dan@@ ger@@ ous .
"So here &apos;s a dis@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ er about me , though , before we get too dee@@ p into this ."
I gre@@ w up in a very sh@@ el@@ te@@ red environment .
"I was rai@@ sed in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan in the early 198@@ 0s , two b@@ loc@@ ks from the e@@ pic@@ en@@ ter of p@@ un@@ k music ."
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of big@@ ot@@ ry and the social re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions of a rel@@ ig@@ i@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ based up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing .
"W@@ here I come from , if you we@@ ren &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ e@@ en or a ra@@ d@@ ical thin@@ ker or a perfor@@ man@@ ce art@@ ist of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do ."
"( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , but as a ki@@ d on the st@@ ree@@ ts of New York , you learn how to tr@@ ust your own inst@@ in@@ cts , you learn how to go with your own ideas ."
"So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a bo@@ y ."
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
"So I went home , and I sha@@ ved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bo@@ y . &quot; &quot; I mean , who kno@@ ws , right ?"
"When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that ."
"I didn &apos;t want any@@ one to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t ."
I ke@@ pt up the ch@@ ara@@ de for e@@ ight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was pla@@ ying a ki@@ d nam@@ ed W@@ al@@ ter in a movi@@ e called &quot; &quot; J@@ u@@ li@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little stre@@ et t@@ ough that follo@@ wed Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an S@@ later around and ba@@ d@@ ge@@ red him .
"S@@ e@@ e , I was also a child ac@@ tor , which dou@@ bl@@ ed up the la@@ y@@ ers of the perfor@@ man@@ ce of my iden@@ t@@ ity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really pla@@ ying a bo@@ y ."
"In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teach@@ ers at school , not my friends , not the di@@ rec@@ tors that I worked with ."
K@@ i@@ ds would often come up to me in clas@@ s and gra@@ b me by the th@@ ro@@ at to che@@ ck for an A@@ da@@ m &apos;s ap@@ ple or gra@@ b my cr@@ ot@@ ch to che@@ ck what I was working with .
"When I would go to the ba@@ th@@ room , I would turn my sho@@ es around in the st@@ all@@ s so that it looked like I was pe@@ e@@ ing standing up ."
A@@ t s@@ le@@ e@@ po@@ ver@@ s I would have pan@@ ic atta@@ cks trying to bre@@ ak it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kis@@ s me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s wor@@ th men@@ tion@@ ing though that I didn &apos;t h@@ ate my body or my gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was perfor@@ ming this el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fied as trans@@ gen@@ der .
"If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in ther@@ ap@@ y , they probably would have di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed me as something like gen@@ der d@@ ys@@ mor@@ p@@ hi@@ c and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"But in my particular case , I just wok@@ e up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again ."
"P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty had h@@ it , and I had no idea what being a girl me@@ ant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was ."
"When a ki@@ d beha@@ ves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?"
No one is exactly sho@@ c@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself by my parents .
"When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had f@@ all@@ en in love , it was the last thing on ei@@ ther of our min@@ ds to dis@@ cus@@ s what the con@@ sequ@@ ences were of the fact that my first love was a girl ."
"Th@@ ree years later , when I fe@@ ll in love with a man , ne@@ i@@ ther of my parents bat@@ ted an e@@ ye@@ l@@ as@@ h ei@@ ther ."
"S@@ e@@ e , it &apos;s one of the great b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to de@@ f@@ ine myself as any one thing at any point ."
"I was just allo@@ wed to be me , gro@@ wing and chan@@ ging in every moment ."
"So four , almost five years ago , P@@ ro@@ pos@@ ition 8 , the great mar@@ ri@@ age equ@@ ality de@@ b@@ ate , was ra@@ is@@ ing a lot of d@@ ust around this country ."
"And at the time , getting mar@@ ri@@ ed wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about ."
"But I was stru@@ ck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ ni@@ shed ci@@ vi@@ l r@@ ights recor@@ d , could be re@@ pe@@ ating its mis@@ takes so bl@@ at@@ an@@ tly ."
"And I remember wat@@ ching the dis@@ cus@@ sion on te@@ le@@ vision and thinking how interesting it was that the se@@ par@@ ation of ch@@ ur@@ ch and state was essen@@ ti@@ ally dra@@ wing ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es thr@@ ough@@ out this country , between places where people beli@@ ev@@ ed in it and places where people didn &apos;t ."
"And then , that this dis@@ cus@@ sion was dra@@ wing ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es around me ."
"If this was a war with two dis@@ par@@ ate side@@ s , I , by de@@ fa@@ ult , fe@@ ll on team ga@@ y , because I cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t 100 percent stra@@ ight ."
"A@@ t the time I was just beginning to em@@ er@@ ge from this e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year person@@ al iden@@ t@@ ity cr@@ is@@ is z@@ ig@@ za@@ g that saw me go from being a bo@@ y to being this a@@ w@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a bo@@ y in girl &apos;s clo@@ the@@ s to the op@@ pos@@ ite extre@@ me of this su@@ per s@@ k@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ comp@@ en@@ s@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ ch@@ as@@ ing gir@@ l@@ y-@@ girl to finally just a he@@ sit@@ ant expl@@ or@@ ation of what I actually was , a tom@@ bo@@ y@@ ish girl who l@@ ik@@ ed both bo@@ ys and girls depen@@ ding on the person ."
"I had spent a year photograp@@ h@@ ing this new gener@@ ation of girls , much like myself , who fe@@ ll kind of bet@@ we@@ en@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ines — girls who s@@ ka@@ te@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ we@@ ar , girls who had bo@@ ys &apos; ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts but wor@@ e gir@@ ly nai@@ l pol@@ ish , girls who had e@@ ye@@ sha@@ do@@ w to mat@@ ch their sc@@ rap@@ ed k@@ ne@@ es , girls who l@@ ik@@ ed girls and bo@@ ys who all l@@ ik@@ ed bo@@ ys and girls who all ha@@ ted being bo@@ x@@ ed in to anything ."
"I lo@@ ved these people , and I ad@@ mi@@ red their f@@ ree@@ dom , but I wat@@ ched as the world outside of our uto@@ pi@@ an bu@@ b@@ ble ex@@ plo@@ ded into these ra@@ ging de@@ ba@@ tes where p@@ un@@ d@@ its started l@@ iken@@ ing our love to be@@ st@@ i@@ ality on national te@@ le@@ vision ."
"And this powerful a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ro@@ ll@@ ed in over me that I was a min@@ or@@ ity , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my charac@@ ter ."
I was le@@ g@@ ally and in@@ dis@@ pu@@ ta@@ bly a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s c@@ it@@ izen .
I was not an activ@@ ist .
I wa@@ ve no f@@ la@@ gs in my own life .
But I was pla@@ gu@@ ed by this question : How could any@@ one v@@ ote to st@@ ri@@ p the r@@ ights of the v@@ ast vari@@ ety of people that I knew based on one ele@@ ment of their charac@@ ter ?
How could they say that we as a group were not de@@ ser@@ ving of equ@@ al r@@ ights as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of their dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ation ?
D@@ id they know who they were v@@ ot@@ ing against and what the imp@@ act was ?
"And then it oc@@ cur@@ red to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were ca@@ sting into secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s c@@ it@@ iz@@ en@@ ship it might make it har@@ der for them to do ."
It might give them pa@@ use .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same din@@ ner par@@ ty , so I fig@@ u@@ red out a way where I could in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce them to each other photograp@@ h@@ ically without any ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ice , without any l@@ igh@@ ting , or without any man@@ ip@@ ulation of any kind on my part ."
Because in a photograp@@ h you can exam@@ ine a l@@ ion &apos;s wh@@ is@@ kers without the fe@@ ar of him ri@@ pp@@ ing your face off .
"For me , photograp@@ hy is not just about ex@@ pos@@ ing fil@@ m , it &apos;s about ex@@ pos@@ ing the vi@@ e@@ wer to something new , a place they ha@@ ven &apos;t gone before , but most importan@@ tly , to people that they might be af@@ ra@@ id of ."
"L@@ i@@ fe ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed gener@@ ations of people to dis@@ tan@@ t , far@@ -@@ off cul@@ tures they never knew ex@@ is@@ ted through pic@@ tures ."
"So I decided to make a seri@@ es of very simple por@@ tra@@ its , m@@ ug@@ sh@@ ots if you will ."
"And I basically decided to photograp@@ h any@@ one in this country that was not 100 percent stra@@ ight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a lim@@ it@@ less number of people ."
"( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help ."
"So I ran out in the f@@ ree@@ z@@ ing co@@ ld , and I photograp@@ h@@ ed every single person that I knew that I could get to in F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of about two years ago ."
"And I took those photograp@@ h@@ s , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help ."
And they fun@@ ded two weeks of sho@@ ot@@ ing in New York .
And then we made this .
"( Mus@@ ic ) V@@ ideo : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ il@@ le@@ t@@ t W@@ right , and I &apos;m an art@@ ist born and rai@@ sed in New York C@@ ity . ( Mus@@ ic )@@ "

My go@@ al is to show the hum@@ an@@ ity that ex@@ ists in every one of us through the sim@@ plic@@ ity of a face .

"That video was made in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 11 , and as of today I have tra@@ ve@@ led to almost 20 cities and photograp@@ h@@ ed almost 2@@ ,000 people ."
"I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minu@@ te of just qu@@ i@@ et and have you just look at these fac@@ es because there is nothing that I can say that will ad@@ d to them ."
"Because if a picture is wor@@ th a th@@ ous@@ and words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vo@@ ca@@ bu@@ l@@ ary ."
"So after tra@@ ve@@ ling and talking to people in places like O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ oma or sma@@ ll@@ -@@ to@@ wn T@@ ex@@ as , we found ev@@ idence that the in@@ iti@@ al pre@@ mise was de@@ ad on ."

"O@@ f course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much lar@@ ger pro@@ por@@ tion of people iden@@ ti@@ fied as something that was much more nu@@ an@@ ced ."
I found that most people f@@ all on a spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of what I have come to re@@ fer to as &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And I am not even going to ad@@ dre@@ ss the issue of cho@@ ice ver@@ su@@ s bio@@ logical im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the beli@@ e@@ f that se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation is a cho@@ ice , I inv@@ ite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y ."
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human be@@ ings are not on@@ e-@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal .
"The most important thing to take from the per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge system is this : If you have ga@@ y people over here and you have stra@@ ight people over here , and while we recogni@@ ze that most people iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y as some@@ where clo@@ ser to one bin@@ ary or another , there is this v@@ ast spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of people that ex@@ ist in between ."
And the reality that this presen@@ ts is a com@@ plic@@ ated one .
"Because , for example , if you pas@@ s a la@@ w that allo@@ ws a b@@ oss to fir@@ e an em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e for h@@ omo@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al behavior , where exactly do you dra@@ w the line ?"
"I@@ s it over here , by the people who have had one or two he@@ te@@ ro@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences so far ?"
O@@ r is it over here by the people who have only had one or two h@@ omo@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al experi@@ ences th@@ us far ?
W@@ here exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s c@@ it@@ izen ?
A@@ no@@ ther interesting thing that I learned from my project and my tra@@ ve@@ ls is just what a po@@ or bin@@ ding ag@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation is .
"A@@ f@@ ter tra@@ ve@@ ling so much and mee@@ ting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ ts and De@@ mo@@ cr@@ ats and Re@@ pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ans and jo@@ cks and qu@@ e@@ ens and every other pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation you can possi@@ bly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human r@@ ace ."
"A@@ side from the fact that we play with one le@@ ga@@ l hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the shar@@ ed nar@@ r@@ ative of pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice and stru@@ g@@ gle , just being other than stra@@ ight doesn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly mean that we have anything in common ."
"So in the en@@ d@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of fac@@ es that S@@ el@@ f E@@ v@@ ident T@@ ru@@ ths is always be@@ coming , as it h@@ ope@@ fully appe@@ ars across more and more pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms , bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ters , b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , F@@ ace@@ book pa@@ ges , scre@@ en sa@@ ver@@ s , perhaps in wat@@ ching this pro@@ ces@@ sion of hum@@ an@@ ity , something interesting and u@@ se@@ ful will be@@ gin to happen ."
"H@@ ope@@ fully these ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies , these bin@@ ari@@ es , these over@@ -@@ simp@@ li@@ fied bo@@ x@@ es will be@@ gin to become u@@ se@@ less and they &apos;ll be@@ gin to f@@ all away ."
"Because really , they descri@@ be nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are ."
What we see are human be@@ ings in all their mul@@ ti@@ plic@@ ity .
And seeing them makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their hum@@ an@@ ity .
A@@ t the very least I hope it makes it har@@ der to den@@ y their human r@@ ights .
"So is it me partic@@ ul@@ arly that you would cho@@ ose to den@@ y the right to hou@@ sing , the right to ad@@ op@@ t children , the right to mar@@ ri@@ age , the f@@ ree@@ dom to sho@@ p here , live here , bu@@ y here ?"
"A@@ m I the one that you cho@@ ose to dis@@ own as your child or your bro@@ ther or your sis@@ ter or your mother or your father , your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , your cou@@ s@@ in , your un@@ cle , the pres@@ ident , your pol@@ ice woman or the fi@@ re@@ man ?"
It &apos;s too l@@ ate .
Because I already am all of those things .
"We already are all of those things , and we always have been ."
"So p@@ lease don &apos;t gre@@ et us as st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers , gre@@ et us as your fe@@ l@@ low human be@@ ings , peri@@ od ."

"In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to the br@@ ick k@@ il@@ ns ."
This st@@ range and a@@ we@@ some s@@ ight was like wal@@ king into an@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or D@@ an@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
"E@@ n@@ velo@@ p@@ ed in tem@@ per@@ at@@ ures of 1@@ 30 de@@ gre@@ es , men , women , children , entire famil@@ ies in fact , were clo@@ ak@@ ed in a he@@ av@@ y bl@@ an@@ ke@@ t of d@@ ust , while me@@ chan@@ ically sta@@ c@@ king br@@ ic@@ ks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and car@@ r@@ ying them from the sc@@ or@@ ching k@@ il@@ ns to tru@@ cks hundre@@ ds of yar@@ ds away ."
"D@@ e@@ a@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ oton@@ y and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this tas@@ k over and over for 16 or 1@@ 7 hours a day ."
"There were no bre@@ ak@@ s for food , no water bre@@ ak@@ s , and the se@@ v@@ ere de@@ hy@@ d@@ r@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al ."
So per@@ v@@ as@@ ive was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my c@@ amera became too ho@@ t to even tou@@ ch and ce@@ a@@ sed working .
"E@@ very 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our c@@ ru@@ i@@ ser to cle@@ an out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air con@@ diti@@ on@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I s@@ at there , I thought , my c@@ amera is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people ."
"B@@ ack in the k@@ il@@ ns , I wanted to cr@@ y , but the ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ on@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ isa , don &apos;t do that .

I couldn &apos;t off@@ er them any di@@ re@@ ct help .
"I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing ."
I wasn &apos;t a c@@ it@@ izen of that country .
I could get them in a wor@@ se s@@ itu@@ ation than they were already in .
"I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation , and I tr@@ us@@ ted that they would ."
"As for me , I &apos;d have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my he@@ art@@ bre@@ ak ."
"In the H@@ ima@@ la@@ y@@ as , I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for mil@@ es down m@@ oun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to tru@@ cks wa@@ iting at ro@@ ads be@@ low ."
"The big sh@@ ee@@ ts of sl@@ ate were he@@ a@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ r@@ ying them , and the kids ho@@ is@@ ted them from their he@@ ads using these han@@ d@@ made har@@ ne@@ s@@ ses of st@@ ic@@ ks and ro@@ p@@ e and tor@@ n cl@@ ot@@ h ."
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"@@ How can we a@@ ffe@@ ct something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ v@@ as@@ ive ?"
"S@@ ome don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ s@@ la@@ ved , people working 16 , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pa@@ y , because this has been the case all their lives ."
They have nothing to comp@@ are it to .
"When these vil@@ la@@ g@@ ers c@@ la@@ im@@ ed their f@@ ree@@ dom , the s@@ la@@ ve@@ ho@@ l@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their hou@@ ses ."
"I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the cen@@ ter r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ se@@ v@@ ere , and ab@@ ol@@ iti@@ on@@ ists on the ground hel@@ p@@ ed them get a qu@@ ar@@ ry lease of their own , so that now they do the same bac@@ k@@ -@@ bre@@ aking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get p@@ ai@@ d for it , and they do it in f@@ ree@@ dom ."
"S@@ e@@ x tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word s@@ la@@ very , and because of this wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ fe@@ ly within this particular indus@@ try ."
"In K@@ a@@ th@@ man@@ d@@ u , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been se@@ x s@@ la@@ ves themselves ."
"They u@@ sh@@ e@@ red me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this d@@ ir@@ ty , d@@ im@@ ly f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent l@@ it ba@@ se@@ ment ."
"This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se ."
It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
"C@@ ab@@ in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , as they &apos;re known in the tra@@ de , are ven@@ u@@ es for for@@ ced pr@@ os@@ t@@ itu@@ tion ."
"E@@ ach has small , pri@@ v@@ ate ro@@ om@@ s , where the s@@ la@@ ves , women , along with young girls and bo@@ ys , some as young as seven years old , are for@@ ced to en@@ ter@@ tain the c@@ li@@ ents , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging them to bu@@ y more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ."
"E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dar@@ k and d@@ ing@@ y , iden@@ ti@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all , and part@@ iti@@ on@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ wo@@ od and a cur@@ tain ."
The wor@@ kers here often en@@ d@@ ure tra@@ gi@@ c se@@ x@@ u@@ al ab@@ use at the hands of their cus@@ tom@@ ers .
"S@@ tan@@ ding in the ne@@ ar dar@@ k@@ ness , I remember feel@@ ing this qu@@ ick , ho@@ t fe@@ ar , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ app@@ ed in that he@@ ll ."
I had only one way out : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no win@@ do@@ ws large enough to cl@@ im@@ b through .
"These people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult sub@@ ject , it &apos;s important to not@@ e that s@@ la@@ very , inclu@@ ding se@@ x tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king , oc@@ cur@@ s in our own bac@@ ky@@ ard as well ."
"T@@ ens of hundre@@ ds of people are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , in dom@@ est@@ ic serv@@ itu@@ de , and the l@@ ist can go on ."
"@@ Re@@ cent@@ ly , the New York T@@ im@@ es re@@ por@@ ted that between 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 and 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 American children are so@@ ld into se@@ x s@@ la@@ very every year ."
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The te@@ x@@ ti@@ le indus@@ try is another one we often think of when we hear about s@@ la@@ ve lab@@ or .
I vis@@ ited vil@@ la@@ ges in India where entire famil@@ ies were en@@ s@@ la@@ ved in the sil@@ k tra@@ de .
This is a family por@@ tra@@ it .
"The d@@ yed black hands are the father , while the blu@@ e and red hands are his s@@ ons ."
"They mi@@ x d@@ y@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the d@@ y@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic ."
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
"&quot; &quot; We have no f@@ ree@@ dom , &quot; &quot; they said ."
"&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get p@@ ai@@ d for our d@@ ye@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s est@@ ima@@ ted that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ s@@ la@@ ved on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the lar@@ gest man@@ -@@ made l@@ ake in the world ."
"When we first ar@@ ri@@ ved , I went to have a qu@@ ick look ."
"I saw what seem@@ ed to be a family fi@@ shing on a bo@@ at , two ol@@ der bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?"
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ s@@ la@@ ved .
"C@@ h@@ il@@ dren are taken from their famil@@ ies and tra@@ f@@ fic@@ ked and v@@ an@@ i@@ shed , and they &apos;re for@@ ced to work en@@ d@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the l@@ ake , even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m ."
This young child is e@@ ight years old .
"He was tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing when our bo@@ at appro@@ ach@@ ed , fr@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed it would run over his tin@@ y c@@ ano@@ e ."
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .

M@@ any of them dro@@ wn .
"For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been for@@ ced to work on the l@@ ake ."
"T@@ er@@ ri@@ fied of his mas@@ ter , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been tre@@ ated with c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger s@@ la@@ ves that he man@@ ag@@ es ."
"I met these bo@@ ys at five in the mor@@ ning , when they were ha@@ ul@@ ing in the last of their ne@@ ts , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
"@@ in the co@@ ld , win@@ dy night ."
And it &apos;s important to not@@ e that these ne@@ ts we@@ ig@@ h more than a th@@ ous@@ and p@@ oun@@ ds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed from a fi@@ shing vil@@ la@@ ge .

"We started experim@@ en@@ ting , as you can see , in terms of sh@@ ap@@ es , for@@ ms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pe@@ t project .

"This is our group , our ma@@ in group of we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."
They come on a wee@@ k@@ ly bas@@ is to D@@ ur@@ ban .
They all have ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all mo@@ ved back to the r@@ ural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a wee@@ k@@ ly tur@@ n@@ around of produc@@ tion .
This is the community that I or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally sho@@ wed you the s@@ li@@ de of .
"And that &apos;s also mo@@ der@@ ni@@ z@@ ed today , and it &apos;s supp@@ or@@ ting work for 3@@ 00 we@@ a@@ ver@@ s ."

"In an age of global st@@ ri@@ fe and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is se@@ x so d@@ am@@ n good ?"
"If you &apos;re la@@ ugh@@ ing , you know what I mean ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s why . B@@ ack in uni@@ versity , we had a qu@@ ick project to design some so@@ lar@@ -@@ po@@ we@@ red c@@ loc@@ ks ."
Here &apos;s my clo@@ ck .
"It u@@ ses something called the d@@ war@@ f su@@ n@@ flo@@ wer , which gro@@ ws to about 12 in@@ ches in he@@ ight ."
"Now , as you know , su@@ n@@ flo@@ wers tr@@ ack the sun during the course of the day ."
"So in the mor@@ ning , you see which di@@ re@@ ction the su@@ n@@ flo@@ wer is fac@@ ing , and you mar@@ k it on the bl@@ ank area in the b@@ ase ."
"A@@ t no@@ on , you mar@@ k the changed pos@@ ition of the su@@ n@@ flo@@ wer , and in the ev@@ en@@ ing again , and that &apos;s your clo@@ ck ."
"Now , I know my clo@@ ck doesn &apos;t tell you the ex@@ act time , but it does give you a gener@@ al idea using a flo@@ wer ."
"So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ a@@ sed , sub@@ je@@ ctive op@@ in@@ ion , it &apos;s br@@ il@@ li@@ ant ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s clo@@ ck ."
It &apos;s five mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ as@@ ses with a sho@@ t gl@@ as@@ s under each one .
In each sho@@ t gl@@ as@@ s is a different sc@@ en@@ ted oil .
"In the mor@@ ning , the su@@ n@@ light will shin@@ e down on the first mag@@ ni@@ f@@ ying gl@@ as@@ s , foc@@ using a be@@ am of light on the sho@@ t gl@@ as@@ s under@@ ne@@ ath ."
"This will war@@ m up the sc@@ en@@ ted oil inside , and a particular s@@ me@@ ll will be em@@ it@@ ted ."
"So during the course of the day , five different s@@ me@@ lls are dis@@ per@@ sed thr@@ ough@@ out that environment ."
An@@ yone living in that house can tell the time just by the s@@ me@@ ll .
You can see why I h@@ ate Ch@@ r@@ is .
One thing you have to know about me is I h@@ ate to l@@ ose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ g@@ ging me for well over a deca@@ de .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why se@@ x is so good ."
"M@@ any years after the sol@@ ar po@@ we@@ red c@@ loc@@ ks project , a young l@@ ad@@ y I knew sug@@ ge@@ sted maybe se@@ x is so good because of the five sen@@ ses ."
"And when she said this , I had an e@@ pi@@ p@@ han@@ y ."
So I decided to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate different experi@@ ences I had in my life from the point of view of the five sen@@ ses .
"T@@ o do this , I de@@ vi@@ sed something called the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ."
"A@@ long the y-@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have a scale from zer@@ o to 10 , and along the x@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is , you have , of course , the five sen@@ ses ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ time I had a memor@@ able experience in my life , I would recor@@ d it on this grap@@ h like a five sen@@ ses di@@ ary ."
Here &apos;s a qu@@ ick video to show you how it works .
"B@@ ike desig@@ ner : This is &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , cus@@ to@@ m b@@ ike desig@@ ner ."
( M@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; T@@ ou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; S@@ me@@ ll &#93; &#91; T@@ as@@ te &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h works .
So here are some other resu@@ l@@ ts .
The first is for inst@@ ant no@@ od@@ les .
"Now obvi@@ ously , tas@@ te and s@@ me@@ ll are quite high , but not@@ ice sound is at three ."
"You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) N@@ ee@@ d@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people ."
"O@@ K , next , clu@@ b@@ b@@ ing ."
These people I still do han@@ g out with .
"A@@ ll right , and s@@ mok@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere I found tou@@ ch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reas@@ ons is that s@@ mok@@ ers told me the sen@@ s@@ ation of ho@@ l@@ ding a c@@ ig@@ are@@ tte and br@@ ing@@ ing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the s@@ mok@@ ing experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of sc@@ ary to think how well c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes are desig@@ ned by the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ rs ."
"O@@ K . Now , what would the perfe@@ ct experience look like on the five sen@@ ses grap@@ h ?"
"It would , of course , be a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal line along the top ."
"Now you can see , not even as in@@ ten@@ se an experience as ri@@ ding a mot@@ or@@ b@@ ike comes close ."
"In fact , in the years that I ga@@ the@@ red data , only one experience came close to being the perfe@@ ct one ."
"That is , of course , se@@ x . G@@ re@@ at se@@ x ."
R@@ es@@ pon@@ den@@ ts said that great se@@ x hit@@ s all of the five sen@@ ses at an extre@@ me level .
So the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory does help expla@@ in why se@@ x is so good .
"Now in the middle of all this five sen@@ ses work , I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly re@@ mem@@ be@@ red the so@@ lar@@ -@@ po@@ we@@ red c@@ loc@@ ks project from my you@@ th ."
And I realized this the@@ ory also expla@@ ins why Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s clo@@ ck is so much better than min@@ e .
"You see , my clo@@ ck only fo@@ cu@@ ses on s@@ ight , and a little bit of tou@@ ch ."
Here &apos;s Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s clo@@ ck .
It &apos;s the first clo@@ ck ever that u@@ ses s@@ me@@ ll to tell the time .
"In fact , in terms of the five sen@@ ses , Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s clo@@ ck is a re@@ v@@ olution ."
And that &apos;s what this the@@ ory ta@@ ught me about my field .
"You see , up t@@ ill now , us desig@@ ners , we &apos;ve main@@ ly foc@@ used on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of tou@@ ch , which means we &apos;ve ig@@ no@@ red the other three sen@@ ses ."
Ch@@ r@@ is &apos;s clo@@ ck shows us that even ra@@ is@@ ing just one of those other sen@@ ses can make for a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant produ@@ ct .
So what if we started using the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory in all of our desig@@ ns ?
Here &apos;s three qu@@ ick ideas I came up with .
"We could call this &quot; &quot; the per@@ fu@@ ma@@ tor . &quot; &quot; All right , next ."
"So I br@@ us@@ h my tee@@ th t@@ w@@ ice a day , and what if we had a too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h that ta@@ ste@@ s like can@@ dy , and when the tas@@ te of can@@ dy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h ?"
"F@@ in@@ ally , I have a thing for the ke@@ ys on a f@@ lu@@ te or a cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et ."
"It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you pre@@ ss down on them ."
"Now , I don &apos;t play the f@@ lu@@ te or the cl@@ ar@@ in@@ et , so I decided to com@@ b@@ ine these ke@@ ys with an in@@ stru@@ ment I do play : the te@@ le@@ vision re@@ mot@@ e control ."
"Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll not@@ ice that the five sen@@ ses the@@ ory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these produc@@ ts but also the way they look ."
"Now , I realiz@@ e the five sen@@ ses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting ."
There &apos;s also the six emot@@ ions and that el@@ us@@ ive x@@ -@@ fac@@ tor .
Ma@@ ybe that could be the to@@ p@@ ic of my next talk .
"@@ U@@ n@@ til then , p@@ lease have fun using the five sen@@ ses in your own lives and your own desig@@ ns ."
"O@@ h , one last thing before I leave ."
And the best way to do that is with free can@@ dy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
( Applause )
She wanted us to experience re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the v@@ ir@@ tu@@ e of com@@ pl@@ im@@ en@@ ting each other .
"And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ..@@ ."
And I was one of them .
And the com@@ pl@@ im@@ ents sto@@ pped .
And the teach@@ er was f@@ re@@ aking out .
"S@@ he was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , would any@@ one say anything n@@ ice about these people ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No one ? OK , why don &apos;t you go get your gi@@ ft and s@@ it down ."
W@@ as it me or the teach@@ er ?
"You know , when you see people get ro@@ as@@ ted on T@@ V , it was fun@@ n@@ y ."
There was nothing fun@@ n@@ y about that day .
Th@@ en fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward e@@ ight years .
I fe@@ ll in love with that guy .
"I thought , wo@@ w , I know what I want to do now ."
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another ver@@ sion of me : one who will con@@ qu@@ er the world .
"Well , then two years later , I was presen@@ ted with the opportunity to come to the United States ."
"Th@@ en , fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward another 14 years ."
I was 30 .
"N@@ ope , I didn &apos;t build that company ."
One wanted to con@@ qu@@ er the world — make a difference — another was af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ je@@ ction .
And every time that si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old won .
And this fe@@ ar even per@@ sis@@ ted after I started my own company .
It h@@ ur@@ t me so bad that I wanted to qu@@ it right there .
W@@ ou@@ ld any suc@@ cess@@ ful ent@@ re@@ pre@@ ne@@ ur qu@@ it like that ?
No way .
And this is where it cl@@ ic@@ ked for me .
Th@@ en I found this we@@ b@@ s@@ ite by lu@@ ck .
It &apos;s called re@@ je@@ c@@ tion@@ ther@@ ap@@ y@@ .@@ com@@ .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Re@@ je@@ ction Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y &quot; &quot; was this game inven@@ ted by this C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an ent@@ re@@ pre@@ ne@@ ur .
"( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this ."
"And I &apos;ll feel myself getting re@@ je@@ cted 100 days . &quot; &quot; And I came up with my own re@@ je@@ ction ideas , and I made a video blo@@ g out of it ."
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blo@@ g looked like .
D@@ a@@ y One ...
( Laughter ) B@@ or@@ row 100 dollars from a st@@ ran@@ ger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
I came do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and I saw this big guy sitting behind a des@@ k .
He looked like a se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ard .
So I just appro@@ ach@@ ed him .
"( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;"
"He was a chu@@ b@@ by , lo@@ ve@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he inv@@ ited me to expla@@ in myself ."
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
"I could &apos;ve expla@@ ined , I could &apos;ve ne@@ got@@ i@@ ated ."
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
"I felt , wo@@ w , this is like a micro@@ cos@@ m of my life ."
"E@@ very time I felt the sl@@ igh@@ test re@@ je@@ ction , I would just run as f@@ ast as I could ."
And you know what ?
I &apos;ll sta@@ y enga@@ ged .
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
"I &apos;m sure they have some here , too ."
"And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you make me dou@@ g@@ h@@ nu@@ ts that look like O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic sym@@ b@@ ols ?"
"B@@ as@@ ically , you inter@@ lin@@ k five dou@@ g@@ h@@ nu@@ ts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say y@@ es , right ?"
And I was so tou@@ ched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million vi@@ e@@ ws on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be .
And I became fam@@ ous .
I wanted to see what I could learn .
"That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a we@@ ird thing ."
And then I learned I could fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am ...
"You know , sometimes you get re@@ je@@ cted by l@@ igh@@ ting , you know ?"
"( Laughter ) But wo@@ w — when I fin@@ i@@ shed teach@@ ing that clas@@ s , I wal@@ ked out cr@@ ying , because I thought I could fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill my life dre@@ am just by simply as@@ king ."
"And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I qu@@ o@@ ted M@@ art@@ in L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r ."
"And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about re@@ je@@ ction , and in my case , re@@ je@@ ction was my cur@@ se , was my bo@@ o@@ ge@@ y@@ man ."
It has bo@@ the@@ red me my whole life because I was run@@ ning away from it .
I turned that into the big@@ gest gi@@ ft in my life .
I started teach@@ ing people how to turn re@@ je@@ c@@ tions into opportun@@ ities .
"When you get re@@ je@@ cted in life , when you are fac@@ ing the next ob@@ sta@@ cle or next fail@@ ure , conside@@ r the possi@@ bil@@ ities ."
D@@ on &apos;t run .
( Applause )
"( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) I see@@ k re@@ fu@@ ge in Al@@ la@@ h from cur@@ sed S@@ at@@ an . In the N@@ ame of Al@@ la@@ h , the most G@@ r@@ ac@@ ious , the most M@@ er@@ ci@@ ful ."
( En@@ gl@@ ish ) I was born in a middle clas@@ s family .
"My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a bus@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man ."
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a bo@@ y or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I gu@@ ess I was the lu@@ c@@ ky one .
My mother had 16 pre@@ g@@ nan@@ ci@@ es .
"F@@ rom 16 pre@@ g@@ nan@@ ci@@ es , five of us are al@@ ive ."
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
"D@@ a@@ y to day , I wat@@ ched women being car@@ ri@@ ed to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , or wat@@ ched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard ."
"A@@ t that time , when I fin@@ i@@ shed my high school , I really wanted to be a doc@@ tor ."
I wanted to be a doc@@ tor to help women and children .
"So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to uni@@ versity ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dor@@ mit@@ ory for girls , so I was ac@@ cep@@ ted in med@@ ical school , but I could not go there ."
"So as a resu@@ lt , my father sen@@ t me to America ."
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
"W@@ hi@@ le I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was inv@@ a@@ ded by R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
"And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country ."
"There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it ."
My family was in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"So as so@@ on as I comple@@ ted my education , I br@@ ought my family to America ."
I wanted them to be sa@@ fe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan .
"D@@ a@@ y after day , when I lis@@ ten@@ ed to the news , when I follo@@ wed what was going on with my country , my heart was bre@@ aking up ."
"I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me ."
I had a good job .
I was a pro@@ fe@@ s@@ s@@ or at a uni@@ versity .
I ear@@ ned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p .
"And when I went to the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan , there were 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es . 7@@ .@@ 5 million re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
"A@@ b@@ out 90 percent of them were women and children . M@@ ost of the men have been kill@@ ed or they were in war . And you know , in the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ,@@ "
"@@ when I went da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day to do a sur@@ ve@@ y , I found things you never could imagine ."
I saw a wi@@ do@@ w with five to e@@ ight children sitting there and wee@@ ping and not kno@@ wing what to do .
"I saw a young woman have no way to go any@@ where , no education , no en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , no place to even live ."
"I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supp@@ or@@ ting the family as a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ 1@@ 2@@ -@@ year old bo@@ y — being the head of the hou@@ se@@ hold , trying to prote@@ ct their sis@@ ter and their mother and their children ."
So it was a very dev@@ a@@ st@@ ating s@@ itu@@ ation .
"My heart was be@@ ating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do ."
"A@@ t that moment , we talk about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m ."
"A@@ t that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?"
How could I help these people ?
I am one individu@@ al . What can I do for them ?
"But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life ."
It trans@@ for@@ med me . It gave me st@@ at@@ us .
It gave me con@@ f@@ idence . It gave me a care@@ er .
"It hel@@ p@@ ed me to supp@@ ort my family , to bring my family to another country , to be sa@@ fe ."
"And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after ."
But do you think it was easy ?
"@@ No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for girls , completely ."
"And also , by R@@ us@@ si@@ a inv@@ ad@@ ing A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan , people were not tr@@ us@@ ting any@@ one ."
"It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; W@@ ho am I ?"
S@@ ome@@ body who comes from the United States .
S@@ ome@@ body who got e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted here .
D@@ id they tr@@ ust me ? O@@ f course not .
So I really needed to build the tr@@ ust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and sur@@ ve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
"F@@ in@@ ally , I found one man ."
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
"I went to his tent in the cam@@ p , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teach@@ er . &quot;"
"And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y woman , cra@@ z@@ y woman , how do you think I can be a teach@@ er ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; F@@ in@@ ally , he ac@@ cep@@ ted my off@@ er , and once I started a clas@@ s in his comp@@ ound , the word spre@@ ad all over ."
"In a matter of one year , we had 25 s@@ cho@@ ols set up , 1@@ 5@@ ,000 children going to school , and it was amazing ."
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
"But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were gi@@ ving teach@@ er tra@@ ining . We were tra@@ ining women &apos;s r@@ ights , human r@@ ights , demo@@ cr@@ acy , ru@@ le of la@@ w . We were gi@@ ving all kinds of tra@@ ining . And one day , I tell you ,@@ "
"@@ one day I was in the off@@ ice in Pe@@ sha@@ war , P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ d@@ den , I saw my sta@@ ff run@@ ning to ro@@ om@@ s and loc@@ king the do@@ ors and telling me , &quot; &quot; R@@ un away , hi@@ de ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a lea@@ der , what do you do ?"
You &apos;re sc@@ ar@@ ed . You know it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous .
You know your life is on the line .
"But as a lea@@ der , you have to hold it together ."
You have to hold it together and show st@@ ren@@ g@@ th .
"So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were p@@ our@@ ing into my off@@ ice ."
So I inv@@ ited them to the off@@ ice .
"They came , and there were nin@@ e of them — nin@@ e T@@ ali@@ ban ."
They were the ug@@ li@@ est looking men you can ever see .
"( Laughter ) V@@ er@@ y me@@ an@@ -@@ looking people , black clo@@ the@@ s , black tur@@ ban , and they p@@ our into my off@@ ice ."
And I inv@@ ited them to have a se@@ at and have te@@ a .
They said no . They are not going to d@@ rin@@ k te@@ a .
"And of course , with the t@@ one of vo@@ ice they were using , it was very sc@@ ary , but I was really shak@@ ing up ."
"But also I was str@@ ong , ho@@ l@@ ding myself up ."
"And , of course , by that time , you know how I dre@@ ss — I dre@@ ss from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ ja@@ b ."
"The only thing you could see , my eyes ."
"They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?"
D@@ on &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for girls ?
"What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? W@@ here is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teach@@ ing girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody ."
"We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ or@@ an , H@@ o@@ ly B@@ ook ."
"And you know , K@@ or@@ an says that if you learn the H@@ o@@ ly B@@ ook , the woman , they can be a good wi@@ fe , and they can o@@ be@@ y their h@@ us@@ b@@ and . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started spe@@ aking P@@ a@@ sh@@ to ."
"They tal@@ ked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I o@@ ffe@@ red them te@@ a again , and they took a si@@ p and they left ."
"B@@ y that time , my sta@@ ff p@@ ou@@ red into my off@@ ice ."
They were sc@@ ar@@ ed to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t k@@ ill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y happy , and I was happy to be al@@ ive , of course ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ f course , I was happy to be al@@ ive ."
"But also , as we contin@@ u@@ ously gave tra@@ ining during the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ ban — of course during the T@@ ali@@ ban there is another story ."
"We went under@@ ground and we pro@@ v@@ ided education for 80 s@@ cho@@ ol@@ girls , 3@@ ,000 students under@@ ground , and contin@@ u@@ ously we tra@@ ined ."
"W@@ it@@ h the f@@ all of the T@@ ali@@ ban , we went into the country , and we open@@ ed school after school ."
We open@@ ed women &apos;s learning cen@@ ter .
We contin@@ u@@ ously open@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ics .
We worked with mo@@ thers and children .
We had re@@ produc@@ tive health tra@@ ining .
We had all kinds of tra@@ ining that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was de@@ l@@ igh@@ ted with the out@@ come of my work .
"And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up nor@@ th of K@@ a@@ bu@@ l , and all of a su@@ d@@ den , again , I was sto@@ pped in the middle of the ro@@ ad by 1@@ 9 young men ."
"@@ R@@ i@@ f@@ les on their shou@@ l@@ ders , they b@@ loc@@ ked the ro@@ ad ."
"And I told my dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the dri@@ ver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you ."
"What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing . &quot; &quot; They called my name ."
"And by that time , the women are ye@@ lling and scre@@ am@@ ing inside the car ."
"I am very shak@@ en up , and I told myself , this is it ."
"This time , we all are going to be kill@@ ed ."
There is no dou@@ b@@ t in my mind .
"But still , the moment comes , and you take st@@ ren@@ g@@ th from whatever you believe and whatever you do ."
It &apos;s in your heart .
"You believe in your wor@@ th , and you can walk on it ."
So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
"My le@@ g was shak@@ ing , and I got outside ."
"And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?"
"They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are ."
We know where you are going .
E@@ very day you go up nor@@ th here and there .
"You tra@@ in women , you te@@ ach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job ."
"You build their s@@ kill@@ s . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?"
"What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK ."
"The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and k@@ ill ."
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
"It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course ."
"So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I wal@@ ked into the car , I s@@ it in the car , and I told the dri@@ ver , &quot; &quot; T@@ ur@@ n around and go back to the off@@ ice . &quot; &quot; A@@ t that time , we only were supp@@ or@@ ting girls ."
"We only had money for women to tra@@ in them , to se@@ nd them to school , and nothing else ."
"B@@ y the time I came to the off@@ ice , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were gone ."
They ran away home . N@@ ob@@ o@@ dy sta@@ yed there .
"My bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my vo@@ ice was completely gone ."
"I was shak@@ en up , and I s@@ at on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to sol@@ ve this problem ?"
Because we had tra@@ ining going on up nor@@ th already .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of women were there coming to get tra@@ ining .
"So I was sitting there , all of a su@@ d@@ den , at this moment , talking about mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful don@@ ors called me about a re@@ por@@ t ."
"And she asked me , &quot; &quot; S@@ ak@@ en@@ a ? &quot; &quot; And I ans@@ we@@ red her ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing . &quot; &quot; I tried to co@@ ver ."
"@@ No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again ."
"&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;"
I told her the whole story .
"A@@ t that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them ."
"You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same rou@@ te , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back fur@@ ther , the same young men , standing up there and ho@@ l@@ ding the ri@@ f@@ le and poin@@ ting to us to stop the car ."
So we sto@@ pped the car .
"I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n one con@@ d@@ ition , that whatever I say , you ac@@ cept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , y@@ es , they do ."
"So I took them to the mos@@ qu@@ e , and to make a long story sh@@ ort , I told them I &apos;d give them teach@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers ."
"They learn En@@ gl@@ ish , they learn how to be teach@@ ers , they learn compu@@ ters , and they are my gu@@ ide@@ s ."
"E@@ very area that is un@@ known to us in the m@@ oun@@ tain areas , they go with me . They are a@@ head , and we go ."
And they prote@@ ct us .

That te@@ lls you that education trans@@ for@@ ms people .
"When you educ@@ ate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gen@@ der equ@@ ality ."
"We cannot only tra@@ in women but for@@ get about the men , because the men are the real people who are gi@@ ving women the har@@ de@@ st time ."
"( Laughter ) So we started tra@@ ining men because the men should know the poten@@ tial of women , know how much these poten@@ tial men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing ."
"So we are contin@@ u@@ ously gi@@ ving tra@@ ining to men , and I really believe str@@ on@@ g@@ ly ."
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
"It was a beautiful country , beautiful , pe@@ ace@@ ful country ."
We were going every@@ where .
"W@@ om@@ en were getting education : la@@ w@@ y@@ er , engine@@ er , teach@@ er , and we were going from house to house ."
We never loc@@ ked our do@@ ors .
But you know what happened to my country .
"T@@ o@@ day , people cannot walk out of their do@@ or without se@@ cur@@ ity issu@@ es ."
But we want the same A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
"T@@ o@@ day , the women of A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan are working very , very hard ."
They are ear@@ ning de@@ gre@@ es . They are tra@@ ining to be la@@ w@@ y@@ ers .
"They are tra@@ ining to be doc@@ tors , back again ."
"They are tra@@ ining to be teach@@ ers , and they are run@@ ning bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses ."
"So it is so wonderful to see people like that re@@ ach their comple@@ te poten@@ tial , and all of this is going to happen ."
"If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ish ."

"This is where I live . I live in K@@ en@@ ya , at the sou@@ th parts of the N@@ air@@ obi N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k ."
"Th@@ ose are my da@@ d &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ air@@ obi N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k ."
"N@@ air@@ obi N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k is not f@@ en@@ ced in the sou@@ th w@@ ide@@ ly , which means w@@ il@@ d animals like ze@@ bra@@ s mig@@ r@@ ate out of the par@@ k f@@ ree@@ ly ."
"So pre@@ dat@@ ors like lions fol@@ low them , and this is what they do ."
They k@@ ill our li@@ v@@ es@@ to@@ ck .
"This is one of the co@@ ws which was kill@@ ed at night , and I just wok@@ e up in the mor@@ ning and I found it de@@ ad , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had ."
"My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from he@@ a@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we val@@ ue them so much ."
So I gre@@ w up h@@ ating lions so much .
"The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prote@@ ct our community and the li@@ v@@ es@@ to@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem ."
So they k@@ ill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were kill@@ ed in N@@ air@@ obi .
And I think this is why the N@@ air@@ obi N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k lions are few .
"So a bo@@ y , from six to nin@@ e years old , in my community is respon@@ sible for his da@@ d &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me ."
So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem .
"And the first idea I got was to use fir@@ e , because I thought lions were sc@@ ar@@ ed of fir@@ e ."
"But I came to realiz@@ e that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even hel@@ ping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed ."
So I didn &apos;t give up . I contin@@ u@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a sc@@ are@@ c@@ row .
I was trying to tr@@ ick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing ne@@ ar the co@@ w@@ shed .
"But lions are very cle@@ ver . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the sc@@ are@@ c@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he j@@ um@@ ps in and kill@@ s the animals ."
"So one night , I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come ."
And I disco@@ vered that lions are af@@ ra@@ id of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
"S@@ ince I was a small bo@@ y , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took ap@@ art my mo@@ m &apos;s new ra@@ di@@ o , and that day she almost kill@@ ed me , but I learned a lot about electr@@ on@@ ics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y , an in@@ dic@@ ator box . It &apos;s a small dev@@ ice found in a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle , and it hel@@ ps mot@@ or@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks ."
"And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the l@@ ights , on and off ."
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a br@@ ok@@ en f@@ la@@ sh@@ light .
So I set up everything .
"As you can see , the sol@@ ar pan@@ el char@@ ges the bat@@ ter@@ y , and the bat@@ ter@@ y supp@@ lies the power to the small in@@ dic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ for@@ mer ."
And the in@@ dic@@ ator box makes the l@@ ights fl@@ as@@ h .
"As you can see , the bu@@ l@@ b@@ s face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from ."
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
"The l@@ ights fl@@ as@@ h and tr@@ ick the lions into thinking I was wal@@ king around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was s@@ le@@ e@@ ping in my bed ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks .
"So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experi@@ en@@ ced any problem with lions ."
And my ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing h@@ om@@ es heard about this idea .
One of them was this gr@@ and@@ mother .
"S@@ he had a lot of her animals being kill@@ ed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the l@@ ights for her ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the l@@ ights . You can see at the back , those are the l@@ ion l@@ ights ."
"S@@ ince now , I &apos;ve set up seven h@@ om@@ es around my community , and they &apos;re really working ."
"And my idea is also being used now all over K@@ en@@ ya for sc@@ ar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ p@@ han@@ ts away from people &apos;s far@@ ms ."
"Because of this inven@@ tion , I was lu@@ c@@ ky to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best s@@ cho@@ ols in K@@ en@@ ya , B@@ ro@@ ok@@ house Inter@@ national S@@ ch@@ ool , and I &apos;m really exc@@ ited about this ."
My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and cre@@ ating an a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing the l@@ ights to the h@@ om@@ es which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teach@@ ing them how to put them ."
"So one year ago , I was just a bo@@ y in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ na gr@@ as@@ s@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside ."
And here I am today .
I got a chan@@ ce to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED .
So my big dre@@ am is to become an air@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and p@@ il@@ ot when I grow up .
"I used to h@@ ate lions , but now because my inven@@ tion is sa@@ ving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to sta@@ y with the lions without any con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t ."

There was a pro@@ gram on T@@ V about j@@ ob@@ s most kids don &apos;t know about .

An@@ ima@@ tion and art has always been my first love .
"It was my love for technology that s@@ par@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ic@@ ious D@@ i@@ sh@@ es . &quot; &quot; There was a v@@ iru@@ s on my computer , and I was trying to get ri@@ d of it , and all of a su@@ d@@ den , I just thought , what if v@@ iru@@ ses have their own little world inside the computer ?"

That started my love for technology .
"I built my first we@@ b@@ s@@ ite myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ c@@ ri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ th@@ on ."
I &apos;m also working on an anima@@ ted seri@@ es called &quot; &quot; The P@@ ol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about be@@ es and other pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
"If plan@@ ts ar@@ en &apos;t pol@@ l@@ ina@@ ted by the pol@@ lin@@ at@@ ors , then all cre@@ at@@ ures , inclu@@ ding ourselves , that de@@ p@@ end on these plan@@ ts , would star@@ ve ."

"( Mus@@ ic ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my anima@@ tions start with ideas , but what are ideas ?"
I@@ de@@ as can s@@ par@@ k a movement .

"If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , me@@ dic@@ ine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives ."
"A@@ t e@@ ight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Ma@@ ya &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ pro@@ f@@ it , Ma@@ ya &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the P@@ lan@@ et ."
( Laughter ) And I make e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly clo@@ thing and ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies .
"I &apos;m 1@@ 3 now , and al@@ though I started my business in 200@@ 8 , my art@@ is@@ tic jour@@ ney started way before then ."
"I was gre@@ at@@ ly inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by art , and I wanted to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate it in everything I did , even my business ."
"I would find different f@@ ab@@ r@@ ics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a sc@@ ar@@ f or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for desig@@ ns ."
"I not@@ ic@@ ed when I wor@@ e my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; W@@ ow , that &apos;s really cu@@ te . W@@ here can I get one ? &quot;"
"And I thought , I can start my own business ."
Now I didn &apos;t have any business pl@@ ans at only e@@ ight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were sa@@ fe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
"My mo@@ m ta@@ ught me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would s@@ it and make little he@@ ad@@ ban@@ ds out of ri@@ b@@ bon , and I would write down the nam@@ es and the pr@@ ice of each ite@@ m ."

"Th@@ en one day , F@@ or@@ bes ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine con@@ ta@@ cted me when I was 10 years old ."
( Laughter ) They wanted to fe@@ ature me and my company in their ar@@ tic@@ le .
"Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly ?"
I &apos;ve had a pas@@ sion for prote@@ c@@ ting the environment and its cre@@ at@@ ures since I was little .
My parents ta@@ ught me at an early age about gi@@ ving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
"I heard about how the d@@ y@@ es in some clo@@ thing or the process of even making the ite@@ ms was har@@ m@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I disco@@ vered that even after d@@ ye@@ ing has being comple@@ ted , there is a was@@ te issue that gi@@ ves a ne@@ g@@ ative imp@@ act on the environment ."
"For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of materi@@ als , or the d@@ um@@ ping of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materi@@ als ."
"These ac@@ tions can pol@@ lu@@ te the air , making it to@@ x@@ ic to any@@ one or anything that in@@ ha@@ les it ."
"So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my ite@@ ms had to be e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly , and 10 to 20 percent of the pro@@ f@@ its I made went to local and global char@@ ities and environ@@ mental organiz@@ ations ."
"( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wa@@ ve of ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s that not only see@@ ks to have a suc@@ cess@@ ful business , but also a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able future ."

"We live in a big , di@@ verse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate to sa@@ ve it ."
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your he@@ ads about the things that are happening in our world .
"It takes to get it through your he@@ ar@@ ts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when mo@@ ve@@ ments are s@@ par@@ ked ."
"That is when opportun@@ ities and innov@@ ation are created , and that is why ideas come to life ."

( Laughter ) F@@ ee@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ shing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ ap@@ s .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ bes , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite norma@@ l ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ shing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between inside and outside .
So it means basically this arch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qu@@ i@@ et box , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to sta@@ y in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back ev@@ en@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion , usu@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we conside@@ r no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ e@@ p better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ e@@ p in a qu@@ i@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the jun@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y ba@@ r ."
You are not supp@@ o@@ sed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of ."
You never me@@ lt in ra@@ in .
"So , children are supp@@ o@@ sed to be outside ."
So that is how we should tre@@ at them .
This is how they divi@@ de clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are supp@@ o@@ sed to help teach@@ ers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And a wa@@ sh@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ key trying to fish another mon@@ key from ab@@ o@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at least one s@@ ky@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ ta C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to conside@@ r sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a da@@ ughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s oka@@ y . H@@ is s@@ ku@@ ll is quite str@@ ong .
He is res@@ il@@ i@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ f@@ fic j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ yo , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of dan@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce of this building is 18@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the sur@@ pr@@ ise is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on a@@ verage ."
And these children have the hig@@ he@@ st a@@ th@@ le@@ tic ab@@ il@@ ities am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
Just like sh@@ ee@@ p . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prote@@ ct them too much , and they need to t@@ um@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
"I think arch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture is cap@@ able of chan@@ ging this world , and people &apos;s lives ."
And this is one of the atte@@ m@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Here are some images of cl@@ us@@ ters of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
"They are these huge collec@@ tions of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies , b@@ ound together by their mu@@ tual gra@@ v@@ ity ."
"So most of the poin@@ ts that you see on the scre@@ en are not individu@@ al st@@ ars , but collec@@ tions of st@@ ars , or g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"Now , by sho@@ wing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are these beautiful ob@@ jects , but more than that , I think g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous , they are sur@@ pris@@ ing , and they &apos;re u@@ se@@ ful ."
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most mas@@ sive lab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
"And as lab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies , to descri@@ be g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters is to descri@@ be the experim@@ ents that you can do with them ."
"And I think there are four maj@@ or typ@@ es , and the first typ@@ e that I want to descri@@ be is prob@@ ing the very big ."
"So , how big ?"
"Well , here is an image of a particular g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ter ."
"It is so mas@@ sive that the light pas@@ sing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being dis@@ tor@@ ted by the extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of this cl@@ us@@ ter ."
"And , in fact , if you look very care@@ fully you &apos;ll be able to see rin@@ gs around this cl@@ us@@ ter ."
"Now , to give you a number , this particular g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ter has a ma@@ ss of over one million billion su@@ ns ."
It &apos;s just min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing how mas@@ sive these systems can get .
"But more than their ma@@ ss , they have this ad@@ diti@@ onal fe@@ ature ."
"They are essen@@ ti@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sion of the entire universe ."
"And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large sc@@ al@@ es , such as , how does gra@@ v@@ ity work ?"
might be ans@@ we@@ red by stu@@ d@@ ying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very ho@@ t .
"O@@ kay , if I take an image of a g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ter , and I sub@@ tr@@ act away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blu@@ e blo@@ b ."
This is in f@@ al@@ se col@@ or .
It &apos;s actually X@@ -@@ ra@@ y light that we &apos;re seeing .
"And the question is , if it &apos;s not g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies , what is em@@ it@@ ting this light ?"
"The answer is ho@@ t ga@@ s , mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e ga@@ s — in fact , it &apos;s pl@@ as@@ ma ."
And the reason why it &apos;s so ho@@ t goes back to the pre@@ vi@@ ous s@@ li@@ de .
"The extre@@ me gra@@ v@@ ity of these systems is ac@@ ce@@ l@@ er@@ ating partic@@ les of ga@@ s to great spe@@ e@@ ds , and great spe@@ e@@ ds means great tem@@ per@@ at@@ ures ."
"So this is the ma@@ in idea , but science is a r@@ ough dra@@ ft ."
"There are many bas@@ ic pro@@ per@@ ties about this pl@@ as@@ ma that still con@@ f@@ use us , still pu@@ z@@ z@@ le us , and still p@@ us@@ h our under@@ standing of the phys@@ ics of the very ho@@ t ."
Th@@ ird thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
"Now , to expla@@ in this , I need to tell you a very dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing fact ."
M@@ ost of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of at@@ om@@ s .
You were li@@ ed to .
"M@@ ost of it is made up of something very , very my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous , which we call dar@@ k matter ."
"D@@ ar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to inter@@ act very much , ex@@ cept through gra@@ v@@ ity , and of course we would like to learn more about it ."
"If you &apos;re a partic@@ le phys@@ ic@@ ist , you want to know what happens when we s@@ mas@@ h things together ."
And dar@@ k matter is no ex@@ cep@@ tion .
"Well , how do we do this ?"
"T@@ o answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters col@@ li@@ de ?"
Here is an image .
"S@@ ince g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are re@@ presen@@ t@@ ative sl@@ ices of the universe , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions ."
"They are mos@@ tly made up of dar@@ k matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this blu@@ ish pur@@ ple ."
"The red re@@ presen@@ ts the ho@@ t ga@@ s , and , of course , you can see many g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"What &apos;s happened is a partic@@ le ac@@ ce@@ l@@ er@@ ator at a huge , huge scale ."
"And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effe@@ cts that might be difficult to de@@ te@@ ct in the la@@ b , might be comp@@ oun@@ ded and comp@@ oun@@ ded into something that we could possi@@ bly ob@@ ser@@ ve in nature ."
"So , it &apos;s very fun@@ n@@ y ."
"The reason why g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters can te@@ ach us about dar@@ k matter , the reason why g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters can te@@ ach us about the phys@@ ics of the very small , is pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because they are so very big ."
F@@ our@@ th thing : the phys@@ ics of the very st@@ range .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is cra@@ z@@ y .
"O@@ kay , if there &apos;s anything st@@ ran@@ ger I think it has to be dar@@ k energy ."
"If I th@@ row a b@@ all into the air , I expe@@ ct it to go up ."
What I don &apos;t expe@@ ct is that it go up at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , cos@@ mo@@ log@@ ists understand why the universe is ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ ding at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ incre@@ as@@ ing r@@ ate .
"They give the cause of this ac@@ ce@@ l@@ er@@ ated ex@@ p@@ ans@@ ion a name , and they call it dar@@ k energy ."
"And , again , we want to learn more about it ."
"So , one particular question that we have is , how does dar@@ k energy a@@ ffe@@ ct the universe at the lar@@ gest sc@@ al@@ es ?"
"D@@ e@@ pen@@ ding on how str@@ ong it is , maybe structure for@@ ms fas@@ ter or s@@ lo@@ wer ."
"Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ bly com@@ plic@@ ated ."
Here is a computer sim@@ ulation .
And we need a way to simp@@ li@@ f@@ y it .
"Well , I like to think about this using an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy ."
"If I want to understand the s@@ in@@ king of the T@@ itan@@ ic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little pos@@ iti@@ ons of every single little piece of the bo@@ at that br@@ oke off ."
The most important thing to do is to tr@@ ack the two big@@ gest parts .
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the lar@@ gest sc@@ al@@ es by trac@@ king its big@@ gest pie@@ ces and those big@@ gest pie@@ ces are cl@@ us@@ ters of g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ ies ."
"So , as I come to a close , you might feel sl@@ igh@@ tly che@@ ated ."
"I mean , I began by talking about how g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y cl@@ us@@ ters are u@@ se@@ ful , and I &apos;ve given some reas@@ ons , but what is their use really ?"
"Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quot@@ e by H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d when he was asked about c@@ ars ."
"He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said fas@@ ter hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day , we as a society are fac@@ ed with many , many difficult problems ."
And the solu@@ tions to these problems are not obvi@@ ous .
They are not fas@@ ter hor@@ ses .
They will requ@@ ire an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of sci@@ enti@@ fic in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity .
"So , y@@ es , we need to foc@@ us , y@@ es , we need to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate , but we also need to remember that innov@@ ation , in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , insp@@ ir@@ ation — these things come when we bro@@ a@@ den our field of vision when we step back when we z@@ oo@@ m out ."
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by stu@@ d@@ ying the universe around us . Th@@ an@@ ks .

You &apos;re not making the face .

That &apos;s the s@@ itu@@ ation .
A@@ B : P@@ i ?
Because without a decis@@ ion we &apos;re left power@@ less .

"@@ Goo@@ d , now what is this that I &apos;m plan@@ ting ?"

"T@@ en years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life ."
"A@@ t the time , I was car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ aliz@@ ing in car@@ di@@ a@@ c ima@@ ging tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es ."
The call came from a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o .
A@@ n el@@ der@@ ly fe@@ ma@@ le ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ e had wok@@ en up with a fac@@ i@@ al dro@@ o@@ p and the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were wor@@ ri@@ ed that she &apos;d had a str@@ oke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the z@@ o@@ o and image the anima@@ l &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ di@@ a@@ c cause .
"Now , to be clear , Nor@@ th American z@@ oo@@ s are sta@@ f@@ f@@ ed by high@@ ly qu@@ ali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their anima@@ l patients ."
"But oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally , they do re@@ ach into the human med@@ ical community , partic@@ ul@@ arly for some speci@@ ality con@@ su@@ l@@ tation , and I was one of the lu@@ c@@ ky phys@@ ic@@ ians who was inv@@ ited in to help ."
"I had a chan@@ ce to ru@@ le out a str@@ oke in this ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ e and make sure that this gor@@ ill@@ a didn &apos;t have a tor@@ n a@@ or@@ ta , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate this ma@@ ca@@ w for a heart mur@@ mu@@ r , make sure that this C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a se@@ a l@@ ion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ di@@ um wasn &apos;t in@@ fl@@ am@@ ed , and in this picture , I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing to the heart of a l@@ ion after a li@@ fe@@ sa@@ ving , col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans and phys@@ ic@@ ians where we dra@@ ined 7@@ 00 c@@ c &apos;s of f@@ lu@@ id from the sa@@ c in which this l@@ ion &apos;s heart was con@@ tain@@ ed ."
"And this pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure , which I have done on many human patients , was iden@@ tical , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of that pa@@ w and that tai@@ l ."
"Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter with phys@@ ic@@ ians , dis@@ cus@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ no@@ ses and tre@@ at@@ ments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o with ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , dis@@ cus@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s and di@@ ag@@ no@@ ses and tre@@ at@@ ments for their anima@@ l patients ."
"And oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ oun@@ ds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter and at the L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Z@@ o@@ o ."
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear foc@@ us for me .
"P@@ h@@ ys@@ ic@@ ians and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were essen@@ ti@@ ally taking care of the same dis@@ or@@ ders in their anima@@ l and human patients : con@@ ge@@ st@@ ive heart fail@@ ure , brain t@@ um@@ ors , le@@ uke@@ mi@@ a , di@@ a@@ be@@ tes , ar@@ thr@@ it@@ is , A@@ L@@ S , bre@@ ast cancer , even psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ es like de@@ pres@@ sion , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , comp@@ ul@@ sions , e@@ ating dis@@ or@@ ders and self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ."
"Now , I &apos;ve got a con@@ fe@@ s@@ sion to make ."
"E@@ ven though I stu@@ died com@@ par@@ ative ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy and ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary bio@@ logy as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even writ@@ ten my se@@ ni@@ or the@@ s@@ is on D@@ ar@@ win@@ ian the@@ ory — learning about the sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant over@@ la@@ p between the dis@@ or@@ ders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wake@@ -@@ up call for me ."
"So I started wonder@@ ing , with all of these over@@ l@@ ap@@ s , how was it that I had never thought to ask a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an , or con@@ su@@ lt the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary liter@@ ature , for in@@ s@@ ights into one of my human patients ?"
"W@@ hy had I never , no@@ r had any of my phys@@ ic@@ ian friends and col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es wh@@ om I asked , ever atten@@ ded a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce ?"
"For that matter , why was any of this a sur@@ pr@@ ise ?"
"I mean , look , every single phys@@ ic@@ ian ac@@ cep@@ ts some bio@@ logical conne@@ ction between animals and humans ."
E@@ very me@@ dic@@ ation that we pre@@ scri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our famil@@ ies has first been te@@ sted on an anima@@ l .
But there &apos;s something very different about gi@@ ving an anima@@ l a me@@ dic@@ ation or a human disease and the anima@@ l develop@@ ing con@@ ge@@ st@@ ive heart fail@@ ure or di@@ a@@ be@@ tes or bre@@ ast cancer on their own .
"Now , maybe some of the sur@@ pr@@ ise comes from the incre@@ as@@ ing se@@ par@@ ation in our world between the ur@@ ban and the non@@ ur@@ ban ."
"You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ o@@ l gro@@ ws on tre@@ es or that che@@ ese comes from a plant ."
"Well , today &apos;s human hos@@ p@@ it@@ als , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly , are tur@@ ning into these g@@ le@@ am@@ ing ca@@ the@@ d@@ r@@ als of technology ."
And this cre@@ ates a psy@@ cho@@ logical dis@@ tan@@ ce between the human patients who are being tre@@ ated there and anima@@ l patients who are living in oce@@ ans and far@@ ms and jun@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even dee@@ per reason .
"P@@ h@@ ys@@ ic@@ ians and scientists , we ac@@ cept inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tually that our species , H@@ omo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , is me@@ rely one species , no more uni@@ qu@@ e or speci@@ al than any other ."
"But in our he@@ ar@@ ts , we don &apos;t completely believe that ."
I feel it myself when I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing to M@@ o@@ z@@ art or looking at pic@@ tures of the M@@ ars R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ ook .
"I feel that tu@@ g of human ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , even as I recogni@@ ze the sci@@ enti@@ fic@@ ally is@@ ol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ i@@ or species , ap@@ art ."
"Well , I &apos;m trying these days ."
"When I see a human pati@@ ent now , I always ask , what do the anima@@ l doc@@ tors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?"
"And , might I be taking better care of my human pati@@ ent if I saw them as a human anima@@ l pati@@ ent ?"
Here are a few exam@@ ples of the kind of exc@@ iting conne@@ c@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart fail@@ ure .
"A@@ r@@ ound the year 20@@ 00 , human car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ists &quot; &quot; disco@@ vered &quot; &quot; emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed heart fail@@ ure ."
"It was descri@@ bed in a ga@@ m@@ bl@@ ing father who had lost his life &apos;s sa@@ v@@ ings with a ro@@ ll of the d@@ ice , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter ."
"But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is was ne@@ i@@ ther new , no@@ r was it uni@@ qu@@ e@@ ly human ."
"@@ V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing , tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally in@@ duc@@ ed sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s in animals ran@@ ging from mon@@ ke@@ ys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , from to de@@ er to r@@ ab@@ b@@ its , since the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
How many human lives might have been sa@@ ved if this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ists ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ in@@ j@@ ury .
S@@ ome human patients har@@ m themselves .
"S@@ ome pl@@ u@@ ck out pat@@ ches of ha@@ ir , others actually c@@ ut themselves ."
There are st@@ al@@ lions that re@@ pe@@ t@@ iti@@ vely b@@ ite their f@@ lan@@ ks until they b@@ le@@ ed .
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very speci@@ fic and very effe@@ ctive ways of tre@@ ating and even pre@@ ven@@ ting self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury in their self-@@ in@@ j@@ uring animals .
S@@ hou@@ ldn &apos;t this ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary knowledge be put into the hands of psy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ ists and parents and patients stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with self-@@ in@@ j@@ ury ?
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m psy@@ ch@@ os@@ is .
"S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , some women become de@@ pres@@ sed , and sometimes they become seri@@ ously de@@ pres@@ sed and even psy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ic ."
"They may ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct their ne@@ w@@ born , and in some extre@@ me ca@@ ses , even har@@ m the child ."
"E@@ qu@@ ine ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally , a m@@ are , so@@ on after gi@@ ving bir@@ th , will ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct the fo@@ al , re@@ f@@ using to n@@ ur@@ se , and in some in@@ stan@@ ces , k@@ ick the fo@@ al , even to death ."
But ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vi@@ sed an inter@@ ven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ je@@ ction sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome that inv@@ ol@@ ves incre@@ as@@ ing o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in the m@@ are .
"O@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in is the b@@ on@@ ding hor@@ mon@@ e , and this lea@@ ds to re@@ ne@@ wed intere@@ st , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al ."
S@@ hou@@ ldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / g@@ y@@ n &apos;s and family doc@@ tors and patients who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with pos@@ t@@ par@@ tu@@ m de@@ pres@@ sion and psy@@ ch@@ os@@ is ?

"T@@ o expla@@ in it , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to have to air some d@@ ir@@ ty la@@ un@@ d@@ ry ."

"O@@ f course , most phys@@ ic@@ ians don &apos;t realiz@@ e that it is har@@ der to get into ve@@ t school these days than med@@ ical school , and that when we go to med@@ ical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , H@@ omo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in mam@@ ma@@ ls , am@@ p@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ p@@ t@@ il@@ es , fish and bir@@ ds ."
So I don &apos;t bl@@ ame the ve@@ ts for feel@@ ing an@@ no@@ yed by my pro@@ fe@@ s@@ sion &apos;s con@@ de@@ sc@@ en@@ sion and ig@@ nor@@ ance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an who can only take care of one species ?
"A phys@@ ic@@ ian .

C@@ an ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c information make you heal@@ thy ?
In 200@@ 1 I got h@@ it by a tra@@ in .
My tra@@ in was a heart atta@@ ck .
"I found myself in a hos@@ p@@ ital in an in@@ ten@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ care ward , rec@@ u@@ per@@ ating from em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy sur@@ ger@@ y ."
And I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly realized something : that I was completely in the dar@@ k .
"I started as@@ king my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;"
&quot; C@@ ou@@ ld my doc@@ tor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
"So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the for@@ mul@@ a for life and good health ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e@@ tics , li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le and environment ."
"That &apos;s going to sort of con@@ tain our ris@@ ks , and if we man@@ age those ris@@ ks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good heal@@ thy life ."
"Well , I understand the gen@@ e@@ tics and li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le part ."
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my phys@@ ic@@ ians con@@ stan@@ tly ask me questions about this .
"H@@ a@@ ve you ever had to f@@ ill out those long , le@@ g@@ al@@ -@@ size for@@ ms in your doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice ?"
"I mean , if you &apos;re lu@@ c@@ ky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?"
"( Laughter ) D@@ o it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le and your family history , your me@@ dic@@ ation history , your sur@@ g@@ ical history , your all@@ er@@ gy history ... did I for@@ get any history ?"
"But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my phys@@ ic@@ ians really get this part of the equ@@ ation ."
"What does that mean , my environment ?"
"Well , it can mean a lot of things ."
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
W@@ hi@@ le I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you li@@ ved ?
"@@ Just think about that , you know , wan@@ der through your life thinking about this ."
And you realiz@@ e that you spend it in a vari@@ ety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
"And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an air@@ plan@@ e a good por@@ tion of your time tra@@ ve@@ ling some place ."
"So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; &quot; W@@ here do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?"
"And where do you ex@@ p@@ ose your@@ selves to ris@@ ks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion that I spend about 7@@ 5 percent of my time rel@@ ati@@ vely in a small number of places ."
"And I don &apos;t wan@@ der far from that place for a maj@@ or@@ ity of my time , even though I &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker ."
"Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little jour@@ ney here ."
"I started off in S@@ c@@ ran@@ ton , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia ."
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ body might hai@@ l from nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia , but this is where I spent my first 1@@ 9 years with my little young l@@ un@@ gs ."
"You know , bre@@ a@@ thing high con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ations here of su@@ l@@ fu@@ r di@@ o@@ x@@ ide , car@@ bon di@@ o@@ x@@ ide and me@@ th@@ ane ga@@ s , in un@@ equ@@ al qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities — 1@@ 9 years of this ."
"And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those p@@ il@@ es of bur@@ ning , s@@ mo@@ l@@ der@@ ing co@@ al was@@ te look like ."
"So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid@@ -@@ we@@ st ."
"O@@ K , so I en@@ ded up in L@@ ou@@ is@@ vil@@ le , K@@ en@@ tu@@ c@@ ky ."
"Well , I decided to be ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s to a place called R@@ u@@ b@@ ber@@ to@@ wn ."
They man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture pla@@ st@@ ics . They use large qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities ch@@ l@@ or@@ op@@ ren@@ e and ben@@ zen@@ e .
"O@@ kay , I spent 25 years , in my mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ age l@@ un@@ gs now , bre@@ a@@ thing vari@@ ous con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ations of that ."
"And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it ."
It was in@@ si@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
"Th@@ en I decided I had to get really smar@@ t , I would take this job in the W@@ est C@@ o@@ ast ."
And I mo@@ ved to Re@@ d@@ lan@@ ds C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y n@@ ice , and there my ol@@ der , se@@ ni@@ or l@@ un@@ gs , as I like to call them , I f@@ ill@@ ed with partic@@ ul@@ ate matter , car@@ bon di@@ o@@ x@@ ide and very high do@@ ses of o@@ z@@ one ."
O@@ kay ? Al@@ most like the hig@@ he@@ st in the n@@ ation .
"A@@ l@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day ."
"If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about ."
"So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?"
"Well , the picture is , there is a huge ga@@ p here ."
The one thing that never happens in my doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice : They never ask me about my place history .
"@@ No doc@@ tor , can I remember , ever as@@ king me , &quot; W@@ here have you li@@ ved ? &quot;"
They ha@@ ven &apos;t asked me what kind of the qu@@ ality of the d@@ rin@@ king water that I put in my mou@@ th or the food that I in@@ gest into my sto@@ ma@@ ch .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s mis@@ sing .
L@@ ook at the kind of data that &apos;s av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend bil@@ lions of dollars inve@@ sting in this kind of research .
"Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ cl@@ ed the places where I &apos;ve been ."
"Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart atta@@ ck I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?"
"So , how many people are in the white ?"
How many people in the room have spent the maj@@ or@@ ity of their life in the white space ?
An@@ y@@ body ? B@@ o@@ y you &apos;re lu@@ c@@ ky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
"O@@ h , not so lu@@ c@@ ky ."
There are thousands of these kinds of ma@@ ps that are dis@@ pla@@ yed in at@@ la@@ ses all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
But n@@ one of that &apos;s in my med@@ ical recor@@ d .
And it &apos;s not in you@@ rs ei@@ ther .
"So , here &apos;s my friend P@@ au@@ l ."
"He &apos;s a col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e . He allo@@ wed his cell phone to be trac@@ ked every two hours , 2@@ 4 / 7 , 3@@ 6@@ 5 days out of the year for the last two years , every@@ where he went ."
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really stu@@ died that you might have some clu@@ es as to what P@@ au@@ l l@@ ik@@ es to do .
An@@ y@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ ki . Right .
"We can z@@ oo@@ m in here , and we su@@ d@@ den@@ ly see that now we see where P@@ au@@ l has really spent a maj@@ or@@ ity of his time ."
And all of those black d@@ ots are all of the to@@ x@@ ic re@@ lease inven@@ tor@@ ies that are mon@@ it@@ ore@@ d by the E@@ P@@ A .
D@@ id you know that data ex@@ is@@ ted ?
"For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ aliz@@ ed ma@@ p of that ."
"So , our cell p@@ hon@@ es can now build a place history ."
This is how P@@ au@@ l did it . He did it with his i@@ Ph@@ one .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the phys@@ ic@@ ian would have in front of him and her when we en@@ ter that ex@@ am room instead of just the p@@ in@@ k s@@ li@@ p that said I p@@ ai@@ d at the coun@@ ter . Right ?
This could be my little as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment .
"And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ a B@@ ill , I sug@@ gest that maybe you not de@@ ci@@ de , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , and it &apos;s war@@ m every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck at night ."
"I &apos;d sug@@ gest that that &apos;s a bad idea B@@ ill , because of this re@@ por@@ t . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions ."
"O@@ kay , number one is , we must te@@ ach phys@@ ic@@ ians about the val@@ ue of ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical information ."
It &apos;s called ge@@ ome@@ dic@@ ine . There are about a half a do@@ zen pro@@ gr@@ ams in the world right now that are foc@@ used on this .
And they &apos;re in the early sta@@ ges of develop@@ ment .
"These pro@@ gr@@ ams need to be supp@@ or@@ ted , and we need to te@@ ach our future doc@@ tors of the world the importan@@ ce of some of the information I &apos;ve shar@@ ed here with you today ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars all over the world building an electr@@ on@@ ic health recor@@ d , we make sure we put a place history inside that med@@ ical recor@@ d ."
It not only will be important for the phys@@ ic@@ ian ; it will be important for the re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers that now will have huge sam@@ ples to dra@@ w up@@ on .
But it will also be u@@ se@@ ful for us .
"I could have made the decis@@ ion , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ z@@ one cap@@ ital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decis@@ ion ."
O@@ r I could ne@@ got@@ i@@ ate with my em@@ plo@@ y@@ er to make that decis@@ ion in the best intere@@ st of myself and my company .
"W@@ it@@ h that , I would like to just say that J@@ ack L@@ or@@ d said this almost 10 years ago ."
Just look at that for a minu@@ te .
"That was what the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion of the D@@ art@@ mou@@ th A@@ t@@ l@@ as of H@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can expla@@ in the ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c vari@@ ations that oc@@ cu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in we@@ ll@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates ."
That was what he was talking about on that quot@@ e .
And I would say he got it right almost a deca@@ de ago .
"So , I &apos;d very much like to see us be@@ gin to really se@@ ize this as an opportunity to get this into our med@@ ical recor@@ ds ."
"So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : G@@ e@@ o@@ grap@@ hy always mat@@ ters ."
And I believe that ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c information can make both you and me very heal@@ thy . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an , China in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s ."
"When I was in the first gra@@ de , the government wanted to trans@@ fer me to a school for a@@ th@@ le@@ tes , all ex@@ pen@@ ses p@@ ai@@ d ."
"But my t@@ ig@@ er mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engine@@ er like them ."
"A@@ f@@ ter survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution , they fir@@ m@@ ly beli@@ ev@@ ed there &apos;s only one sure way to happ@@ iness : a sa@@ fe and we@@ ll@@ -@@ p@@ ai@@ d job ."
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dre@@ am was to become a Chin@@ ese op@@ era sing@@ er .
That is me pla@@ ying my ima@@ gin@@ ary pi@@ ano .
"A@@ n op@@ era sing@@ er must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ ro@@ bat@@ ics , so I tried everything I could to go to op@@ era school ."
I even wr@@ ote to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the h@@ ost of a ra@@ di@@ o show .
But no ad@@ ul@@ ts l@@ ik@@ ed the idea .
No ad@@ ul@@ ts beli@@ ev@@ ed I was seri@@ ous .
"O@@ n@@ ly my friends supp@@ or@@ ted me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was ."
"So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ ined ."
My dre@@ am would never come true .
I was af@@ ra@@ id that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ clas@@ s happ@@ iness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ f@@ air .
So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another call@@ ing .
N@@ ob@@ o@@ dy around to te@@ ach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to book@@ s .
I sat@@ is@@ fied my hun@@ ger for par@@ en@@ tal adv@@ ice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and mus@@ ic@@ ians . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ or@@ respon@@ den@@ ce in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou L@@ ei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ depen@@ den@@ t woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tra@@ d@@ ition requ@@ i@@ res o@@ be@@ dience . &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be ef@@ fici@@ ent from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ ap@@ er by the D@@ o@@ zen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was insp@@ i@@ red to study ab@@ ro@@ ad after read@@ ing these .
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ om@@ p@@ le@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( aka E@@ ch@@ o C@@ han ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ es@@ s@@ ons F@@ rom H@@ is@@ tory &quot; &quot; by N@@ an H@@ u@@ ai@@ jin &#93; I came to the U.S@@ . in 199@@ 5 , so which book@@ s did I read here first ?"
"B@@ ook@@ s ban@@ ned in China , of course ."
&quot; &quot; The Goo@@ d Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chin@@ ese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent for pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da . G@@ ot it .
"The B@@ i@@ ble is interesting , but st@@ range ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a to@@ p@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th com@@ man@@ d@@ ment gave me an e@@ pi@@ p@@ han@@ y : &quot; You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
"&quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it be@@ comes my too@@ l to cl@@ im@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relation@@ ship with my parents ."
En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing .
It off@@ ers many in@@ s@@ ights .
"For example , I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Chin@@ ese students gre@@ w up with ."
"It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the cen@@ ter of the world ."
A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es somebody &apos;s view .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a stan@@ dar@@ d pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c world .
There are even research fi@@ el@@ ds such as com@@ par@@ ative rel@@ ig@@ ion and com@@ par@@ ative liter@@ ature .
C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tr@@ ast gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ars a more comple@@ te under@@ standing of a to@@ p@@ ic .
"So I thought , well , if com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing works for research , why not do it in dai@@ ly life too ?"
So I started read@@ ing book@@ s in pa@@ ir@@ s .
"So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in F@@ ran@@ k@@ l@@ in &quot; &quot; by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n A@@ d@@ ams &quot; &quot; by D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are inv@@ olved in the same ev@@ ent , or friends with shar@@ ed experi@@ ences ."

And what I understand from my B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian friends is that this guy is just a c@@ li@@ ch@@ e machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting mat@@ ch by just sp@@ ou@@ ting c@@ li@@ ch@@ e again and again and again .
"So B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ians went to that first mat@@ ch against Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , put up this ban@@ ner , started a T@@ wit@@ ter cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and tried to con@@ v@@ ince the rest of us to t@@ we@@ et the ph@@ r@@ ase : &quot; &quot; C@@ al@@ a a bo@@ c@@ a , G@@ al@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so suc@@ cess@@ ful at this that it to@@ pped T@@ wit@@ ter for two weeks ."
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of les@@ s@@ ons that you can take from this .
"And the first les@@ son , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong as@@ king people to be ac@@ tive on@@ line , so long as ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m just means re@@ t@@ wee@@ ting a ph@@ r@@ ase ."
"So as long as ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with ."
"The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ians on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
"As far as national re@@ presen@@ tation , 11 percent of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian inter@@ net u@@ ser@@ s are on T@@ wit@@ ter ."
That &apos;s a much high@@ er number than in the U.S@@ . or U.@@ K@@ .
"N@@ ex@@ t to J@@ ap@@ an , it &apos;s the second most re@@ presen@@ ted by population ."
"Now if you &apos;re using T@@ wit@@ ter or other social net@@ works , and you didn &apos;t realiz@@ e this was a space with a lot of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ians in it , you &apos;re like most of us ."
Because what happens on a social net@@ work is you inter@@ act with the people that you have cho@@ sen to inter@@ act with .
"And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guy , you te@@ nd to inter@@ act with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guys ."
And you don &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly have the sense that T@@ wit@@ ter is in fact a very he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ ian space .
"It &apos;s also extre@@ me@@ ly sur@@ pris@@ ing to many Amer@@ ic@@ ans , a he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American space ."
T@@ wit@@ ter rec@@ ently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 2@@ 4 percent of American T@@ wit@@ ter u@@ ser@@ s are Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American .
That &apos;s about t@@ w@@ ice as high as Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ ans are re@@ presen@@ ted in the population .
"And again , that was very sho@@ c@@ king to many T@@ wit@@ ter u@@ ser@@ s , but it shou@@ ldn &apos;t be ."
And the reason it shou@@ ldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ ren@@ ding T@@ op@@ ics .
And you te@@ nd to find to@@ pic@@ s that are almost enti@@ rely Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American con@@ vers@@ ations .
"This was a vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation done by F@@ er@@ nan@@ do V@@ i@@ e@@ ga@@ s and M@@ art@@ in W@@ atten@@ ber@@ g , two amazing vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ ation desig@@ ners , who looked at a wee@@ ken@@ d &apos;s wor@@ th of T@@ wit@@ ter tra@@ f@@ fic and essen@@ ti@@ ally found that a lot of these t@@ ren@@ ding to@@ pic@@ s were basically se@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted con@@ vers@@ ations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expe@@ ct ."
"It turns out that oil sp@@ ill is a mos@@ tly white con@@ vers@@ ation , that co@@ ok@@ out is a mos@@ tly black con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"And what &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y about this is that if you wanted to mi@@ x up who you were seeing on T@@ wit@@ ter , it &apos;s liter@@ ally a qu@@ ick cl@@ ick away ."
"You cl@@ ick on that co@@ ok@@ out ta@@ g , there an enti@@ rely different con@@ vers@@ ation with different people partic@@ ip@@ ating in it ."
"But gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , most of us don &apos;t ."
"We end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es , as my friend E@@ l@@ i P@@ ari@@ ser call@@ s them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are sim@@ il@@ ar to the people we already know ."
And we te@@ nd not to see that w@@ ide@@ r picture .
"Now for me , I &apos;m sur@@ pri@@ sed by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the inter@@ net was supp@@ o@@ sed to be ."
"If you go back into the early days of the inter@@ net , when cy@@ ber@@ -@@ uto@@ pi@@ ans like N@@ ick N@@ e@@ gro@@ pon@@ te were wr@@ iting big book@@ s like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the predic@@ tion was that the inter@@ net was going to be an incredi@@ bly powerful force to s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h out cul@@ tur@@ al differen@@ ces , to put us all on a common field of one fa@@ shi@@ on or another ."
N@@ e@@ gro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build conne@@ c@@ tions in the world of at@@ om@@ s .
He &apos;s at a technology con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
"And he &apos;s looking at something really , tru@@ ly ab@@ sur@@ d , which is bot@@ t@@ les of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table ."
And N@@ e@@ gro@@ pon@@ te says this is cra@@ z@@ y .
This is the old economy .
"It &apos;s the economy of moving these he@@ av@@ y , s@@ low at@@ om@@ s over long dis@@ tan@@ ces that &apos;s very difficult to do ."
"We &apos;re he@@ ad@@ ing to the future of b@@ its , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s we@@ igh@@ t@@ less ."
It can be any@@ where in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
"Now , N@@ e@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things ."
He &apos;s tot@@ ally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many ca@@ ses at@@ om@@ s are much more mo@@ bi@@ le than b@@ its .
"If I walk into a st@@ ore in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to bu@@ y water that &apos;s bot@@ t@@ led in F@@ i@@ ji , shipp@@ ed at great ex@@ pen@@ se to the United States ."
It &apos;s actually sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly hard for me to see a F@@ i@@ ji@@ an fe@@ ature fil@@ m .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to lis@@ ten to F@@ i@@ ji@@ an music .
"It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly difficult for me to get F@@ i@@ ji@@ an news , which is st@@ range , because actually there &apos;s an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount going on in F@@ i@@ ji ."
There &apos;s a cou@@ p government . There &apos;s a mil@@ it@@ ary government .
There &apos;s cr@@ ac@@ k@@ do@@ w@@ ns on the pre@@ ss .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be pa@@ ying atten@@ tion to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we te@@ nd to look a lot at the inf@@ ra@@ structure of glob@@ aliz@@ ation .
We look at the fr@@ ame@@ work that makes it possible to live in this conne@@ cted world .
And that &apos;s a fr@@ ame@@ work that inclu@@ des things like air@@ line rou@@ tes .
It inclu@@ des things like the Internet c@@ ab@@ les .
"We look at a ma@@ p like this one , and it looks like the entire world is fl@@ at because everything is a ho@@ p or two away ."
"You can get on a fl@@ ight in L@@ on@@ don , you can end up in B@@ an@@ g@@ al@@ ore later today ."
"T@@ wo h@@ op@@ s , you &apos;re in S@@ u@@ v@@ a , the cap@@ ito@@ l of F@@ i@@ ji ."
It &apos;s all right there .
"When you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these net@@ works , you get a very different picture ."
"You start looking at how the global plan@@ e fl@@ ights move , and you su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disco@@ ver that the world isn &apos;t even close to fl@@ at ."
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly l@@ um@@ p@@ y .
"There are parts of the world that are very , very well conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s basically a gi@@ ant pa@@ th@@ way in the s@@ ky between L@@ on@@ don and New York .
"@@ but look at this ma@@ p , and you can wat@@ ch this for , you know , two or three minutes ."
You won &apos;t see very many plan@@ es go from S@@ ou@@ th America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll disco@@ ver that there are parts of the g@@ lo@@ be that are sy@@ ste@@ matic@@ ally c@@ ut off .
"When we stop looking at the inf@@ ra@@ structure that makes conne@@ ction possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realiz@@ ing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does ."
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last deca@@ de or so .
"The world is , in fact , getting more global ."
It &apos;s getting more conne@@ cted .
M@@ ore of problems are global in scale .
M@@ ore of our econom@@ ics is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
"If you wat@@ ched a te@@ le@@ vision bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast in the United States in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , 3@@ 5 to 40 percent of it would have been inter@@ national news on a n@@ igh@@ tly new bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast ."
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this ten@@ ds to give us a very dis@@ tor@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a s@@ li@@ de that Al@@ isa M@@ il@@ ler sho@@ wed at a pre@@ vi@@ ous TED T@@ al@@ k .
Al@@ isa &apos;s the pres@@ ident of P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o Inter@@ national .
"And she made a car@@ to@@ gram , which is basically a dis@@ tor@@ ted ma@@ p based on what American te@@ le@@ vision news ca@@ sts looked at for a mon@@ th ."
"And you see that when you dis@@ tor@@ t a ma@@ p based on atten@@ tion , the world within American te@@ le@@ vision news is basically re@@ duc@@ ed to this gi@@ ant blo@@ ated U.S@@ ."
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ a@@ ded .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
"And before you con@@ clu@@ de that this is just a fun@@ ction of American T@@ V news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I a@@ gre@@ e that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been ma@@ pp@@ ing el@@ ite media like the New York T@@ im@@ es , and I get the same thing ."
"When you look at the New York T@@ im@@ es , you look at other el@@ ite media , what you lar@@ ge@@ ly get are pic@@ tures of very we@@ al@@ thy n@@ ations and the n@@ ations we &apos;ve inv@@ a@@ ded ."
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly hel@@ ping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a ma@@ p made by M@@ ar@@ k G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m who &apos;s down the stre@@ et at the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Internet In@@ st@@ itu@@ te .
A this is a ma@@ p of ar@@ tic@@ les in W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia that have been ge@@ o@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll not@@ ice that there &apos;s a very he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards Nor@@ th America and W@@ es@@ tern Eur@@ ope .
"E@@ ven within W@@ iki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re cre@@ ating their own con@@ tent on@@ line , there &apos;s a he@@ av@@ y bi@@ as to@@ wards the place where a lot of the W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia au@@ th@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , you can get up , you can pic@@ k up your computer when you get out of this ses@@ sion , you could read a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er from India or from A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ ia , from C@@ an@@ a@@ da , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.S@@ ."
You probably won &apos;t .
"If you look at on@@ line media con@@ sum@@ ption — in this case , in the top 10 u@@ ser@@ s of the inter@@ net — more than 9@@ 5 percent of the news re@@ a@@ der@@ ship is on dom@@ est@@ ic news sit@@ es ."
"It &apos;s one of these r@@ are ca@@ ses where the U.S@@ . is actually sl@@ igh@@ tly better than &#91; the U.@@ K@@ . &#93; , because we actually like read@@ ing your media , rather than v@@ ice ver@@ sa ."
So all of this star@@ ts le@@ ad@@ ing me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I re@@ fer to as ima@@ gin@@ ary cos@@ mo@@ polit@@ an@@ ism .
We look at the inter@@ net .
We think we &apos;re getting this wi@@ de view of the g@@ lo@@ be .
"We oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally st@@ um@@ ble onto a pa@@ ge in Chin@@ ese , and we de@@ ci@@ de that we do in fact have the gre@@ a@@ test technology ever built to conne@@ ct us to the rest of the world ."
And we for@@ get that most of the time we &apos;re che@@ c@@ king B@@ os@@ ton R@@ ed S@@ o@@ x sc@@ ore@@ s .
"So this is a real problem — not just because the R@@ ed S@@ o@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re dis@@ cus@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to sol@@ ve are global in scale and sc@@ ope , they requ@@ ire global con@@ vers@@ ations to get to global solu@@ tions ."
This is a problem we have to sol@@ ve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
"For six years , I &apos;ve been han@@ ging out with these guys ."
This is a group called G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ices .
This is a team of b@@ log@@ g@@ ers from around the world .
O@@ ur mis@@ sion was to fi@@ x the world &apos;s media .
We started in 200@@ 4 .
"You might have not@@ ic@@ ed , we ha@@ ven &apos;t done all that well so far ."
"N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to sol@@ ve the problem ."
"But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting les@@ s@@ ons for how we would re@@ w@@ ire if we we wanted to use the we@@ b to have a w@@ ide@@ r world ."
The first thing you have to conside@@ r is that there are parts of the world that are dar@@ k sp@@ ots in terms of atten@@ tion .
In this case — the ma@@ p of the world at night by N@@ A@@ S@@ A — they &apos;re dar@@ k liter@@ ally because of l@@ ack of electr@@ ic@@ ity .
And I used to think that a dar@@ k s@@ po@@ t on this ma@@ p basically me@@ ant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more bas@@ ic needs .
"What I &apos;m star@@ ting to realiz@@ e is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of work , and you need an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment ."
"One of those dar@@ k sp@@ ots is Ma@@ da@@ ga@@ s@@ car , a country which is gener@@ ally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works fil@@ m than it is actually known for the lo@@ vely people who live there ."
And so the people who f@@ oun@@ ded F@@ oko C@@ lu@@ b in Ma@@ da@@ ga@@ s@@ car we@@ ren &apos;t actually con@@ cer@@ ned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much simp@@ ler .
It was a clu@@ b to learn En@@ gl@@ ish and to learn compu@@ ters and the inter@@ net .
but what happened was that Ma@@ da@@ ga@@ s@@ car went through a viol@@ ent cou@@ p .
M@@ ost in@@ depen@@ den@@ t media was shu@@ t down .
"And the high school students who were learning to blo@@ g through F@@ oko C@@ lu@@ b su@@ d@@ den@@ ly found themselves talking to an inter@@ national au@@ dience about the demon@@ str@@ ations , the viol@@ ence , everything that was going on within this country ."
"So a very , very small pro@@ gram desig@@ ned to get people in front of compu@@ ters , publi@@ shing their own th@@ ough@@ ts , publi@@ shing in@@ depen@@ den@@ t media , en@@ ded up having a huge imp@@ act on what we know about this country ."
Now the tr@@ ick with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ es@@ sing most people here don &apos;t speak M@@ al@@ aga@@ s@@ y .
"I &apos;m also gu@@ es@@ sing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chin@@ ese — which is sort of sa@@ d if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most re@@ presen@@ ted language on the inter@@ net ."
F@@ or@@ tun@@ ately people are trying to figure out how to fi@@ x this .
"If you &apos;re using Google Ch@@ r@@ ome and you go to a Chin@@ ese language s@@ ite , you not@@ ice this really cu@@ te box at the top , which au@@ to@@ matic@@ ally de@@ te@@ cts that the pa@@ ge is in Chin@@ ese and very quickly at a mou@@ se cl@@ ick will give you a trans@@ l@@ ation of the pa@@ ge ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s a machine trans@@ l@@ ation of the pa@@ ge ."
"And while Google is very , very good with some langu@@ ag@@ es , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Chin@@ ese ."
And the resu@@ l@@ ts can be pretty fun@@ n@@ y .
"What you really want — what I really want , is ev@@ en@@ tually the ability to p@@ us@@ h a but@@ ton and have this qu@@ e@@ u@@ ed so a human being can trans@@ l@@ ate this ."
"And if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not ."
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Ye@@ ey@@ an .
"And Ye@@ ey@@ an is a group of 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers who get on@@ line every day ."
They look for the most interesting con@@ tent in the En@@ gl@@ ish language .
"They trans@@ l@@ ate r@@ ough@@ ly 100 ar@@ tic@@ les a day from maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers , maj@@ or we@@ b@@ sit@@ es ."
They put it on@@ line for free .
"It &apos;s the project of a guy nam@@ ed Z@@ han@@ g L@@ ei , who was living in the United States during the L@@ ha@@ sa ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ a@@ sed American media co@@ verage was ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start trans@@ l@@ ating , so that people between these countries start under@@ standing each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Ye@@ ey@@ an can line up 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people to trans@@ l@@ ate the En@@ gl@@ ish inter@@ net into Chin@@ ese , where &apos;s the En@@ gl@@ ish language Ye@@ ey@@ an ?"
"W@@ ho &apos;s going after Chin@@ ese , which now has 4@@ 00 million inter@@ net u@@ ser@@ s out there ?"
My gu@@ ess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
"So even if we can find a way to trans@@ l@@ ate from Chin@@ ese , there &apos;s no gu@@ aran@@ te@@ e that we &apos;re going to find it ."
"When we look for information on@@ line , we basically have two stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es ."
We use a lot of search .
And search is ter@@ ri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
"But if what you &apos;re looking for is se@@ ren@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our ma@@ in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hy is to look to our social net@@ works , to look for our friends ."
What are they looking at ? Ma@@ ybe we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essen@@ ti@@ ally what you end up getting after a while is the w@@ is@@ dom of the flo@@ ck .
"You end up f@@ loc@@ king with a lot of people who are probably sim@@ il@@ ar to you , who have sim@@ il@@ ar intere@@ sts ."
"And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other f@@ loc@@ ks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own intere@@ sts ."
"T@@ o do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bu@@ m@@ p you out of your flo@@ ck and into another flo@@ ck ."
You need a gu@@ ide .
So this is A@@ mir@@ a A@@ l H@@ us@@ sa@@ ini . She is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ed@@ it@@ or for G@@ lob@@ al V@@ o@@ ices .
She has one of the har@@ de@@ st j@@ ob@@ s in the world .
"N@@ ot only does she have to keep our I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ i and P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian con@@ tribu@@ tors from kill@@ ing each other , she has to figure out what is going to intere@@ st you about the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
"And in that sense of trying to get you out of your norma@@ l or@@ bit , and to try to get you to pa@@ y atten@@ tion to a story about someone who &apos;s given up s@@ mok@@ ing for the mon@@ th of R@@ a@@ ma@@ dan , she has to know something about a global au@@ dience ."
She has to know something about what stories are av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
"B@@ as@@ ically , she &apos;s a dee@@ ja@@ y ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a s@@ kill@@ ed human cur@@ ator who kno@@ ws what materi@@ al is av@@ a@@ il@@ able to her , who &apos;s able to lis@@ ten to the au@@ dience , and who &apos;s able to make a se@@ lec@@ tion and p@@ us@@ h people for@@ ward in one fa@@ shi@@ on or another ."
I don &apos;t think this is ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mi@@ c process .
I think what &apos;s great about the inter@@ net is that it actually makes it much eas@@ i@@ er for dee@@ ja@@ ys to re@@ ach a w@@ ide@@ r au@@ dience .
I know A@@ mir@@ a .
I can ask her what to read .
"But with the inter@@ net , she &apos;s in a pos@@ ition where she can tell a lot of people what to read ."
"And you can lis@@ ten to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your we@@ b w@@ iden@@ ed ."
"So once you start w@@ iden@@ ing like this , once you start l@@ igh@@ ting up vo@@ ices in the dar@@ k sp@@ ots , once you start trans@@ l@@ ating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really we@@ ird places ."
"This is an image from pretty much my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite blo@@ g , which is A@@ fri@@ G@@ ad@@ get ."
And A@@ fri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blo@@ g that looks at technology in an Africa con@@ text .
"And speci@@ fic@@ ally , it &apos;s looking at a bl@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ mit@@ h in K@@ i@@ b@@ era in N@@ air@@ obi , who is tur@@ ning the sh@@ af@@ t of a L@@ an@@ dro@@ ver into a co@@ ld chi@@ se@@ l ."
"And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;"
"And the tru@@ th is , this guy can probably expla@@ in this to you ."
This is E@@ ri@@ k H@@ er@@ s@@ man . You guys may have seen him around the con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce .
He goes by the mon@@ ik@@ er W@@ h@@ ite Afr@@ ican .
"He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ e@@ k , but he &apos;s also K@@ en@@ y@@ an ; he was born in S@@ u@@ dan , gre@@ w up in K@@ en@@ ya ."
He is a bri@@ dge figure .
"He is someone who liter@@ ally has fe@@ et in both wor@@ l@@ ds — one in the world of the Afr@@ ican technology community , one in the world of the American technology community ."
"And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this bl@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ mit@@ h in K@@ i@@ b@@ era and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ int , about looking for insp@@ ir@@ ation based on re@@ using materi@@ als ."
"He kno@@ ws one world , and he &apos;s fin@@ ding a way to communic@@ ate it to another world , both of which he has dee@@ p conne@@ c@@ tions to ."
"These bri@@ dge fig@@ ures , I &apos;m pretty well con@@ v@@ in@@ ced , are the future of how we try to make the world w@@ ide@@ r through using the we@@ b ."
"But the tr@@ ick with bri@@ d@@ ges is , ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely , you need someone to cr@@ oss them ."
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
"So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I su@@ spe@@ ct I would spend my of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on n@@ ur@@ sing my wou@@ n@@ ds , en@@ jo@@ ying my house , so on and so for@@ th — possi@@ bly recor@@ ding a hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p al@@ bu@@ m ."
"D@@ han@@ i J@@ ones , who is the middle lin@@ e@@ bac@@ ker for the C@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ nat@@ i B@@ en@@ g@@ als , has a sl@@ igh@@ tly different appro@@ ach to the of@@ f-@@ se@@ as@@ on ."
D@@ han@@ i has a te@@ le@@ vision show .
"It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ han@@ i T@@ ac@@ k@@ les the G@@ lo@@ be . &quot; &quot; And every week on this te@@ le@@ vision show , D@@ han@@ i tra@@ ve@@ ls to a different n@@ ation of the world ."
He fin@@ ds a local sp@@ or@@ ting team .
"He tra@@ ins with them for a week , and he pla@@ ys a mat@@ ch with them ."
And his reason for this is not just that he wan@@ ts to mas@@ ter M@@ u@@ a@@ y T@@ hai bo@@ x@@ ing .
"It &apos;s because , for him , sp@@ ort is the language that allo@@ ws him to en@@ coun@@ ter the full wi@@ d@@ th and won@@ der of the world ."
F@@ or some of us it might be music . F@@ or some of us it might be food .
F@@ or a lot of us it might be liter@@ ature or wr@@ iting .
But there are all these different tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that al@@ low you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The go@@ al of my T@@ al@@ k here is not to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the people in this room to em@@ br@@ ace your x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ ia .
"My gu@@ ess — given that you &apos;re at a con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce called TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es , whether or not you use that ter@@ m ."
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the person@@ al decis@@ ion that you want a w@@ ide@@ r world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ w@@ ire the systems that we have .
We have to fi@@ x our media .
We have to fi@@ x the inter@@ net . We have to fi@@ x our education .
We have to fi@@ x our im@@ mig@@ r@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y .
"We need to look at ways of cre@@ ating se@@ ren@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making trans@@ l@@ ation per@@ v@@ as@@ ive , and we need to find ways to em@@ br@@ ace and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate these bri@@ dge fig@@ ures ."
And we need to figure out how to cul@@ tiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
"B@@ as@@ ically , there &apos;s a maj@@ or demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c ev@@ ent going on ."
And it may be that pas@@ sing the 50 percent ur@@ ban point is an economic ti@@ pp@@ ing point . So the world now is a ma@@ p of conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity .
It used to be that P@@ ar@@ is and L@@ on@@ don and New York were the lar@@ gest cities .
What we have now is the end of the r@@ ise of the W@@ est . That &apos;s over .
The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate num@@ bers are over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
"So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , vil@@ la@@ ges of the world are em@@ p@@ t@@ ying out ."
"The question is , why ?"
"And here &apos;s the un@@ r@@ om@@ an@@ tic tru@@ th — and the city air makes you free , they said in R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce G@@ er@@ many . So some people go to places like S@@ han@@ g@@ hai but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics ru@@ le ."
And these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by po@@ ver@@ ty .
They &apos;re people getting out of po@@ ver@@ ty as f@@ ast as they can .
"They &apos;re the dom@@ in@@ ant buil@@ ders and to a large ex@@ tent , the dom@@ in@@ ant desig@@ ners ."
They have h@@ ome@@ -@@ bre@@ wed inf@@ ra@@ structure and vi@@ br@@ ant ur@@ ban life .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of the G@@ D@@ P in India is coming out of M@@ um@@ bai .
"They are con@@ stan@@ tly up@@ gra@@ ding , and in a few ca@@ ses , the government hel@@ ps ."
E@@ duc@@ ation is the ma@@ in ev@@ ent that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the stre@@ et in M@@ um@@ bai ?
A@@ l G@@ ore kno@@ ws . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . E@@ very@@ one works .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ si@@ x@@ th of hum@@ an@@ ity is there . It &apos;s so@@ on going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ un@@ ch line : cities have de@@ fu@@ sed the population b@@ om@@ b .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ un@@ ch line .
That &apos;s the news from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . Here it is in per@@ spe@@ ctive .
S@@ t@@ ars have shin@@ ed down on ear@@ th &apos;s life for bil@@ lions of years .
Now we &apos;re shin@@ ing right back up .
Thank you .
"The night before I was he@@ ad@@ ing for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land , I was inv@@ ited to h@@ ost the fin@@ al of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot T@@ al@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in S@@ han@@ g@@ hai with the 8@@ 0,000 live au@@ dience in the sta@@ di@@ um ."
G@@ u@@ ess who was the perfor@@ ming gu@@ est ?
S@@ usan B@@ o@@ y@@ le .
"And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to S@@ c@@ ot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She san@@ g beauti@@ fully , and she even man@@ ag@@ ed to say a few words in Chin@@ ese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; he@@ ll@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff ."
It means &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
"Because it was a line from our Chin@@ ese par@@ al@@ le@@ l S@@ usan B@@ o@@ y@@ le — a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ some ye@@ ar-@@ old woman , a ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ han@@ g@@ hai , who lo@@ ves sing@@ ing W@@ es@@ tern op@@ era , but she didn &apos;t understand any En@@ gl@@ ish or F@@ ren@@ ch or I@@ tal@@ ian , so she man@@ ag@@ ed to f@@ ill in the l@@ y@@ r@@ ics with ve@@ ge@@ table nam@@ es in Chin@@ ese ."
"( Laughter ) And the last sen@@ ten@@ ce of N@@ es@@ sun D@@ or@@ ma that she was sing@@ ing in the sta@@ di@@ um was &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; S@@ usan B@@ o@@ y@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live au@@ dience san@@ g together ."
That was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous .
So I gu@@ ess both S@@ usan B@@ o@@ y@@ le and this ve@@ ge@@ table ven@@ d@@ or in S@@ han@@ g@@ hai be@@ lon@@ ged to o@@ ther@@ ness .
"They were the least expe@@ cted to be suc@@ cess@@ ful in the business called en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , yet their cou@@ ra@@ ge and tal@@ ent br@@ ought them through ."
And a show and a pl@@ at@@ form gave them the stage to realiz@@ e their dre@@ ams .
"Well , being different is not that difficult ."
We are all different from different per@@ spe@@ c@@ ti@@ ves .
"But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view ."
You may have the chan@@ ce to make a difference .
"My gener@@ ation has been very for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness and partic@@ ip@@ ate in the his@@ tor@@ ic trans@@ formation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years ."
"I remember that in the year of 199@@ 0 , when I was gra@@ du@@ ating from col@@ le@@ ge , I was ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job in the s@@ al@@ es de@@ part@@ ment of the first fi@@ ve@@ -@@ sta@@ r ho@@ te@@ l in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , G@@ re@@ at W@@ all S@@ her@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there ."
"So after being inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ ted by this J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese man@@ ag@@ er for a half an h@@ our , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ is@@ s Y@@ an@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my cou@@ ra@@ ge and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you se@@ ll ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a cl@@ ue what a s@@ al@@ es de@@ part@@ ment was about in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ sta@@ r ho@@ te@@ l ."
That was the first day I set my foo@@ t in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ sta@@ r ho@@ te@@ l .
"A@@ r@@ ound the same time , I was going through an au@@ d@@ ition — the first ever open au@@ d@@ ition by national te@@ le@@ vision in China — with another th@@ ous@@ and col@@ le@@ ge girls ."
"The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and beautiful f@@ res@@ h face ."
"So when it was my turn , I sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ al@@ ities on te@@ le@@ vision always have to be beautiful , s@@ we@@ et , in@@ no@@ cent and , you know , supp@@ or@@ tive ?"
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own vo@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ en@@ ded them .
"But actually , they were im@@ pres@@ sed by my words ."
"And so I was in the second r@@ ound of compe@@ t@@ ition , and then the third and the f@@ our@@ th ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seven r@@ oun@@ ds of compe@@ t@@ ition , I was the last one to survi@@ ve it ."
So I was on a national te@@ le@@ vision pr@@ ime@@ -@@ time show .
"And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chin@@ ese te@@ le@@ vision that allo@@ wed its hos@@ ts to speak out of their own min@@ ds without read@@ ing an appro@@ ved scri@@ pt ."
( Applause ) And my wee@@ k@@ ly au@@ dience at that time was between 200 to 3@@ 00 million people .
"Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S@@ . and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a U@@ ni@@ versity to pur@@ su@@ e my pos@@ t@@ gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my care@@ er ."
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wed more than a th@@ ous@@ and people in the past .
"And sometimes I have young people appro@@ ach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel pr@@ oud of that ."
But then we are also so for@@ tun@@ ate to wit@@ ness the trans@@ formation of the whole country .
I was in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic G@@ am@@ es .
I was re@@ presen@@ ting the S@@ han@@ g@@ hai E@@ x@@ p@@ o .
I saw China em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing the world and v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
"But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young gener@@ ation up to ?"
"@@ How are they different , and what are the differen@@ ces they are going to make to sh@@ ape the future of China , or at large , the world ?"
So today I want to talk about young people through the pl@@ at@@ form of social media .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?"
"Well this is a girl called G@@ u@@ o M@@ e@@ ime@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful ."
"S@@ he sho@@ wed off her ex@@ pen@@ sive ba@@ gs , clo@@ the@@ s and car on her micro@@ blo@@ g , which is the Chin@@ ese ver@@ sion of T@@ wit@@ ter ."
And she c@@ la@@ im@@ ed to be the gener@@ al man@@ ag@@ er of R@@ ed C@@ ross at the C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce .
"S@@ he didn &apos;t realiz@@ e that she ste@@ pped on a sen@@ s@@ itive ner@@ ve and ar@@ ou@@ sed national quest@@ i@@ on@@ ing , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bility of R@@ ed C@@ ross ."
"The contro@@ vers@@ y was so he@@ ated that the R@@ ed C@@ ross had to open a pre@@ ss con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce to cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y it , and the inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ation is going on ."
"So far , as of today , we know that she her@@ self made up that t@@ it@@ le — probably because she feel@@ s pr@@ oud to be as@@ soci@@ ated with char@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll those ex@@ pen@@ sive ite@@ ms were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her bo@@ y@@ friend , who used to be a bo@@ ard member in a sub@@ di@@ vision of R@@ ed C@@ ross at C@@ ha@@ m@@ ber of C@@ om@@ mer@@ ce ."
It &apos;s very com@@ plic@@ ated to expla@@ in .
"But any@@ way , the public still doesn &apos;t bu@@ y it ."
It is still bo@@ il@@ ing .
"It shows us a gener@@ al mis@@ tr@@ ust of government or govern@@ men@@ t-@@ bac@@ ked institu@@ tions , which l@@ ac@@ ked trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy in the past ."
And also it sho@@ wed us the power and the imp@@ act of social media as micro@@ blo@@ g .
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ blo@@ g bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 20@@ 10 , with vis@@ it@@ ors dou@@ bl@@ ed and time spent on it tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
"S@@ ina@@ .@@ co@@ m , a maj@@ or news por@@ tal , alone has more than 1@@ 40 million micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"O@@ n T@@ en@@ cent , 200 million ."
"The most pop@@ ular b@@ log@@ ger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movi@@ e sta@@ r , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million follo@@ wers , or f@@ ans ."
"A@@ b@@ out 80 percent of those micro@@ b@@ log@@ g@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old ."
"And because , as you know , the tra@@ diti@@ onal media is still he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly contro@@ ll@@ ed by the government , social media off@@ ers an open@@ ing to let the ste@@ am out a little bit ."
"But because you don &apos;t have many other open@@ ings , the he@@ at coming out of this open@@ ing is sometimes very str@@ ong , ac@@ tive and even viol@@ ent ."
"So through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging , we are able to understand Chin@@ ese you@@ th even better ."
So how are they different ?
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the on@@ e-@@ child pol@@ ic@@ y ."
"And because of se@@ lec@@ ted ab@@ or@@ tion by famil@@ ies who fa@@ v@@ ore@@ d bo@@ ys to girls , now we have en@@ ded up with 30 million more young men than women ."
"That could p@@ ose a poten@@ tial dan@@ ger to the society , but who kno@@ ws ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ aliz@@ ed world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries ."
M@@ ost of them have fa@@ ir@@ ly good education .
The ill@@ it@@ er@@ acy r@@ ate in China am@@ ong this gener@@ ation is under one percent .
"In cities , 80 percent of kids go to col@@ le@@ ge ."
"But they are fac@@ ing an ag@@ ing China with a population ab@@ o@@ ve 6@@ 5 years old coming up with se@@ ven@@ -@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 20@@ 30 ."
"And you know we have the tra@@ d@@ ition that youn@@ ger gener@@ ations supp@@ ort the el@@ ders fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re s@@ ick ."
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to supp@@ ort four parents who have a life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates are not in sh@@ ort supp@@ ly .
"In ur@@ ban areas , col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates find the star@@ ting s@@ al@@ ary is about 4@@ 00 U.S@@ . dollars a mon@@ th , while the a@@ verage ren@@ t is ab@@ o@@ ve $ 500 ."
"So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ ee@@ z@@ ed in very lim@@ ited space to sa@@ ve money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of an@@ ts . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed and bu@@ y their ap@@ art@@ ment , they fig@@ u@@ red out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to af@@ for@@ d their first ap@@ art@@ ment ."
"That r@@ ati@@ o in America would only cost a couple five years to ear@@ n , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the s@@ ky@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ting real est@@ ate pr@@ ice ."
"A@@ mon@@ g the 200 million mig@@ r@@ ant wor@@ kers , 60 percent of them are young people ."
They find themselves sort of san@@ d@@ wi@@ ched between the ur@@ ban areas and the r@@ ural areas .
"M@@ ost of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of be@@ lon@@ ging ."
"They work for longer hours with less in@@ come , less social we@@ l@@ f@@ are ."
"And they &apos;re more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to job l@@ os@@ ses , sub@@ ject to in@@ fl@@ ation , t@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ bi , or de@@ cl@@ ine of de@@ m@@ and from Eur@@ ope or America for the produc@@ ts they produ@@ ce ."
"L@@ ast year , though , an app@@ all@@ ing in@@ c@@ ident in a sou@@ ther@@ n O@@ E@@ M man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing comp@@ ound in China : 1@@ 3 young wor@@ kers in their l@@ ate te@@ ens and early 20@@ s comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ic@@ ide , just one by one like ca@@ using a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease ."
But they died because of all different person@@ al reas@@ ons .
"But this whole in@@ c@@ ident ar@@ ou@@ sed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from society about the is@@ ol@@ ation , both physical and mental , of these mig@@ r@@ ant wor@@ kers ."
"For those who do re@@ turn back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very we@@ l@@ come loc@@ ally , because with the knowledge , s@@ kill@@ s and net@@ works they have learned in the cities , with the as@@ sis@@ tan@@ ce of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more j@@ ob@@ s , up@@ gra@@ de local a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and create new business in the less develop@@ ed market ."
"So for the past few years , the co@@ as@@ tal areas , they found themselves in a sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of lab@@ or ."
These di@@ a@@ gr@@ ams show a more gener@@ al social bac@@ k@@ ground .
"The first one is the En@@ ge@@ ls co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent , which expla@@ ins that the cost of dai@@ ly ne@@ cess@@ ities has dro@@ pped its per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge all through the past deca@@ de , in terms of family in@@ come , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent ."
"But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , in@@ dic@@ ating a ris@@ ing living cost ."
The G@@ ini co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent has already pas@@ sed the dan@@ ger@@ ous line of 0@@ .@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0@@ .@@ 5 — even wor@@ se than that in America — sho@@ wing us the in@@ come in@@ equ@@ ality .
And so you see this whole society getting fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted about l@@ os@@ ing some of its mo@@ bility .
"And also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even re@@ sen@@ t@@ ment to@@ wards the r@@ ich and the powerful is quite w@@ ide@@ spre@@ ad ."
So any acc@@ us@@ ations of cor@@ ru@@ ption or bac@@ k@@ do@@ or de@@ al@@ ings between au@@ th@@ or@@ ities or business would ar@@ ou@@ se a social out@@ cr@@ y or even un@@ rest .
"So through some of the h@@ otte@@ st to@@ pic@@ s on micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging , we can see what young people care most about ."
S@@ o@@ cial j@@ us@@ tic@@ e and government ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility run@@ s the first in what they de@@ m@@ and .
"For the past deca@@ de or so , a mas@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation and develop@@ ment have let us wit@@ ness a lot of re@@ por@@ ts on the for@@ ced demo@@ lit@@ ion of pri@@ v@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ty ."
And it has ar@@ ou@@ sed huge an@@ ger and fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ation am@@ ong our young gener@@ ation .
"S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es people get kill@@ ed , and sometimes people set themselves on fir@@ e to prote@@ st ."
"So when these in@@ c@@ iden@@ ts are re@@ por@@ ted more and more f@@ requ@@ ently on the Internet , people cr@@ y for the government to take ac@@ tions to stop this ."
"So the good news is that ear@@ li@@ er this year , the state coun@@ ci@@ l pas@@ sed a new reg@@ ulation on house requ@@ is@@ ition and demo@@ lit@@ ion and pas@@ sed the right to order for@@ ced demo@@ lit@@ ion from local govern@@ ments to the cour@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , many other issu@@ es con@@ cer@@ ning public sa@@ fe@@ ty is a ho@@ t to@@ p@@ ic on the Internet ."
"We heard about pol@@ lu@@ ted air , pol@@ lu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ on@@ ed food ."
"And gu@@ ess what , we have f@@ ak@@ ed be@@ e@@ f ."
"They have sor@@ ts of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that you br@@ us@@ h on a piece of ch@@ ic@@ ken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ e@@ f ."
"And then la@@ tely , people are very con@@ cer@@ ned about co@@ ok@@ ing oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; co@@ ok@@ ing oil from re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant s@@ lo@@ p ."
So all these things have ar@@ ou@@ sed a huge out@@ cr@@ y from the Internet .
"And for@@ tun@@ ately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more t@@ ime@@ ly and also more f@@ requ@@ ently to the public con@@ cer@@ ns ."
"W@@ hi@@ le young people see@@ m to be very sure about their partic@@ ip@@ ation in public pol@@ ic@@ y-@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their person@@ al life ."
China is so@@ on to pas@@ s the U.S@@ .
as the number one market for lu@@ x@@ ury b@@ ran@@ ds — that &apos;s not inclu@@ ding the Chin@@ ese ex@@ pen@@ d@@ itu@@ res in Eur@@ ope and el@@ se@@ where .
"But you know what , half of those con@@ sum@@ ers are ear@@ ning a s@@ al@@ ary be@@ low 2@@ ,000 U.S@@ . dollars ."
They &apos;re not r@@ ich at all .
They &apos;re taking those ba@@ gs and clo@@ the@@ s as a sense of iden@@ t@@ ity and social st@@ at@@ us .
And this is a girl ex@@ plic@@ it@@ ly saying on a T@@ V dat@@ ing show that she would rather cr@@ y in a B@@ M@@ W than s@@ mi@@ le on a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"But of course , we do have young people who would still pre@@ fer to s@@ mi@@ le , whether in a B@@ M@@ W or &#91; on &#93; a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
"So in the next picture , you see a very pop@@ ular ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called &quot; &quot; nak@@ ed &quot; &quot; we@@ d@@ ding , or &quot; &quot; nak@@ ed &quot; &quot; mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"It does not mean they will we@@ ar nothing in the we@@ d@@ ding , but it shows that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get mar@@ ri@@ ed without a house , without a car , without a di@@ am@@ on@@ d r@@ ing and without a we@@ d@@ ding ban@@ qu@@ et , to show their comm@@ it@@ ment to true love ."
"And also , people are doing good through social media ."
And the first picture sho@@ wed us that a tru@@ ck ca@@ ging 500 h@@ ome@@ less and ki@@ d@@ n@@ app@@ ed do@@ gs for food pro@@ ces@@ sing was sp@@ ot@@ ted and sto@@ pped on the high@@ way with the whole country wat@@ ching through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging .
"@@ People were don@@ ating money , do@@ g food and of@@ fer@@ ing vol@@ un@@ te@@ er work to stop that tru@@ ck ."
"And after hours of ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation , 500 do@@ gs were re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed ."
And here also people are hel@@ ping to find mis@@ sing children .
A father pos@@ ted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
"A@@ f@@ ter thousands of re@@ sen@@ ds in re@@ la@@ y , the child was found , and we wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed the re@@ un@@ ion of the family through micro@@ b@@ log@@ ging ."
So happ@@ iness is the most pop@@ ular word we have heard through the past two years .
"H@@ app@@ iness is not only re@@ la@@ ted to person@@ al experi@@ ences and person@@ al val@@ u@@ es , but also , it &apos;s about the environment ."
People are thinking about the follo@@ wing questions : A@@ re we going to sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice our environment fur@@ ther to produ@@ ce high@@ er G@@ D@@ P ?
"@@ How are we going to per@@ form our social and polit@@ ical re@@ form to keep p@@ ace with economic growth , to keep su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability and sta@@ bility ?"
"And also , how cap@@ able is the system of self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness to keep more people con@@ tent with all sor@@ ts of fr@@ ic@@ tion going on at the same time ?"
I gu@@ ess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our youn@@ ger gener@@ ation are going to trans@@ form this country while at the same time being trans@@ for@@ med themselves .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it n@@ ice ?
You su@@ d@@ den@@ ly become a disease on le@@ gs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start spe@@ aking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
C@@ an I study ? C@@ an I make love ? C@@ an I be cre@@ ative ?
There &apos;s more to me .
"And , it worked ."
"For example , here we see F@@ ran@@ ces@@ c@@ a F@@ ini in her perfor@@ man@@ ce ."
So I was able to take my time and cho@@ ose .
What are the out@@ comes ?
"I &apos;m f@@ ine , as you can see , pretty f@@ ine ."
E@@ very@@ thing I did was th@@ ough@@ t@@ fully desig@@ ned to get me enga@@ ged .
This global perfor@@ man@@ ce is my open@@ -@@ source c@@ ure for cancer .
"A big challenge is , how should the i@@ P@@ ads be used , and what ap@@ ps should we put on the i@@ P@@ ads ?"
H@@ i everybody . So my name is Ma@@ c .
"My job is that I li@@ e to children , but they &apos;re hon@@ est lies ."
"I write children &apos;s book@@ s , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e from P@@ ab@@ l@@ o P@@ ic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Ar@@ t is not tru@@ th ."
Ar@@ t is a li@@ e that makes us realiz@@ e tru@@ th or at least the tru@@ th that is given us to understand .
"The art@@ ist must know the man@@ ner whe@@ re@@ by to con@@ v@@ ince others of the tru@@ th@@ fu@@ l@@ ness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a ki@@ d , and I lo@@ ved it , but I had no idea what it me@@ ant ."
"( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , tru@@ th and lies , fic@@ tion and reality ."
So how could I un@@ tan@@ gle this k@@ not@@ ted bun@@ ch of sen@@ ten@@ ces ?
"And I said , I &apos;ve got P@@ o@@ wer@@ P@@ o@@ int . Let &apos;s do a V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ th . L@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , bo@@ om ."
"We &apos;ve got tru@@ th and lies and then there &apos;s this little space , the e@@ dge , in the middle ."
"That lim@@ inal space , that &apos;s art ."
All right . V@@ en@@ n di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very hel@@ p@@ ful ei@@ ther .
"The thing that made me understand that quot@@ e and really kind of what art , at least the art of fic@@ tion , was , was working with kids ."
I used to be a sum@@ mer cam@@ p coun@@ sel@@ or .
"I would do it on my sum@@ m@@ ers off from col@@ le@@ ge , and I lo@@ ved it ."
It was a sp@@ or@@ ts sum@@ mer cam@@ p for f@@ our@@ - to si@@ x@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds .
"I was in char@@ ge of the f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds , which is good , because f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds can &apos;t play sp@@ or@@ ts , and ne@@ i@@ ther can I@@ ."
"( Laughter ) I play sp@@ or@@ ts at a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old level , so what would happen is the kids would dri@@ b@@ ble around some con@@ es , and then got ho@@ t , and then they would go s@@ it under@@ ne@@ ath the t@@ ree where I was already sitting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life ."
"I would tell them about how , on the wee@@ ken@@ ds , I would go home and I would sp@@ y for the Q@@ ue@@ en of En@@ g@@ land ."
"And so@@ on , other kids who we@@ ren &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Ma@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t , right ?"
You &apos;re the guy who sp@@ ies for the Q@@ ue@@ en of En@@ g@@ land . &quot; &quot; And I had been wa@@ iting my whole life for st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers to come up and ask me that question .
"In my f@@ an@@ tas@@ y , they were s@@ ve@@ l@@ te R@@ us@@ si@@ an women , but , you know , f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds — you take what you can get in B@@ er@@ ke@@ le@@ y , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was famil@@ i@@ ar to me and really exc@@ iting .
"I think the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of this for me — I &apos;ll never for@@ get this — there was this little girl nam@@ ed R@@ il@@ ey . She was tin@@ y , and she used to always take out her l@@ un@@ ch every day and she would th@@ row out her f@@ ru@@ it ."
"S@@ he would just take her f@@ ru@@ it , her mo@@ m p@@ ac@@ ked her a me@@ l@@ on every day , and she would just th@@ row it in the i@@ v@@ y and then she would e@@ at f@@ ru@@ it s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks and pu@@ d@@ ding cu@@ ps , and I was like , &quot; &quot; R@@ il@@ ey , you can &apos;t do that , you have to e@@ at the f@@ ru@@ it . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you th@@ row the f@@ ru@@ it in the i@@ v@@ y , pretty so@@ on , it &apos;s going to be over@@ gro@@ wn with me@@ l@@ ons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I en@@ ded up telling stories to children and not being a nu@@ tr@@ iti@@ on@@ ist for children ."
"And so R@@ il@@ ey was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen ."
"That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of cam@@ p , I got up early and I got a big can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e from the gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore and I hi@@ d it in the i@@ v@@ y , and then at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , I was like , &quot; R@@ il@@ ey , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;"
"And — ( Laughter ) — she went tru@@ d@@ ging through the i@@ v@@ y , and then her eyes just got so wi@@ de , and she poin@@ ted out this me@@ l@@ on that was big@@ ger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and ru@@ shed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why is there a st@@ ic@@ ker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not th@@ row your st@@ ick@@ ers in the i@@ v@@ y ."
"P@@ ut them in the tr@@ as@@ h can . It ru@@ ins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And R@@ il@@ ey car@@ ri@@ ed that me@@ l@@ on around with her all day , and she was so pr@@ oud ."
"And R@@ il@@ ey knew she didn &apos;t grow a me@@ l@@ on in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a we@@ ird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to ."
It &apos;s anything . Ar@@ t can get us to that place .
"S@@ he was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fic@@ tion ."
I &apos;m going to call it won@@ der .
"It &apos;s what C@@ ol@@ er@@ i@@ dge called the w@@ ill@@ ing su@@ sp@@ en@@ sion of dis@@ beli@@ e@@ f or po@@ e@@ tic fa@@ it@@ h , for those mom@@ ents where a story , no matter how st@@ range , has some se@@ m@@ bl@@ ance of the tru@@ th , and then you &apos;re able to believe it ."
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
"A@@ d@@ ul@@ ts can too , and we get there when we read ."
"It &apos;s why in two days , people will be de@@ sc@@ en@@ ding on D@@ u@@ bl@@ in to take the wal@@ king t@@ our of B@@ lo@@ om@@ s@@ day and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; U@@ l@@ ys@@ ses , &quot; &quot; even though n@@ one of that happened ."
"O@@ r people go to L@@ on@@ don and they vis@@ it B@@ ak@@ er S@@ tre@@ et to see S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck H@@ ol@@ m@@ es &apos; ap@@ art@@ ment , even though 2@@ 2@@ 1@@ B is just a number that was pain@@ ted on a building that never actually had that ad@@ dre@@ ss ."
"We know these charac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real , but we have real feel@@ ings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these charac@@ ters ar@@ en &apos;t real ,@@ "
and yet we also know that they are .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds can get there a lot more eas@@ ily than ad@@ ul@@ ts can , and that &apos;s why I love wr@@ iting for kids ."
I think kids are the best au@@ dience for seri@@ ous liter@@ ary fic@@ tion .
"When I was a ki@@ d , I was ob@@ ses@@ sed with se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or no@@ ve@@ ls , things like &quot; &quot; N@@ ar@@ ni@@ a , &quot; &quot; where you would open a war@@ dro@@ be and go through to a mag@@ ical land ."
And I was con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors really did ex@@ ist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
"I wanted to live and cr@@ oss over into that fic@@ ti@@ onal world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s clo@@ set do@@ ors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mo@@ m &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s clo@@ set , and there was not a se@@ cre@@ t mag@@ ical land there ."
There was some other we@@ ird stuff that I think my mo@@ m should know about .
( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
"A@@ f@@ ter col@@ le@@ ge , my first job was working behind one of these se@@ cre@@ t do@@ ors ."
This is a place called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a .
"It &apos;s at 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et in the M@@ is@@ sion in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , and when I worked there , there was a publi@@ shing company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ te@@ red there called M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s , a non@@ pro@@ f@@ it wr@@ iting cen@@ ter called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , but then the front of it was a st@@ range sho@@ p ."
"You see , this place was zon@@ ed re@@ tai@@ l , and in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , they were not going to give us a vari@@ ance , and so the writ@@ er who f@@ oun@@ ded it , a writ@@ er nam@@ ed D@@ a@@ ve E@@ g@@ g@@ ers , to come into comp@@ li@@ ance with co@@ de , he said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , I &apos;m just going to build a p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wo@@ od ."
There &apos;s dra@@ wers you can pu@@ ll out and get c@@ it@@ ru@@ s so you don &apos;t get sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"They have e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ches in lots of col@@ ors , because when it &apos;s sp@@ r@@ ing@@ time , p@@ ir@@ ates want to go w@@ il@@ d ."
You don &apos;t know . B@@ l@@ ack is bor@@ ing . P@@ as@@ te@@ l .
"O@@ r eyes , also in lots of col@@ ors , just gl@@ as@@ s eyes , depen@@ ding on how you want to deal with that s@@ itu@@ ation ."
"And the st@@ ore , st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , people came to them and b@@ ought things , and they en@@ ded up pa@@ ying the ren@@ t for our tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the qu@@ ality of work you do , kids would come and get in@@ stru@@ ction in wr@@ iting , and when you have to walk this we@@ ird , lim@@ inal , fic@@ ti@@ onal space like this to go do your wr@@ iting , it &apos;s going to a@@ ffe@@ ct the kind of work that you make ."
It &apos;s a se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or that you can walk through .
"So I ran the 8@@ 2@@ 6 in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , and it was my job to build the st@@ ore down there ."
So we have The E@@ ch@@ o P@@ ar@@ k T@@ ime T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art .
"That &apos;s our motto : &quot; &quot; W@@ hen@@ ever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on S@@ un@@ set B@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les ."
O@@ ur fri@@ en@@ dly sta@@ ff is ready to help you .
"They &apos;re from all er@@ as , inclu@@ ding just the 198@@ 0s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very re@@ cent past ."
"There &apos;s our E@@ m@@ plo@@ ye@@ es of the M@@ on@@ th , inclu@@ ding G@@ en@@ g@@ his K@@ han , C@@ har@@ les D@@ ic@@ ken@@ s ."
S@@ ome great people have come up through our ran@@ ks .
This is our kind of ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ cy se@@ ction .
"We have some pa@@ tent me@@ dic@@ ines , C@@ ano@@ p@@ ic j@@ ars for your organ@@ s , commun@@ ist so@@ a@@ p that says , &quot; &quot; This is your so@@ a@@ p for the year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) O@@ ur s@@ lu@@ sh@@ y machine br@@ oke on the open@@ ing night and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
O@@ ur arch@@ ite@@ ct was co@@ vered in red sy@@ ru@@ p .
"It looked like he had just mur@@ de@@ red somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular arch@@ ite@@ ct , and we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
It was going to be the high@@ light of our st@@ ore .
"So we just put that sig@@ n on it that said , &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of order . C@@ ome back y@@ es@@ ter@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that en@@ ded up being a better j@@ oke than s@@ lu@@ shi@@ es , so we just left it there fore@@ ver ."
"M@@ am@@ mot@@ h C@@ hun@@ ks . These things we@@ ig@@ h , like , seven p@@ oun@@ ds each ."
B@@ ar@@ b@@ ari@@ an re@@ pe@@ ll@@ ent . It &apos;s full of s@@ al@@ ad and p@@ ot@@ p@@ our@@ ri — things that bar@@ b@@ ari@@ ans h@@ ate .
De@@ ad langu@@ ag@@ es .
"( Laughter ) L@@ ee@@ ches , nature &apos;s tin@@ y doc@@ tors ."
"And V@@ ik@@ ing O@@ dor@@ ant , which comes in lots of great sc@@ ents : to@@ en@@ a@@ il@@ s , s@@ we@@ at and r@@ ot@@ ten ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es , p@@ y@@ re as@@ h ."
"Because we believe that A@@ x@@ e B@@ o@@ dy S@@ p@@ ra@@ y is something that you should only find on the bat@@ t@@ le@@ field , not under your ar@@ ms . ( Laughter ) And these are ro@@ bo@@ t emot@@ ion chi@@ ps , so robot@@ s can feel love or fe@@ ar ."
"O@@ ur big@@ gest sel@@ ler is S@@ cha@@ den@@ f@@ re@@ u@@ de , which we did not expe@@ ct ."
( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
"But there &apos;s a non@@ pro@@ f@@ it behind it , and kids go through a do@@ or that says &quot; &quot; E@@ m@@ plo@@ ye@@ es O@@ n@@ ly &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do h@@ ome@@ work and write stories and make fil@@ ms and this is a book re@@ lease par@@ ty where kids will read ."
"There &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly that &apos;s publi@@ shed with just wr@@ iting that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have re@@ lease par@@ ties and they e@@ at c@@ ake and read for their parents and d@@ rin@@ k mil@@ k out of ch@@ am@@ pa@@ g@@ ne gl@@ as@@ ses ."
"And it &apos;s a very speci@@ al space , because it &apos;s this we@@ ird space in the front ."
The j@@ oke isn &apos;t a j@@ oke .
"You can &apos;t find the se@@ ams on the fic@@ tion , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fic@@ tion that &apos;s col@@ on@@ ized the real world ."
I see it as kind of a book in three d@@ im@@ en@@ sions .
"There &apos;s a ter@@ m called me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tion , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and me@@ ta &apos;s having a moment now ."
"I@@ ts last big moment was probably in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s with no@@ ve@@ l@@ ists like J@@ o@@ h@@ n B@@ ar@@ th and W@@ il@@ li@@ am G@@ ad@@ d@@ is , but it &apos;s been around ."
It &apos;s almost as old as stor@@ y@@ telling itself .
And one me@@ ta@@ fic@@ tive tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is bre@@ aking the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all . Right ?
"It &apos;s when an ac@@ tor will turn to the au@@ dience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an ac@@ tor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . &quot; &quot; And even that supp@@ o@@ se@@ dly hon@@ est moment , I would ar@@ gu@@ e , is in serv@@ ice of the li@@ e , but it &apos;s supp@@ o@@ sed to fore@@ ground the ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ ality of the fic@@ tion ."
"For me , I kind of pre@@ fer the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"If I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak down the f@@ our@@ th w@@ all , I want fic@@ tion to es@@ cap@@ e and come into the real world ."
I want a book to be a se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or that open@@ s and le@@ ts the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my book@@ s .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; B@@ il@@ ly T@@ wit@@ ters and his B@@ lu@@ e W@@ ha@@ le P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a ki@@ d who gets a blu@@ e wha@@ le as a pe@@ t but it &apos;s a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and it ru@@ ins his life .
So it &apos;s de@@ li@@ vered over@@ night by F@@ ed@@ U@@ p .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
He lives in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o — very t@@ ough city to own a blu@@ e wha@@ le in .
"A lot of h@@ ill@@ s , real est@@ ate is at a pre@@ mi@@ um ."
"This market &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y , everybody ."
"But under@@ ne@@ ath the j@@ ac@@ ke@@ t is this case , and that &apos;s the co@@ ver under@@ ne@@ ath the book , the j@@ ac@@ ke@@ t , and there &apos;s an ad that off@@ ers a free 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day ris@@ k@@ -@@ free tri@@ al for a blu@@ e wha@@ le ."
And you can just se@@ nd in a self-@@ ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed sta@@ m@@ p@@ ed en@@ velo@@ p@@ e and we &apos;ll se@@ nd you a wha@@ le .
And kids do write in .
"So here &apos;s a le@@ t@@ ter . It says , &quot; &quot; De@@ ar people , I be@@ t you 10 bu@@ cks you won &apos;t se@@ nd me a blu@@ e wha@@ le ."
"E@@ li@@ ot G@@ an@@ n@@ on ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what E@@ li@@ ot and the other kids who se@@ nd these in get back is a le@@ t@@ ter in very small pr@@ int from a Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an la@@ w fir@@ m — ( Laughter ) — that says that du@@ e to a change in cus@@ tom@@ s la@@ ws , their wha@@ le has been he@@ ld up in S@@ o@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d , which is a very lo@@ vely f@@ j@@ or@@ d , and then it just kind of tal@@ ks about S@@ o@@ g@@ ne@@ f@@ j@@ or@@ d and Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an food for a little while . It dig@@ res@@ ses . ( Laughter )@@ "
But it fin@@ i@@ sh@@ es off by saying that your wha@@ le would love to hear from you .
"He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a mes@@ sage ."
"And when you call and leave him a mes@@ sage , you just , on the out@@ going mes@@ sage , it &apos;s just wha@@ le soun@@ ds and then a be@@ e@@ p , which actually soun@@ ds a lot like a wha@@ le sound ."
And they get a picture of their wha@@ le too .
"So this is R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h , and R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h be@@ lon@@ gs to a ki@@ d nam@@ ed N@@ ic@@ o who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s mes@@ sage ."
This is the first mes@@ sage I ever got from N@@ ic@@ o .
"( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ e@@ ll@@ o , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I am your o@@ w@@ ner , R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h . H@@ e@@ ll@@ o ."
"So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you so@@ on another day . B@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ a@@ c B@@ ar@@ net@@ t : So N@@ ic@@ o called back , like , an h@@ our later ."
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s mes@@ sa@@ ges .
"( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ e@@ ll@@ o , R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h , this is N@@ ic@@ o ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you for a long time , but I tal@@ ked to you on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , ye@@ ah , S@@ at@@ ur@@ day or S@@ un@@ day , so now I &apos;m call@@ ing you again to say he@@ ll@@ o and I won@@ der what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tom@@ or@@ row or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ B : So he did , he called back that day again ."
He &apos;s left over 25 mes@@ sa@@ ges for R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h over four years .
"You find out all about him and the gr@@ and@@ ma that he lo@@ ves and the gr@@ and@@ ma that he l@@ ik@@ es a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the cr@@ os@@ s@@ word pu@@ z@@ z@@ les that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more mes@@ sage from N@@ ic@@ o ."
This is the Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s mes@@ sage from N@@ ic@@ o .
"@@ &#91; Be@@ e@@ p &#93; ( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) N@@ ic@@ o : H@@ e@@ ll@@ o , R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h , sor@@ ry I ha@@ ven &apos;t tal@@ ked to you in a long time ."
"It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so bus@@ y because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a wha@@ le , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m call@@ ing you to just say , to w@@ ish you a mer@@ ry Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s ."
"So have a n@@ ice Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s , and b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ e , R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h . Goo@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"M@@ B : I actually got N@@ ic@@ o , I ha@@ dn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a mes@@ sage two days ago ."
"H@@ is vo@@ ice is completely different , but he put his bab@@ ys@@ it@@ ter on the phone , and she was very n@@ ice to R@@ an@@ do@@ l@@ p@@ h as well ."
But N@@ ic@@ o &apos;s the best re@@ a@@ der I could hope for .
I would want any@@ one I was wr@@ iting for to be in that place emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally with the things that I create .
"I feel lu@@ c@@ ky . K@@ i@@ ds like N@@ ic@@ o are the best re@@ a@@ ders , and they de@@ ser@@ ve the best stories we can give them ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) Thank you . O@@ o@@ h , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; P@@ he@@ w , p@@ he@@ w , cal@@ m down .

"Well , what I &apos;m doing is contro@@ lling the p@@ it@@ ch with my left hand ."
"S@@ e@@ e , the clo@@ ser I get to this an@@ ten@@ na , the high@@ er the not@@ e gets — ( P@@ or@@ ta@@ men@@ to ) — and you can get it really low ."

"( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are com@@ mon@@ ly asked ; there are so many ."
"And ... Well , I gu@@ ess I could tell you a little of the history of the the@@ re@@ m@@ in ."
"It was inven@@ ted around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the inven@@ tor , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ e@@ re@@ m@@ in — he also was a mus@@ ic@@ ian be@@ side@@ s an inven@@ tor — he came up with the idea for making the the@@ re@@ m@@ in , I think , when he was working on some sh@@ or@@ t@@ wa@@ ve ra@@ di@@ os ."
"And there &apos;d be that sound in the sig@@ nal — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ e@@ ching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an in@@ stru@@ ment , because there are p@@ it@@ ches in it . &quot; &quot; And so some@@ how through develop@@ ing that , he ev@@ en@@ tually came to make the the@@ re@@ m@@ in the way it is now ."
"And a lot of times , even kids no@@ wa@@ days , they &apos;ll make re@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce to a the@@ re@@ m@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ f@@ i hor@@ ro@@ r movi@@ es , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( W@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o@@ -@@ ho@@ o ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a fun@@ n@@ y , go@@ of@@ y sound to do ."
"And sometimes if I have too much co@@ ffe@@ e , then my vi@@ br@@ ato gets out of hand ."
You &apos;re really sen@@ s@@ itive to your body and its fun@@ c@@ tions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to sta@@ y so still if you want to have the most control .
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of the b@@ al@@ an@@ cing act ear@@ li@@ er on — what M@@ i@@ cha@@ el was doing — because you &apos;re f@@ igh@@ ting so hard to keep the b@@ al@@ ance with what you &apos;re pla@@ ying with and sta@@ y in tun@@ e , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to foc@@ us so much on being in tun@@ e all the time ; you want to be feel@@ ing the music ."
"And then also , you &apos;re trying to sta@@ y very , very , very still because little mo@@ ve@@ ments with other parts of your body will a@@ ffe@@ ct the p@@ it@@ ch , or sometimes if you &apos;re ho@@ l@@ ding a low not@@ e — ( T@@ one ris@@ ing out of key ) — and bre@@ a@@ thing will make it ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) If I pas@@ s out on the next son@@ g ... ( Laughter )
"I think of it almost like like a yo@@ ga in@@ stru@@ ment because it makes you so a@@ ware of every little cra@@ z@@ y thing your body is doing , or just a@@ ware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re pla@@ ying ; you don &apos;t want to have any su@@ d@@ den mo@@ ve@@ ments ."
"And if I go to a clu@@ b and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; Here , have some d@@ rin@@ ks on us ! &quot;"
"And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on so@@ on ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( T@@ ee@@ ter@@ ing ton@@ es ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does re@@ f@@ le@@ ct the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ..@@ ."
"@@ it &apos;s sim@@ il@@ ar to being a v@@ oc@@ al@@ ist , ex@@ cept instead of it coming out of your th@@ ro@@ at , you &apos;re contro@@ lling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of re@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce ; you &apos;re always rel@@ ying on your e@@ ars and ad@@ j@@ us@@ ting con@@ stan@@ tly ."

I &apos;m very for@@ tun@@ ate to be here .
I feel so for@@ tun@@ ate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pres@@ sed by the kin@@ d@@ ness ex@@ pres@@ sed to me .
"I called my wi@@ fe L@@ es@@ li@@ e , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good ."
It feel@@ s like I &apos;ve lan@@ ded in a col@@ on@@ y of an@@ ge@@ ls . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feel@@ ing .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clo@@ ck is run@@ ning .
"I &apos;m a public school teach@@ er , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ in@@ ten@@ den@@ t ."
"H@@ er name is P@@ am M@@ or@@ an in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , the foo@@ th@@ ill@@ s of the B@@ lu@@ e R@@ i@@ dge M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
And she &apos;s a very high@@ -@@ te@@ ch super@@ in@@ ten@@ den@@ t .
"S@@ he u@@ ses smar@@ t bo@@ ar@@ ds , she blo@@ gs , she T@@ wee@@ ts , she does F@@ ace@@ book , she does all this sort of high@@ -@@ te@@ ch stuff ."
She &apos;s a technology lea@@ der and in@@ struc@@ ti@@ onal lea@@ der .
"But in her off@@ ice , there &apos;s this old wo@@ o@@ den , we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , kit@@ ch@@ en table — pe@@ el@@ ing green pa@@ int , it &apos;s kind of r@@ ic@@ ke@@ ty ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a mo@@ der@@ n , cu@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ -@@ e@@ dge person ."
"W@@ hy is this old table in your off@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I gre@@ w up in S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ tern V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , in the co@@ al min@@ es and the far@@ m@@ lan@@ ds of r@@ ural V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and this table was in my gr@@ and@@ father &apos;s kit@@ ch@@ en ."
"And we &apos;d come in from pla@@ ying , he &apos;d come in from plo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d s@@ it around that table every night ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , I heard so much knowledge and so many in@@ s@@ ights and so much w@@ is@@ dom come out around this table , I began to call it the w@@ is@@ dom table ."
"And when he pas@@ sed on , I took this table with me and br@@ ought it to my off@@ ice , and it re@@ min@@ ds me of him ."
"It re@@ min@@ ds me of what goes on around an em@@ p@@ ty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the Wor@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ ame , and essen@@ ti@@ ally it is also an em@@ p@@ ty space ."
"And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 2@@ 1@@ st century w@@ is@@ dom table , really ."
It all started back in 19@@ 7@@ 7 .
"I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ pp@@ ing in and out of col@@ le@@ ge ."
"And my parents were very pati@@ ent , but I had been doing inter@@ mit@@ tent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a my@@ st@@ ical qu@@ est ."
"And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flo@@ wing ro@@ bes and my big be@@ ard and my J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on gl@@ as@@ ses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al en@@ l@@ igh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , da@@ d ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they p@@ lea@@ ded with me to get a de@@ gre@@ e in something ."
So I got a de@@ gre@@ e and it turned out to be education .
It was an experim@@ en@@ tal education pro@@ gram .
"It could have been den@@ t@@ is@@ try , but the word &quot; &quot; experim@@ en@@ tal &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for ."
"And I went in for a job inter@@ view in the R@@ ich@@ mon@@ d P@@ u@@ bli@@ c S@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , the cap@@ ital city , b@@ ought a th@@ ree@@ -@@ piece su@@ it — my con@@ ces@@ sion to con@@ ven@@ tion — ke@@ pt my long be@@ ard and my af@@ ro and my pl@@ at@@ form sho@@ es — at the time it was the &apos; 7@@ 0s — and I wal@@ ked in , and I s@@ at down and had an inter@@ view ."
"And I gu@@ ess they were hard up for teach@@ ers because the super@@ vis@@ or , her name was An@@ na Ar@@ o , said I had the job teach@@ ing gi@@ f@@ ted children ."
"And I was so sho@@ c@@ ked , so st@@ un@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , th@@ ank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) G@@ i@@ f@@ ted education ha@@ dn &apos;t really taken hold too much ."
There we@@ ren &apos;t really many materi@@ als or things to use .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer sho@@ c@@ ked me . It st@@ un@@ ned me ."
H@@ er answer set the tem@@ pl@@ ate for the entire care@@ er I was to have after that .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question c@@ lear@@ ed the space ."
"There was no pro@@ gram di@@ rec@@ tive , no man@@ u@@ al to fol@@ low , no stan@@ dar@@ ds in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way ."
"And she c@@ lear@@ ed such a space that I en@@ de@@ av@@ ore@@ d from then on to clear a space for my students , an em@@ p@@ ty space , whe@@ re@@ by they could create and make me@@ an@@ ing out of their own under@@ standing ."
"So this happened in 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and I was teach@@ ing many years later , and a friend of min@@ e in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed me to a young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker ."
H@@ is name is Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ ina .
Ch@@ r@@ is F@@ ar@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
"C@@ h@@ r@@ is , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , vis@@ i@@ on@@ ary fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker who &apos;s made a fil@@ m ."
( Applause ) This fil@@ m is called &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ld Pe@@ ace and O@@ ther 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ chi@@ e@@ ve@@ ments . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ po@@ sed the fil@@ m to me — it &apos;s a great t@@ it@@ le .
"He pro@@ po@@ sed the fil@@ m to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local T@@ V , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the fil@@ m has really gone places ."
"Now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but Ch@@ r@@ is has man@@ ag@@ ed , through his own sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice , to get this fil@@ m out ."
"So we made a fil@@ m and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teach@@ er ."
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ sta@@ ment to teach@@ ing and teach@@ ers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
"And the st@@ range thing is , when I wat@@ ch the fil@@ m — I have the e@@ er@@ ie sen@@ s@@ ation of seeing it — I saw myself liter@@ ally dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
What I saw was my teach@@ ers coming through me .
"I saw my ge@@ ome@@ try teach@@ er in high school , M@@ r@@ . R@@ u@@ cell &apos;s wr@@ y s@@ mi@@ le under his han@@ d@@ le@@ ba@@ r mus@@ tach@@ e ."
That &apos;s the s@@ mi@@ le I use — that &apos;s his s@@ mi@@ le .
I saw J@@ an P@@ ol@@ o &apos;s f@@ la@@ shing eyes .
"And they we@@ ren &apos;t f@@ la@@ shing in an@@ ger , they were f@@ la@@ shing in love , in@@ ten@@ se love for her students ."
And I have that kind of fl@@ as@@ h sometimes .
And I saw M@@ is@@ s E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ an@@ ks who wor@@ e pe@@ ar@@ ls and high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ s to ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school every day .
"And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school teach@@ er st@@ are ."
You know the one .
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teach@@ er ?"
"I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ to@@ ire ."
And M@@ is@@ s B@@ an@@ ks was there as a great men@@ tor for me .
"And then I saw my own parents , my first teach@@ ers ."
"My father , very inven@@ tive , sp@@ ati@@ al thin@@ ker ."
That &apos;s my bro@@ ther M@@ al@@ col@@ m there on the right .
"And my mother , who ta@@ ught me in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de in se@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted s@@ cho@@ ols in V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , who was my insp@@ ir@@ ation ."
"And really , I feel as though , when I see the fil@@ m — I have a ge@@ st@@ ure she does , like this — I feel like I am a contin@@ u@@ ation of her ge@@ st@@ ure ."
I am one of her teach@@ ing ge@@ stu@@ res .
"And the beautiful thing was , I got to te@@ ach my da@@ ughter in ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school , Ma@@ de@@ line ."
And so that ge@@ st@@ ure of my mother &apos;s contin@@ u@@ es through many gener@@ ations .
It &apos;s an amazing feel@@ ing to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shou@@ l@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this Wor@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
"It started out like this : it &apos;s just a f@@ our@@ -@@ foo@@ t by fi@@ ve@@ -@@ foo@@ t pl@@ y@@ wo@@ od bo@@ ard in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city ur@@ ban school , 19@@ 7@@ 8 ."
I was cre@@ ating a les@@ son for students on Africa .
"We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them sol@@ ve it ."
I didn &apos;t want to lec@@ ture or have just book read@@ ing .
I wanted to have them be im@@ mer@@ sed and learn the feel@@ ing of learning through their bo@@ dies .
"So I thought , well they like to play ga@@ m@@ es ."
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say inter@@ ac@@ tive ; we didn &apos;t have that ter@@ m in 19@@ 7@@ 8 — but something inter@@ ac@@ tive .
"And so we made the game , and it has since ev@@ olved to a f@@ our@@ -@@ foo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ foo@@ t by f@@ our@@ -@@ foo@@ t P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as@@ s structure ."
And it has four P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as@@ s la@@ y@@ ers .
There &apos;s an ou@@ ter space la@@ y@@ er with black ho@@ les and sa@@ te@@ ll@@ it@@ es and research sa@@ te@@ ll@@ it@@ es and as@@ te@@ ro@@ id min@@ ing .
"There &apos;s an air and space level with cl@@ ou@@ ds that are big pu@@ f@@ f@@ s of c@@ ot@@ ton we p@@ us@@ h around and ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al air sp@@ ac@@ es and air for@@ ces , a ground and se@@ a level with thousands of game pie@@ ces on it — even an under@@ se@@ a level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ se@@ a min@@ ing ."
There are four countries around the bo@@ ard .
The kids make up the nam@@ es of the countries — some are r@@ ich ; some are po@@ or .
"They have different as@@ se@@ ts , comm@@ er@@ cial and mil@@ it@@ ary ."
And each country has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
"There &apos;s a P@@ r@@ ime M@@ in@@ is@@ ter , S@@ e@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of S@@ tate , M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of D@@ ef@@ en@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or C@@ om@@ p@@ tro@@ l@@ ler ."
I cho@@ ose the P@@ r@@ ime M@@ in@@ is@@ ter based on my relation@@ ship with them .
"I off@@ er them the job , they can turn it down , and then they cho@@ ose their own c@@ ab@@ in@@ et ."
"There &apos;s a Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , ar@@ ms de@@ al@@ ers and a United N@@ ations ."
There &apos;s also a we@@ a@@ ther go@@ d@@ de@@ ss who contro@@ ls a ran@@ dom sto@@ ck market and ran@@ dom we@@ a@@ ther .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ pa@@ ge cr@@ is@@ is doc@@ um@@ ent with 50 inter@@ loc@@ king problems .
"So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes ."
"I th@@ row them into this complex ma@@ tri@@ x , and they tr@@ ust me because we have a dee@@ p , r@@ ich relation@@ ship together ."
"And so with all these c@@ ri@@ ses , we have — let &apos;s see — e@@ th@@ ni@@ c and min@@ or@@ ity ten@@ sions ; we have chem@@ ical and nu@@ clear sp@@ ill@@ s , nu@@ clear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s oil sp@@ ill@@ s , environ@@ mental dis@@ as@@ ters , water r@@ ights dis@@ pu@@ tes , bre@@ ak@@ away re@@ pu@@ bl@@ ics , fam@@ ine , en@@ dan@@ ge@@ red species and global war@@ ming ."
"If A@@ l G@@ ore is here , I &apos;m going to se@@ nd my f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders from A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and V@@ en@@ able s@@ cho@@ ols to you because they sol@@ ved global war@@ ming in a week ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it se@@ ver@@ al times too . ( Laughter )
"So I also have in the game a sa@@ bo@@ te@@ ur — some child — it &apos;s basically a tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker — and I have my tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to sa@@ ve the world and their pos@@ ition in the game ."
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ min@@ e everything in the game .
"And they do it se@@ cre@@ tly through mis@@ information and am@@ big@@ u@@ ities and ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ an@@ ci@@ es , trying to cause everyone to think more dee@@ p@@ ly ."
"The sa@@ bo@@ te@@ ur is there , and we also read from S@@ un T@@ zu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Ar@@ t of W@@ ar . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ ders understand it — nin@@ e years old — and they han@@ dle that and use that to understand how to , not fol@@ low — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and de@@ stru@@ ction , the pat@@ h to war ."
"They learn to over@@ look sh@@ or@@ t-@@ s@@ igh@@ ted re@@ ac@@ tions and imp@@ ul@@ sive thinking , to think in a lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m , more con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al way ."
"S@@ te@@ war@@ t B@@ r@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a C@@ o@@ E@@ v@@ olution Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly ar@@ tic@@ le on a pe@@ ace force ."
"And in the game , sometimes students actually form a pe@@ ace force ."
I &apos;m just a clo@@ ck wat@@ ch@@ er .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ er . I &apos;m just a fac@@ il@@ it@@ ator .
The students run the game .
I have no chan@@ ce to make any pol@@ ic@@ y wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever once they start pla@@ ying .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( V@@ ideo ) B@@ o@@ y : The Wor@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ ame is seri@@ ous .
You &apos;re actually getting ta@@ ught something like how to take care of the world .
"S@@ e@@ e , M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mes@@ sed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fi@@ x that problem ."
"@@ J@@ o@@ h@@ n H@@ un@@ ter : I o@@ ffe@@ red them a — ( Applause ) A@@ c@@ tually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer ."
And I ad@@ m@@ it the tru@@ th to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
"And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to di@@ g up the answer ."
And so I ap@@ o@@ log@@ ize to them as well .
"I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sor@@ ry , bo@@ ys and girls , but the tru@@ th is we have left this world to you in such a sa@@ d and ter@@ ri@@ ble sh@@ ape , and we hope you can fi@@ x it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a s@@ in@@ c@@ ere ap@@ o@@ logy , and they take it very seri@@ ously ."
Now you may be wonder@@ ing what all this comple@@ x@@ ity looks like .
"Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see ."
"( V@@ ideo ) J@@ H : All right , we &apos;re going into ne@@ got@@ i@@ ations as of now . G@@ o ."
"( C@@ hat@@ ter ) J@@ H : My question to you is , who &apos;s in char@@ ge of that clas@@ s@@ room ?"
It &apos;s a seri@@ ous question : who is really in char@@ ge ?
I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the clas@@ s@@ room over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a tr@@ ust and an under@@ standing and a de@@ dic@@ ation to an ide@@ al that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teach@@ er : control every con@@ vers@@ ation and respon@@ se in the clas@@ s@@ room .
"It &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible . Th@@ e@@ ir collec@@ tive w@@ is@@ dom is much gre@@ a@@ ter than min@@ e , and I ad@@ m@@ it it to them open@@ ly ."
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some mag@@ ical things that have happened .
"In this game we had a little girl , and she was the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of the po@@ ore@@ st n@@ ation ."
And the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se M@@ in@@ is@@ ter — she had the tan@@ k cor@@ ps and A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce and so for@@ th .
"And she was next do@@ or to a very we@@ al@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ r@@ ich ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ation , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly she atta@@ c@@ ked , against her P@@ r@@ ime M@@ in@@ is@@ ter &apos;s or@@ ders , the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or &apos;s oil fi@@ el@@ ds ."
"S@@ he mar@@ ched into the oil field re@@ ser@@ ves , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded it , without fir@@ ing a sho@@ t , and se@@ cu@@ red it and he@@ ld it ."
And that ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or was un@@ able to con@@ du@@ ct any mil@@ it@@ ary oper@@ ations because their fu@@ el supp@@ ly was loc@@ ked up .
"We were all up@@ set with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?"
"This is the Wor@@ ld Pe@@ ace G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nin@@ e years old , she he@@ ld her pie@@ ces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; T@@ o her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that ."
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
"And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cr@@ oss a nin@@ e ye@@ ar-@@ old girl with tan@@ ks ."
( Laughter ) They are the t@@ oug@@ he@@ st op@@ pon@@ ents .
And we were very up@@ set .
I thought I was fail@@ ing as a teach@@ er . Why would she do this ?
"But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation peri@@ od with all te@@ ams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in ne@@ got@@ i@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day ."
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this maj@@ or country was plan@@ ning a mil@@ it@@ ary off@@ en@@ sive to dom@@ in@@ ate the entire world .
"H@@ ad they had their fu@@ el supp@@ lies , they would have done it ."
She was able to see the ve@@ c@@ tors and tre@@ nd l@@ ines and in@@ ten@@ tions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical decis@@ ion to atta@@ ck in a pe@@ ace game .
"Now she used a small war to a@@ ver@@ t a lar@@ ger war , so we sto@@ pped and had a very good ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical dis@@ cus@@ sion about whether that was right , con@@ diti@@ onal good , or not right ."
"That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the s@@ itu@@ ations ."
I could not have desig@@ ned that in teach@@ ing it .
It came about spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously through their collec@@ tive w@@ is@@ dom .
"( Applause ) A@@ no@@ ther example , a beautiful thing happened ."
We have a le@@ t@@ ter in the game .
"If you &apos;re a mil@@ it@@ ary com@@ man@@ der and you wa@@ ge tro@@ op@@ s — the little pla@@ stic to@@ ys on the bo@@ ard — and you l@@ ose them , I put in a le@@ t@@ ter ."
You have to write a le@@ t@@ ter to their parents — the fic@@ ti@@ onal parents of your fic@@ ti@@ onal tro@@ op@@ s — expla@@ ining what happened and of@@ fer@@ ing your con@@ do@@ l@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to com@@ b@@ at .
"And so we had this s@@ itu@@ ation come up — last sum@@ mer actually , at A@@ g@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t S@@ ch@@ ool in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le C@@ oun@@ ty — and one of our mil@@ it@@ ary com@@ man@@ ders got up to read that le@@ t@@ ter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r@@ . H@@ un@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a par@@ ent vis@@ iting that day , just sitting in the back of the room ."
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mo@@ m to read the le@@ t@@ ter .
"It &apos;ll be more re@@ al@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she ga@@ me@@ ly pic@@ ked up the le@@ t@@ ter ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started read@@ ing . She read one sen@@ ten@@ ce .
She read two sen@@ ten@@ ces .
"B@@ y the third sen@@ ten@@ ce , she was in te@@ ars ."
I was in te@@ ars .
"E@@ very@@ body under@@ sto@@ od that when we l@@ ose somebody , the win@@ ners are not g@@ lo@@ ating ."
We all l@@ ose .
And it was an amazing oc@@ curren@@ ce and an amazing under@@ standing .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend D@@ a@@ vi@@ d says about this .
He &apos;s been in many bat@@ t@@ les .
( V@@ ideo ) D@@ a@@ vi@@ d : We &apos;ve really had enough of people atta@@ c@@ king .
"I mean , we &apos;ve been lu@@ c@@ ky &#91; most of &#93; the time ."
But now I &apos;m feel@@ ing really we@@ ird because I &apos;m living what S@@ un T@@ zu said one week .
"One week he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose who go into bat@@ tle and w@@ in will want to go back , and those who l@@ ose in bat@@ tle will want to go back and w@@ in . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been win@@ ning bat@@ t@@ les , so I &apos;m going into bat@@ t@@ les , more bat@@ t@@ les ."
And I think it &apos;s sort of we@@ ird to be living what S@@ un T@@ zu said .
J@@ H : I get ch@@ ill@@ s every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of enga@@ ge@@ ment you want to have happen .
"And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t pl@@ an that , and I can &apos;t even test that ."
But it &apos;s self-@@ ev@@ ident as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an au@@ th@@ en@@ tic as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment of learning .
"We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go be@@ yon@@ d data with the real tru@@ th of what &apos;s going on ."
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ nan .
"We had pla@@ yed the game one ses@@ sion after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essen@@ ti@@ ally sol@@ ved all 50 of the inter@@ loc@@ king c@@ ri@@ ses ."
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be sol@@ ved and every country &apos;s as@@ set val@@ ue has to be incre@@ a@@ sed ab@@ o@@ ve its star@@ ting point .
"S@@ ome are po@@ or , some are we@@ al@@ thy . There are bil@@ lions ."
The Wor@@ ld B@@ ank pres@@ ident was a th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gra@@ der one time .
"He says , &quot; &quot; How many zer@@ os in a tr@@ illion ? I &apos;ve got to cal@@ cul@@ ate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was se@@ tting f@@ is@@ c@@ al pol@@ ic@@ y in that game for high school pla@@ y@@ ers who were pla@@ ying with him ."
So the team that was the po@@ ore@@ st had got@@ ten even po@@ ore@@ r .
There was no way they could w@@ in .
"And we were appro@@ ach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , our cu@@ t-@@ off time — there was about a minu@@ te left — and de@@ sp@@ air just set@@ t@@ led over the room ."
"I thought , I &apos;m fail@@ ing as a teach@@ er ."
I should have got@@ ten it so they could have won .
They shou@@ ldn &apos;t be fail@@ ing like this .
I &apos;ve fail@@ ed them .
And I was just feel@@ ing so sa@@ d and de@@ je@@ cted .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , B@@ ren@@ nan wal@@ ked over to my ch@@ air and he gr@@ ab@@ bed the be@@ ll , the be@@ ll I r@@ ing to sig@@ nal a change or a re@@ con@@ ven@@ ing of c@@ ab@@ in@@ e@@ ts , and he ran back to his se@@ at , ran@@ g the be@@ ll ."
"E@@ very@@ body ran to his ch@@ air : there was scre@@ am@@ ing ; there was ye@@ lling , wa@@ ving of their d@@ os@@ si@@ ers ."
They get these d@@ os@@ si@@ ers full of se@@ cre@@ t doc@@ um@@ ents .
They were ge@@ st@@ ic@@ ul@@ ating ; they were run@@ ning around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my clas@@ s@@ room .
"P@@ rin@@ ci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in , I &apos;m out of a job ."
The parents were looking in the win@@ do@@ w .
And B@@ ren@@ nan run@@ s back to his se@@ at . E@@ very@@ body run@@ s back to their se@@ at .
"He rin@@ gs the be@@ ll again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 secon@@ ds left on the clo@@ ck — &quot; &quot; we have , all n@@ ations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together ."
And we &apos;ve got 6@@ 00 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to off@@ er it as a don@@ ation to this po@@ or country .
"And if they ac@@ cept it , it &apos;ll ra@@ ise their as@@ set val@@ ue and we can w@@ in the game ."
W@@ ill you ac@@ cept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three secon@@ ds left on the clo@@ ck .
"E@@ very@@ body looks at this pr@@ ime min@@ is@@ ter of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won ."
"S@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous comp@@ as@@ sion that could not be plan@@ ned for , that was un@@ expe@@ cted and un@@ predic@@ table ."
E@@ very game we play is different .
"S@@ ome ga@@ m@@ es are more about social issu@@ es , some are more about economic issu@@ es ."
S@@ ome ga@@ m@@ es are more about war@@ f@@ are .
But I don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that reality of being human .
"I al@@ low them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a blo@@ od@@ less way , how not to do what they conside@@ r to be the wrong thing ."
"And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves ."
"And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pic@@ k up a cr@@ it@@ ical thinking too@@ l or cre@@ ative thinking too@@ l from this game and le@@ verage something good for the world , they may sa@@ ve us all ."
If only .
"And on be@@ half of all of my teach@@ ers on wh@@ ose shou@@ l@@ ders I &apos;m standing , th@@ ank you . Thank you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small to@@ wn ki@@ d .
"I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story ."
He lives in a small vil@@ la@@ ge in sou@@ ther@@ n S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a .
H@@ is vil@@ la@@ ge is ne@@ ar M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu .
D@@ r@@ ought dri@@ ves the small vil@@ la@@ ge into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ in@@ k of star@@ v@@ ation .
"W@@ it@@ h nothing left for him there , he lea@@ ves for the big city , in this case , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu , the cap@@ ital of S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a ."
"When he ar@@ ri@@ ves , there are no opportun@@ ities , no j@@ ob@@ s , no way for@@ ward ."
He ends up living in a tent city on the out@@ s@@ kir@@ ts of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu .
"M@@ a@@ ybe a year pas@@ ses , nothing ."
"One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man who off@@ ers to take him to l@@ un@@ ch , then to din@@ ner , to bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
"He mee@@ ts this d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic group of people , and they give him a bre@@ ak ."
"He &apos;s given a bit of money to bu@@ y him@@ self some new clo@@ the@@ s , money to se@@ nd back home to his family ."
He is in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to this young woman .
He ev@@ en@@ tually gets mar@@ ri@@ ed .
He star@@ ts this new life .
He has a pur@@ p@@ ose in life .
"One beautiful day in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu , under an a@@ zure blu@@ e s@@ ky , a car b@@ om@@ b goes off ."
"That small to@@ wn ki@@ d with the big city dre@@ ams was the su@@ ic@@ ide b@@ om@@ ber , and that d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b , a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist organiz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
So how does the story of a small to@@ wn ki@@ d just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing him@@ self up ?
He was wa@@ iting .
"He was wa@@ iting for an opportunity , wa@@ iting to be@@ gin his future , wa@@ iting for a way for@@ ward , and this was the first thing that came along ."
This was the first thing that p@@ ul@@ led him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d .
And his story re@@ pe@@ ats itself in ur@@ ban cen@@ ters around the world .
"It is the story of the di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ chi@@ sed , un@@ em@@ plo@@ yed ur@@ ban you@@ th who s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in J@@ o@@ han@@ ne@@ s@@ bur@@ g , s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in L@@ on@@ don , who re@@ ach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d ."
"For young people , the pr@@ om@@ ise of the city , the big city dre@@ am is that of opportunity , of j@@ ob@@ s , of we@@ al@@ th , but young people are not shar@@ ing in the pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity of their cities ."
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s you@@ th who su@@ f@@ fer from the hig@@ he@@ st un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ra@@ tes .
"B@@ y 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 ."
"If we do not inclu@@ de young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not pro@@ vi@@ de them opportun@@ ities , the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d , the ga@@ te@@ way to ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , to viol@@ ence , to gan@@ gs , will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0 ."
"And in my city of bir@@ th , M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu , 70 percent of young people su@@ f@@ fer from un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."
"@@ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school ."
They pretty much do nothing .
"I went back to M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu last mon@@ th , and I went to vis@@ it M@@ ad@@ ina H@@ os@@ p@@ ital , the hos@@ p@@ ital I was born in ."
"I remember standing in front of that bu@@ l@@ le@@ t-@@ ri@@ d@@ den hos@@ p@@ ital thinking , what if I had never left ?"
What if I had been for@@ ced into that same state of wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d ?
W@@ ou@@ ld I have become a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a you@@ th lea@@ der@@ ship and ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it .
I br@@ ought together about 90 young S@@ o@@ ma@@ l@@ i lea@@ ders .
We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ stor@@ med on solu@@ tions to the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
"He went to uni@@ versity in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu , gra@@ du@@ ated ."
"There were no j@@ ob@@ s , no opportun@@ ities ."
"I remember him telling me , because he was a col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ate , un@@ em@@ plo@@ yed , fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted , that he was the perfe@@ ct tar@@ get for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist organiz@@ ations , to be rec@@ ru@@ ited ."
They sou@@ g@@ h@@ t people like him out .
But his story takes a different rou@@ te .
"In M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu , the big@@ gest bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads ."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l war have completely de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed the ro@@ ad system , and a mot@@ or@@ b@@ ike can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get around ."
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ ized it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ b@@ ike company .
He began ren@@ ting out mot@@ or@@ b@@ ik@@ es to local res@@ iden@@ ts who couldn &apos;t norma@@ lly af@@ for@@ d them .
"He b@@ ought 10 b@@ ik@@ es , with the help of family and friends , and his dre@@ am is to ev@@ en@@ tually ex@@ p@@ and to se@@ ver@@ al hun@@ d@@ red within the next three years ."
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y and se@@ ize a new opportunity .
"It &apos;s ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship , and I believe ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship can be the most powerful too@@ l against wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d ."
It em@@ po@@ wers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very economic opportun@@ ities they are so des@@ per@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can tra@@ in young people to be ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s .
"I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my me@@ et@@ ings , M@@ o@@ ha@@ med M@@ o@@ ha@@ mou@@ d , a fl@@ or@@ ist ."
He was hel@@ ping me tra@@ in some of the young people at the sum@@ m@@ it in ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship and how to be innov@@ ative and how to create a culture of ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship .
"He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu has seen in over 2@@ 2 years , and until rec@@ ently , until M@@ o@@ ha@@ med came along , if you wanted flo@@ wers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used pla@@ stic bou@@ qu@@ e@@ ts shipp@@ ed from ab@@ ro@@ ad ."
"If you asked someone , &quot; W@@ hen was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h flo@@ wers ? &quot;"
"@@ for many who gre@@ w up under ci@@ vi@@ l war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So M@@ o@@ ha@@ med saw an opportunity ."
He started a lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al company .
"He created a far@@ m right outside of M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu , and started gro@@ wing tu@@ li@@ ps and l@@ il@@ ies , which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ s@@ h M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu climate ."
"And he began de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing flo@@ wers to we@@ d@@ d@@ ings , cre@@ ating gar@@ den@@ s at h@@ om@@ es and bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on cre@@ ating M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu &apos;s first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years ."
There &apos;s no public par@@ k in M@@ o@@ ga@@ di@@ shu .
"He wan@@ ts to create a space where famil@@ ies , young people , can come together , and , as he says , s@@ me@@ ll the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses ."
"And he doesn &apos;t grow ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way ."
"So the first step is to insp@@ ire young people , and in that room , M@@ o@@ ha@@ med &apos;s presen@@ ce had a really pro@@ found imp@@ act on the you@@ th in that room ."
They had never really thought about star@@ ting up a business .
"They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innov@@ ation , really had a str@@ ong imp@@ act on them ."
He for@@ ced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
"He em@@ po@@ we@@ red them to believe that they could be ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s , that they could be change mak@@ ers ."
"B@@ y the end of the day , they were coming up with innov@@ ative solu@@ tions to some of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges fac@@ ing their city ."
They came up with ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ i@@ al solu@@ tions to local problems .
"So insp@@ ir@@ ing young people and cre@@ ating a culture of ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a reality ."
They need exper@@ t@@ ise and men@@ tor@@ ship to gu@@ ide them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ching their bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses .
"C@@ on@@ ne@@ ct young people with the re@@ sources they need , pro@@ vi@@ de them the supp@@ ort they need to go from ide@@ ation to cre@@ ation , and you will create c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ sts for ur@@ ban growth ."
"For me , ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship is more than just star@@ ting up a business ."
It &apos;s about cre@@ ating a social imp@@ act .
M@@ o@@ ha@@ med is not simply se@@ lling flo@@ wers .
I believe he is se@@ lling hope .
"H@@ is Pe@@ ace P@@ ar@@ k , and that &apos;s what he call@@ s it , when it &apos;s created , will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city ."
A@@ den hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help ren@@ t out and ma@@ inta@@ in those b@@ ik@@ es for him .
He gave them the opportunity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is of wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d .
These young ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s are having a tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s imp@@ act in their cities .
"So my sug@@ ge@@ st@@ ion is , turn you@@ th into ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ he@@ ren@@ t innov@@ ation , and you will have more stories of flo@@ wers and Pe@@ ace P@@ ar@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d ."
Thank you .

"O@@ kay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play ."
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realiz@@ e there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
"( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) O@@ kay , so first of all , let &apos;s we@@ l@@ come M@@ r@@ . J@@ am@@ ire W@@ il@@ li@@ ams on the dru@@ ms , ( Applause ) B@@ ur@@ nis@@ s T@@ ra@@ v@@ is on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and M@@ r@@ . Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an S@@ an@@ ds on the pi@@ ano . ( Applause )@@ "
"So the ban@@ d@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredi@@ ble space ."
It is really a sa@@ cre@@ d space .
"And one of the things that is really sa@@ cre@@ d about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past ."
You really are al@@ ive right here in this moment .
There are so many decis@@ ions being made when you walk on the ban@@ d@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
"In the middle , we sort of made our way into a son@@ g called &quot; &quot; T@@ it@@ i B@@ oo@@ m . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not ."
E@@ very@@ one &apos;s lis@@ ten@@ ing . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for pro@@ je@@ cted ideas .
"So the idea of a mis@@ take : F@@ rom the per@@ spe@@ ctive of a ja@@ z@@ z mus@@ ic@@ ian , it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to talk about someone else &apos;s mis@@ take ."
"So the way I per@@ ce@@ ive a mis@@ take when I &apos;m on the ban@@ d@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mis@@ take ."
The only mis@@ take lies in that I &apos;m not able to per@@ ce@@ ive what it is that someone else did .
E@@ very &quot; &quot; mis@@ take &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in ja@@ z@@ z .
So it &apos;s hard to even descri@@ be what a fun@@ n@@ y not@@ e would be .
"So for example , if I pla@@ yed a col@@ or , like we were pla@@ ying on a p@@ al@@ et@@ te , that soun@@ ded like this ..@@ ."
( Mus@@ ic ) So if Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an pla@@ yed a not@@ e — like play an F@@ . ( Mus@@ ic )
"S@@ e@@ e , these are all right inside of the col@@ or p@@ al@@ et@@ te ."
If you pla@@ yed an E@@ .
"S@@ e@@ e , these all li@@ e right inside of this gener@@ al emot@@ i@@ onal p@@ al@@ et@@ te that we were pain@@ ting ."
"If you pla@@ yed an F # though , ( D@@ is@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s e@@ ars , they would per@@ ce@@ ive that as a mis@@ take ."
"So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second ."
And we &apos;re going to play on this p@@ al@@ et@@ te .
"And at some point , Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce this not@@ e ."
And we won &apos;t re@@ act to it .
"He &apos;ll in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second ."
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this p@@ al@@ et@@ te .
( Mus@@ ic ) So someone could con@@ cep@@ tually per@@ ce@@ ive that as a mis@@ take .
The only way that I would say it was a mis@@ take is in that we didn &apos;t re@@ act to it .
It was an opportunity that was mis@@ sed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table . We &apos;ll pa@@ int this p@@ al@@ et@@ te again .
"He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll re@@ act to it , but something will change ."
"We &apos;ll all ac@@ cept his ideas , or not ."
"( Mus@@ ic ) So you see , he pla@@ yed this not@@ e ."
I en@@ ded up cre@@ ating a me@@ lo@@ dy out of it .
The te@@ x@@ ture changed in the dru@@ ms this time .
"It got a little bit more r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ c , a little bit more in@@ ten@@ se in respon@@ se to how I respon@@ ded to it ."
So there is no mis@@ take .
"The only mis@@ take is if I &apos;m not a@@ ware , if each individu@@ al mus@@ ic@@ ian is not a@@ ware and ac@@ cep@@ ting enough of his fe@@ l@@ low b@@ and member to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate the idea and we don &apos;t al@@ low for cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity ."
"So ja@@ z@@ z , this ban@@ d@@ stand is absolu@@ tely amazing ."
It &apos;s a very pur@@ i@@ f@@ ying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for gr@@ an@@ ted .
We know that to be able to come on the ban@@ d@@ stand and play music is a b@@ les@@ sing .
So how does this all rel@@ ate to behavi@@ or@@ al fin@@ ance ?
"Well we &apos;re ja@@ z@@ z mus@@ ic@@ ians , so ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ pic@@ ally we don &apos;t have a great relation@@ ship to fin@@ ance ."
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we han@@ dle it ."
And the other d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic of it is that we don &apos;t mic@@ r@@ om@@ an@@ age in ja@@ z@@ z .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually lim@@ its the art@@ is@@ tic possi@@ bil@@ ities .
"If I come up and I dic@@ tate to the b@@ and that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just j@@ um@@ p right in ..@@ ."
"@@ ready , just play some time ."
"One , two , one , two , three , four ."
( Mus@@ ic ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ ot@@ ic because I &apos;m bu@@ ll@@ ying my ideas .
"I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to lis@@ ten ."
This is a science of lis@@ ten@@ ing .
It has far more to do with what I can per@@ ce@@ ive than what it is that I can do .
"So if I want the music to get to a certain level of in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity , the first step for me is to be pati@@ ent , to lis@@ ten to what &apos;s going on and pu@@ ll from something that &apos;s going on around me ."
"When you do that , you enga@@ ge and insp@@ ire the other mus@@ ic@@ ians and they give you more , and gra@@ du@@ ally it buil@@ ds ."
"W@@ at@@ ch . One , two , a one , two , three , four ."
( Mus@@ ic ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m p@@ ul@@ ling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organ@@ ic . It &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
It &apos;s not about bu@@ ll@@ ying my vision or anything like that .
"It &apos;s about being here in the moment , ac@@ cep@@ ting one another and allo@@ wing cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity to f@@ low ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ ges is to innov@@ ate fund@@ am@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one teach@@ er didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
"I want to say that really and tru@@ ly , after these incredi@@ ble spe@@ e@@ ches and ideas that are being spre@@ ad , I am in the a@@ w@@ k@@ ward pos@@ ition of being here to talk to you today about te@@ le@@ vision ."
So most everyone wat@@ ches T@@ V .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
"H@@ ere in America , people actually love T@@ V ."
The a@@ verage American wat@@ ches T@@ V for almost 5 hours a day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now I happen to make my living these days in te@@ le@@ vision , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing ."
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
"They , in fact , ber@@ ate it ."
"They call it stu@@ pi@@ d , and wor@@ se , believe me ."
"My mother , gro@@ wing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; i@@ di@@ ot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to de@@ b@@ ate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good T@@ V or bad T@@ V ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe te@@ le@@ vision has a con@@ science ."
"So why I believe that te@@ le@@ vision has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that te@@ le@@ vision di@@ rec@@ tly re@@ f@@ lec@@ ts the mor@@ al , polit@@ ical , social and emot@@ i@@ onal need sta@@ tes of our n@@ ation — that te@@ le@@ vision is how we actually dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate our entire val@@ ue system ."
"So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ e@@ ly human , and they all ad@@ d up to our idea of con@@ science ."
"Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad T@@ V ."
We &apos;re talking about pop@@ ular T@@ V .
We &apos;re talking about to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted shows over the course of 50 years .
"@@ How do these N@@ i@@ el@@ sen r@@ at@@ ings re@@ f@@ le@@ ct not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collec@@ tive un@@ consci@@ ous , but how do these to@@ p@@ -@@ 10 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ ra@@ ted shows over 50 years re@@ f@@ le@@ ct the idea of our social con@@ science ?"
"@@ How does te@@ le@@ vision ev@@ ol@@ ve over time , and what does this say about our society ?"
"Now spe@@ aking of ev@@ olution , from bas@@ ic bio@@ logy , you probably remember that the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , inclu@@ ding humans , have four bas@@ ic pr@@ ima@@ l inst@@ in@@ cts ."
You have hun@@ ger ; you have se@@ x ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for ac@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ven@@ ess .
"As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve develop@@ ed , we &apos;ve ev@@ olved over time to tem@@ per , or ta@@ me , these bas@@ ic anima@@ l inst@@ in@@ cts ."
We have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to la@@ ug@@ h and cr@@ y .
"We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity ."
That is se@@ par@@ ate and ap@@ art from the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom .
The other thing about human be@@ ings is that we love to be en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ed .
We love to wat@@ ch T@@ V .
This is something that c@@ lear@@ ly se@@ para@@ tes us from the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom .
"A@@ n@@ ima@@ ls might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to wat@@ ch ."
So I had an am@@ b@@ ition to disco@@ ver what could be under@@ sto@@ od from this uni@@ qu@@ e@@ ly human relation@@ ship between te@@ le@@ vision pro@@ gr@@ ams and the human consci@@ ous .
Why has te@@ le@@ vision en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ev@@ olved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this car@@ to@@ on de@@ vi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l sitting on our shou@@ l@@ ders .
"I@@ s te@@ le@@ vision liter@@ ally fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing as our con@@ science , tem@@ p@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?"
"So to be@@ gin to answer these questions , we did a research study ."
We went back 50 years to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 te@@ le@@ vision se@@ as@@ on .
We sur@@ ve@@ yed the to@@ p@@ -@@ 20 N@@ i@@ el@@ sen shows every year for 50 years — a th@@ ous@@ and shows .
"We tal@@ ked to over 3@@ ,000 individu@@ als — almost 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 — ag@@ ed 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally ."
How did you feel wat@@ ching every single one of these shows ?
D@@ id you feel a sense of mor@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity ?
D@@ id you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? D@@ id you la@@ ug@@ h ?
What did this mean for you ?
"So to our global TED au@@ di@@ ences , I want to say that this was a U.S@@ . sam@@ ple ."
"But as you can see , these emot@@ i@@ onal need sta@@ tes are tru@@ ly uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l ."
"And on a fac@@ tual bas@@ is , over 80 percent of the U.S@@ . &apos; s most pop@@ ular shows are ex@@ por@@ ted around the world ."
So I really hope our global au@@ di@@ ences can rel@@ ate .
"T@@ wo ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data s@@ li@@ de : F@@ or insp@@ ir@@ ing me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tr@@ ic@@ ks that con@@ science can play on us on a dai@@ ly bas@@ is , I th@@ ank le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y r@@ ab@@ bi , J@@ ack S@@ tern ."
"And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to th@@ ank TED community super@@ sta@@ r H@@ ans R@@ os@@ ling , who you may have just seen ."
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 20@@ 10 , the 50 years of our study ."
"T@@ wo things we &apos;re going to start with — the insp@@ ir@@ ation state and the mor@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity state , which , for this pur@@ p@@ ose , we de@@ fin@@ ed insp@@ ir@@ ation as te@@ le@@ vision shows that up@@ li@@ ft me , that make me feel much more pos@@ itive about the world ."
M@@ or@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity are te@@ le@@ vis@@ ions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
"As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 insp@@ ir@@ ation is ho@@ l@@ ding ste@@ ad@@ y ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re wat@@ ching T@@ V for .
M@@ or@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity star@@ ts to cl@@ im@@ b .
"@@ Right at the end of the 6@@ 0s , mor@@ al am@@ big@@ u@@ ity is going up , insp@@ ir@@ ation is kind of on the wan@@ e ."
Why ?
"The C@@ u@@ ban M@@ is@@ si@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is sho@@ t , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ ights movement , r@@ ace ri@@ ots , the V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , M@@ L@@ K is sho@@ t , B@@ ob@@ by K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy is sho@@ t , W@@ a@@ ter@@ g@@ ate ."

"When you guys hear this indus@@ try ter@@ m , a bre@@ ak@@ out h@@ it , what does that mean ?"
"It means in the 19@@ 6@@ 6 te@@ le@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mo@@ thers B@@ ro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of no@@ where ."
"This was the first show that allo@@ wed vi@@ e@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can com@@ ment on how I feel about the V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m W@@ ar , about the pres@@ iden@@ cy , through te@@ le@@ vision ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a bre@@ ak@@ out show ."
"So then , just like the last ch@@ art , look what happens ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the da@@ m bur@@ sts . The da@@ m bur@@ sts ."
C@@ om@@ for@@ t is no longer why we wat@@ ch te@@ le@@ vision .

"O@@ n@@ ly one gener@@ ation , 20 years in , and we disco@@ vered , W@@ ow ! T@@ V can do that ?"
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
"So to this very , very sa@@ v@@ v@@ y c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , I also want to not@@ e the dig@@ ital fol@@ ks did not inv@@ ent dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive ."

What were those shows ?
G@@ l@@ am@@ or@@ ous and r@@ ich .
"&quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ tas@@ y I@@ s@@ land . &quot;"
In@@ cre@@ di@@ ble ma@@ pp@@ ing of our national psy@@ ch@@ e with some hard and f@@ ast fac@@ ts : un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .

"W@@ he@@ ther or not you &apos;re in my business , you have su@@ rely heard or read of the de@@ cl@@ ine of the thing called the th@@ ree@@ -@@ c@@ amera sit@@ co@@ m and the r@@ ise of reality T@@ V ."
"Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the s@@ po@@ t ."
"The 9@@ 0s — the big bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es of hum@@ or — we &apos;re wat@@ ching &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ r@@ as@@ i@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ he@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ in@@ fe@@ ld . &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing &apos;s good , low un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment ."

"In 200@@ 1 , the S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 200@@ 1 te@@ le@@ vision se@@ as@@ on , hum@@ or suc@@ c@@ um@@ b@@ s to ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment once and for all ."
Why not ?
We had a 20@@ 00 pres@@ iden@@ tial elec@@ tion decided by the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ sting of the te@@ ch bu@@ b@@ ble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x be@@ comes part of the social le@@ x@@ ic@@ on .
L@@ ook what happens when we keep going .
"A@@ t the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality te@@ le@@ vision has taken hold ."
What do people want in their T@@ V then ?
I would have thought re@@ ven@@ ge or n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
G@@ ive me some com@@ for@@ t ; my world is f@@ all@@ ing ap@@ art .

"That &apos;s all great , right ?"
"So as dra@@ matic@@ ally different as these te@@ le@@ vision shows , p@@ ure en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one bas@@ ic inst@@ in@@ ct re@@ ma@@ ins ."
"We &apos;re animals , we need our mom@@ s ."
"There has not been a deca@@ de of te@@ le@@ vision without a de@@ fin@@ itive , dom@@ in@@ ant T@@ V mo@@ m ."
"The 19@@ 5@@ 0s : J@@ une C@@ le@@ ever in the or@@ ig@@ inal com@@ for@@ t show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ a@@ ve it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; L@@ u@@ c@@ il@@ le B@@ all ke@@ pt us la@@ ugh@@ ing through the r@@ ise of social consci@@ ous@@ ness in the 6@@ 0s ."

"So to you all , the women of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , the men of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , the global au@@ di@@ ences of TE@@ D@@ W@@ om@@ en , th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me present my idea about the con@@ science of te@@ le@@ vision ."
But let me also th@@ ank the incredi@@ ble cre@@ at@@ ors who get up every@@ day to put their ideas on our te@@ le@@ vision scre@@ ens thr@@ ough@@ out all these ag@@ es of te@@ le@@ vision .
"They give it life on te@@ le@@ vision , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vi@@ e@@ wers , through your collec@@ tive social consci@@ ences , that give it life , lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , power or not ."
So th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"Well we all know the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b has absolu@@ tely trans@@ for@@ med publi@@ shing , bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting , comm@@ er@@ ce and social conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity , but where did it all come from ?"
"And I &apos;ll quot@@ e three people : V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h , D@@ ou@@ g En@@ ge@@ l@@ b@@ art and T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e ."
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h .
V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was the U.S@@ . government &apos;s chi@@ e@@ f sci@@ enti@@ fic ad@@ vi@@ ser during the war .
"And in 19@@ 4@@ 5 , he publi@@ shed an ar@@ tic@@ le in a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine called A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic M@@ on@@ th@@ ly ."
And the ar@@ tic@@ le was called &quot; &quot; A@@ s We Ma@@ y Th@@ in@@ k . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ an@@ ne@@ v@@ ar B@@ us@@ h was saying was the way we use information is br@@ ok@@ en .
We don &apos;t work in terms of li@@ br@@ ari@@ es and c@@ at@@ al@@ o@@ g systems and so for@@ th .
The brain works by as@@ soci@@ ation .
"W@@ it@@ h one ite@@ m in its thought , it s@@ n@@ ap@@ s in@@ stan@@ tly to the next ite@@ m ."
And the way information is struc@@ tu@@ red is tot@@ ally in@@ cap@@ able of kee@@ ping up with this process .
"And so he sug@@ ge@@ sted a machine , and he called it the me@@ me@@ x ."
"And the me@@ me@@ x would lin@@ k information , one piece of information to a re@@ la@@ ted piece of information and so for@@ th ."
Now this was in 19@@ 4@@ 5 .
A computer in those days was something the se@@ cre@@ t serv@@ ices used to use for co@@ de bre@@ aking .
And no@@ body knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was inven@@ ted .
And he pro@@ po@@ sed this machine called the me@@ me@@ x .
"And he had a pl@@ at@@ form where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will ."
"So sp@@ in@@ ning for@@ ward , one of the guys who read this ar@@ tic@@ le was a guy called D@@ ou@@ g En@@ ge@@ l@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.S@@ . A@@ ir F@@ or@@ ce of@@ fic@@ er ."
And he was read@@ ing it in their li@@ br@@ ary in the F@@ ar E@@ ast .
"And he was so insp@@ i@@ red by this ar@@ tic@@ le , it kind of di@@ rec@@ ted the rest of his life ."
"And by the mid@@ -@@ 6@@ 0s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the S@@ tan@@ for@@ d Re@@ search La@@ b in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
He built a system .
"The system was desig@@ ned to a@@ ug@@ ment human inte@@ llig@@ ence , it was called ."
"And in a pre@@ mon@@ ition of today &apos;s world of cl@@ oud compu@@ ting and so@@ f@@ t@@ war@@ es of serv@@ ice , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine S@@ y@@ stem ."
And this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ ge@@ l@@ b@@ art .
He was gi@@ ving a presen@@ tation at the F@@ all J@@ o@@ int C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
"What he sho@@ wed — he s@@ at on a stage like this , and he demon@@ stra@@ ted this system ."
He had his head mi@@ c like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
"And you can see , he &apos;s working between doc@@ um@@ ents and grap@@ h@@ ics and so for@@ th ."
"And he &apos;s dri@@ ving it all with this pl@@ at@@ form here , with a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fin@@ ger ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and the world &apos;s first computer mou@@ se , which he speci@@ ally desig@@ ned in order to do this system ."
So this is where the mou@@ se came from as well .
So this is D@@ ou@@ g En@@ ge@@ l@@ b@@ art .
The tr@@ ou@@ ble with D@@ ou@@ g En@@ ge@@ l@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the compu@@ ters in those days cost se@@ ver@@ al million p@@ oun@@ ds .
"So for a person@@ al computer , a few million p@@ oun@@ ds was like having a person@@ al j@@ et plan@@ e ; it wasn &apos;t really very pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when person@@ al compu@@ ters did ar@@ ri@@ ve , then there was room for this kind of system on person@@ al compu@@ ters ."
"And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called G@@ u@@ ide for the A@@ pp@@ le M@@ ac@@ in@@ tos@@ h ."
And we de@@ li@@ vered the world &apos;s first hy@@ per@@ text system .
And this began to get a head of ste@@ am .
"A@@ pp@@ le in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a thing called H@@ y@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a fus@@ s about it ."
They had a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ pa@@ ge supp@@ le@@ ment in the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal the day it la@@ un@@ ched .
The ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines started to co@@ ver it .
B@@ y@@ te ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine and C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ations at the A@@ C@@ M had speci@@ al issu@@ es co@@ ver@@ ing hy@@ per@@ text .
We develop@@ ed a P@@ C ver@@ sion of this produ@@ ct as well as the M@@ ac@@ in@@ tos@@ h ver@@ sion .
And our P@@ C ver@@ sion became quite ma@@ ture .
These are some exam@@ ples of this system in action in the l@@ ate 8@@ 0s .
"You were able to de@@ li@@ ver doc@@ um@@ ents , were able to do it over net@@ works ."
We develop@@ ed a system such that it had a mar@@ ku@@ p language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hy@@ per@@ text mar@@ ku@@ p language .
"And the system was cap@@ able of doing very , very large doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ation systems over computer net@@ works ."
So I took this system to a tra@@ de show in V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es ne@@ ar P@@ ar@@ is in l@@ ate N@@ o@@ ve@@ m@@ ber 199@@ 0 .
"And I was appro@@ ach@@ ed by a n@@ ice young man called T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you I@@ an R@@ it@@ chi@@ e ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ po@@ sed system called the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous name , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally since the whole system ran on his computer in his off@@ ice ."
But he was completely con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that his Wor@@ ld W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b would take over the world one day .
"And he tried to per@@ su@@ a@@ de me to write the bro@@ w@@ ser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any grap@@ h@@ ics or f@@ on@@ ts or la@@ you@@ t or anything ; it was just pla@@ in text ."
"I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from C@@ E@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this ."
So we didn &apos;t do it .
"In the next couple of years , the hy@@ per@@ text community didn &apos;t recogni@@ ze him ei@@ ther ."
"In 199@@ 2 , his pap@@ er was re@@ je@@ cted for the H@@ y@@ per@@ text Con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce ."
"In 199@@ 3 , there was a table at the con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce in S@@ e@@ at@@ tle , and a guy called M@@ ar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ sen was demon@@ str@@ ating his little bro@@ w@@ ser for the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b ."
"And I saw it , and I thought , ye@@ p , that &apos;s it ."
"And the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ g@@ h , and I had no op@@ pos@@ ition in having T@@ i@@ m B@@ er@@ ner@@ s@@ -@@ Le@@ e as the ke@@ y@@ not@@ e spe@@ ak@@ er ."
So that pu@@ ts me in pretty ill@@ us@@ tri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ick R@@ o@@ we who was at De@@ c@@ c@@ a Re@@ cor@@ ds and turned down The Be@@ at@@ les .
"There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went fl@@ ying his plan@@ e when I@@ B@@ M came looking for an oper@@ ating system for the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see B@@ ill G@@ ates ."
"And the 12 publi@@ sh@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K@@ . R@@ o@@ w@@ ling &apos;s H@@ ar@@ ry P@@ ot@@ ter , I gu@@ ess ."
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s M@@ ar@@ c An@@ dre@@ es@@ sen who wr@@ ote the world &apos;s first bro@@ w@@ ser for the Wor@@ ld W@@ ide W@@ e@@ b ."
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to F@@ or@@ tun@@ e ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , he &apos;s wor@@ th 7@@ 00 million dollars ."
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
"In 199@@ 4 , I wal@@ ked into a pris@@ on in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and I met a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y who had been tor@@ tu@@ red and was de@@ ni@@ ed access to coun@@ se@@ l ."
"And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundre@@ ds of le@@ t@@ ters I had writ@@ ten for polit@@ ical pris@@ on@@ ers , that I would never have writ@@ ten a le@@ t@@ ter for him , because he was not a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y who had done something important for any@@ body ."
He was not a polit@@ ical pris@@ on@@ er .
He was a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y who had sto@@ l@@ en a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
"What I also realized at that point was that it was not only C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 1@@ 3 develop@@ ing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all pas@@ sed la@@ ws that say you have a right to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and you have a right not to be tor@@ tu@@ red ."
And what I recogni@@ z@@ ed was that there was an incredi@@ ble win@@ do@@ w of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ative too@@ l .
"We often think of tor@@ ture as being polit@@ ical tor@@ ture or re@@ ser@@ ved for just the wor@@ st , but , in fact , 9@@ 5 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for polit@@ ical pris@@ on@@ ers ."
"It is for people who are in br@@ ok@@ en@@ -@@ down le@@ ga@@ l systems , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ation — it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than having a le@@ ga@@ l system , che@@ ap@@ er than having a la@@ w@@ y@@ er and early access to coun@@ se@@ l — it is what happens most of the time ."
"I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decis@@ ion , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ative too@@ l in our li@@ fe@@ time , but it will requ@@ ire three things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is the tra@@ ining , em@@ power@@ ment , and conne@@ ction of de@@ f@@ en@@ ders wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
The second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic early access to coun@@ se@@ l .
And the third is comm@@ it@@ ment .
"So in the year 20@@ 00 , I began to won@@ der , what if we came together ?"
C@@ ou@@ ld we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I f@@ oun@@ ded Inter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ tic@@ e which has a speci@@ fic mis@@ sion of en@@ ding tor@@ ture as an inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ative too@@ l and imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting du@@ e process r@@ ights in the 9@@ 3 countries by plac@@ ing tra@@ ined la@@ w@@ y@@ ers at an early stage in pol@@ ice st@@ ations and in cour@@ tro@@ om@@ s .
"My first experi@@ ences , though , did come from C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer R@@ ou@@ ge had kill@@ ed them all ."
"And even 20 years later , there was only 10 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers in the country , so con@@ sequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a pris@@ on and not only would you me@@ et 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ ys , you &apos;d me@@ et women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; W@@ om@@ en would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my h@@ us@@ b@@ and comm@@ it@@ ted a cr@@ ime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no ru@@ le of la@@ w ."
"The first group of de@@ f@@ en@@ ders came together and I still remember , as I was tra@@ ining , I said , &quot; O@@ kay , what do you do for an inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ation ? &quot;"
"And there was sil@@ ence in the clas@@ s , and finally one woman sto@@ od up , &#91; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teach@@ er . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have de@@ f@@ en@@ ded more than a hun@@ d@@ red people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ation , because they all come with con@@ fe@@ s@@ sions . &quot; &quot; And we tal@@ ked about , as a clas@@ s , the fact that number one , the con@@ fe@@ s@@ sions might not be re@@ li@@ able , but number two , we did not want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the pol@@ ice to keep doing this , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally as it was now against the la@@ w ."
And it took a lot of cou@@ ra@@ ge for these de@@ f@@ en@@ ders to de@@ ci@@ de that they would be@@ gin to stand up and supp@@ ort each other in imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting these la@@ ws .
"And I still remember the first ca@@ ses where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would supp@@ ort her , and the ju@@ d@@ ges ke@@ pt saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the ex@@ act same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfe@@ ct case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ ge@@ table sel@@ ler , she was sitting outside of a house ."
"S@@ he said she actually saw the person run out who she thin@@ ks sto@@ le whatever the je@@ we@@ l@@ ry was , but the pol@@ ice came , they got her , there was nothing on her ."
She was pre@@ g@@ nan@@ t at the time . She had c@@ ig@@ are@@ tte bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ car@@ ri@@ ed .
"And when they br@@ ought her case to the ju@@ dge , for the first time he sto@@ od up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no ev@@ idence ex@@ cept for your tor@@ ture con@@ fe@@ s@@ sion and you will be re@@ lea@@ sed . &quot; &quot; And the de@@ f@@ en@@ ders began to take ca@@ ses over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ."
But C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia is not alone .
"I used to think , well is it C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia ?"
O@@ r is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
"In B@@ ur@@ un@@ d@@ i I wal@@ ked into a pris@@ on and it wasn &apos;t a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y , it was an 8@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y for ste@@ al@@ ing a mo@@ bi@@ le phone ."
"O@@ r a woman , I pic@@ ked up her bab@@ y , really cu@@ te bab@@ y , I said &quot; &quot; Y@@ our bab@@ y is so cu@@ te . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a bab@@ y , she was three ."
"And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was acc@@ used of ste@@ al@@ ing two di@@ ap@@ ers and an iron for her bab@@ y and still had been in pris@@ on ."
"And when I wal@@ ked up to the pris@@ on di@@ rec@@ tor , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out ."
"A ju@@ dge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , we can talk about it , but look at my pris@@ on . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two th@@ ous@@ and people here are without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So la@@ w@@ y@@ ers began to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organ@@ ize a system where they can take ca@@ ses ."
"But we realized that it &apos;s not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but the conne@@ ction of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers that makes a difference ."
"For example , in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ au@@ di@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 2@@ 4 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers with her who sto@@ od up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a f@@ res@@ h win@@ d in the de@@ ser@@ t when we can come together . &quot; &quot; O@@ r in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a pris@@ on where everybody sto@@ od up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , e@@ ight years , 12 years without a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a tra@@ ining together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people m@@ um@@ bl@@ ing@@ "
"@@ and g@@ ru@@ m@@ bl@@ ing — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create j@@ us@@ tic@@ e because we do not have the re@@ sources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the l@@ ack of re@@ sources is never an exc@@ use for in@@ j@@ us@@ tic@@ e . &quot; &quot; And with that , he suc@@ cess@@ fully organiz@@ ed 6@@ 8 la@@ w@@ y@@ ers who have been sy@@ ste@@ matic@@ ally taking the ca@@ ses ."
"The key that we see , though , is tra@@ ining and then early access ."
"I was rec@@ ently in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , and was insp@@ i@@ red to me@@ et with another group of la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , look , we don &apos;t have pol@@ ice on the st@@ ree@@ ts now . The pol@@ ice are one of the ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we had the re@@ v@@ olution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been ten@@ s of mil@@ lions of dollars that have rec@@ ently gone in to the develop@@ ment of the le@@ ga@@ l system here ."
"What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the develop@@ ment a@@ gen@@ ci@@ es , and they were tra@@ ining pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the norma@@ l bi@@ as , as op@@ po@@ sed to de@@ f@@ en@@ ders ."
And they sho@@ wed me a man@@ u@@ al which actually was an ex@@ ce@@ ll@@ ent man@@ u@@ al .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m g@@ onna c@@ op@@ y this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . La@@ w@@ y@@ ers can come at the pol@@ ice st@@ ation . It was perfe@@ ct ."
P@@ ro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors were perfe@@ c@@ tly tra@@ ined .
"But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pa@@ use , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tu@@ red . &quot;"
"So the pie@@ ces are , not only the tra@@ ining of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , but us fin@@ ding a way to sy@@ ste@@ matic@@ ally imp@@ le@@ ment early access to coun@@ se@@ l , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tu@@ red ."
"And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also a@@ ware of the fact that it soun@@ ds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , oka@@ y , it soun@@ ds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it soun@@ ds big ."
And there are many reas@@ ons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of cre@@ ating mir@@ ac@@ les because of their comm@@ it@@ ment .
"It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , but de@@ f@@ en@@ ders all over the world who are looking for these pie@@ ces ."
"We have a pro@@ gram called J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we supp@@ ort them ?"
So it &apos;s an on@@ line con@@ test where it &apos;s only five th@@ ous@@ and dollars if you come up with and innov@@ ative way of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting j@@ us@@ tic@@ e .
"And there are 30 J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ ak@@ ers thr@@ ough@@ out the world , from S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka to S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five th@@ ous@@ and dollars do amazing things , through S@@ M@@ S pro@@ gr@@ ams , through par@@ al@@ e@@ ga@@ l pro@@ gr@@ ams , through whatever they can do ."
"And it &apos;s not only these J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their net@@ works are and how they can move it for@@ ward ."
"So in China , for in@@ stan@@ ce , great la@@ ws came out where it says pol@@ ice cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be p@@ uni@@ shed ."
"And I was sitting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted ?"
"This is f@@ anta@@ stic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s oka@@ y , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on De@@ ce@@ m@@ ber 4 , he organiz@@ ed three th@@ ous@@ and mem@@ bers of the Y@@ ou@@ th C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ist Le@@ a@@ gu@@ e , from 14 of the top la@@ w s@@ cho@@ ols , who organiz@@ ed themselves , develop@@ ed pos@@ ters with the new la@@ ws , and went to the pol@@ ice st@@ ations and began what he says is a non@@ -@@ viol@@ ent le@@ ga@@ l re@@ v@@ olution to prote@@ ct c@@ it@@ izen r@@ ights ."
So I tal@@ ked about the fact that we need to tra@@ in and supp@@ ort de@@ f@@ en@@ ders .
We need to sy@@ ste@@ matic@@ ally imp@@ le@@ ment early access to coun@@ se@@ l .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a comm@@ it@@ ment to this .
"And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s w@@ il@@ dly ide@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"N@@ ever going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end s@@ la@@ very , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id ."
It began with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
"Now , there &apos;s one of our fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite po@@ em@@ s from the de@@ f@@ en@@ ders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; T@@ ake cou@@ ra@@ ge friends , the ro@@ ad is often long , the pat@@ h is never clear , and the st@@ ak@@ es are very high , but dee@@ p down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to supp@@ ort not only de@@ f@@ en@@ ders , but also everyone in the system who is looking to@@ wards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ative too@@ l ."
"I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . F@@ ir@@ st of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ i@@ sh@@ na , who actually was my insp@@ ir@@ ation for star@@ ting Inter@@ national B@@ ri@@ d@@ ges to J@@ us@@ tic@@ e ."
"@@ V@@ i@@ sh@@ na was a 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y when I met him who was born in a C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ an pris@@ on in K@@ an@@ da@@ l P@@ ro@@ v@@ ince . But because he was born in the pris@@ on , everybody lo@@ ved him , inclu@@ ding the gu@@ ar@@ ds , so he was the only one who was allo@@ wed to come in and out of the b@@ ars ."
"So , you know , there &apos;s b@@ ars . And by the time that V@@ i@@ sh@@ na was getting big@@ ger , which means what gets big@@ ger ? Y@@ our head gets big@@ ger ."
"So he would come to the first ba@@ r , the second ba@@ r and then the third ba@@ r , and then really s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly move his head so he could f@@ it through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would gra@@ b my p@@ in@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go vis@@ it ."
"You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to vis@@ it all 1@@ 5@@ 6 pris@@ on@@ ers . And I would li@@ ft him , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"O@@ r if they were dar@@ k cells , it was like iron cor@@ ru@@ ga@@ ted , and he would put his fin@@ g@@ ers through ."
"And most of the pris@@ on@@ ers said that he was their gre@@ a@@ test jo@@ y and their su@@ n@@ shin@@ e , and they looked for@@ ward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ i@@ sh@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ y ."
"He was born in a pris@@ on with almost nothing , no materi@@ al go@@ o@@ ds , but he had a sense of his own her@@ o@@ ic jour@@ ney , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably I can &apos;t do everything ."
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
"And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I th@@ ank you for having the pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic ima@@ gin@@ ation to imagine the sh@@ ap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and inv@@ ite you into this jour@@ ney with us ."
Thank you .

"And when this high@@ ly un@@ produc@@ tive ses@@ sion is over , you go back to your des@@ k , and you stand at your des@@ k and you say , &quot; &quot; B@@ o@@ y , I w@@ ish I had those two hours back , like I w@@ ish I had my ch@@ air back . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ very day , we al@@ low our co@@ wor@@ kers , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise very , very n@@ ice people , to ste@@ al from us ."
And I &apos;m talking about something far more val@@ u@@ able than off@@ ice fur@@ nit@@ ure .
I &apos;m talking about time . Y@@ our time .
"In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c of a ter@@ ri@@ ble new ill@@ ness known as M@@ A@@ S : M@@ ind@@ less A@@ c@@ cept S@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome ."

"But between glob@@ aliz@@ ation and per@@ v@@ as@@ ive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dra@@ matic@@ ally over the last few years ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , I have ev@@ idence to pro@@ ve that M@@ A@@ S is a global ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c ."
Let me tell you why .
"A couple of years ago , I put a video on Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be , and in the video , I ac@@ ted out every ter@@ ri@@ ble con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce call you &apos;ve ever been on ."
"It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we h@@ ate about really bad me@@ et@@ ings ."
There &apos;s the mo@@ der@@ ator who has no idea how to run the mee@@ ting .
There are the partic@@ i@@ pan@@ ts who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
The whole thing kind of col@@ l@@ ap@@ ses into this col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative tra@@ in w@@ re@@ ck .
And everybody lea@@ ves very an@@ gr@@ y .
It &apos;s kind of fun@@ n@@ y .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a qu@@ ick look .
( V@@ ideo ) O@@ ur go@@ al today is to come to an a@@ gre@@ e@@ ment on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .

"A couple of weeks after I put that on@@ line , 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in do@@ zen@@ s of countries , I mean do@@ zen@@ s of countries , wat@@ ched this video ."
"And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of vi@@ e@@ ws every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
"And in fact , some of the big@@ gest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my per@@ mis@@ sion to use this video in their ne@@ w@@ -@@ h@@ ire tra@@ ining to te@@ ach their new em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es how not to run a mee@@ ting at their company ."

"Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people wr@@ ote things like , &quot; O@@ M@@ G , that was my day today ! &quot;"
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;

These are real qu@@ o@@ tes and it &apos;s real sa@@ d .
A common the@@ me run@@ ning through all of these com@@ ments on@@ line is this fund@@ amen@@ tal beli@@ e@@ f that we are power@@ less to do anything other than go to me@@ et@@ ings and su@@ f@@ fer through these po@@ or@@ ly run me@@ et@@ ings and live to me@@ et another day .

"In fact , the c@@ ure for M@@ A@@ S is right here in our hands ."
"It &apos;s right at our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps , liter@@ ally ."
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No M@@ A@@ S !
"( Laughter ) W@@ h@@ ich , if I remember my high school S@@ pan@@ ish , means something like , &quot; &quot; En@@ ough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No M@@ A@@ S works . It &apos;s very simple ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , the next time you get a mee@@ ting inv@@ it@@ ation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , cl@@ ick the ten@@ t@@ ative but@@ ton !@@ "
"It &apos;s oka@@ y , you &apos;re allo@@ wed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there ."

Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s H@@ al@@ ey .

( V@@ ideo ) P@@ re@@ sen@@ ter : H@@ al@@ ey V@@ an D@@ y@@ ck !
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feel@@ ing the same emot@@ ions .
Let &apos;s take a look inside H@@ al@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are bil@@ lions of inter@@ conne@@ cted neur@@ ons in an imp@@ os@@ sible tan@@ gle .
But wa@@ it — what is an idea any@@ way ?
"Well , you can think of it as a pat@@ tern of information that hel@@ ps you understand and na@@ v@@ ig@@ ate the world ."
"I@@ de@@ as come in all sh@@ ap@@ es and s@@ iz@@ es , from the complex and an@@ al@@ y@@ tical to the simple and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ."
Here are just a few exam@@ ples shar@@ ed from the TED stage .
S@@ ir K@@ en R@@ ob@@ in@@ son — cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is key to our kids &apos; future .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : E@@ l@@ ora H@@ ar@@ dy — building from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
"( V@@ ideo ) E@@ l@@ ora H@@ ar@@ dy : It is gro@@ wing all around us , it &apos;s str@@ ong , it &apos;s ele@@ g@@ ant , it &apos;s ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake@@ -@@ res@@ is@@ tan@@ t ."
CA : Ch@@ ima@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single iden@@ t@@ ity .
"( V@@ ideo ) Ch@@ ima@@ man@@ da A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The single story cre@@ ates ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , and the problem with ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are in@@ comple@@ te ."
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s oper@@ ating system .
"So , for example , if one little comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that kit@@ ten@@ s are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act like this ."
"But if another comp@@ on@@ ent of your wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is the idea that le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds are dan@@ ger@@ ous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll re@@ act a little bit differen@@ tly ."
"Now , different people &apos;s wor@@ l@@ d@@ vi@@ e@@ ws can be dra@@ matic@@ ally different ."
"&quot; &quot; A woman of fa@@ it@@ h , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exper@@ t , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sis@@ ter &quot; &quot; ?"
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force sh@@ ap@@ ing human culture .
C@@ ur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
S@@ ti@@ r your au@@ dience &apos;s cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"And once you &apos;ve s@@ par@@ ked that des@@ ire , it will be so much eas@@ i@@ er to start building your idea ."
"Th@@ ree , build your idea , piece by piece , out of con@@ cep@@ ts that your au@@ dience already under@@ stan@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s important , the@@ re@@ fore , to test your talk on tr@@ us@@ ted friends , and find out which parts they get con@@ fu@@ sed by ."
"F@@ our , here &apos;s the fin@@ al ti@@ p : M@@ ake your idea wor@@ th shar@@ ing ."
And I need you to be hon@@ est with the answer .
"C@@ an I ask you to p@@ lease rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a son@@ g or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really l@@ ik@@ ed , and you an@@ tic@@ i@@ pa@@ ted that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school ma@@ th ."
"I se@@ ll a produ@@ ct to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ pos@@ ition ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak ma@@ th down into two ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ got@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ r@@ at@@ ics with le@@ ad@@ ing co@@ ef@@ fici@@ ents gre@@ a@@ ter than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ v@@ ided you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the ap@@ plic@@ ation of ma@@ th pro@@ ces@@ ses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ matic@@ al fi@@ el@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th teach@@ er ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ expla@@ in the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ den@@ ts l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ les@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ bes 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mul@@ a to app@@ ly in that s@@ itu@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V shows , has a really good descri@@ ption for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary d@@ r@@ ama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it sh@@ ap@@ es the neur@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ ati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ solution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ ati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quickly ."
"You expe@@ ct sit@@ com@@ -@@ s@@ ized problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three comm@@ er@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a la@@ ug@@ h tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ t@@ ire in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and we@@ ll@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s — partic@@ ul@@ arly mas@@ s@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s — te@@ ach ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a phys@@ ics te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"N@@ ot@@ ice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pie@@ ces of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ mul@@ a some@@ where , ev@@ en@@ tually , which the studen@@ t will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ f@@ fici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all a@@ gre@@ e that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out num@@ bers and t@@ we@@ aking the con@@ text a little bit ."
"And if the studen@@ t still doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze the sta@@ m@@ p this was mo@@ l@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any phys@@ ics , just kno@@ wing how to de@@ co@@ de a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sh@@ ame ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really c@@ ool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about de@@ fin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cur@@ ious which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , partic@@ ul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and presen@@ ted to the studen@@ t all at once , how that cre@@ ates this imp@@ ati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ matic@@ al structure , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , me@@ asu@@ re@@ ments , la@@ be@@ ls , poin@@ ts , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ ction is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compe@@ lling question , a compe@@ lling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can step over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : W@@ h@@ ich se@@ ction is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ vers@@ ation because the vi@@ su@@ al is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ wers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , friend ver@@ su@@ s friend , in pa@@ ir@@ s , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ing , whatever ."
And then ev@@ en@@ tually we realiz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ o@@ ve the mi@@ d line .
"And we realiz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ be@@ ls to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realiz@@ e it would be n@@ ice to have some me@@ asu@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ matic@@ al structure ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the con@@ vers@@ ation , the con@@ vers@@ ation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nin@@ e out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then develo@@ p those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you guys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been obvi@@ ous in my pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ eld the flo@@ or here for a second to E@@ in@@ ste@@ in , who , I believe , has p@@ ai@@ d his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , in the U.S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the for@@ mul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly compe@@ lling ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that supp@@ or@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ den@@ ts have to develo@@ p those , they have to for@@ mul@@ ate those ."
And then not@@ ice that all the information writ@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a dis@@ trac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ den@@ ts need to de@@ ci@@ de , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ u@@ ch an under@@ re@@ presen@@ ted question in ma@@ th cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or c@@ li@@ p art that you so often see in te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ den@@ ts are looking at their wat@@ ches , ro@@ lling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ vers@@ ation about ma@@ th because someone else has the for@@ mul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ mul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every studen@@ t is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ matic@@ ally and con@@ vers@@ ation@@ ally in@@ tim@@ i@@ da@@ ted jo@@ ining the con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , atta@@ ch them to gu@@ es@@ ses , and kids have b@@ ought in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teach@@ er &apos;s ed@@ ition ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ ore@@ tical mode@@ ls that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teach@@ er &apos;s ed@@ ition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sources of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ ore@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ vers@@ ations have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ por@@ t some really fun ga@@ m@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these v@@ iru@@ ses day one of the clas@@ s .
"These are the kids who now , one se@@ mes@@ ter in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ vers@@ ation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ de@@ fin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ tim@@ i@@ da@@ ted by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of fun .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge ma@@ th teach@@ ers I talk to to use mul@@ t@@ ime@@ dia , because it br@@ ings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high re@@ solution and full col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge studen@@ t in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in con@@ vers@@ ation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ l@@ ig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a ma@@ th teach@@ er right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um in our front po@@ c@@ ke@@ t .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ a@@ p , and the to@@ ols to dis@@ tribu@@ te it f@@ ree@@ ly under open l@@ ic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video seri@@ es on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vi@@ e@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teach@@ ers in countries I &apos;ve never vis@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ vers@@ ation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wo@@ w ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one c@@ art and 1@@ 9 ite@@ ms or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one ite@@ ms ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mode@@ ling inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it ev@@ en@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; Goo@@ d M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ ca@@ bu@@ l@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , whatever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a studen@@ t , par@@ ent , teach@@ er , pol@@ ic@@ y ma@@ ker , whatever — in@@ s@@ ist on better ma@@ th cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ pre@@ ter : P@@ i@@ ano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite mus@@ ical sym@@ bo@@ l ."
It means to play so@@ f@@ tly .
"If you &apos;re pla@@ ying a mus@@ ical in@@ stru@@ ment and you not@@ ice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the sc@@ ore , you need to play so@@ f@@ ter ."
T@@ wo p &apos;s — even so@@ f@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s — extre@@ me@@ ly so@@ ft .
"This is my dra@@ wing of a p@@ -@@ t@@ ree , which demon@@ stra@@ tes no matter how many thousands up@@ on thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never re@@ ach comple@@ te sil@@ ence ."
That &apos;s my curren@@ t de@@ fin@@ ition of sil@@ ence : a very ob@@ sc@@ ure sound .
"I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ig@@ n L@@ an@@ gu@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , pl@@ us a bit of my own bac@@ k@@ ground ."
"F@@ ren@@ ch sig@@ n language was br@@ ought to America during the early 18@@ 0@@ 0s , and as time went by , mi@@ x@@ ed with local sig@@ ns , it ev@@ olved into the language we know today as A@@ S@@ L ."
So it has a history of about 200 years .
"I was born de@@ a@@ f , and I was ta@@ ught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life ."
And I beli@@ ev@@ ed it to be true .
"@@ Y@@ et , I realiz@@ e now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all ."
"S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day ."
"As a De@@ a@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a fore@@ ig@@ n country , bl@@ ind@@ ly follo@@ wing its ru@@ les , cus@@ tom@@ s , behavi@@ ors and nor@@ ms without ever quest@@ i@@ on@@ ing them ."
So how is it that I understand sound ?
"Well , I wat@@ ch how people be@@ have and respon@@ d to sound ."
"You people are like my l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers , and am@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y sound ."
I learn and mir@@ ro@@ r that behavior .
"A@@ t the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respon@@ d to me ."
"Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ..@@ ."
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t s@@ la@@ m the do@@ or ! &quot;
&quot; D@@ on &apos;t make too much no@@ ise when you &apos;re e@@ ating from the p@@ ot@@ ato@@ -@@ chi@@ p ba@@ g ! &quot;
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re e@@ ating , make sure you don &apos;t sc@@ r@@ ape your u@@ ten@@ sil@@ s on the pl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I ter@@ m &quot; &quot; sound e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te . &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe I think about sound e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te more than the a@@ verage he@@ ar@@ ing person does ."
I &apos;m hy@@ per@@ -@@ v@@ ig@@ il@@ ant around sound .
"And I &apos;m always wa@@ iting in e@@ ag@@ er ner@@ v@@ ous an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next ."
"H@@ ence , this dra@@ wing ."
"T@@ B@@ D , to be decided ."
"T@@ B@@ C , to be contin@@ u@@ ed ."
"T@@ B@@ A , to be an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced ."
And you not@@ ice the sta@@ ff — there are no no@@ tes con@@ tain@@ ed in the l@@ ines .
That &apos;s because the l@@ ines already con@@ tain sound through the sub@@ tle s@@ mu@@ d@@ ges and s@@ me@@ ars .
"In De@@ a@@ f culture , movement is equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to sound ."
This is a sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; sta@@ ff &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A typ@@ ical sta@@ ff con@@ ta@@ ins five l@@ ines .
"@@ Y@@ et for me , sig@@ ning it with my th@@ um@@ b st@@ ic@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural ."
"That &apos;s why you &apos;ll not@@ ice in my dra@@ w@@ ings , I st@@ ick to four l@@ ines on pap@@ er ."
"In the year 200@@ 8 , I had the opportunity to tra@@ vel to B@@ er@@ l@@ in , G@@ er@@ many , for an art@@ ist res@@ iden@@ cy there ."
"P@@ ri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter ."
"D@@ uring this sum@@ mer , I vis@@ ited different mu@@ se@@ um@@ s and g@@ all@@ er@@ y sp@@ ac@@ es , and as I went from one place to the next , I not@@ ic@@ ed there was no vi@@ su@@ al art there ."
"A@@ t that time , sound was t@@ ren@@ ding , and this stru@@ ck me ..@@ ."
"@@ there was no vi@@ su@@ al art , everything was au@@ d@@ it@@ ory ."
Now sound has come into my art ter@@ rit@@ ory .
I@@ s it going to fur@@ ther dis@@ tan@@ ce me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experi@@ en@@ ced through the e@@ ars .
"It could be felt ta@@ c@@ tually , or experi@@ en@@ ced as a vi@@ su@@ al , or even as an idea ."
So I decided to re@@ cl@@ ai@@ m o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship of sound and to put it into my art pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e .
"And everything that I had been ta@@ ught reg@@ ar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn ."
I started cre@@ ating a new body of work .
"And when I presen@@ ted this to the art community , I was blo@@ wn away with the amount of supp@@ ort and atten@@ tion I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved ."
"I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social curren@@ cy ."
"In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a he@@ ar@@ ing person &apos;s thing ."
"And sound is so powerful that it could ei@@ ther dise@@ m@@ power me and my art@@ work , or it could em@@ power me ."
I ch@@ ose to be em@@ po@@ we@@ red .
There &apos;s a mas@@ sive culture around sp@@ ok@@ en language .
"And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al vo@@ ice to communic@@ ate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a vo@@ ice at all ."
So I need to work with individu@@ als who can supp@@ ort me as an equ@@ al and become my vo@@ ice .
"And that way , I &apos;m able to ma@@ inta@@ in re@@ le@@ v@@ an@@ cy in society today ."
"So at school , at work and institu@@ tions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L inter@@ pre@@ ters ."
And their vo@@ ice be@@ comes my vo@@ ice and iden@@ t@@ ity .
They help me to be heard .
And their vo@@ ices hold val@@ ue and curren@@ cy .
"I@@ ron@@ ically , by bor@@ ro@@ wing out their vo@@ ices , I &apos;m able to ma@@ inta@@ in a tem@@ por@@ ary form of curren@@ cy , kind of like taking out a lo@@ an with a very high intere@@ st r@@ ate ."
"If I didn &apos;t contin@@ ue this pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , I feel that I could just fa@@ de off into ob@@ li@@ v@@ ion and not ma@@ inta@@ in any form of social curren@@ cy ."
"So with sound as my new art medi@@ um , I de@@ l@@ ved into the world of music ."
And I was sur@@ pri@@ sed to see the sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ities between music and A@@ S@@ L .
"For example , a mus@@ ical not@@ e cannot be fully cap@@ tu@@ red and ex@@ pres@@ sed on pap@@ er ."
And the same ho@@ l@@ ds true for a con@@ cept in A@@ S@@ L .
They &apos;re both high@@ ly sp@@ ati@@ al and high@@ ly inf@@ lec@@ ted — me@@ an@@ ing that sub@@ tle changes can a@@ ffe@@ ct the entire me@@ an@@ ing of both sig@@ ns and soun@@ ds .
"I &apos;d like to share with you a pi@@ ano me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or , to have you have a better under@@ standing of how A@@ S@@ L works ."
"So , en@@ vision a pi@@ ano ."
A@@ S@@ L is br@@ ok@@ en down into many different gr@@ am@@ matic@@ al par@@ ame@@ ters .
"If you as@@ sig@@ n a different par@@ ame@@ ter to each fin@@ ger as you play the pi@@ ano — such as fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion , body movement , spe@@ ed , hand sh@@ ape and so on , as you play the pi@@ ano — En@@ gl@@ ish is a lin@@ e@@ ar language , as if one key is being pres@@ sed at a time ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ or@@ d — all 10 fin@@ g@@ ers need to come down sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously to ex@@ pre@@ ss a clear con@@ cept or idea in A@@ S@@ L ."
"If just one of those ke@@ ys were to change the ch@@ or@@ d , it would create a completely different me@@ an@@ ing ."
"The same app@@ lies to music in reg@@ ar@@ ds to p@@ it@@ ch , t@@ one and vol@@ ume ."
"In A@@ S@@ L , by pla@@ ying around with these different gr@@ am@@ matic@@ al par@@ ame@@ ters , you can ex@@ pre@@ ss different ideas ."
"For example , take the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T ."
This is the sig@@ n T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
S@@ tar@@ ing at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — bus@@ ted . ( Laughter )
U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h .
What are you looking at ?
"A@@ w , stop ."
"( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a mus@@ ical l@@ ens ? &quot;"
"If I was to create a sig@@ n and re@@ pe@@ at it over and over , it could become like a piece of vi@@ su@@ al music ."
"For example , this is the sig@@ n for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun ri@@ ses and se@@ ts ."
"This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to re@@ pe@@ at it and s@@ low it down , vi@@ su@@ ally it looks like a piece of music ."
All ... day .
I feel the same ho@@ l@@ ds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
"This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , re@@ presen@@ ted in this dra@@ wing ."
"And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of n@@ ights : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; over@@ night , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more mus@@ ic@@ ality than the other two . ( Laughter )@@ "
This re@@ presen@@ ts how time is ex@@ pres@@ sed in A@@ S@@ L and how the dis@@ tan@@ ce from your body can ex@@ pre@@ ss the changes in time .
"For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present ten@@ se happens clo@@ se@@ st and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back ."
"So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Th@@ en &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite , with the very r@@ om@@ an@@ tic and dra@@ ma@@ tic not@@ ion to it , &quot; once up@@ on a time . &quot;"
( Laughter ) &quot; C@@ om@@ mon time &quot; is a mus@@ ical ter@@ m with a speci@@ fic time sig@@ nature of four be@@ ats per me@@ a@@ sure .
"@@ Y@@ et when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what au@@ to@@ matic@@ ally comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So not@@ ice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand ."
We have the sta@@ ff across the head and the che@@ st .
"@@ &#91; H@@ e@@ ad : R@@ H , F@@ l@@ as@@ h c@@ la@@ w &#93; &#91; C@@ om@@ mon time &#93; &#91; C@@ he@@ st : L@@ H , F@@ l@@ as@@ h c@@ la@@ w &#93; I &apos;m now going to demon@@ str@@ ate a hand sh@@ ape called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ as@@ h c@@ la@@ w . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you p@@ lease fol@@ low along with me ?"
"E@@ very@@ body , hands up ."
"Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the che@@ st , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time ."
"@@ Yes , got it ."
That means &quot; &quot; to f@@ all in love &quot; &quot; in Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; .
"( Laughter ) Inter@@ national &#91; S@@ ig@@ n &#93; , as a not@@ e , is a vi@@ su@@ al too@@ l to help communic@@ ate across cul@@ tures and sig@@ n langu@@ ag@@ es around the world ."
The second one I &apos;d like to demon@@ str@@ ate is this — p@@ lease fol@@ low along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
( Laughter ) Now the third — p@@ lease fol@@ low along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ l@@ igh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
"&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ l@@ igh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; Goo@@ d job , everyone ."
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice how all three sig@@ ns are very sim@@ il@@ ar , they all happen at the head and the che@@ st , but they con@@ ve@@ y quite different me@@ an@@ ings ."
"So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is al@@ ive and th@@ ri@@ ving , just like music is ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , in this day and age , we live in a very au@@ di@@ o@@ -@@ cent@@ ri@@ c world ."
"And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it au@@ to@@ matic@@ ally ho@@ l@@ ds no social curren@@ cy ."
We need to start thinking har@@ der about what de@@ fin@@ es social curren@@ cy and al@@ low A@@ S@@ L to develo@@ p its own form of curren@@ cy — without sound .
And this could possi@@ bly be a step to le@@ ad to a more in@@ cl@@ us@@ ive society .
"And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be de@@ a@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , no@@ r do you have to be he@@ ar@@ ing to learn music ."
A@@ S@@ L is such a r@@ ich tre@@ a@@ sure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
"And I &apos;d like to inv@@ ite you to open your e@@ ars , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our vi@@ su@@ al language ."
"And you never know , you might just f@@ all in love with us ."

I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ stic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ ha@@ ck an@@ ten@@ na at@@ tach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ick hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his te@@ le@@ sc@@ ope to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary on the side of a gl@@ as@@ s win@@ do@@ w in S@@ a@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
I was born and rai@@ sed in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a .
"A@@ l@@ though my family con@@ stan@@ tly stru@@ g@@ g@@ led against po@@ ver@@ ty , I was always lo@@ ved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ gest of two in the family ."
But then the great fam@@ ine began in 199@@ 4 .
I was four years old .
My sis@@ ter and I would go sear@@ ching for fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od star@@ ting at 5 in the mor@@ ning and come back after mid@@ night .
"I would wan@@ der the st@@ ree@@ ts sear@@ ching for food , and I remember seeing a small child ti@@ ed to a mother &apos;s back e@@ ating chi@@ ps , and wan@@ ting to ste@@ al them from him ."
H@@ un@@ ger is hum@@ il@@ i@@ ation . H@@ un@@ ger is h@@ op@@ ele@@ s@@ s@@ ness .
"For a hun@@ gr@@ y child , polit@@ ics and f@@ ree@@ dom are not even thought of ."
"O@@ n my nin@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to e@@ at ."
"But even as a child , I could feel the he@@ av@@ iness in their he@@ ar@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver a million Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans died of star@@ v@@ ation in that time , and in 200@@ 3 , when I was 1@@ 3 years old , my father became one of them ."
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
"In the same year , my mother dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed one day , and then my sis@@ ter told me that she was going to China to ear@@ n money , but that she would re@@ turn with money and food so@@ on ."
"S@@ ince we had never been se@@ para@@ ted , and I thought we would be together fore@@ ver , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left ."
It was the big@@ gest mis@@ take I have ever made in my life .
"But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
I have not seen my mo@@ m or my sis@@ ter since then .
"S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly , I became an or@@ p@@ han and h@@ ome@@ less ."
"My dai@@ ly life became very hard , but very simple ."
My go@@ al was to find a d@@ us@@ ty piece of bre@@ ad in the tr@@ as@@ h .
But that is no way to survi@@ ve .
"I started to realiz@@ e , be@@ g@@ ging would not be the solution ."
So I started to ste@@ al from food car@@ ts in il@@ le@@ ga@@ l marke@@ ts .
"S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es , I found small j@@ ob@@ s in ex@@ change for food ."
"O@@ n@@ ce , I even spent two months in the win@@ ter working in a co@@ al min@@ e , 3@@ 3 me@@ ters under@@ ground without any prote@@ ction for up to 16 hours a day ."
I was not un@@ common .
"M@@ any other or@@ p@@ han@@ s survi@@ ved this way , or wor@@ se ."
"When I could not f@@ all as@@ le@@ e@@ p from bit@@ ter co@@ ld or hun@@ ger pa@@ ins , I h@@ op@@ ed that , the next mor@@ ning , my sis@@ ter would come back to wake me up with my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite food ."
That hope ke@@ pt me al@@ ive .
"I don &apos;t mean big , gr@@ and hope ."
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ as@@ h can had bre@@ ad , even though it usu@@ ally didn &apos;t ."
"But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die ."
H@@ ope ke@@ pt me al@@ ive .
"E@@ very day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live ."
"A@@ f@@ ter three years of wa@@ iting for my sis@@ ter &apos;s re@@ turn , I decided to go to China to look for her myself ."
I realized I couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve much longer this way .
"I knew the jour@@ ney would be ris@@ ky , but I would be ris@@ king my life ei@@ ther way ."
"I could die of star@@ v@@ ation like my father in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China ."
I had learned that many people tried to cr@@ oss the bor@@ der to China in the n@@ igh@@ t@@ time to av@@ oi@@ d being seen .
Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ an bor@@ der gu@@ ar@@ ds often sh@@ oo@@ t and k@@ ill people trying to cr@@ oss the bor@@ der without per@@ mis@@ sion .
"C@@ hin@@ ese sol@@ di@@ ers will c@@ at@@ ch and se@@ nd back Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans , where they face se@@ v@@ ere p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment ."
"I decided to cr@@ oss during the day , first because I was still a ki@@ d and sc@@ ar@@ ed of the dar@@ k , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cr@@ oss during the day , I thought I might be able to cr@@ oss without being seen by any@@ one ."
"I made it to China on F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 200@@ 6 ."
I was 16 years old .
"I thought things in China would be eas@@ i@@ er , since there was more food ."
I thought more people would help me .
"But it was har@@ der than living in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , because I was not free ."
I was always wor@@ ri@@ ed about being ca@@ ught and sen@@ t back .
"B@@ y a mir@@ ac@@ le , some months later , I met someone who was run@@ ning an under@@ ground sh@@ el@@ ter for Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans , and was allo@@ wed to live there and e@@ at reg@@ ular me@@ als for the first time in many years ."
"@@ La@@ ter that year , an activ@@ ist hel@@ p@@ ed me es@@ cap@@ e China and go to the United States as a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ."
"I went to America without kno@@ wing a word of En@@ gl@@ ish , yet my social wor@@ ker told me that I had to go to high school ."
"E@@ ven in Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , I was an F studen@@ t ."
( Laughter ) And I b@@ are@@ ly fin@@ i@@ shed ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school .
And I remember I f@@ ought in school more than once a day .
T@@ ex@@ t@@ book@@ s and the li@@ br@@ ary were not my pla@@ y@@ ground .
"My father tried very hard to mot@@ i@@ v@@ ate me into stu@@ d@@ ying , but it didn &apos;t work ."
"A@@ t one point , my father gave up on me ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son any@@ more . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it h@@ ur@@ t me dee@@ p@@ ly ."
"But ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , my level of mot@@ i@@ v@@ ation still didn &apos;t change before he died ."
"So in America , it was kind of ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous that they said I should go to high school ."
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
"I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much ."
"But one day , I came home and my f@@ os@@ ter mother had made ch@@ ic@@ ken w@@ ings for din@@ ner ."
"And during din@@ ner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it ."
"When I looked down at my pl@@ ate , I saw the last ch@@ ic@@ ken wing , that my f@@ os@@ ter father had given me his ."
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
"He just looked back at me very war@@ m@@ ly , but said no words ."
S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly I re@@ mem@@ be@@ red my bio@@ logical father .
"My f@@ os@@ ter father &apos;s small act of love re@@ min@@ ded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hun@@ gr@@ y , even if he was star@@ ving ."
"I felt so su@@ f@@ fo@@ ca@@ ted that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation ."
"My only w@@ ish that night was to c@@ ook a me@@ al for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to hon@@ or him ."
And my answer was to pr@@ om@@ ise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to hon@@ or his sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice .
"I took school seri@@ ously , and for the first time ever in my life , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved an ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c a@@ ward for ex@@ ce@@ ll@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s l@@ ist from the first se@@ mes@@ ter in high school ."
( Applause ) That ch@@ ic@@ ken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ ope is person@@ al . H@@ ope is something that no one can give to you .
You have to cho@@ ose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
"In Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a , I made it myself ."
H@@ ope br@@ ought me to America .
"But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming f@@ ree@@ dom ."
"My f@@ os@@ ter father at that din@@ ner gave me a di@@ re@@ ction , and he mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated me and gave me a pur@@ p@@ ose to live in America ."
I did not come here by myself .
"I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough ."
M@@ any people hel@@ p@@ ed me along the way to get here .
Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans are f@@ igh@@ ting hard to survi@@ ve .
"They have to force themselves to survi@@ ve , have hope to survi@@ ve , but they cannot make it without help ."
This is my mes@@ sage to you .
"H@@ a@@ ve hope for yourself , but also help each other ."
"L@@ i@@ fe can be hard for everyone , whe@@ re@@ ver you live ."
My f@@ os@@ ter father didn &apos;t inte@@ nd to change my life .
"In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the sma@@ l@@ le@@ st act of love ."
"A piece of bre@@ ad can sat@@ is@@ f@@ y your hun@@ ger , and having the hope will bring you bre@@ ad to keep you al@@ ive ."
But I con@@ f@@ iden@@ tly believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also sa@@ ve another J@@ o@@ se@@ p@@ h &apos;s life and change thousands of other J@@ o@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survi@@ ve .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an H@@ ong : J@@ o@@ se@@ p@@ h , th@@ ank you for shar@@ ing that very person@@ al and speci@@ al story with us ."
"I know you ha@@ ven &apos;t seen your sis@@ ter for , you said , it was almost exactly a deca@@ de , and in the off chan@@ ce that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to se@@ nd her a mes@@ sage ."
J@@ o@@ se@@ p@@ h K@@ i@@ m : In K@@ ore@@ an ?
"A@@ H : You can do En@@ gl@@ ish , then K@@ ore@@ an as well ."
"( Laughter ) J@@ K : O@@ kay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in K@@ ore@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without te@@ ar@@ ing up ."
"N@@ un@@ a , it has been already 10 years that I ha@@ ven ’ t seen you ."
"I just wanted to say that I mis@@ s you , and I love you , and p@@ lease come back to me and sta@@ y al@@ ive ."
"And I — o@@ h , g@@ os@@ h ."
I still ha@@ ven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
"I will live my life happ@@ ily and study hard until I see you , and I pr@@ om@@ ise I will not cr@@ y again ."
"( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking for@@ ward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day ."
And can I also make a small mes@@ sage to my mo@@ m ?
"A@@ H : S@@ ure , p@@ lease ."
"@@ J@@ K : I ha@@ ven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still p@@ ra@@ y for me and think about me ."
I just wanted to say th@@ ank you for le@@ tting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to f@@ ill out some sort of we@@ b form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a dis@@ tor@@ ted sequ@@ ence of charac@@ ters like this ?
"@@ How many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?"
"O@@ kay , out@@ standing . So I inven@@ ted that ."
( Laughter ) O@@ r I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
"And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the ent@@ ity f@@ ill@@ ing out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer pro@@ gram that was writ@@ ten to sub@@ m@@ it the form mil@@ lions and mil@@ lions of times ."
"The reason it works is because humans , at least non@@ -@@ vi@@ su@@ all@@ y-@@ imp@@ ai@@ red humans , have no tr@@ ou@@ ble read@@ ing these dis@@ tor@@ ted squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly charac@@ ters , whe@@ re@@ as computer pro@@ gr@@ ams simply can &apos;t do it as well yet ."
"So for example , in the case of T@@ ic@@ ket@@ mas@@ ter , the reason you have to typ@@ e these dis@@ tor@@ ted charac@@ ters is to pre@@ v@@ ent sc@@ al@@ per@@ s from wr@@ iting a pro@@ gram that can bu@@ y mil@@ lions of tic@@ ke@@ ts , two at a time ."
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are used all over the Internet .
"And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the pre@@ c@@ ise sequ@@ ence of ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that is sho@@ wn to the u@@ ser is not so for@@ tun@@ ate ."
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o reg@@ is@@ tr@@ ation pa@@ ge .
"The ran@@ dom charac@@ ters that happened to be sho@@ wn to the u@@ ser were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spe@@ ll a word ."
But the best part is the mes@@ sage that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help des@@ k got about 20 minutes later .
"T@@ ex@@ t : &quot; &quot; H@@ el@@ p ! I &apos;ve been wa@@ iting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wa@@ it ."
"This of course , is not as bad as this po@@ or person ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A P@@ ro@@ ject is something that we did here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ e@@ ll@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used every@@ where ."
"@@ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next ev@@ olution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ e@@ ll@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company ."
"And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red this company ."
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the follo@@ wing realiz@@ ation : It turns out that appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s are typ@@ ed every@@ day by people around the world .
"When I first heard this , I was quite pr@@ oud of myself ."
"I thought , look at the imp@@ act that my research has had ."
But then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , each time you typ@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , essen@@ ti@@ ally you was@@ te 10 secon@@ ds of your time ."
"And if you mul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly that by 200 million , you get that hum@@ an@@ ity as a whole is wa@@ sting about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours every day typ@@ ing these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s ."
So then I started feel@@ ing bad .
"( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get ri@@ d of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s , because the se@@ cur@@ ity of the W@@ e@@ b sort of depen@@ ds on them ."
"But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this ef@@ for@@ t for something that is good for hum@@ an@@ ity ?"
"So see , here &apos;s the thing ."
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 secon@@ ds , your brain is doing something amazing ."
Y@@ our brain is doing something that compu@@ ters cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do u@@ se@@ ful work for those 10 secon@@ ds ?
"A@@ no@@ ther way of pu@@ tting it is , is there some hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get compu@@ ters to sol@@ ve , yet we can s@@ pl@@ it into tin@@ y 1@@ 0@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they sol@@ ve a little bit of this problem ?"
"And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; y@@ es , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now ."
"So what you may not know is that no@@ wa@@ days while you &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you au@@ th@@ en@@ tic@@ ating yourself as a human , but in ad@@ d@@ ition you &apos;re actually hel@@ ping us to dig@@ it@@ ize book@@ s ."
So let me expla@@ in how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of pro@@ jects out there trying to dig@@ it@@ ize book@@ s .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
"A@@ maz@@ on , now with the K@@ in@@ dle , is trying to dig@@ it@@ ize book@@ s ."
B@@ as@@ ically the way this works is you start with an old book .
"You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? L@@ ike a book ?"
"( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you s@@ can it ."
Now sc@@ an@@ ning a book is like taking a dig@@ ital photograp@@ h of every pa@@ ge of the book .
It gi@@ ves you an image for every pa@@ ge of the book .
This is an image with text for every pa@@ ge of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to de@@ ci@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
"That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ C@@ R , for op@@ tical charac@@ ter recog@@ nit@@ ion , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there ."
Now the problem is that O@@ C@@ R is not perfe@@ ct .
"E@@ speci@@ ally for ol@@ der book@@ s where the in@@ k has fa@@ ded and the pa@@ ges have turned ye@@ l@@ low , O@@ C@@ R cannot recogni@@ ze a lot of the words ."
"For example , for things that were writ@@ ten more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recogni@@ ze about 30 percent of the words ."
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recogni@@ ze and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typ@@ ing a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
"So the next time you typ@@ e a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re typ@@ ing are actually words that are coming from book@@ s that are being dig@@ it@@ ized that the computer could not recogni@@ ze ."
"And now the reason we have two words no@@ wa@@ days instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you ."
"But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot gra@@ de it for you ."
"So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer ."
"We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , p@@ lease typ@@ e both ."
"And if you typ@@ e the cor@@ re@@ ct word for the one for which the system already kno@@ ws the answer , it as@@ sum@@ es you are human , and it also gets some con@@ f@@ idence that you typ@@ ed the other word cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And if we re@@ pe@@ at this process to like 10 different people and all of them a@@ gre@@ e on what the new word is , then we get one more word dig@@ it@@ ized ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
So this is how the system works .
"And basically , since we re@@ lea@@ sed it about three or four years ago , a lot of we@@ b@@ sit@@ es have started s@@ wit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people was@@ ted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are hel@@ ping to dig@@ it@@ ize book@@ s ."
"So for example , T@@ ic@@ ket@@ mas@@ ter ."
"So every time you bu@@ y tic@@ ke@@ ts on T@@ ic@@ ket@@ mas@@ ter , you help to dig@@ it@@ ize a book ."
"F@@ ace@@ book : E@@ very time you ad@@ d a friend or p@@ oke somebody , you help to dig@@ it@@ ize a book ."
"T@@ wit@@ ter and about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 other sit@@ es are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
"And in fact , the number of sit@@ es that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing per day is really , really large ."
"It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about two and a half million book@@ s a year ."
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typ@@ ing C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ s on the Internet .
"( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , fun@@ n@@ y things can happen ."
And this is es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally true because now we &apos;re gi@@ ving people two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ sen En@@ gl@@ ish words next to each other .
So fun@@ n@@ y things can happen .
"For example , we presen@@ ted this word ."
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
"But if you present it along with another ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ sen word , bad things can happen ."
"So we get this . ( T@@ ex@@ t : bad ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even wor@@ se , because the particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite where we sho@@ wed this actually happened to be called The E@@ m@@ bas@@ s@@ y of the K@@ ing@@ dom of God ."
( Laughter ) O@@ op@@ s . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ E@@ d@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m ( T@@ ex@@ t : D@@ am@@ n li@@ ber@@ al ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on in@@ su@@ l@@ ting people left and right every@@ day .
"Now , of course , we &apos;re not just in@@ su@@ l@@ ting people ."
"S@@ e@@ e here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presen@@ ting two ran@@ dom@@ ly cho@@ sen words , interesting things can happen ."
"So this actually has given r@@ ise to a really big Internet me@@ me that ten@@ s of thousands of people have partic@@ i@@ pa@@ ted in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art ."
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
"I@@ ma@@ gine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ex@@ t : inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble to@@ as@@ ter ) Th@@ en what you &apos;re supp@@ o@@ sed to do is you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t of it ."
"Th@@ en of course , you f@@ ill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us dig@@ it@@ ize a book ."
"But then , first you take a scre@@ en sho@@ t , and then you dra@@ w something that is re@@ la@@ ted to it ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of these .
S@@ ome of them are very cu@@ te . ( T@@ ex@@ t : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) S@@ ome of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
"( T@@ ex@@ t : st@@ on@@ ed f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like p@@ al@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logical sh@@ vis@@ le , they con@@ tain S@@ no@@ o@@ p D@@ o@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )@@ "
"O@@ kay , so this is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A ."
So this is the fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite thing that I like about this whole project .
"This is the number of dis@@ tin@@ ct people that have hel@@ p@@ ed us dig@@ it@@ ize at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has hel@@ p@@ ed us dig@@ it@@ ize human knowledge ."
And it is num@@ bers like these that mot@@ i@@ v@@ ate my research a@@ gen@@ da .
"So the question that mot@@ i@@ v@@ ates my research is the follo@@ wing : If you look at hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale a@@ chi@@ e@@ ve@@ ments , these really big things that hum@@ an@@ ity has got@@ ten together and done his@@ tor@@ ically — like for example , building the p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ i@@ ds of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or the P@@ an@@ ama C@@ an@@ al or pu@@ tting a man on the M@@ o@@ on — there is a cur@@ ious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people ."
"It &apos;s we@@ ird ; they were all done with about 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people ."
"And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , co@@ ordin@@ ating more than 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people , let alone pa@@ ying them , was essen@@ ti@@ ally imp@@ os@@ sible ."
"But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you a project where we &apos;ve got@@ ten 7@@ 50 million people to help us dig@@ it@@ ize human knowledge ."
"So the question that mot@@ i@@ v@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the M@@ o@@ on with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?"
"So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different pro@@ jects that we &apos;ve been working on ."
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It has@@ n &apos;t yet been la@@ un@@ ched . It &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"S@@ ince it has@@ n &apos;t been la@@ un@@ ched , sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Yeah , I can tr@@ ust you &apos;ll do that ."
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
"It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my gra@@ du@@ ate studen@@ t , S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ ker ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s S@@ e@@ ver@@ in H@@ ac@@ ker ."
So I po@@ sed the question to my gra@@ du@@ ate studen@@ t .
"B@@ y the way , you did hear me cor@@ rec@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ac@@ ker ."
So I po@@ sed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free ?
"O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b ."
So right now the W@@ e@@ b is part@@ iti@@ on@@ ed into mul@@ ti@@ ple langu@@ ag@@ es .
A large fr@@ action of it is in En@@ gl@@ ish .
"If you don &apos;t know any En@@ gl@@ ish , you can &apos;t access it ."
"But there &apos;s large fr@@ ac@@ tions in other different langu@@ ag@@ es , and if you don &apos;t know those langu@@ ag@@ es , you can &apos;t access it ."
"So I would like to trans@@ l@@ ate all of the W@@ e@@ b , or at least most of the W@@ e@@ b , into every maj@@ or language ."
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
"Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use compu@@ ters to trans@@ l@@ ate ?"
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ l@@ ation ?
M@@ ach@@ ine trans@@ l@@ ation no@@ wa@@ days is star@@ ting to trans@@ l@@ ate some sen@@ ten@@ ces here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mis@@ takes .
"E@@ ven when it doesn &apos;t make a mis@@ take , since it makes so many mis@@ takes , you don &apos;t know whether to tr@@ ust it or not ."
So let me show you an example of something that was trans@@ la@@ ted with a machine .
A@@ c@@ tually it was a for@@ um p@@ ost .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ c@@ ri@@ pt .
It was trans@@ la@@ ted from J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese into En@@ gl@@ ish .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person star@@ ts ap@@ o@@ log@@ iz@@ ing for the fact that it &apos;s trans@@ la@@ ted with a computer .
So the next sen@@ ten@@ ce is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just expla@@ ining something .
"@@ Re@@ member , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ c@@ ri@@ pt ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : A@@ t often , the go@@ at@@ -@@ time inst@@ all a er@@ ro@@ r is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes the first part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : How many times like the win@@ d , a po@@ le , and the dra@@ g@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Th@@ en comes my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the question ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : This in@@ su@@ lt to father &apos;s st@@ ones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the en@@ ding , which is my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite part of the whole thing ."
"( T@@ ex@@ t : P@@ lease ap@@ o@@ log@@ ize for your stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many th@@ ank you . ) ( Laughter ) O@@ kay , so computer trans@@ l@@ ation , not yet good enough ."
So back to the question .
So we need people to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
"So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pa@@ y people to do this ?"
We could pa@@ y pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors to trans@@ l@@ ate the whole W@@ e@@ b .
We could do that .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it would be extre@@ me@@ ly ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
"For example , trans@@ l@@ ating a tin@@ y , tin@@ y fr@@ action of the whole W@@ e@@ b , W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , into one other language , S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia ex@@ ists in S@@ pan@@ ish , but it &apos;s very small com@@ par@@ ed to the size of En@@ gl@@ ish ."
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of En@@ gl@@ ish .
"If we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate the other 80 percent into S@@ pan@@ ish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most ex@@ plo@@ ited , out@@ sour@@ cing country out there ."
So it would be very ex@@ pen@@ sive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b into every maj@@ or language for free .
"Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realiz@@ e you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , two big ob@@ sta@@ cl@@ es ."
The first one is a l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there ex@@ ists 100 million people out there using the W@@ e@@ b who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us trans@@ l@@ ate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a l@@ ack of mot@@ i@@ v@@ ation .
How are we going to mot@@ i@@ v@@ ate people to actually trans@@ l@@ ate the W@@ e@@ b for free ?
"N@@ or@@ ma@@ lly , you have to pa@@ y people to do this ."
So how are we going to mot@@ i@@ v@@ ate them to do it for free ?
"Now when we were star@@ ting to think about this , we were b@@ loc@@ ked by these two things ."
"But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to sol@@ ve both these problems with the same solution ."
There &apos;s a way to k@@ ill two bir@@ ds with one st@@ one .
"And that is to trans@@ form language trans@@ l@@ ation into something that mil@@ lions of people want to do , and that also hel@@ ps with the problem of l@@ ack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education ."
"So it turns out that today , there are over 1@@ .@@ 2 billion people learning a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
"@@ People really , really want to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language ."
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being for@@ ced to do so in school .
"For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have p@@ ai@@ d over $ 500 for so@@ f@@ t@@ ware to learn a new language ."
"So people really , really want to learn a new language ."
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new we@@ b@@ s@@ ite — it &apos;s called D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the bas@@ ic idea is people learn a new language for free while sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously trans@@ l@@ ating the W@@ e@@ b .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
"So the way this works is wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re a just a begin@@ ner , we give you very , very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces ."
"There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces on the W@@ e@@ b ."
"We give you very , very simple sen@@ ten@@ ces along with what each word means ."
"And as you trans@@ l@@ ate them , and as you see how other people trans@@ l@@ ate them , you start learning the language ."
"And as you get more and more adv@@ an@@ ced , we give you more and more complex sen@@ ten@@ ces to trans@@ l@@ ate ."
"But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing ."
Now the cra@@ z@@ y thing about this me@@ th@@ od is that it actually really works .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , people are really , really learning a language ."
"We &apos;re mos@@ tly done building it , and now we &apos;re te@@ sting it ."
People really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the le@@ ad@@ ing language learning so@@ f@@ t@@ ware .
So people really do learn a language .
"And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting ."
"Because you see with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real con@@ tent ."
"As op@@ po@@ sed to learning with made@@ -@@ up sen@@ ten@@ ces , people are learning with real con@@ tent , which is in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly interesting ."
So people really do learn a language .
"But perhaps more sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , the trans@@ l@@ ations that we get from people using the s@@ ite , even though they &apos;re just begin@@ ners , the trans@@ l@@ ations that we get are as ac@@ cur@@ ate as those of pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors , which is very sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
So let me show you one example .
This is a sen@@ ten@@ ce that was trans@@ la@@ ted from G@@ er@@ man into En@@ gl@@ ish .
The top is the G@@ er@@ man .
The middle is an En@@ gl@@ ish trans@@ l@@ ation that was done by somebody who was a pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal En@@ gl@@ ish trans@@ l@@ ator who we p@@ ai@@ d 20 c@@ ents a word for this trans@@ l@@ ation .
"And the bot@@ to@@ m is a trans@@ l@@ ation by u@@ ser@@ s of D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , n@@ one of wh@@ om knew any G@@ er@@ man before they started using the s@@ ite ."
"You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfe@@ ct ."
"Now of course , we play a tr@@ ick here to make the trans@@ l@@ ations as good as pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal language trans@@ l@@ at@@ ors ."
We com@@ b@@ ine the trans@@ l@@ ations of mul@@ ti@@ ple begin@@ ners to get the qu@@ ality of a single pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal trans@@ l@@ ator .
"Now even though we &apos;re com@@ bin@@ ing the trans@@ l@@ ations , the s@@ ite actually can trans@@ l@@ ate pretty f@@ ast ."
"So let me show you , this is our est@@ ima@@ tes of how f@@ ast we could trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia from En@@ gl@@ ish into S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"@@ Re@@ member , this is 50 million doll@@ ar@@ s@@ -@@ wor@@ th of val@@ ue ."
"So if we wanted to trans@@ l@@ ate W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia into S@@ pan@@ ish , we could do it in five weeks with 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 ac@@ tive u@@ ser@@ s ."
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million ac@@ tive u@@ ser@@ s .
"S@@ ince all the pro@@ jects that my group has worked on so far have got@@ ten mil@@ lions of u@@ ser@@ s , we &apos;re h@@ ope@@ ful that we &apos;ll be able to trans@@ l@@ ate extre@@ me@@ ly f@@ ast with this project ."
Now the thing that I &apos;m most exc@@ ited about with D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this pro@@ v@@ ide@@ s a f@@ air business model for language education .
"So here &apos;s the thing : The curren@@ t business model for language education is the studen@@ t pa@@ ys , and in particular , the studen@@ t pa@@ ys R@@ o@@ se@@ tta S@@ t@@ one 500 dollars ."
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the curren@@ t business model .
The problem with this business model is that 9@@ 5 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ f@@ air to@@ wards the po@@ or .
This is tot@@ ally bi@@ a@@ sed to@@ wards the r@@ ich .
"Now see , in D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually cre@@ ating val@@ ue , you &apos;re trans@@ l@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could char@@ ge somebody for trans@@ l@@ ations ."
So this is how we could mon@@ et@@ ize this .
"S@@ ince people are cre@@ ating val@@ ue while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pa@@ y their money , they pa@@ y with their time ."
"But the mag@@ ical thing here is that they &apos;re pa@@ ying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language ."
So the n@@ ice thing about D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it pro@@ v@@ ide@@ s a f@@ air business model — one that doesn &apos;t dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ate against po@@ or people .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the s@@ ite .
"We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched , but if you go there , you can sig@@ n up to be part of our pri@@ v@@ ate be@@ ta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t yet la@@ un@@ ched this D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
"B@@ y the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually D@@ u@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really a@@ we@@ some team , some of wh@@ om are here ."
So th@@ ank you .
( Applause )
"In O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , there was a f@@ anta@@ stic doc@@ tor , who was very un@@ usu@@ al , nam@@ ed Al@@ ice S@@ te@@ war@@ t ."
"And Al@@ ice was un@@ usu@@ al par@@ tly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty r@@ are in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ."
"And she was br@@ il@@ li@@ ant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ gest F@@ el@@ low to be elec@@ ted to the R@@ o@@ y@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of Ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ ians ."
"S@@ he was un@@ usu@@ al too because she contin@@ u@@ ed to work after she got mar@@ ri@@ ed , after she had kids , and even after she got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced and was a single par@@ ent , she contin@@ u@@ ed her med@@ ical work ."
"And she was un@@ usu@@ al because she was really interested in a new science , the em@@ er@@ ging field of ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ o@@ logy , the study of pat@@ ter@@ ns in disease ."
"But like every scient@@ ist , she ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated that to make her mar@@ k , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and sol@@ ve it ."
The hard problem that Al@@ ice ch@@ ose was the ris@@ ing in@@ c@@ idence of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers .
"M@@ ost disease is cor@@ re@@ la@@ ted with po@@ ver@@ ty , but in the case of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were d@@ ying seem@@ ed mos@@ tly to come from af@@ f@@ lu@@ ent famil@@ ies ."
"So , what , she wanted to know , could expla@@ in this ano@@ ma@@ ly ?"
"Now , Al@@ ice had tr@@ ou@@ ble getting fun@@ ding for her research ."
"In the end , she got just 1@@ ,000 p@@ oun@@ ds from the L@@ ad@@ y T@@ ata M@@ em@@ ori@@ al pri@@ ze ."
And that me@@ ant she knew she only had one sho@@ t at collec@@ ting her data .
"Now , she had no idea what to look for ."
"This really was a nee@@ dle in a hay@@ sta@@ ck sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of ."
H@@ ad the children e@@ a@@ ten bo@@ il@@ ed s@@ wee@@ ts ?
H@@ ad they con@@ sum@@ ed col@@ ore@@ d d@@ rin@@ ks ?
D@@ id they e@@ at fish and chi@@ ps ?
D@@ id they have in@@ do@@ or or out@@ do@@ or pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
"And when her car@@ bon c@@ op@@ i@@ ed quest@@ i@@ on@@ na@@ ire started to come back , one thing and one thing only j@@ um@@ p@@ ed out with the st@@ at@@ is@@ tical cl@@ ar@@ ity of a kind that most scientists can only dre@@ am of ."
"B@@ y a r@@ ate of two to one , the children who had died had had mo@@ thers who had been X@@ -@@ ra@@ yed when pre@@ g@@ nan@@ t ."
Now that fin@@ ding f@@ le@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ ti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom .
"C@@ on@@ ven@@ ti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom he@@ ld that everything was sa@@ fe up to a point , a thre@@ sho@@ ld ."
"It f@@ le@@ w in the face of con@@ ven@@ ti@@ onal w@@ is@@ dom , which was huge en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m for the c@@ ool new technology of that age , which was the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y machine ."
"And it f@@ le@@ w in the face of doc@@ tors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who hel@@ p@@ ed patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them ."
"N@@ e@@ ver@@ the@@ less , Al@@ ice S@@ te@@ war@@ t ru@@ shed to pu@@ bl@@ ish her pre@@ lim@@ in@@ ary fin@@ d@@ ings in The L@@ an@@ ce@@ t in 19@@ 5@@ 6 ."
"@@ People got very exc@@ ited , there was talk of the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , and Al@@ ice really was in a big h@@ ur@@ ry to try to study all the ca@@ ses of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od cancer she could find before they dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed ."
"In fact , she need not have h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed ."
It was fully 25 years before the B@@ rit@@ ish and med@@ ical — B@@ rit@@ ish and American med@@ ical es@@ ta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ments ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed the pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e of X@@ -@@ ra@@ ying pre@@ g@@ nan@@ t women .
"The data was out there , it was open , it was f@@ ree@@ ly av@@ a@@ il@@ able , but no@@ body wanted to know ."
"A child a week was d@@ ying , but nothing changed ."
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t dri@@ ve change .
So for 25 years Al@@ ice S@@ te@@ war@@ t had a very big f@@ ight on her hands .
"So , how did she know that she was right ?"
"Well , she had a f@@ anta@@ stic model for thinking ."
"S@@ he worked with a st@@ at@@ is@@ tic@@ ian nam@@ ed G@@ e@@ or@@ ge K@@ ne@@ ale , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was pretty much everything that Al@@ ice wasn &apos;t ."
"So , Al@@ ice was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge was a re@@ cl@@ use ."
"A@@ l@@ ice was very war@@ m , very em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with her patients ."
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly pre@@ fer@@ red num@@ bers to people .
But he said this f@@ anta@@ stic thing about their working relation@@ ship .
"He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to pro@@ ve D@@ r@@ . S@@ te@@ war@@ t wrong . &quot; &quot; He ac@@ ti@@ vely sou@@ g@@ h@@ t dis@@ con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion ."
"D@@ i@@ fferen@@ t ways of looking at her mode@@ ls , at her st@@ at@@ is@@ tics , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ pro@@ ve her ."
He saw his job as cre@@ ating con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t around her the@@ or@@ ies .
"Because it was only by not being able to pro@@ ve that she was wrong , that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge could give Al@@ ice the con@@ f@@ idence she needed to know that she was right ."
It &apos;s a f@@ anta@@ stic model of col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation — thinking part@@ ners who ar@@ en &apos;t e@@ ch@@ o ch@@ am@@ bers .
"I won@@ der how many of us have , or dare to have , such col@@ lab@@ or@@ at@@ ors ."
Al@@ ice and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge were very good at con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of con@@ struc@@ tive con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t requ@@ ire ?
"Well , first of all , it requ@@ i@@ res that we find people who are very different from ourselves ."
"That means we have to res@@ ist the neur@@ ob@@ i@@ o@@ logical dri@@ ve , which means that we really pre@@ fer people mos@@ tly like ourselves , and it means we have to see@@ k out people with different bac@@ k@@ gr@@ oun@@ ds , different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to enga@@ ge with them ."
That requ@@ i@@ res a lot of pati@@ ence and a lot of energy .
"And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love ."
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be pre@@ par@@ ed to change our min@@ ds .
"A@@ l@@ ice &apos;s da@@ ughter told me that every time Al@@ ice went he@@ ad@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ head with a fe@@ l@@ low scient@@ ist , they made her think and think and think again ."
"&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y a f@@ ight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one relation@@ ship ."
"But it str@@ ik@@ es me that the big@@ gest problems we face , many of the big@@ gest dis@@ as@@ ters that we &apos;ve experi@@ en@@ ced , mos@@ tly ha@@ ven &apos;t come from individu@@ als , they &apos;ve come from organiz@@ ations , some of them big@@ ger than countries , many of them cap@@ able of a@@ ffe@@ c@@ ting hundre@@ ds , thousands , even mil@@ lions of lives ."
So how do organiz@@ ations think ?
"Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t ."
"And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t ."
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t .
"In sur@@ ve@@ ys of Eur@@ ope@@ an and American ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ti@@ ves , fully 8@@ 5 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issu@@ es or con@@ cer@@ ns at work that they were af@@ ra@@ id to ra@@ ise ."
"A@@ f@@ ra@@ id of the con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t that that would pro@@ v@@ oke , af@@ ra@@ id to get em@@ bro@@ il@@ ed in ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that they did not know how to man@@ age , and felt that they were b@@ ound to l@@ ose ."
E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organiz@@ ations mos@@ tly can &apos;t do what G@@ e@@ or@@ ge and Al@@ ice so tri@@ um@@ p@@ han@@ tly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
"And it means that people like many of us , who have run organiz@@ ations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mos@@ tly f@@ ai@@ l to get the best out of them ."
So how do we develo@@ p the s@@ kill@@ s that we need ?
"Because it does take s@@ k@@ ill and pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , too ."
"If we ar@@ en &apos;t going to be af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it ."
"So , rec@@ ently , I worked with an ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive nam@@ ed J@@ oe , and J@@ oe worked for a med@@ ical dev@@ ice company ."
And J@@ oe was very wor@@ ri@@ ed about the dev@@ ice that he was working on .
He thought that it was too com@@ plic@@ ated and he thought that its comple@@ x@@ ity created mar@@ gin@@ s of er@@ ro@@ r that could really h@@ ur@@ t people .
He was af@@ ra@@ id of doing da@@ ma@@ ge to the patients he was trying to help .
"But when he looked around his organiz@@ ation , no@@ body else seem@@ ed to be at all wor@@ ri@@ ed ."
"So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t ."
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;d look stu@@ pi@@ d .
"But he ke@@ pt wor@@ r@@ ying about it , and he wor@@ ri@@ ed about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he lo@@ ved ."
"In the end , J@@ oe and I found a way for him to ra@@ ise his con@@ cer@@ ns ."
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this s@@ itu@@ ation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and dou@@ b@@ ts .
So now J@@ oe had al@@ lies . They could think together .
"And y@@ es , there was a lot of con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t and de@@ b@@ ate and ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , but that allo@@ wed everyone around the table to be cre@@ ative , to sol@@ ve the problem , and to change the dev@@ ice ."
"@@ J@@ oe was what a lot of people might think of as a wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wer , ex@@ cept that like almost all wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ blo@@ wers , he wasn &apos;t a c@@ ran@@ k at all , he was pas@@ si@@ ona@@ tely dev@@ o@@ ted to the organiz@@ ation and the high@@ er pur@@ po@@ ses that that organiz@@ ation ser@@ ved ."
"But he had been so af@@ ra@@ id of con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , until finally he became more af@@ ra@@ id of the sil@@ ence ."
"And when he dar@@ ed to speak , he disco@@ vered much more inside him@@ self and much more give in the system than he had ever ima@@ gin@@ ed ."
And his col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es don &apos;t think of him as a c@@ ran@@ k .
They think of him as a lea@@ der .
"So , how do we have these con@@ vers@@ ations more eas@@ ily and more often ?"
"Well , the U@@ ni@@ versity of D@@ el@@ ft requ@@ i@@ res that its Ph@@ D students have to sub@@ m@@ it five sta@@ te@@ ments that they &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to de@@ f@@ end ."
"It doesn &apos;t really matter what the sta@@ te@@ ments are about , what mat@@ ters is that the can@@ di@@ da@@ tes are w@@ ill@@ ing and able to stand up to au@@ th@@ or@@ ity ."
"I think it &apos;s a f@@ anta@@ stic system , but I think lea@@ ving it to Ph@@ D can@@ di@@ da@@ tes is far too few people , and way too l@@ ate in life ."
"I think we need to be teach@@ ing these s@@ kill@@ s to kids and ad@@ ul@@ ts at every stage of their develop@@ ment , if we want to have thinking organiz@@ ations and a thinking society ."
The fact is that most of the big@@ gest c@@ ata@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ es that we &apos;ve wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed rare@@ ly come from information that is se@@ cre@@ t or hid@@ den .
"It comes from information that is f@@ ree@@ ly av@@ a@@ il@@ able and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully bl@@ in@@ d to , because we can &apos;t han@@ dle , don &apos;t want to han@@ dle , the con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t that it pro@@ v@@ ok@@ es ."
"But when we dare to bre@@ ak that sil@@ ence , or when we dare to see , and we create con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , we en@@ able ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking ."
"O@@ p@@ en information is f@@ anta@@ stic , open net@@ works are essen@@ tial ."
But the tru@@ th won &apos;t set us free until we develo@@ p the s@@ kill@@ s and the ha@@ bit and the tal@@ ent and the mor@@ al cou@@ ra@@ ge to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

"@@ Be@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ a@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"O@@ n the stage that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"My En@@ gl@@ ish lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many a@@ z@@ un@@ gu , white people . ( Laughter )@@ "
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sis@@ ters , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"@@ Be@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of po@@ or far@@ m@@ ers ."
"L@@ ike everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experi@@ en@@ ced an a@@ w@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
"My family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ s@@ ima for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ a@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ dar@@ y school , you have to pa@@ y school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fi@@ el@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I felt very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ ive education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read book@@ s , science book@@ s , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally phys@@ ics ."
I couldn &apos;t read En@@ gl@@ ish that well .
I used di@@ a@@ gr@@ ams and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electr@@ ic@@ ity .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ r@@ ig@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ en@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fr@@ ame and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four l@@ ights , with s@@ wit@@ ches , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mode@@ led after an elec@@ tri@@ c be@@ ll ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ r@@ ig@@ ation .
Q@@ ue@@ u@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a ho@@ te@@ l .
"So , on stage that day in A@@ ru@@ sha , my En@@ gl@@ ish lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Afr@@ ic@@ ans , and the po@@ or who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with your dre@@ ams ."
God b@@ less .
Ma@@ ybe one day you will wat@@ ch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , tr@@ ust yourself and believe ."
"W@@ ha@@ tever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"In the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist E@@ as@@ tern G@@ er@@ many , if you o@@ w@@ ned a t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er , you had to reg@@ is@@ ter it with the government ."
You had to reg@@ is@@ ter a sam@@ ple sh@@ e@@ et of text out of the t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er .
And this was done so the government could tr@@ ack where text was coming from .
"If they found a pap@@ er which had the wrong kind of thought , they could tr@@ ack down who created that thought ."
"And we in the W@@ est couldn &apos;t understand how any@@ body could do this , how much this would re@@ str@@ ic@@ t f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
We would never do that in our own countries .
"But today in 20@@ 11 , if you go and bu@@ y a col@@ or la@@ ser prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or la@@ ser prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and pr@@ int a pa@@ ge , that pa@@ ge will end up having s@@ light ye@@ l@@ low d@@ ots prin@@ ted on every single pa@@ ge in a pat@@ tern which makes the pa@@ ge uni@@ qu@@ e to you and to your prin@@ ter ."
This is happening to us today .
And no@@ body seem@@ s to be making a fus@@ s about it .
"And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us , the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
And this is one of the ma@@ in three sources of on@@ line problems today .
"If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the on@@ line world , we can group the atta@@ cks based on the atta@@ c@@ kers ."
We have three ma@@ in grou@@ ps .
We have on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als .
"L@@ ike here , we have M@@ r@@ . D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine ."
And the mot@@ i@@ ves of on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
"They use on@@ line atta@@ cks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it ."
"We actually have se@@ ver@@ al ca@@ ses of mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res on@@ line , mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their atta@@ cks ."
Here &apos;s V@@ l@@ ad@@ im@@ ir T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ art@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is S@@ te@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in .
"This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on ."
"These guys make their for@@ tun@@ es on@@ line , but they make it through the il@@ le@@ ga@@ l means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do on@@ line ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers to col@@ le@@ ct our cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information while we are doing on@@ line sh@@ op@@ ping from an in@@ fe@@ cted computer ."
"The U.S@@ . S@@ e@@ cre@@ t S@@ er@@ v@@ ice , two months ago , f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ w@@ is@@ s ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r@@ . S@@ am J@@ a@@ in right here , and that ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S@@ . dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ zen ."
M@@ r@@ . J@@ a@@ in him@@ self is on the lo@@ ose ; no@@ body kno@@ ws where he is .
And I cl@@ ai@@ m it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more like@@ ly for any of us to become the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of a cr@@ ime on@@ line than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se .
"In the future , the maj@@ or@@ ity of cr@@ ime will be happening on@@ line ."
The second maj@@ or group of atta@@ c@@ kers that we are wat@@ ching today are not mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated by money .
"They &apos;re mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated by something else — mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated by prote@@ sts , mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated by an op@@ in@@ ion , mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated by the la@@ ugh@@ s ."
G@@ rou@@ ps like A@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ri@@ sen up over the last 12 months and have become a maj@@ or pla@@ y@@ er in the field of on@@ line atta@@ cks .
"So those are the three ma@@ in atta@@ c@@ kers : cr@@ im@@ in@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ c@@ k@@ tiv@@ ists like A@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prote@@ st , but then the last group are n@@ ation sta@@ tes , govern@@ ments doing the atta@@ cks ."
And then we look at ca@@ ses like what happened in D@@ ig@@ i@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pr@@ ime example of what happens when govern@@ ments atta@@ ck against their own c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens .
"D@@ ig@@ i@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds — or actually , it was ."
It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy last f@@ all because they were ha@@ c@@ ked into .
S@@ ome@@ body br@@ oke in and they ha@@ c@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
"And I asked last week in a mee@@ ting with D@@ ut@@ ch government re@@ presen@@ t@@ ati@@ ves , I asked one of the lea@@ ders of the team whether he found pla@@ us@@ i@@ ble that people died because of the D@@ ig@@ i@@ N@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck ."
And his answer was y@@ es .
So how do people die as the resu@@ lt of a ha@@ ck like this ?
Well D@@ ig@@ i@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .
They se@@ ll cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
"Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted serv@@ ices , serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il ."
"Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their compe@@ t@@ it@@ ors , but these serv@@ ices are es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally pop@@ ular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an sta@@ tes like I@@ ran , where dis@@ s@@ iden@@ ts use fore@@ ig@@ n serv@@ ices like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more tr@@ us@@ t@@ wor@@ thy than the local serv@@ ices and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L conne@@ c@@ tions , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ o@@ p on their dis@@ cus@@ sions ."
E@@ x@@ cept they can if they ha@@ ck into a fore@@ ig@@ n C@@ .@@ A@@ .
and issue ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of D@@ ig@@ i@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
"What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ?"
"Well in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , the ri@@ o@@ ters lo@@ o@@ ted the he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an se@@ cre@@ t pol@@ ice in Ap@@ ri@@ l 20@@ 11 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pap@@ ers ."
"A@@ mon@@ g those pap@@ ers , was this bin@@ der ent@@ it@@ led &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were no@@ tes from a company based in G@@ er@@ many which had so@@ ld the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of to@@ ols for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communic@@ ation of the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens of the country ."
"They had so@@ ld this too@@ l for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Eur@@ os to the E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government ."
The company he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters are right here .
So W@@ es@@ tern govern@@ ments are pro@@ vi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with to@@ ols to do this against their own c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens .
But W@@ es@@ tern govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well .
"For example , in G@@ er@@ many , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called S@@ tate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by G@@ er@@ man government of@@ fici@@ als to inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ate their own c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
"If you are a su@@ spe@@ ct in a cr@@ im@@ inal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous , your phone will be t@@ app@@ ed ."
"But today , it goes be@@ yon@@ d that ."
They will ta@@ p your Internet conne@@ ction .
"They will even use to@@ ols like S@@ tate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ fe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ab@@ les them to wat@@ ch all your communic@@ ation , to lis@@ ten to your on@@ line dis@@ cus@@ sions , to col@@ le@@ ct your pas@@ s@@ words ."
"Now when we think dee@@ per about things like these , the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , that soun@@ ds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really a@@ ffe@@ ct me because I &apos;m a le@@ ga@@ l c@@ it@@ izen ."
Why should I wor@@ ry ?
"Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; &quot; And this is an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , which doesn &apos;t make sense ."
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is imp@@ li@@ ed .
P@@ ri@@ v@@ acy is not up for dis@@ cus@@ sion .
This is not a question between pri@@ v@@ acy against se@@ cur@@ ity .
It &apos;s a question of f@@ ree@@ dom against control .
"And while we might tr@@ ust our govern@@ ments right now , right here in 20@@ 11 , any right we give away will be given away for good ."
"And do we tr@@ ust , do we bl@@ ind@@ ly tr@@ ust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?"
And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ un@@ dan@@ e soun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my t@@ um@@ ble d@@ r@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) ( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and e@@ vi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ought to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ sequ@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ st@@ itu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an ill@@ us@@ ion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ u@@ es is an ill@@ us@@ ion — and actually quite a dan@@ ger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ dat@@ ion for mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ u@@ es see@@ m to be@@ long to different sp@@ he@@ res ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ ption of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ u@@ es are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the we@@ ll@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ ures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ l@@ ig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ as@@ sion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ f@@ fer . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fe@@ l@@ low pr@@ ima@@ tes than we are about in@@ se@@ cts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ po@@ sed to a gre@@ a@@ ter range of poten@@ tial happ@@ iness and su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to not@@ ice here is that this is a fac@@ tual cl@@ ai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ stru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ cts ."
"And there &apos;s no not@@ ion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ u@@ es that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about consci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ u@@ es from rel@@ ig@@ ion , even if you think that good and e@@ vi@@ l ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely rel@@ ate to con@@ diti@@ ons after death — ei@@ ther to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happ@@ iness with God or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing in he@@ ll — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about consci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ s@@ ist after death is itself a fac@@ tual cl@@ ai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the con@@ diti@@ ons of we@@ ll@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fail@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where st@@ ran@@ g@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , where people are mur@@ de@@ red in@@ dis@@ cr@@ im@@ ina@@ tely ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ou@@ ld ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ou@@ ld it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the e@@ vi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s ? P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human commun@@ ities fl@@ our@@ ish , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality re@@ la@@ tes to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ u@@ es we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our s@@ itu@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many le@@ ve@@ ls — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and polit@@ ical ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human we@@ ll@@ -@@ being we are , of ne@@ cess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ic@@ ide b@@ om@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 v@@ ir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produ@@ ct of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tribu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by chan@@ ging our bra@@ ins ."
"And so the@@ re@@ fore whatever cul@@ tur@@ al vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ our@@ ish can , at least in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ text of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , psy@@ cho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the consci@@ ous experience of consci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can the@@ re@@ fore vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differen@@ ces in the we@@ ll@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ at@@ ures , both person@@ al and collec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to not@@ ice is that perhaps there are sta@@ tes of human we@@ ll@@ -@@ being that we rare@@ ly access , that few people access ."
And these awa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these sta@@ tes can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ st@@ ical or sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other sta@@ tes that we can &apos;t access because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could access them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ aran@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have sci@@ enti@@ fic ans@@ wers to every con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able mor@@ al question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stan@@ ce , that you will one day con@@ su@@ lt a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should b@@ om@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nu@@ clear fac@@ il@@ ities , or whether you can de@@ du@@ ct the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions a@@ ffe@@ ct human we@@ ll@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ wers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to the question of how humans fl@@ our@@ ish — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stan@@ ce , there are 2@@ 1 sta@@ tes in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is le@@ ga@@ l , where it is le@@ ga@@ l for a teach@@ er to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ i@@ ses and bl@@ is@@ ters and even bre@@ aking the s@@ kin ."
"And hundre@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ c@@ iden@@ t@@ ally , are sub@@ je@@ cted to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ l@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ ts , I think , will f@@ ai@@ l to sur@@ pr@@ ise you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut .
And the r@@ ation@@ ale for this behavior is ex@@ plic@@ it@@ ly rel@@ ig@@ ious .
"The cre@@ ator of the universe him@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we s@@ po@@ il the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the obvi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and viol@@ ence and public hum@@ il@@ i@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy emot@@ i@@ onal develop@@ ment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any dou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the not@@ ion of we@@ ll@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed , and see@@ min@@ g@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ stru@@ ed ."
"And so , how the@@ re@@ fore can there be an ob@@ je@@ ctive not@@ ion of we@@ ll@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , conside@@ r by an@@ al@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ de@@ fin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
W@@ hen this st@@ at@@ ue was car@@ ved the a@@ verage life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we med@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a m@@ ara@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be conside@@ red a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
People will se@@ nd you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ d@@ ition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ ly open for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dis@@ tin@@ ction between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as clear and con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to not@@ ice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ min@@ e an ob@@ je@@ ctive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a range of materi@@ als that con@@ st@@ itu@@ te heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a clear dis@@ tin@@ ction between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ wers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ pt us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tr@@ ition ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l mor@@ ality would requ@@ ire mor@@ al pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stan@@ ce , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as mor@@ al tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ side@@ r , by an@@ al@@ o@@ gy , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ ue@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ ue@@ en is a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ ma@@ in of perfe@@ ct ob@@ je@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the mor@@ al sp@@ here ."
Con@@ side@@ r the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the pos@@ ition , gener@@ ally spe@@ aking , of our inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pr@@ oud de@@ ni@@ zen@@ s of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and da@@ ugh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ en@@ g@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row bat@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ the@@ red in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
W@@ ho are we to pre@@ te@@ nd that we know so little about human we@@ ll@@ -@@ being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary we@@ ar@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather often , is to mur@@ der her out of sh@@ ame ?"
"@@ Just let that fact de@@ ton@@ ate in your brain for a minu@@ te : Y@@ our da@@ ughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ presen@@ ts a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfe@@ ct solution in our own society ."
"For in@@ stan@@ ce , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ stand almost any@@ where in the ci@@ vil@@ ized world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may requ@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hy to see something wrong with these images ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the perfe@@ ct ex@@ pres@@ sion of psy@@ cho@@ logical b@@ al@@ ance with re@@ spe@@ ct to vari@@ ab@@ les like you@@ th and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ t@@ ima@@ l environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ presen@@ ts a place of better b@@ al@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the mor@@ al lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape ."
But the thing to not@@ ice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the iron@@ y , from my per@@ spe@@ ctive , is that the only people who see@@ m to gener@@ ally a@@ gre@@ e with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to mor@@ al questions are rel@@ ig@@ ious de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ wers to mor@@ al questions because they got these ans@@ wers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ d , not because they made an inte@@ llig@@ ent an@@ al@@ ys@@ is of the ca@@ u@@ ses and con@@ d@@ ition of human and anima@@ l we@@ ll@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ d@@ ur@@ ance of rel@@ ig@@ ion as a l@@ ens through which most people view mor@@ al questions has se@@ para@@ ted most mor@@ al talk from real questions of human and anima@@ l su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
This is why we spend our time talking about things like ga@@ y mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nu@@ clear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ u@@ es .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to not@@ ice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ cul@@ ar , ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c , scient@@ ist typ@@ es ."
W@@ hen talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differen@@ ces of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stan@@ ce the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama gets up every mor@@ ning med@@ it@@ ating on comp@@ as@@ sion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an inte@@ gr@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent of human happ@@ iness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and kill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to pro@@ f@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ es@@ tern inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tu@@ als look at this s@@ itu@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent that poten@@ ti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He l@@ ik@@ es cho@@ col@@ ate , he l@@ ik@@ es v@@ an@@ ill@@ a ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot@@ ice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the smar@@ test phys@@ ic@@ ists around who is the smar@@ test phys@@ ic@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a phys@@ ics con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing the@@ ory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ son@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a phys@@ ic@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing the@@ ory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of str@@ ing the@@ ory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to be@@ long to any str@@ ing the@@ ory clu@@ b that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
W@@ hen@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ ions must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a do@@ ma@@ in of exper@@ t@@ ise .
That is what it is for knowledge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves that in the mor@@ al sp@@ here there is no such thing as mor@@ al exper@@ t@@ ise , or mor@@ al tal@@ ent , or mor@@ al gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th conside@@ r@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ ban have a point of view on phys@@ ics that is wor@@ th conside@@ r@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less obvi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human we@@ ll@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ wers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing , and mor@@ ality re@@ la@@ tes to that do@@ ma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that re@@ li@@ ably le@@ ad to nee@@ d@@ less human su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world f@@ ill@@ ed with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inven@@ ted ; it will always be eas@@ i@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seem@@ s to me , the@@ re@@ fore , pa@@ ten@@ tly obvi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and to@@ l@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differen@@ ces in not@@ ions of human we@@ ll@@ -@@ being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or to@@ l@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differen@@ ces in the not@@ ions about how disease spre@@ ads , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ d@@ ings and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ wers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ wers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble materi@@ al there ."
"W@@ he@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , he@@ ar@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seem@@ s to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ s@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the Mus@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ ok@@ en with a lot of Mus@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a ce@@ le@@ br@@ ation of fe@@ ma@@ le speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resu@@ lt of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated psy@@ cho@@ logical view — &quot; that ma@@ le l@@ ust is not to be tr@@ us@@ ted . &quot;"
"I mean , can you enga@@ ge in a con@@ vers@@ ation with that kind of woman without seem@@ ing kind of cul@@ tur@@ al im@@ peri@@ al@@ ist ?"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ r@@ is : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sen@@ ten@@ ce , wat@@ ching the clo@@ ck tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a con@@ text where men have certain expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ aran@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y hat , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to vol@@ un@@ tari@@ ly do whatever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we shou@@ ldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ ar@@ ing a full bur@@ q@@ a ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what ro@@ lling the clo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , b@@ al@@ an@@ cing mor@@ al pro@@ gre@@ ss with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward under@@ standing our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ tai@@ l , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the pos@@ itive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ al@@ ities of ourselves in much gre@@ a@@ ter de@@ tai@@ l ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand pos@@ itive social emot@@ ion like em@@ pa@@ thy and comp@@ as@@ sion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we be@@ gin to shin@@ e light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my da@@ ughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ f@@ ident and we@@ ll@@ -@@ e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted in the con@@ text of men who do des@@ ire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
D@@ o people love their da@@ ugh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ wers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the resu@@ l@@ ts come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ in@@ ctive curren@@ t ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mod@@ ul@@ o one obvi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ text of a tru@@ ly de@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ onal beli@@ e@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my ga@@ y son was going to go to he@@ ll if he found a bo@@ y@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ p@@ ed his head off . And that was the most comp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts al@@ ig@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emot@@ ion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about we@@ ll@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger con@@ text ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing e@@ c@@ sta@@ s@@ y and then blo@@ wing him@@ self up on a bu@@ s ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ vers@@ ation I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an hon@@ or . Thank you .

( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a dis@@ tin@@ ct pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ge to be here .
"A few weeks ago , I saw a video on Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be of Con@@ gre@@ s@@ s@@ woman G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el@@ le G@@ i@@ f@@ for@@ ds at the early sta@@ ges of her reco@@ very from one of those a@@ w@@ ful bu@@ l@@ le@@ ts ."

"And it &apos;s a very powerful and po@@ ig@@ nan@@ t re@@ min@@ der of how the beau@@ ty of music has the ability to speak where words f@@ ai@@ l , in this case liter@@ ally speak ."

"S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly , what we &apos;re fin@@ ding with these con@@ cer@@ ts , away from the stage , away from the fo@@ ot@@ l@@ ights , out of the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do ta@@ il@@ s , the mus@@ ic@@ ians become the con@@ du@@ it for de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing the tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s ther@@ ap@@ e@@ u@@ tic ben@@ ef@@ its of music on the brain to an au@@ dience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make ."
"@@ Just as me@@ dic@@ ine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building b@@ loc@@ ks of the body alone , the power and beau@@ ty of music tran@@ sc@@ ends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our be@@ lo@@ ved ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
Mus@@ ic tran@@ sc@@ ends the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic beau@@ ty alone .
"The sy@@ n@@ ch@@ ron@@ y of emot@@ ions that we experience when we hear an op@@ era by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a sym@@ p@@ hon@@ y by B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms , or ch@@ am@@ ber music by Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven , compe@@ ls us to remember our shar@@ ed , common hum@@ an@@ ity , the dee@@ p@@ ly commun@@ al conne@@ cted consci@@ ous@@ ness , the em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic consci@@ ous@@ ness that neur@@ op@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist I@@ a@@ in M@@ c@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ r@@ ist says is har@@ d-@@ wi@@ red into our brain &apos;s right he@@ mis@@ p@@ here ."
"And for those living in the most de@@ hum@@ an@@ iz@@ ing con@@ diti@@ ons of mental ill@@ ness within h@@ ome@@ les@@ s@@ ness and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beau@@ ty of music off@@ ers a chan@@ ce for them to tran@@ sc@@ end the world around them , to remember that they still have the cap@@ ac@@ ity to experience something beautiful and that hum@@ an@@ ity has not for@@ got@@ ten them ."
"And the s@@ par@@ k of that beau@@ ty , the s@@ par@@ k of that hum@@ an@@ ity trans@@ for@@ ms into hope , and we know , whether we cho@@ ose the pat@@ h of music or of me@@ dic@@ ine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must in@@ still within our commun@@ ities , within our au@@ di@@ ences , if we want to insp@@ ire heal@@ ing from within ."
"I &apos;d like to end with a quot@@ e by J@@ o@@ h@@ n K@@ e@@ ats , the R@@ om@@ an@@ tic En@@ gl@@ ish po@@ et , a very fam@@ ous quot@@ e that I &apos;m sure all of you know ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ ats him@@ self had also given up a care@@ er in me@@ dic@@ ine to pur@@ su@@ e po@@ e@@ try , but he died when he was a year ol@@ der than me ."
"And K@@ e@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ au@@ ty is tru@@ th , and tru@@ th beau@@ ty ."
"That is all y@@ e know on Earth , and all y@@ e need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause )@@ "
"Th@@ ank you so much everyone from TED , and Ch@@ r@@ is and A@@ my in particular ."
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not s@@ le@@ pt in weeks .
"N@@ ei@@ l and I were sitting there com@@ par@@ ing how little we &apos;ve s@@ le@@ pt in an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so ner@@ v@@ ous — and I do this when I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organiz@@ ation called 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might jo@@ in in and do sim@@ il@@ ar things ."
"B@@ ack in about 20@@ 00 , I was living in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n , I was trying to fin@@ ish my first book , I was wan@@ der@@ ing around da@@ z@@ ed every day because I wr@@ ote from 12 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ ."
So I would walk around in a da@@ ze during the day .
"I had no mental ac@@ u@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble hours ."
"In the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that I li@@ ved in , P@@ ar@@ k S@@ lo@@ p@@ e , there are a lot of writ@@ ers — it &apos;s like a very high per cap@@ ita r@@ ati@@ o of writ@@ ers to norma@@ l people ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I had gro@@ wn up around a lot of teach@@ ers ."
"My mo@@ m was a teach@@ er , my sis@@ ter became a teach@@ er and after col@@ le@@ ge so many of my friends went into teach@@ ing ."
"And so I was always he@@ ar@@ ing them talk about their lives and how insp@@ ir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and con@@ stan@@ tly insp@@ ir@@ ing people I knew ."
"But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the stru@@ g@@ g@@ les they were de@@ al@@ ing with ."
"And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teach@@ ing in city s@@ cho@@ ols were having tr@@ ou@@ ble with their students kee@@ ping up at gra@@ de level , in their read@@ ing and wr@@ iting in particular ."
"Now , so many of these students had come from hou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds where En@@ gl@@ ish isn &apos;t sp@@ ok@@ en in the home , where a lot of them have different speci@@ al needs , learning dis@@ ab@@ il@@ ities . And of course they &apos;re working in s@@ cho@@ ols which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ fun@@ ded ."
"And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bo@@ dies , more on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , more hours , more exper@@ t@@ ise from people that have s@@ kill@@ s in En@@ gl@@ ish and can work with these students on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five clas@@ ses of 30 to 40 students each ."
"This can le@@ ad up to 1@@ 50 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day ."
How can we possi@@ bly give each studen@@ t even one h@@ our a week of on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly the wor@@ k@@ week and cl@@ one the teach@@ ers .
And so we started talking about this .
"And at the same time , I thought about this mas@@ sive group of people I knew : writ@@ ers , ed@@ it@@ ors , jour@@ n@@ al@@ ists , gra@@ du@@ ate students , as@@ sis@@ tan@@ t pro@@ fe@@ s@@ sor@@ s , you name it ."
"A@@ ll these people that had sort of f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble dai@@ ly hours and an intere@@ st in the En@@ gl@@ ish word — I hope to have an intere@@ st in the En@@ gl@@ ish language , but I &apos;m not spe@@ aking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clo@@ ck has got me ."
"But everyone that I knew had an intere@@ st in the pr@@ ima@@ cy of the writ@@ ten word in terms of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing a demo@@ cr@@ acy , n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ l@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed life ."
"And so they had , you know , their time and their intere@@ st , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a con@@ du@@ it that I knew of in my community to bring these two commun@@ ities together ."
"So when I mo@@ ved back to S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , we ren@@ ted this building ."
"And the idea was to put M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we publi@@ shed t@@ w@@ ice or three times a year , and a few other ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines — we were going to move it into an off@@ ice for the first time ."
It used to be in my kit@@ ch@@ en in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n .
"We were going to move it into an off@@ ice , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writ@@ ers and ed@@ it@@ ors and everybody — sort of a wr@@ iting community — coming into the off@@ ice every day any@@ way , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get ex@@ tr@@ a help on their writ@@ ten h@@ ome@@ work , so you have basically no bor@@ der between these two commun@@ ities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students f@@ low in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you tra@@ de , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is ."
You give those hours in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on to the students in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
"So , we had this place , we ren@@ ted it , the lan@@ d@@ l@@ or@@ d was all for it . We did this mur@@ al , that &apos;s a Ch@@ r@@ is W@@ are mur@@ al , that basically expla@@ ins the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in mur@@ al form — it takes a long time to dig@@ est and you have to stand in the middle of the ro@@ ad ."
So we ren@@ ted this space .
"And everything was great ex@@ cept the lan@@ d@@ l@@ or@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zon@@ ed for re@@ tai@@ l ; you have to come up with something ."
You &apos;ve got@@ ta se@@ ll something .
"You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ha ! Re@@ ally ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly to se@@ ll , but we did all the ne@@ cess@@ ary research ."
"It used to be a we@@ ight room , so there were ru@@ b@@ ber flo@@ ors be@@ low , ac@@ ou@@ stic ti@@ le ce@@ il@@ ings and f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent l@@ ights ."
"We took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ o@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ ite@@ wa@@ shed be@@ ams and it had the look — while we were re@@ nov@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hu@@ ll of a ship . &quot;"
"And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should se@@ ll supp@@ lies to the working bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody la@@ ug@@ h , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that ."
Let &apos;s se@@ ll p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ lies . &quot; &quot; This is the p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore .
"You see , this is sort of a s@@ ket@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ kin ."
"A great car@@ pen@@ ter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of p@@ ir@@ ate su@@ p@@ pl@@ y-@@ like ."
Here you see plan@@ ks so@@ ld by the foo@@ t and we have supp@@ lies to com@@ b@@ at sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
"We have the pe@@ g le@@ gs there , that are all han@@ d@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you ."
"@@ U@@ p at the top , you see the e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch dis@@ play , which is the black col@@ um@@ n there for every@@ day use for your e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pas@@ te@@ l and other col@@ ors for ste@@ pp@@ ing out at night — speci@@ al oc@@ c@@ as@@ ions , ba@@ r mit@@ z@@ v@@ a@@ h@@ s and whatever ."
So we open@@ ed this place . And this is a v@@ at that we f@@ ill with tre@@ asu@@ res that students di@@ g in .
This is re@@ plac@@ e@@ ment eyes in case you l@@ ose one .
These are some sig@@ ns that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ r@@ ac@@ tical J@@ ok@@ ing with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
"W@@ hi@@ le you &apos;re read@@ ing the sig@@ n , we pu@@ ll a ro@@ p@@ e behind the coun@@ ter and e@@ ight mo@@ p he@@ ads dro@@ p on your head ."
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s he@@ ads .
"It became mo@@ p he@@ ads . And this is the fish the@@ a@@ ter , which is just a s@@ al@@ t@@ water tan@@ k with three se@@ ats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter ."
"So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s of@@ fic@@ es , where all of us would be working on the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine and book ed@@ iting and things like that ."
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
"We set the place up , we open@@ ed up , we spent months and months re@@ nov@@ ating this place ."
"We had ta@@ bl@@ es , cha@@ ir@@ s , compu@@ ters , everything ."
I went to a d@@ ot@@ -@@ co@@ m au@@ ction at a H@@ o@@ li@@ day In@@ n in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to and I b@@ ought 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a str@@ oke of a p@@ ad@@ dle .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we b@@ ought &apos; e@@ m , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited ."
"It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writ@@ ers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And we s@@ at . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . we put a san@@ d@@ w@@ ich bo@@ ard out on the front side@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree T@@ u@@ tor@@ ing for Y@@ our En@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ Re@@ la@@ ted and W@@ rit@@ ing@@ -@@ Re@@ la@@ ted N@@ ee@@ ds — Just C@@ ome In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to stor@@ m the ga@@ tes , they &apos;re g@@ onna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t ."
"And so we wa@@ ited , we s@@ at at the ta@@ bl@@ es , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited ."
"And everybody was be@@ coming very dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged because it was weeks and weeks that we wa@@ ited , really , where no@@ body came in ."
"And then somebody al@@ er@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a tr@@ ust ga@@ p , because we were oper@@ ating behind a p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?"
"And so then , around that time , I per@@ su@@ a@@ ded a woman nam@@ ed N@@ in@@ e@@ ve@@ h C@@ al@@ ig@@ ari , a lon@@ g@@ time S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o educ@@ ator — she was teach@@ ing in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity , she had all the experience ne@@ cess@@ ary , knew everything about education , was conne@@ cted with all the teach@@ ers and community mem@@ bers in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od — I con@@ v@@ in@@ ced her to move up from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity where she was teach@@ ing ."
She took over as ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive di@@ rec@@ tor .
"I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ ro@@ ads with the teach@@ ers and the parents and the students and everything , and so su@@ d@@ den@@ ly it was actually full every day ."
And what we were trying to off@@ er every day was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion .
The go@@ al was to have a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one r@@ ati@@ o with every one of these students .
"You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 3@@ 5 to 40 hours a year with on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , a studen@@ t can get one gra@@ de level high@@ er ."
"And so most of these students , En@@ gl@@ ish is not sp@@ ok@@ en in the home ."
"They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a ch@@ ur@@ ch pe@@ w that I b@@ ought in a B@@ er@@ ke@@ le@@ y au@@ ction right there — the parents will sometimes wat@@ ch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"So that was the bas@@ is of it , was on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
"If you &apos;re on V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a S@@ tre@@ et within those few b@@ loc@@ ks at around 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big bac@@ k@@ p@@ ac@@ ks , or whatever , actually run@@ ning to this space , which is very st@@ range , because it &apos;s school , in a way ."
But there was something psy@@ cho@@ logical happening there that was just a little bit different .
"And the other thing was , there was no st@@ ig@@ ma ."
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds we@@ ren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ en@@ ter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s@@ -@@ Th@@ at@@ -@@ N@@ ee@@ d-@@ M@@ ore@@ -@@ H@@ el@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 2@@ 6 V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it was a p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ ly st@@ ore , which is in@@ san@@ e ."
"And then secon@@ dly , there &apos;s a publi@@ shing company in the back ."
"And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same ta@@ bl@@ es very often , and shou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ shou@@ l@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ ne@@ x@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ computer with the students ."
"And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter — publi@@ shing cen@@ ter , is what we called it — and a wr@@ iting cen@@ ter ."
"They go in , and they might be working with a high school studen@@ t actually working on a no@@ vel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too ."
So there &apos;s no st@@ ig@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a cre@@ ative en@@ de@@ av@@ or .
They &apos;re seeing ad@@ ul@@ ts . They &apos;re mode@@ ling their behavior .
"These ad@@ ul@@ ts , they &apos;re working in their field ."
"They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these ad@@ ul@@ ts and it all sort of fe@@ e@@ ds on each other ."
"There &apos;s a lot of cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ pol@@ lin@@ ation . The only problem , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally for the ad@@ ul@@ ts working at M@@ c@@ S@@ we@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who ha@@ dn &apos;t ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly b@@ ought into all of this when they sig@@ ned up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room . ( Laughter ) W@@ it@@ h like 60 kids a day , this is a problem ."
"But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ i@@ shing their h@@ ome@@ work in a given day , working on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one , getting all this atten@@ tion — they go home , they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed . They don &apos;t st@@ all ."
They don &apos;t do their h@@ ome@@ work in front of the T@@ V .
"They &apos;re allo@@ wed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , en@@ jo@@ y their family , en@@ jo@@ y other ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play ."
And that makes a happy family .
A bun@@ ch of happy famil@@ ies in a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a happy community .
A bun@@ ch of happy commun@@ ities ti@@ ed together is a happy city and a happy world .
"So the key to it all is h@@ ome@@ work ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion ."
"So we started off with about 12 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hun@@ d@@ red ."
"And we now have 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers on our r@@ os@@ ter ."
And we make it incredi@@ bly easy to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
"The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a mon@@ th , those two hours shou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ shou@@ l@@ der , next to one studen@@ t , con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted atten@@ tion , shin@@ ing this be@@ am of light on their work , on their th@@ ough@@ ts and their self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , is going to be absolu@@ tely trans@@ forma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before ."
"So we said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ven if you have two hours one S@@ un@@ day every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s par@@ tly why the tu@@ tor cor@@ ps gre@@ w so f@@ ast ."
"Th@@ en we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ? &quot; &quot; So we started br@@ ing@@ ing in clas@@ ses during the day ."
"So every day , there &apos;s a field tri@@ p where they together create a book — you can see it being typ@@ ed up ab@@ o@@ ve ."
This is one of the clas@@ ses getting way too exc@@ ited about wr@@ iting .
"You just point a c@@ amera at a clas@@ s , and it always looks like this ."
So this is one of the book@@ s that they do .
"N@@ ot@@ ice the t@@ it@@ le of the book , &quot; The B@@ ook That W@@ as N@@ ever C@@ he@@ c@@ ked O@@ ut : T@@ itan@@ ic . &quot;"
"And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce there was a book nam@@ ed C@@ in@@ dy that was about the T@@ itan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; So , me@@ an@@ while , there &apos;s an ad@@ ult in the back typ@@ ing this up , taking it completely seri@@ ously , which blo@@ ws their mind ."
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a sho@@ t of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the ev@@ ents .
The teach@@ ers that we work with — and everything is different to teach@@ ers — they tell us what to do .
"We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely , completely ma@@ l@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us ."
"The teach@@ ers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most u@@ se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the s@@ cho@@ ols ?"
"Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly , who don &apos;t have really ac@@ tive parents that are br@@ ing@@ ing them in , or ar@@ en &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 people on our tu@@ tor r@@ os@@ ter ."
"@@ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teach@@ er will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five S@@ un@@ days ."
"We &apos;re working on our col@@ le@@ ge es@@ says . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the w@@ ire : 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 tu@@ tors ."
W@@ ho@@ ever can make it sig@@ ns up . They go in about a half an h@@ our before the clas@@ s .
"The teach@@ er te@@ lls them what to do , how to do it , what their tra@@ ining is , what their project is so far ."
"They work under the teach@@ er &apos;s gu@@ ide , and it &apos;s all in one big room ."
"And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going stra@@ ight from their wor@@ k@@ place , stra@@ ight from home , stra@@ ight into the clas@@ s@@ room and working di@@ rec@@ tly with the students ."
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
"Th@@ en another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a clas@@ s@@ room and you can sta@@ ff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the E@@ ve@@ re@@ t@@ t M@@ id@@ dle S@@ ch@@ ool W@@ rit@@ ers &apos; R@@ oo@@ m , where we de@@ cor@@ ated it in bu@@ c@@ can@@ e@@ er st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s right off the li@@ br@@ ary . And there we ser@@ ve all 5@@ 2@@ 9 kids in this middle school .
"This is their ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , the &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ igh@@ t-@@ U@@ p N@@ e@@ ws , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going col@@ um@@ n from Ma@@ y@@ or G@@ av@@ in N@@ e@@ w@@ so@@ m in both langu@@ ag@@ es — En@@ gl@@ ish and S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"So then one day I@@ sa@@ be@@ l A@@ ll@@ en@@ de wr@@ ote to us and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sig@@ n a book with high school students ?"
"I want them to write about how to a@@ chi@@ eve pe@@ ace in a viol@@ ent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good M@@ ar@@ sh@@ all H@@ ig@@ h S@@ ch@@ ool , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment to the students ."
"And we said , &quot; &quot; I@@ sa@@ be@@ l A@@ ll@@ en@@ de is going to read all your es@@ says at the end ."
She &apos;s going to pu@@ bl@@ ish them in a book .
She &apos;s going to spon@@ s@@ or the prin@@ ting of this book in pap@@ er@@ back form .
"It &apos;s going to be av@@ a@@ il@@ able in all the book@@ sto@@ res in the B@@ a@@ y A@@ re@@ a and thr@@ ough@@ out the world , on A@@ maz@@ on and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside au@@ dience , there was I@@ sa@@ be@@ l A@@ ll@@ en@@ de on the other end ."
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredi@@ bly well .
We had a big par@@ ty at the end .
This is a book that you can find any@@ where . So that led to a seri@@ es of these .
"You can see A@@ my T@@ an spon@@ sore@@ d the next one , &quot; I M@@ ight G@@ et S@@ ome@@ where . &quot;"
And this became an on@@ going thing . M@@ ore and more book@@ s .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
"The kids will work har@@ der than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be per@@ man@@ ent , know it &apos;s going to be on a sh@@ el@@ f , know that no@@ body can d@@ im@@ in@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ ore@@ d their words , hon@@ ore@@ d their th@@ ough@@ ts with hundre@@ ds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this atten@@ tion that we give to their th@@ ough@@ ts ."
"And once they a@@ chi@@ eve that level , once they &apos;ve writ@@ ten at that level , they can never go back ."
It &apos;s absolu@@ tely trans@@ forma@@ tive .
And so then they &apos;re all so@@ ld in the st@@ ore . This is ne@@ ar the plan@@ ks .
We se@@ ll all the studen@@ t book@@ s .
"W@@ here else would you put them , right ?"
"So we se@@ ll &apos; e@@ m , and then something we@@ ird had been happening with the sto@@ res . The st@@ ore , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the st@@ ore actually made money ."
So it was pa@@ ying the ren@@ t .
"And maybe this is just a S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to ju@@ dge ."
But people would come in — and this was before the p@@ ir@@ ate movi@@ es and everything !
"It was making a lot of money . N@@ ot a lot of money , but it was pa@@ ying the ren@@ t , pa@@ ying a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time sta@@ ff member there ."
There &apos;s the ocean ma@@ ps you can see on the left .
And it became a ga@@ te@@ way to the community .
"@@ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?"
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to s@@ we@@ ar on the we@@ b . ( Laughter ) I@@ s that a ru@@ le ? I don &apos;t know .
"They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it ."
"And then right be@@ yon@@ d — there &apos;s usu@@ ally a little cha@@ in there — right be@@ yon@@ d , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red ."
"This is a field tri@@ p going on . And so they would be sh@@ op@@ ping , and they might be more like@@ ly to bu@@ y some l@@ ard , or mil@@ let for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prote@@ c@@ tor for n@@ igh@@ t@@ time , all of these things we se@@ ll ."
So the st@@ ore actually did really well .
"But it br@@ ought in so many people — teach@@ ers , don@@ ors , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , everybody — because it was stre@@ et level . It was open to the public ."
"It wasn &apos;t a non@@ -@@ pro@@ f@@ it bur@@ i@@ ed , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th flo@@ or of some building do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn . It was right in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od that it was ser@@ ving , and it was open all the time to the public ."
"So , it became this sort of we@@ ird , happy acc@@ ident ."
"So all the people I used to know in B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;"
"And a lot of them had been for@@ mer educ@@ at@@ ors or wou@@ l@@ d-@@ be educ@@ at@@ ors , so they com@@ b@@ ined with a lot of local desig@@ ners , local writ@@ ers , and they just took the idea in@@ depen@@ den@@ tly and they did their own thing ."
They didn &apos;t want to se@@ ll p@@ ir@@ ate supp@@ lies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
"So , kno@@ wing the cr@@ ime@@ -@@ f@@ igh@@ ting community in New York , they open@@ ed the B@@ ro@@ ok@@ l@@ y@@ n S@@ u@@ per@@ her@@ o S@@ u@@ pp@@ ly C@@ om@@ p@@ any ."
This is S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
"And this was to make it look sort of like one of those ke@@ ys@@ mit@@ h &apos;s sh@@ op@@ s that has to have every serv@@ ice they &apos;ve ever o@@ ffe@@ red , you know , all over there ."
"So they open@@ ed this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a C@@ os@@ t@@ c@@ o for super@@ her@@ o@@ es — all the supp@@ lies in kind of bas@@ ic form ."
These are all han@@ d@@ made .
"These are all sort of re@@ pur@@ po@@ sed other produc@@ ts , or whatever ."
All the p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ging is done by S@@ am P@@ ot@@ ts .
"So then you have the vil@@ la@@ in con@@ tain@@ ment un@@ it , where kids put their parents . You have the off@@ ice ."
"This is a little v@@ a@@ ult — you have to put your produ@@ ct in there , it goes up an elec@@ tri@@ c li@@ ft and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter te@@ lls you that you have to rec@@ ite the v@@ ow of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to bu@@ y anything . And it lim@@ its , really , their s@@ al@@ es ."
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem ."
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the produc@@ ts . These are all han@@ d@@ made .
This is a se@@ cre@@ t iden@@ t@@ ity k@@ it .
"If you want to take on the iden@@ t@@ ity of S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one , one American fe@@ ma@@ le marke@@ ting ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive from H@@ ob@@ ok@@ en , New J@@ er@@ se@@ y . It &apos;s a full d@@ os@@ si@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ har@@ on B@@ o@@ one ."
"So , this is the cap@@ er@@ y where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cap@@ e , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ gra@@ ded ste@@ ps and then we turn on three hy@@ dra@@ u@@ li@@ c f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cap@@ e in action ."
"There &apos;s nothing wor@@ se than , you know , getting up there and the cap@@ e is bun@@ ching up or something like that ."
"So then , the se@@ cre@@ t do@@ or — this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly open@@ s ."
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pl@@ ing ho@@ ok@@ s .
It open@@ s and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing cen@@ ter in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effe@@ ct !
"But this is — I just want to em@@ p@@ has@@ ize — loc@@ ally fun@@ ded , loc@@ ally built ."
"A@@ ll the desig@@ ners , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ b@@ ono ."
"I just came and vis@@ ited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ough@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours ."
"It &apos;s very bus@@ y . S@@ ame prin@@ ci@@ ples : on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one atten@@ tion , comple@@ te dev@@ ot@@ ion to the students &apos; work and a b@@ oun@@ d@@ less op@@ tim@@ ism and sort of a possi@@ bility of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and ideas ."
"And this s@@ wit@@ ch is fl@@ ic@@ ked in their he@@ ads when they walk through those 18 fe@@ et of this b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re st@@ ore , right ?"
"So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school ."
"It &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ly not school , even though they &apos;re working shou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ shou@@ l@@ der on ta@@ bl@@ es , pen@@ c@@ il@@ s and pap@@ ers , whatever ."
"This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ dan ."
You can read this quot@@ e .
A@@ d@@ dic@@ ted to video ga@@ m@@ es and T@@ V . C@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted atten@@ tion .
And he couldn &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e it .
"So , so@@ on enough , he was wr@@ iting . He would fin@@ ish his h@@ ome@@ work early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ i@@ shing his h@@ ome@@ work early ."
"It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it che@@ c@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to a@@ chi@@ eve the next thing and be pre@@ par@@ ed for school the next day ."
"So he got ho@@ ok@@ ed on that , and then he started doing other things ."
He &apos;s now been publi@@ shed in five book@@ s .
"He co@@ -@@ wr@@ ote a mo@@ c@@ ku@@ men@@ t@@ ary about fail@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es called &quot; &quot; S@@ u@@ per@@ -@@ H@@ as@@ -@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wr@@ ote a seri@@ es on &quot; &quot; P@@ en@@ gu@@ in B@@ al@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a f@@ igh@@ ting — a bo@@ x@@ ing — pen@@ gu@@ in ."
"And then he read al@@ oud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at S@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ hon@@ y S@@ p@@ ace , at a ben@@ ef@@ it for 8@@ 2@@ 6 New York . So he &apos;s there every day ."
He &apos;s ev@@ an@@ ge@@ l@@ ical about it . He br@@ ings his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
There &apos;s four family mem@@ bers that come in every day .
"So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly ."
"This is L@@ .@@ A@@ . , The E@@ ch@@ o P@@ ar@@ k T@@ ime T@@ ra@@ vel M@@ art : &quot; &quot; W@@ hen@@ ever You A@@ re , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Th@@ en . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven for time tra@@ ve@@ l@@ ers ."
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ E@@ le@@ ven would be .
L@@ ee@@ ches . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of O@@ r@@ der . C@@ ome B@@ ack Y@@ es@@ ter@@ day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) An@@ y@@ way . So I &apos;m going to j@@ um@@ p a@@ head .
"These are sp@@ ac@@ es that are only af@@ fil@@ i@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Wor@@ d S@@ t@@ . in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ field , M@@ as@@ sa@@ chu@@ set@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ po@@ t in C@@ in@@ c@@ in@@ nat@@ i ; Y@@ ou@@ th S@@ pe@@ ak@@ s , S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , which insp@@ i@@ red us ; S@@ tu@@ di@@ o S@@ t@@ .

Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that oka@@ y ?
"A@@ ll right , I &apos;ve got a minu@@ te . So , the TED W@@ ish : I w@@ ish that you — you person@@ ally and every cre@@ ative individu@@ al and organiz@@ ation you know — will find a way to di@@ rec@@ tly enga@@ ge with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got inv@@ olved , so that within a year we have a th@@ ous@@ and exam@@ ples — a th@@ ous@@ and ! — of trans@@ forma@@ tive part@@ ner@@ shi@@ ps ."
P@@ ro@@ found le@@ ap@@ s for@@ ward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
"I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and insp@@ ire others on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
We created a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite .
"I &apos;m going to s@@ wit@@ ch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the atten@@ de@@ es of this con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce will u@@ sh@@ er in a new era of partic@@ ip@@ ation in our public s@@ cho@@ ols ."
We hope that you will take the le@@ ad in part@@ ner@@ ing your innov@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it and exper@@ t@@ ise with that of innov@@ ative educ@@ at@@ ors in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teach@@ ers le@@ ad the way .
They will tell you how to be u@@ se@@ ful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and con@@ su@@ lt with the teach@@ ers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
"So , this is with H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o in S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , they did this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job ."
"This we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is already up , it &apos;s already got a bun@@ ch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce U@@ p@@ on a S@@ ch@@ ool , &quot; &quot; which is a great t@@ it@@ le , I think ."
"This s@@ ite will doc@@ um@@ ent every story , every project that comes out of this con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce and around the world . So you go to the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , you see a bun@@ ch of ideas you can be insp@@ i@@ red by and then you ad@@ d your own pro@@ jects once you get started ."
"H@@ ot S@@ tu@@ di@@ o did a great job in a very t@@ ight de@@ ad@@ line . So , vis@@ it the s@@ ite ."
"If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our di@@ rec@@ tor of national pro@@ gr@@ ams . He &apos;ll be on the phone ."
"You e@@ ma@@ il him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possi@@ bly want ."
And he &apos;ll get you insp@@ i@@ red and get you going and gu@@ ide you through the process so that you can a@@ ffe@@ ct change .
And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be ste@@ ri@@ le . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ at@@ ically un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the s@@ kill@@ s that you have .
The s@@ cho@@ ols need you . The teach@@ ers need you .
"S@@ tu@@ den@@ ts and parents need you . They need your ac@@ tual person : your physical person@@ ho@@ od and your open min@@ ds and open e@@ ars and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less comp@@ as@@ sion , sitting next to them , lis@@ ten@@ ing and no@@ d@@ ding and as@@ king questions for hours at a time ."
S@@ ome of these kids just don &apos;t pla@@ in know how good they are : how smar@@ t and how much they have to say .
"You can tell them . You can shin@@ e that light on them , one human inter@@ action at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll jo@@ in us ."
Thank you so much .
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; th@@ ank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was sil@@ ent for 1@@ 7 years .
"And the first words that I sp@@ oke were in W@@ a@@ shin@@ g@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , on the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ a@@ y ."
And my family and friends had ga@@ the@@ red there to hear me speak .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the au@@ dience , she j@@ um@@ p@@ ed up , &quot; H@@ al@@ le@@ lu@@ j@@ ah , J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y ’ s talking ! &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I@@ ma@@ gine if you were qu@@ i@@ et for 1@@ 7 years and your mother was out in the au@@ dience , say ."
"My da@@ d said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll expla@@ in that ."
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recogni@@ ze where my vo@@ ice was coming from .
"I ha@@ dn ’ t heard my vo@@ ice in 1@@ 7 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;"
"And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of la@@ ugh@@ ed ."
"And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this jour@@ ney ."
"And the jour@@ ney , I believe , is a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or for all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys ."
"E@@ ven though this one is kind of un@@ usu@@ al , I want you to think about your own jour@@ ney ."
"My jour@@ ney began in 19@@ 7@@ 1 when I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed two oil tan@@ kers col@@ li@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath the G@@ ol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million g@@ all@@ ons of oil sp@@ ill@@ ed into the ba@@ y ."
It dis@@ tur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
That ’ s a big thing in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"And it was a big thing in my little community of P@@ o@@ int R@@ eyes S@@ tation in In@@ ver@@ ness , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , because there were only about 3@@ 50 people there in the win@@ ter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now ."
"And so when I came in and I started wal@@ king around , people — they just knew what was going on ."
"And people would dri@@ ve up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m wal@@ king for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re wal@@ king to make us look bad , right ?"
"You ’ re wal@@ king to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some tru@@ th to that , because I thought that if I started wal@@ king , everyone would fol@@ low ."
"Because of the oil , everybody tal@@ ked about the pol@@ ll@@ u@@ tion ."
"And so I ar@@ gu@@ ed with people about that , I ar@@ gu@@ ed and I ar@@ gu@@ ed ."
I called my parents up .
"I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving in c@@ ars . &quot; &quot; My da@@ d said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then ."
They ’ re back in Ph@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
"And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; M@@ others are like that ."
"And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day I decided , because I ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop spe@@ aking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest ."
And so I did .
I got up in the mor@@ ning and I didn ’ t say a word .
"And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began lis@@ ten@@ ing — in a long time ."
"And what I heard , it kind of dis@@ tur@@ bed me ."
"Because what I used to do , when I thought I was lis@@ ten@@ ing , was I would lis@@ ten just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I sto@@ pped lis@@ ten@@ ing ."
"And in my mind , I just kind of r@@ ac@@ ed a@@ head and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ i@@ shing up ."
And then I would la@@ un@@ ch in .
"Well , that just en@@ ded communic@@ ation ."
So on this first day I actually lis@@ ten@@ ed .
"And it was very sa@@ d for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning ."
I was 2@@ 7 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
"And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I pr@@ om@@ i@@ sed myself for a year I would keep qu@@ i@@ et because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more ."
"So for a year I said I would keep qu@@ i@@ et , and then on my bir@@ th@@ day I would reas@@ se@@ ss what I had learned and maybe I would talk again ."
"Well , that l@@ as@@ ted 1@@ 7 years ."
"Now during that time — those 1@@ 7 years — I wal@@ ked and I pla@@ yed the ban@@ jo and I pain@@ ted and I wr@@ ote in my jour@@ nal , and I tried to study the environment by read@@ ing book@@ s ."
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
"I wal@@ ked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were of@@ fer@@ ing an environ@@ mental stu@@ dies de@@ gre@@ e ."
It ’ s only 500 mil@@ es .
"And I went into the Re@@ g@@ is@@ tra@@ r ’ s off@@ ice and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;"
I had a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er c@@ li@@ pp@@ ing .
"&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?"
You don ’ t … ?
We have a speci@@ al pro@@ gram for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
"And in those two years , I gra@@ du@@ ated with my first de@@ gre@@ e — a ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ."
"And my father came out , he was so pr@@ oud ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ ten , we ’ re really pr@@ oud of you son , but what are you going to do with a ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ?"
"You don ’ t ri@@ de in c@@ ars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my shou@@ l@@ der , I pic@@ ked my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack up again and I started wal@@ king ."
"I wal@@ ked all the way up to P@@ ort T@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ se@@ nd , W@@ a@@ shin@@ g@@ ton , where I built a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ at , ro@@ de it across P@@ u@@ get S@@ ound and wal@@ ked across W@@ a@@ shin@@ g@@ ton &#91; to &#93; I@@ da@@ ho and down to M@@ is@@ sou@@ l@@ a , M@@ on@@ tan@@ a ."
I had writ@@ ten the U@@ ni@@ versity of M@@ on@@ tan@@ a two years ear@@ li@@ er and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I sho@@ wed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really hel@@ p@@ ed me .
There are two stories in M@@ on@@ tan@@ a .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sig@@ n I used a lot .
"And they said , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that . &quot; &quot; The di@@ rec@@ tor of the pro@@ gram said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome back tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; He gave me 1@@ 50 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ g@@ is@@ ter for one cre@@ d@@ it ."
"You ’ re going to go to S@@ ou@@ th America , ar@@ en ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — R@@ i@@ ver@@ s and l@@ ak@@ es , the hy@@ dro@@ logical systems , S@@ ou@@ th America ."
So I did that .
"He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK J@@ o@@ h@@ n , now that you &apos;ve reg@@ is@@ te@@ red for that one cre@@ d@@ it , you can have a key to an off@@ ice , you can ma@@ tr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ate — you ’ re ma@@ tr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ating , so you can use the li@@ br@@ ary ."
"And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the pro@@ fe@@ s@@ sor@@ s al@@ low you to go to clas@@ s ."
"They ’ re going to sa@@ ve your gra@@ de , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can reg@@ is@@ ter for that clas@@ s and they ’ ll give you the gra@@ de . &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , they don ’ t do that in gra@@ du@@ ate s@@ cho@@ ols , I don ’ t think ."
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
"They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way ."
"And during that time , I actually ta@@ ught clas@@ ses without spe@@ aking ."
I had 1@@ 3 students when I first wal@@ ked into the clas@@ s .
"I expla@@ ined , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sig@@ n language , that I was J@@ o@@ h@@ n F@@ ran@@ c@@ is , I was wal@@ king around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me ."
All the students s@@ at around and they went ...
"( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out ."
They had to take that clas@@ s with me .
"T@@ wo weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our clas@@ s ."
And I learned in that clas@@ s — because I would do things like this ...
"@@ and they were all ga@@ the@@ red around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cu@@ tting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cu@@ tting . &quot;"
"&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cu@@ tting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a han@@ d@@ saw . &quot;"
"&quot; Well , you can ’ t c@@ lear@@ c@@ ut with a ... &quot;"
"&quot; Yes , you can clear c@@ ut ... &quot;"
"&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about se@@ lec@@ tive fore@@ str@@ y . &quot;"
Now this was a dis@@ cus@@ sion clas@@ s and we were having a dis@@ cus@@ sion .
"I just bac@@ ked out of that , you know , and I just kind of ke@@ pt the f@@ ists from fl@@ ying ."
"But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sig@@ n and they said things that I absolu@@ tely did not mean , but I should have ."
"And so what came to me is , if you were a teach@@ er and you were teach@@ ing , if you we@@ ren ’ t learning you probably we@@ ren ’ t teach@@ ing very well ."
And so I went on .
"My da@@ d came out to see me gra@@ du@@ ate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really pr@@ oud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and dri@@ ving and start talking ."
"What are you going to do with a mas@@ ter ’ s de@@ gre@@ e ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my shou@@ l@@ der , I got my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack and I went on to the U@@ ni@@ versity of W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in ."
I spent two years there wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
No one was interested in oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
But something happened — E@@ x@@ x@@ on V@@ al@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the United States wr@@ iting on oil sp@@ ill@@ s .
My da@@ d came out again .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ri@@ de in c@@ ars , you don ’ t talk ."
"My sis@@ ter said maybe I should leave you alone , because you see@@ m to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my bac@@ k@@ p@@ ack again ."
"I put my ban@@ jo on and I wal@@ ked all the way to the E@@ ast C@@ o@@ ast , put my foo@@ t in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States ."
"And on Earth D@@ a@@ y , 199@@ 0 — the 20@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth D@@ a@@ y — that ’ s when I began to speak ."
"And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that t@@ ree in the fore@@ st f@@ all@@ ing ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?"
"And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me speak ."
And that ’ s communic@@ ation .
And they also ta@@ ught me about lis@@ ten@@ ing — that they lis@@ ten@@ ed to me .
"And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the lis@@ ten@@ ing to each other ."
"@@ Re@@ ally , very important — we need to lis@@ ten to each other ."
"Well , my jour@@ ney ke@@ pt going on ."
"My da@@ d said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go ."
"I worked for the C@@ o@@ a@@ st@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.@@ N@@ . Goo@@ d@@ will A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"I wr@@ ote reg@@ ul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wr@@ ote oil sp@@ ill reg@@ ul@@ ations ."
"@@ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; You just start wal@@ king e@@ ast ; get out of your car and just start wal@@ king e@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And as I wal@@ ked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shu@@ t up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bu@@ d@@ dy . &quot;"
"@@ How could that be , how could that be ?"
How could doing such a simple thing like wal@@ king and not talking make a difference ?
"Well , my time at the C@@ o@@ ast G@@ u@@ ard was a really good time ."
"And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at and I sa@@ il@@ ed down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and wal@@ ked through all of the is@@ lan@@ ds , and to V@@ en@@ e@@ zu@@ el@@ a ."
"And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you ."
I started talking because I had stu@@ died environment .
"I ’ d stu@@ died environment at this forma@@ l level , but there was this in@@ forma@@ l level ."
"And the in@@ forma@@ l level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are ."
And environment changed from just being about tre@@ es and bir@@ ds and en@@ dan@@ ge@@ red species to being about how we tre@@ ated each other .
"Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we tre@@ at ourselves and how we tre@@ at each other ."
And so that ’ s the mes@@ sage that I had .
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spre@@ ad that mes@@ sage . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , sa@@ il@@ ed all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ bo@@ at , I kind of worked on that bo@@ at — got to V@@ en@@ e@@ zu@@ el@@ a and I started wal@@ king ."
"This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ri@@ de in mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les ."
"I was wal@@ king through E@@ l D@@ ora@@ do — it &apos;s a pris@@ on to@@ wn , fam@@ ous pris@@ on , or in@@ fam@@ ous pris@@ on — in V@@ en@@ e@@ zu@@ el@@ a , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ ses@@ sed me , because this was not like me ."
"There I am , wal@@ king past the gu@@ ard g@@ ate and the gu@@ ard sto@@ ps and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ ap@@ or@@ te , pas@@ ap@@ or@@ te , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 poin@@ ted at me ."
"And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ sp@@ ort , hu@@ h ?"
I don &apos;t need to show you my pas@@ sp@@ ort . It ’ s in the back of my p@@ ack .
I &apos;m D@@ r@@ . F@@ ran@@ c@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and I &apos;m wal@@ king around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started wal@@ king off .
What pos@@ ses@@ sed me to say this thing ?
The ro@@ ad turned into the jun@@ gle .
I didn ’ t get sho@@ t .
"And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — th@@ ank God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?"
"It took me 100 mil@@ es to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pris@@ on@@ er ."
I was a pris@@ on@@ er and I needed to es@@ cap@@ e .
The pris@@ on that I was in was the fact that I did not dri@@ ve or use mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
Now how could that be ?
"Because when I started , it seem@@ ed very appro@@ pri@@ ate to me not to use mot@@ or@@ ized ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les ."
"But the thing that was different was that every bir@@ th@@ day , I asked myself about sil@@ ence , but I never asked myself about my decis@@ ion to just use my fe@@ et ."
I had no idea I was going to become a U.@@ N@@ . A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ .
"And so I realized that I had a respon@@ si@@ bility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change ."
"You know , we can do it ."
I was going to have to change .
"And I was af@@ ra@@ id to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just wal@@ ked ."
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
"I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today ."
"And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve got@@ ten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go ."
"And we kind of have to leave behind the se@@ cur@@ ity of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are be@@ coming ."
"And so , I want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any pris@@ on that you might find yourself in , as com@@ for@@ table as it may be , because we have to do something now ."
We have to change now .
"As our for@@ mer V@@ ice P@@ res@@ ident said , we have to become activ@@ ists ."
"So if my vo@@ ice can tou@@ ch you , if my ac@@ tions can tou@@ ch you , if my being here can tou@@ ch you , p@@ lease let it be ."
And I know that all of you have tou@@ ched me while I ’ ve been here .
"So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this car@@ ing , this love , this re@@ spe@@ ct that we ’ ve sho@@ wn each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world ."
"Because we are the environment , and how we tre@@ at each other is really how we ’ re going to tre@@ at the environment ."
So I want to th@@ ank you for being here and I want to end this in five secon@@ ds of sil@@ ence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the la@@ test ep@@ is@@ ode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — lon@@ gest run@@ ning so@@ a@@ p op@@ era , which is cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t ."
"And may it run fore@@ ver , because it gi@@ ves people like me a living ."
"It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a norma@@ l so@@ a@@ p op@@ era to want : It &apos;s got love , jo@@ y , happ@@ iness , sa@@ d@@ ness , te@@ ars , la@@ ughter , lots of de@@ ce@@ it , in@@ tr@@ ig@@ ue ."
"And like all good so@@ ap@@ s , it j@@ um@@ ps 20 years when the au@@ dience intere@@ st changes ."
And that &apos;s exactly what cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t has done .
It &apos;s j@@ um@@ p@@ ed 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over game .
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change lea@@ ds to a very big re@@ v@@ olution ."
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
C@@ r@@ ic@@ ke@@ t wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ dri@@ ven gener@@ ations game .
"There was a time when you pla@@ yed cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , you pla@@ yed t@@ ime@@ less test mat@@ ches , when you pla@@ yed on t@@ ill the game got over ."
And there was this game in M@@ ar@@ ch 19@@ 3@@ 9 that started on the third of M@@ ar@@ ch and en@@ ded on the 1@@ 4@@ th of M@@ ar@@ ch .
"So , the mat@@ ch was en@@ ded in between ."
"And one of the En@@ gl@@ ish bat@@ s@@ men said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
But there is a reason why India fe@@ ll in love with cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t : because we had about the same p@@ ace of life .
"( Laughter ) The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?"
"You f@@ ought by day , then it was su@@ n@@ set , so everyone went back home ."
"And then you worked out your stra@@ te@@ gy , and you came and f@@ ought the next day , and you went back home again ."
"The only difference between the Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ ata and our cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t was that in cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , everybody was al@@ ive to come back and f@@ ight the next day ."
"P@@ rin@@ ces pat@@ ron@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of in@@ gr@@ ati@@ ating themselves to the B@@ rit@@ ish ru@@ l@@ ers ."
"But there is one other reason why India fe@@ ll in love with cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , which was , all you needed was a pl@@ ank of wo@@ od and a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ all , and any number of people could play it any@@ where ."
"O@@ r you could play many ga@@ m@@ es in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ s you can see , you can play any@@ where ."
"But s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly the game mo@@ ved on , you know , finally ."
"In In@@ di@@ an sp@@ ort we don &apos;t make things happen , acc@@ iden@@ ts happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes ."
And we won this Wor@@ ld C@@ up in 198@@ 3 .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we fe@@ ll in love with the 5@@ 0@@ -@@ over game , and we pla@@ yed it v@@ ir@@ tually every day ."
There was more 5@@ 0@@ -@@ over cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t than any@@ where .
But there was another big date .
198@@ 3 was when we won the Wor@@ ld C@@ up .
"@@ 199@@ 1 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a fin@@ ance min@@ is@@ ter and a pr@@ ime min@@ is@@ ter w@@ ill@@ ing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of in@@ tr@@ ig@@ ue and m@@ ys@@ ter@@ y in this clo@@ sed country ."
"We c@@ ut cus@@ tom@@ s du@@ ties , we re@@ duc@@ ed impor@@ t du@@ ties , and we got all the mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als coming in , with mul@@ tin@@ ational bu@@ d@@ gets , who looked at per@@ -@@ cap@@ ita in@@ come and got very exc@@ ited about the possi@@ bil@@ ities in India , and were looking for a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le to re@@ ach every In@@ di@@ an ."
"And there are only two ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les in India — one real , one scri@@ p@@ ted ."
"The scri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the movi@@ es , the real one was cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t ."
"And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ wa@@ l from Pe@@ p@@ s@@ i , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world ."
"And Pe@@ p@@ s@@ i was this big re@@ v@@ olution , because they started taking cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t all over ."
And so cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t started be@@ coming big ; cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t started br@@ ing@@ ing ri@@ ches in .
"The next r@@ ights are so@@ ld for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a cur@@ ve , that ."
And then another big acc@@ ident happened in our cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t .
"E@@ n@@ g@@ land inven@@ ted 20 over@@ s cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 over@@ s cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t . &quot; &quot; Just as En@@ g@@ land inven@@ ted cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , and made the rest of the world play it ."
Thank God for them .
"( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T@@ 20 Wor@@ ld C@@ up , you see ."
India didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 Wor@@ ld C@@ up .
But we were for@@ ced to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ gin .
And then something very dra@@ ma@@ tic happened .
"We got to the fin@@ al , and then this moment , that will re@@ ma@@ in en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed fore@@ ver , for everybody , take a look ."
( C@@ ro@@ w@@ d che@@ er@@ ing ) The P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ i bat@@ s@@ man trying to clear the fi@@ el@@ der .
An@@ n@@ oun@@ cer : And Z@@ i@@ sh@@ an takes it ! India w@@ ins !
What a mat@@ ch for a T@@ w@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 fin@@ al .
"I@@ n@@ dia , the world ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
"( C@@ he@@ er@@ ing ) India , T@@ 20 ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
"A mas@@ sive , mas@@ sive suc@@ cess : India , the world T@@ T ch@@ am@@ pi@@ ons ."
H@@ ar@@ sha B@@ ho@@ gle : S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly India disco@@ vered this power of 20@@ -@@ over@@ s cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t .
"The acc@@ ident , of course , there , was that the bat@@ s@@ man thought the bo@@ w@@ ler was bo@@ w@@ ling f@@ ast ."
"( Laughter ) If he had bo@@ w@@ led f@@ ast , the b@@ all would have gone where it was me@@ ant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disco@@ vered that we could be good at this game ."
And what it also did was it led to a certain pri@@ de in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
"It was at a time when inve@@ st@@ ment was coming in , India was feel@@ ing a little more con@@ f@@ ident about itself ."
And so there was a feel@@ ing that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
"And th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for all of us , the En@@ gl@@ ish are very good at inven@@ ting things , and then the gr@@ ac@@ ious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it ."
"( Laughter ) And so En@@ g@@ land inven@@ ted T@@ 20 cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , and allo@@ wed India to hi@@ j@@ ack it ."
"It was not like re@@ engine@@ er@@ ing that we do in me@@ dic@@ ine , we just took it stra@@ ight away , as is ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks , city ver@@ su@@ s city ."
"It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supp@@ or@@ ted our country — the only two areas in which India was very pr@@ oud about their country , re@@ presen@@ ting itself on the field ."
"One was war , the In@@ di@@ an ar@@ my , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often ."
The other was In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t .
"Now , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we had to supp@@ ort city lea@@ gu@@ es ."
But the people getting into these city lea@@ gu@@ es were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the W@@ est .
"A@@ mer@@ ica is a home of lea@@ gu@@ es . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some g@@ lit@@ z@@ y lea@@ gu@@ es here in India . &quot;"
But was India ready for it ?
"Because cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , for a long time in India was always organiz@@ ed ."
"It was never pr@@ omo@@ ted , it was never so@@ ld — it was organiz@@ ed ."
"And look what they did with our beautiful , n@@ ice , simple family game ."
"A@@ ll of a su@@ d@@ den , you had that happening ."
( Mus@@ ic ) A@@ n open@@ ing ce@@ re@@ mon@@ y to mat@@ ch every other .
This was an India that was bu@@ ying C@@ or@@ ve@@ t@@ tes . This was an India that was bu@@ ying J@@ a@@ gu@@ ar .
This was an India that was ad@@ ding more mo@@ bi@@ le p@@ hon@@ es per mon@@ th than New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and &apos;s population t@@ w@@ ice over .
"So , it was a different India ."
"But it was also a sl@@ igh@@ tly more or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x India that was very happy to be mo@@ der@@ n , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people ."
"And so , they were ag@@ ha@@ st when the che@@ er@@ lea@@ ders ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"E@@ very@@ one se@@ cre@@ tly wat@@ ched them , but everyone c@@ la@@ im@@ ed not to ."
( Mus@@ ic ) ( Laughter ) The new o@@ w@@ ners of In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t were not the old prin@@ ces .
"And so they started pr@@ omot@@ ing cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t big time , started pr@@ omot@@ ing clu@@ b@@ s big time ."
And they &apos;ve started pr@@ omot@@ ing them with huge money behind it .
"So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not M@@ an@@ ch@@ es@@ ter United st@@ y@@ le pr@@ omot@@ ion , but very M@@ um@@ bai st@@ y@@ le pr@@ omot@@ ion . T@@ ake a look ."
"Now , all of the su@@ d@@ den , if you were to bo@@ w@@ l a sho@@ t — if M@@ um@@ bai were to bo@@ w@@ l a sho@@ t , for example , they nee@@ dn &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ ba@@ dev@@ i or S@@ hi@@ v@@ a@@ ji P@@ ar@@ k or some@@ where to source them , they could go to T@@ rin@@ i@@ da@@ d ."
"This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from any@@ where as long as you get the best produ@@ ct at the best pr@@ ice ."

( Laughter ) N@@ ever would India have thought on this scale before .
"We have ar@@ ri@@ ved some@@ where . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ r@@ ying the two most important things in In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t , which is cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t and the movi@@ es in In@@ di@@ an en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment ."
There is cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t and the movi@@ es .
And they came together because people in the movi@@ es now started o@@ w@@ ning clu@@ b@@ s .
"And so , people started going to the cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t to wat@@ ch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta ."
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting son@@ g and dan@@ ce in In@@ di@@ an cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t .
And so it started re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ing the In@@ di@@ an movi@@ es more and more .
"And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team — as you will see on the c@@ li@@ p that follo@@ ws — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta ."
So that was the ul@@ t@@ imate reason to do well . T@@ ake a look — everyone &apos;s wat@@ ching P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta .
"We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ches in K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : S@@ ha@@ h R@@ uk@@ h , with the B@@ en@@ g@@ al@@ i son@@ g , getting the au@@ di@@ ences all worked up for K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a — not for India , but for K@@ ol@@ kat@@ a ."
But take a look at this .
C@@ an you imagine ?
And do you know what the P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ i cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ter said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I w@@ ish I was pla@@ ying for P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ in@@ ta &apos;s team . &quot;
"I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?"
"We can play cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t together , we can be friends ."
"So th@@ ank you very much for coming , all of you from P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan ."
"( Applause ) There was cr@@ it@@ ic@@ ism too because they said , &quot; &quot; P@@ la@@ y@@ ers are being b@@ ought and so@@ ld ?"
A@@ re they gra@@ in ?
"A@@ re they c@@ at@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this au@@ ction , you see ."
How do you fi@@ x a pr@@ ice for a pla@@ y@@ er ?
"And so the au@@ ction that follo@@ wed liter@@ ally had people saying , &quot; B@@ an@@ g ! so many million dollars for so@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ so pla@@ y@@ er . &quot;"
There it is .
"( Mus@@ ic ) A@@ u@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ er : G@@ o@@ ing at 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars . C@@ hen@@ nai ."
"S@@ han@@ e W@@ ar@@ ne so@@ ld for 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars ."
"H@@ B : S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly , a game which ear@@ ned its pla@@ y@@ ers 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 2@@ 50 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test mat@@ ch , but if you fin@@ ish in four days you only got 200 ."
"The best In@@ di@@ an pla@@ y@@ ers who pla@@ yed every test mat@@ ch — every one of the inter@@ n@@ ation@@ als , the top of the line pla@@ y@@ ers — stan@@ dar@@ d con@@ trac@@ ts are 2@@ 20@@ ,000 dollars in a whole year ."
"Now they were getting 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 for six days &apos; work ."
"Th@@ en An@@ dre@@ w F@@ lin@@ to@@ ff came by from En@@ g@@ land , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or four weeks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than F@@ ran@@ k L@@ am@@ par@@ d and S@@ te@@ ven G@@ er@@ r@@ ard , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all@@ ers , wo@@ w . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ?

C@@ ou@@ ld you have ima@@ gin@@ ed that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
"That &apos;s not bad , is it ?"
"So , at 2@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars before the first b@@ all was bo@@ w@@ led ."
"What India was doing , though , was ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge br@@ and ."
L@@ al@@ it M@@ od@@ i was on the co@@ ver of B@@ us@@ iness T@@ o@@ day .
"I@@ P@@ L became the big@@ gest br@@ and in India and , because our elec@@ tions , had to be mo@@ ved to S@@ ou@@ th Africa , and we had to start the tou@@ r@@ nam@@ ent in three weeks ."
M@@ o@@ ve a whole tou@@ r@@ nam@@ ent to S@@ ou@@ th Africa in three weeks .
But we did it . You know why ?
"Because no country works as s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly as we do t@@ ill three weeks before an ev@@ ent , and no@@ body works f@@ ast as we do in the last three weeks ."
"We &apos;d also made cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t the only sp@@ ort in India , which is a p@@ ity , but in India every other sp@@ ort pu@@ sh@@ es cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ t to become big , which is a bit of a tra@@ ge@@ dy of our times ."
"Now , this last minu@@ te before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effe@@ cts of all this ."
"And , all of a su@@ d@@ den , India was this land of opportunity ."
"C@@ r@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;"
"And that felt good , you know ?"
"We said , &quot; &quot; The doll@@ ar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; C@@ an you imagine , you &apos;ve got the doll@@ ar on view and there &apos;s no D@@ el@@ hi be@@ lly in there any@@ more ."

"You can &apos;t take a t@@ ime@@ less test to China and s@@ it through 14 days with no resu@@ lt in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world ."

W@@ ho b@@ om@@ bed your house ?

How are you c@@ op@@ ing in your life in ex@@ ile ?
"But there &apos;s one question that always seem@@ s to me to be most re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing , and that is : What did you take ?"
"What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the b@@ om@@ b@@ s were ex@@ plo@@ ding in your to@@ wn , and the ar@@ med gan@@ gs were appro@@ ach@@ ing your house ?"
A S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e bo@@ y I know told me that he didn &apos;t he@@ sit@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent dan@@ ger .
"He took his high school di@@ pl@@ oma , and later he told me why ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school di@@ pl@@ oma because my life depen@@ ded on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that di@@ pl@@ oma ."
"O@@ n his way to school , he would do@@ dge s@@ ni@@ per@@ s ."
"H@@ is clas@@ s@@ room sometimes sh@@ ook with the sound of b@@ om@@ b@@ s and sh@@ e@@ lling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; E@@ very day , I would say to him every mor@@ ning , &apos; H@@ on@@ ey , p@@ lease don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he in@@ sis@@ ted , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;"
"But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all af@@ ra@@ id , but our de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to gra@@ du@@ ate is str@@ on@@ ger than our fe@@ ar . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got ter@@ ri@@ ble news ."
"H@@ any &apos;s a@@ un@@ t , his un@@ cle and his cou@@ s@@ in were mur@@ de@@ red in their h@@ om@@ es for re@@ f@@ using to leave their house ."
Th@@ e@@ ir th@@ ro@@ ats were sl@@ it .
It was time to f@@ le@@ e .
"They left that day , right away , in their car , H@@ any hid@@ den in the back because they were fac@@ ing che@@ c@@ k@@ poin@@ ts of men@@ ac@@ ing sol@@ di@@ ers ."
"And they would cr@@ oss the bor@@ der into Le@@ ban@@ on , where they would find pe@@ ace ."
But they would be@@ gin a life of g@@ ru@@ el@@ ing har@@ d@@ ship and mon@@ oton@@ y .
"They had no cho@@ ice but to build a sh@@ ack on the side of a mu@@ d@@ dy field , and this is H@@ any &apos;s bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f , who pla@@ ys outside ."
"And that day , they jo@@ ined the big@@ gest population of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in the world , in a country , Le@@ ban@@ on , that is tin@@ y ."
"It only has four million c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , and there are one million S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es living there ."
"There &apos;s not a to@@ wn , a city or a vil@@ la@@ ge that is not h@@ ost to S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ."
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and hum@@ an@@ ity that is re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble .
"Th@@ in@@ k about it this way , pro@@ por@@ ti@@ ona@@ tely ."
"It would be as if the entire population of G@@ er@@ many , 80 million people , would f@@ le@@ e to the United States in just three years ."
"H@@ al@@ f of the entire population of S@@ y@@ ri@@ a is now u@@ pro@@ o@@ ted , most of them inside the country ."
S@@ i@@ x and a half million people have fl@@ ed for their lives .
"O@@ ver and well over three million people have cr@@ os@@ sed the bor@@ ders and have found san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing countries , and only a small pro@@ por@@ tion , as you see , have mo@@ ved on to Eur@@ ope ."
What I find most wor@@ r@@ ying is that half of all S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had ar@@ ri@@ ved after a long tre@@ k from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a into J@@ or@@ dan .
And most tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing of all is that only 20 percent of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children are in school in Le@@ ban@@ on .
"And yet , S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , all re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives ."
Why ? Because it allo@@ ws them to think of their future rather than the n@@ igh@@ t@@ m@@ are of their past .
It allo@@ ws them to think of hope rather than hat@@ red .
"I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of a re@@ cent vis@@ it I took to a S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p in nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ ra@@ q , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; C@@ an I take your picture ? &quot;"
"And she said y@@ es , but she re@@ fu@@ sed to s@@ mi@@ le ."
"I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realiz@@ e that she re@@ presen@@ ts a lost gener@@ ation of S@@ y@@ ri@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children , a gener@@ ation is@@ ol@@ ated and fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted ."
"And yet , look at what they fl@@ ed : ut@@ ter de@@ stru@@ ction , buil@@ d@@ ings , indus@@ tries , s@@ cho@@ ols , ro@@ ads , h@@ om@@ es ."
H@@ any &apos;s home was also de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed .
"This will need to be re@@ built by arch@@ ite@@ cts , by engine@@ ers , by electr@@ ic@@ ians ."
C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ities will need teach@@ ers and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and polit@@ ic@@ ians interested in re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation and not re@@ ven@@ ge .
"S@@ hou@@ ldn &apos;t this be re@@ built by the people with the lar@@ gest st@@ ake , the soci@@ e@@ ties in ex@@ ile , the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ?"
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to pre@@ p@@ are for their re@@ turn .
You might imagine that being a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e is just a tem@@ por@@ ary state .
Well far from it .
"W@@ it@@ h war@@ s going on and on , the a@@ verage time a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e will spend in ex@@ ile is 1@@ 7 years ."
"H@@ any was into his second year in lim@@ bo when I went to vis@@ it him rec@@ ently , and we con@@ duc@@ ted our entire con@@ vers@@ ation in En@@ gl@@ ish , which he con@@ fe@@ s@@ sed to me he learned from read@@ ing all of D@@ an B@@ ro@@ wn &apos;s no@@ ve@@ ls and from lis@@ ten@@ ing to American ra@@ p ."
We also spent some n@@ ice mom@@ ents of la@@ ughter and fun with his be@@ lo@@ ved bro@@ ther A@@ sh@@ ra@@ f .
But I &apos;ll never for@@ get what he told me when we en@@ ded our con@@ vers@@ ation that day .
"He said to me , &quot; If I am not a studen@@ t , I am nothing . &quot;"
H@@ any is one of 50 million people u@@ pro@@ o@@ ted in this world today .
N@@ ever since Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I have so many people been for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed .
"So while we &apos;re making s@@ wee@@ ping pro@@ gre@@ ss in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing dan@@ ger@@ ously little to help the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s and we are doing far too little to stop and pre@@ v@@ ent the war@@ s that are dri@@ ving them from their h@@ om@@ es ."
And there are more and more v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s .
"E@@ very day , on a@@ verage , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ plac@@ ed from their h@@ om@@ es — 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people ."
They f@@ le@@ e across bor@@ ders like this one .
"We cap@@ tu@@ red this on the S@@ y@@ ri@@ an bor@@ der to J@@ or@@ dan , and this is a typ@@ ical day ."
"O@@ r they f@@ le@@ e on un@@ se@@ a@@ wor@@ thy and over@@ c@@ ro@@ w@@ ded bo@@ ats , ris@@ king their lives in this case just to re@@ ach sa@@ fe@@ ty in Eur@@ ope ."
"This S@@ y@@ ri@@ an young man survi@@ ved one of these bo@@ ats that cap@@ s@@ ized — most of the people dro@@ w@@ ned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans are just looking for a qu@@ i@@ et place where no@@ body h@@ ur@@ ts you , where no@@ body hum@@ il@@ i@@ ates you , and where no@@ body kill@@ s you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the min@@ im@@ um ."
"@@ How about a place of heal@@ ing , of learning , and even opportunity ?"
"A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans and Eur@@ ope@@ ans have the im@@ pres@@ sion that pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ally huge num@@ bers of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are coming to their country , but the reality is that 8@@ 6 percent , the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , are living in the develop@@ ing world , in countries stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with their own in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity , with their own issu@@ es of hel@@ ping their own pop@@ ul@@ ations and po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So we@@ al@@ thy countries in the world should recogni@@ ze the hum@@ an@@ ity and the gener@@ os@@ ity of the countries that are hos@@ ting so many re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
And all countries should make sure that no one f@@ le@@ e@@ ing war and per@@ se@@ cu@@ tion ar@@ ri@@ ves at a clo@@ sed bor@@ der .
( Applause ) Thank you .
But there is something more that we can do than just simply hel@@ ping re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es survi@@ ve .
We can help them th@@ ri@@ ve .
We should think of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps and commun@@ ities as more than just tem@@ por@@ ary population cen@@ ters where people langu@@ ish wa@@ iting for the war to end .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , as cen@@ ters of ex@@ ce@@ ll@@ ence , where re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es can tri@@ um@@ p@@ h over their tra@@ uma and tra@@ in for the day that they can go home as a@@ gen@@ ts of pos@@ itive change and social trans@@ formation ."
"It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of the ter@@ ri@@ ble war in S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a that has been ra@@ ging on for 2@@ 2 years ."
And imagine living in this cam@@ p .
I vis@@ ited this cam@@ p .
"It &apos;s in D@@ ji@@ bou@@ t@@ i , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a , and it was so re@@ mot@@ e that we had to take a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to f@@ ly there ."
It was d@@ us@@ ty and it was ter@@ ri@@ bly ho@@ t .
"And we went to vis@@ it a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own da@@ ughter , and I went up and tal@@ ked to her ."
"And I asked her the questions that grow@@ n@@ -@@ u@@ ps ask kids , like , &quot; &quot; What is your fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite sub@@ ject ? &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; And this is when her face turned bl@@ ank , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I have no future ."
"My s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing days are over . &quot; &quot; And I thought , there must be some mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ standing , so I turned to my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e and she con@@ fir@@ med to me there is no fun@@ ding for secon@@ dar@@ y education in this cam@@ p ."
"And how I wi@@ shed at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;"
"And I also thought , what a was@@ te ."
She should be and she is the future of S@@ o@@ ma@@ li@@ a .
"A bo@@ y nam@@ ed J@@ ac@@ o@@ b A@@ te@@ m had a different chan@@ ce , but not before he experi@@ en@@ ced ter@@ ri@@ bly tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"He wat@@ ched — this is in S@@ u@@ dan — as his vil@@ la@@ ge — he was only seven years old — bur@@ ned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were kill@@ ed that day ."
"O@@ n@@ ly his cou@@ s@@ in survi@@ ved , and the two of them wal@@ ked for seven months — this is bo@@ ys like him — cha@@ sed and pur@@ su@@ ed by w@@ il@@ d animals and ar@@ med gan@@ gs , and they finally made it to re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps where they found sa@@ fe@@ ty , and he would spend the next seven years in K@@ en@@ ya in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p ."
"But his life changed when he got the chan@@ ce to be re@@ set@@ t@@ led to the United States , and he found love in a f@@ os@@ ter family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this pr@@ oud moment when he gra@@ du@@ ated from uni@@ versity ."
"( Applause ) I sp@@ oke to him on S@@ ky@@ p@@ e the other day , and he was in his new uni@@ versity in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da pur@@ su@@ ing his Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . in public health , and he pr@@ ou@@ dly told me how he was able to ra@@ ise enough fun@@ ds from the American public to es@@ ta@@ bl@@ ish a health cl@@ in@@ ic back in his vil@@ la@@ ge back home ."
So I want to take you back to H@@ any .
"When I told him I was going to have the chan@@ ce to speak to you here on the TED stage , he allo@@ wed me to read you a po@@ e@@ m that he sen@@ t in an e@@ ma@@ il to me ."

"My room , my book@@ s , myself , and everything that was making me s@@ mi@@ le ."
"O@@ h , o@@ h , I had so many dre@@ ams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : N@@ ot inve@@ sting in re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is a huge mis@@ sed opportunity ."
"L@@ e@@ a@@ ve them ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed , and they risk ex@@ plo@@ it@@ ation and ab@@ use , and leave them un@@ s@@ kill@@ ed and un@@ e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted , and de@@ la@@ y by years the re@@ turn to pe@@ ace and pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity in their countries ."
I believe how we tre@@ at the u@@ pro@@ o@@ ted will sh@@ ape the future of our world .
"The v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of war can hold the ke@@ ys to la@@ sting pe@@ ace , and it &apos;s the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who can stop the cy@@ cle of viol@@ ence ."
H@@ any is at a ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
"We would love to help him go to uni@@ versity and to become an engine@@ er , but our fun@@ ds are pri@@ or@@ it@@ ized for the bas@@ ics in life : ten@@ ts and bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts and mat@@ tre@@ s@@ ses and kit@@ ch@@ en se@@ ts , food r@@ ations and a bit of me@@ dic@@ ine ."
U@@ ni@@ versity is a lu@@ x@@ ury .

( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine writ@@ er that some@@ day people like me would go to j@@ ai@@ l .
And that became the he@@ ad@@ line of a F@@ or@@ tun@@ e ar@@ tic@@ le .
They went on to descri@@ be me as America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O .
"F@@ rom pl@@ un@@ de@@ re@@ r to reco@@ ver@@ ing pl@@ un@@ de@@ re@@ r , to America &apos;s gre@@ en@@ est C@@ E@@ O in five years — that , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , was a pretty sa@@ d com@@ men@@ t@@ ary on American C@@ E@@ O@@ s in 199@@ 9 ."

And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a cr@@ ime .
"But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a cr@@ ime — there must be a clear , demon@@ str@@ able al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative to the tak@@ e-@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ was@@ te indus@@ tri@@ al system that so dom@@ ina@@ tes our ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , and is the maj@@ or cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ al@@ ing our children &apos;s future , by dig@@ ging up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to produc@@ ts that quickly become was@@ te in a lan@@ d@@ f@@ ill or an in@@ c@@ in@@ er@@ ator — in sh@@ ort , dig@@ ging up the ear@@ th and con@@ ver@@ ting it to pol@@ lu@@ tion ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ l@@ ich and a we@@ ll@@ -@@ known environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation , imp@@ act — a bad thing — is the produ@@ ct of population , af@@ f@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
"That is , imp@@ act is gener@@ ated by people , what they con@@ sume in their af@@ f@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produc@@ ed ."
"And though the equ@@ ation is lar@@ ge@@ ly sub@@ je@@ ctive , you can perhaps qu@@ an@@ ti@@ f@@ y people , and perhaps qu@@ an@@ ti@@ f@@ y af@@ f@@ lu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ us@@ ive in too many ways to qu@@ an@@ ti@@ f@@ y ."
So the equ@@ ation is con@@ cep@@ tual .
S@@ t@@ ill it works to help us understand the problem .
"So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 199@@ 4 , to create an example : to trans@@ form the way we made car@@ pe@@ t , a pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive produ@@ ct for materi@@ als as well as energy , and to trans@@ form our techno@@ logies so they d@@ im@@ in@@ i@@ shed environ@@ mental imp@@ act , rather than mul@@ ti@@ p@@ li@@ ed it ."
"P@@ au@@ l and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ l@@ ich &apos;s environ@@ mental imp@@ act equ@@ ation : I is equ@@ al to P times A times T : population , af@@ f@@ lu@@ ence and technology ."
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ write that equ@@ ation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A di@@ v@@ ided by T@@ .
"Now , the ma@@ the@@ matic@@ all@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see im@@ medi@@ ately that T in the num@@ er@@ ator incre@@ a@@ ses imp@@ act — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator de@@ cre@@ a@@ ses imp@@ act ."

"I thought about the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of first indus@@ tri@@ al re@@ v@@ olution , T@@ 1 , as we pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed it at Inter@@ face , and it had the follo@@ wing charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."

"We have di@@ ver@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ 8 million p@@ oun@@ ds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4@@ ,000 t@@ ons — of used car@@ pe@@ t from lan@@ d@@ f@@ ill@@ s , cl@@ os@@ ing the lo@@ o@@ p on materi@@ al flo@@ ws through re@@ verse log@@ is@@ tics and pos@@ t-@@ con@@ su@@ mer rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing techno@@ logies that did not ex@@ ist when we started 14 years ago ."
"Th@@ ose new cy@@ cl@@ ical techno@@ logies have con@@ tribu@@ ted m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to the fact that we have produc@@ ed and so@@ ld 8@@ 5 million squ@@ are yar@@ ds of cl@@ ima@@ te@@ -@@ ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al car@@ pe@@ t since 200@@ 4 , me@@ an@@ ing no net con@@ tribu@@ tion to global climate dis@@ ru@@ ption in produc@@ ing the car@@ pe@@ t thr@@ ough@@ out the supp@@ ly cha@@ in , from min@@ e and well head clear to en@@ d-@@ of@@ -@@ life rec@@ la@@ ma@@ tion — in@@ depen@@ den@@ t th@@ ir@@ d-@@ par@@ ty cer@@ ti@@ fied ."
We call it C@@ ool C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t .
"And it has been a powerful marke@@ t@@ place differen@@ ti@@ ator , incre@@ as@@ ing s@@ al@@ es and pro@@ f@@ its ."
"Th@@ ree years ago we la@@ un@@ ched car@@ pe@@ t ti@@ le for the home , under the br@@ and F@@ l@@ or , mis@@ spe@@ ll@@ ed F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R ."
You can point and cl@@ ick today at F@@ l@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m and have C@@ ool C@@ ar@@ pe@@ t de@@ li@@ vered to your front do@@ or in five days .
"It is pr@@ ac@@ tical , and pretty too ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ kon that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our go@@ al : zer@@ o imp@@ act , zer@@ o fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"We &apos;ve set 20@@ 20 as our tar@@ get year for zer@@ o , for re@@ ach@@ ing the top , the sum@@ m@@ it of M@@ oun@@ t S@@ us@@ tain@@ ability ."
We call this M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ is@@ sion Z@@ er@@ o to be incredi@@ bly good for business .
"A better business model , a better way to big@@ ger pro@@ f@@ its ."
Here is the business case for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"F@@ rom real life experience , cos@@ ts are down , not up , re@@ f@@ lec@@ ting some 4@@ 00 million dollars of av@@ o@@ ided cos@@ ts in pur@@ su@@ it of zer@@ o was@@ te — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t S@@ us@@ tain@@ ability ."
This has p@@ ai@@ d all the cos@@ ts for the trans@@ formation of Inter@@ face .
"And this dis@@ pe@@ ls a my@@ th too , this f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice between the environment and the economy ."
"O@@ ur produc@@ ts are the best they &apos;ve ever been , insp@@ i@@ red by design for su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , an un@@ expe@@ cted we@@ ll@@ sp@@ r@@ ing of innov@@ ation ."
O@@ ur people are g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ized around this shar@@ ed high@@ er pur@@ p@@ ose .
You cannot be@@ at it for at@@ trac@@ ting the best people and br@@ ing@@ ing them together .
And the go@@ od@@ will of the marke@@ t@@ place is a@@ st@@ oni@@ shing .
"@@ No amount of ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ing , no cle@@ ver marke@@ ting cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , at any pr@@ ice , could have produc@@ ed or created this much go@@ od@@ will ."
"C@@ os@@ ts , produc@@ ts , people , marke@@ t@@ places — what else is there ?"
It is a better business model .
And here is our 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year recor@@ d of s@@ al@@ es and pro@@ f@@ its .
"There is a di@@ p there , from 200@@ 1 to 200@@ 3 : a di@@ p when our s@@ al@@ es , over a th@@ ree@@ -@@ year peri@@ od , were down 1@@ 7 percent ."
But the marke@@ t@@ place was down 3@@ 6 percent .
We liter@@ ally ga@@ ined market share .
We might not have survi@@ ved that rec@@ es@@ sion but for the adv@@ anta@@ ges of su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
"If every business were pur@@ su@@ ing Inter@@ face pl@@ ans , would that sol@@ ve all our problems ?"
I don &apos;t think so .
"I re@@ ma@@ in tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed by the re@@ vi@@ sed E@@ h@@ r@@ l@@ ich equ@@ ation , I equ@@ als P times A di@@ v@@ ided by T@@ 2 ."
"That A is a cap@@ ital A , sug@@ ge@@ sting that af@@ f@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself ."
But what if we re@@ fr@@ am@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ l@@ ich fur@@ ther ?
"And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; sug@@ ge@@ sting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happ@@ iness — more happ@@ iness with less stuff ."
"You know that would re@@ fr@@ ame ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of econom@@ ics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ds us : the su@@ sta@@ in@@ able species , living on a fin@@ ite ear@@ th , e@@ th@@ ically , happ@@ ily and e@@ co@@ log@@ ically in b@@ al@@ ance with nature and all her natural systems for a th@@ ous@@ and gener@@ ations , or 1@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations — that is to say , into the in@@ de@@ fin@@ ite future ."
But does the ear@@ th have to wa@@ it for our ex@@ tin@@ ction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
"A@@ t Inter@@ face we really inte@@ nd to bring this pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical su@@ sta@@ in@@ able , zer@@ o@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int indus@@ tri@@ al company fully into ex@@ is@@ ten@@ ce by 20@@ 20 ."
"We can see our way now , clear to the top of that m@@ oun@@ tain ."
And now the challenge is in ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion .
"And as my good friend and ad@@ vi@@ ser A@@ mor@@ y L@@ o@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something ex@@ ists , it must be possible . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible ."
"If we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive company can do it , any@@ body can ."
"And if any@@ body can , it follo@@ ws that everybody can ."
"H@@ a@@ w@@ ken fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill@@ ed business and indus@@ try , le@@ ad@@ ing hum@@ an@@ kind away from the ab@@ y@@ ss because , with contin@@ u@@ ed un@@ che@@ c@@ ked de@@ cl@@ ine of the bi@@ os@@ p@@ here , a very de@@ ar person is at risk here — f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , an un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table risk ."
W@@ ho is that person ?
N@@ ot you . N@@ ot I@@ .
But let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this m@@ oun@@ tain cl@@ im@@ b .
"O@@ n a T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning in M@@ ar@@ ch of 199@@ 6 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , br@@ ing@@ ing them along and often not kno@@ wing whether I was conne@@ c@@ ting ."
"But about five days later back in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved an e@@ ma@@ il from G@@ l@@ en@@ n Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s , one of my people in the C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a mee@@ ting ."
He was sen@@ ding me an or@@ ig@@ inal po@@ e@@ m that he had com@@ po@@ sed after our T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ ning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most up@@ li@@ f@@ ting mom@@ ents of my life .
"Because it told me , by God , one person got it ."
"H@@ ere is what G@@ l@@ en@@ n wr@@ ote . And here is that person , most at risk ."
"P@@ lease me@@ et &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out a name , an un@@ seen face , and kno@@ wing not your time or place , T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last T@@ u@@ es@@ day mor@@ n ."
A w@@ ise friend in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed us two .
"And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me ."
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
"For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might some@@ day , some@@ how thre@@ a@@ ten you ."
"T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s child , my da@@ ughter , son , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;ve just be@@ gun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should ."
"@@ Be@@ gin , I will ."
"The way the cost of what I squ@@ an@@ der , what is lost , if ever I for@@ get that you will some@@ day come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ d &quot; &quot; has sp@@ ok@@ en to me with one simple but pro@@ found mes@@ sage , which I pre@@ sume to share with you ."
"We are , each and every one , a part of the we@@ b of life ."
"The contin@@ u@@ um of hum@@ an@@ ity , sure , but in a lar@@ ger sense , the we@@ b of life itself ."
"And we have a cho@@ ice to make during our bri@@ e@@ f , bri@@ e@@ f vis@@ it to this beautiful blu@@ e and green living planet : to h@@ ur@@ t it or to help it ."
"For you , it &apos;s your call ."
Thank you .
