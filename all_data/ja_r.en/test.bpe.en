"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ arly a billion people on this planet that ac@@ ti@@ vely use social net@@ working sit@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"W@@ hi@@ le that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ th@@ ore@@ d ear@@ li@@ er this year by De@@ re@@ k K@@ . M@@ il@@ ler , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ il@@ ler did was have his family and friends write a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ or@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wr@@ ote in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my blo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally shu@@ t down from the p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends pu@@ bl@@ ish this pre@@ par@@ ed mes@@ sage I wr@@ ote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ s@@ ite to an ar@@ chi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist , M@@ il@@ ler &apos;s ar@@ chi@@ ve may have been better writ@@ ten and more care@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an ar@@ chi@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ side@@ r a few st@@ ats for a moment .
Right now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being u@@ plo@@ a@@ ded to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minu@@ te .
There are 200 million T@@ wee@@ ts being pos@@ ted every day .
And the a@@ verage F@@ ace@@ book u@@ ser is cre@@ ating 90 pie@@ ces of con@@ tent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your gr@@ and@@ parents , at best they may have created some photo@@ s or home v@@ ide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly r@@ ich dig@@ ital ar@@ chi@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ oud in@@ de@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tr@@ igu@@ ing opportun@@ ities for techno@@ log@@ ists .
"Now to be clear , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist and not a techno@@ log@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ ef@@ ly is pa@@ int a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some serv@@ ices that are desig@@ ned to let us de@@ ci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ing@@ ly enough , found me when I che@@ c@@ ked into a de@@ l@@ i at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( Re@@ cor@@ ding ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ st@@ row : H@@ e@@ ll@@ o .
De@@ ath : A@@ da@@ m ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can c@@ at@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ gan@@ ic ."
A@@ O : W@@ ho is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ st@@ row : K@@ in@@ d of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that serv@@ ice does , quite simply , is let you create a mes@@ sage or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther serv@@ ice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ or@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tribu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with photo@@ s and v@@ ide@@ os and stories that they can p@@ ost after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably famil@@ i@@ ar with De@@ b R@@ o@@ y who , back in M@@ ar@@ ch , demon@@ stra@@ ted how he was able to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ u@@ es to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of con@@ tent — the T@@ wee@@ ts , the photo@@ s , the v@@ ide@@ os , the blo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such mas@@ sive num@@ bers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our dig@@ ital person@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ an@@ ks to the v@@ a@@ st@@ ness of the amount of con@@ tent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One serv@@ ice called My N@@ ex@@ t T@@ we@@ et an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted onto T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some predic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resu@@ l@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ n@@ ical cap@@ ab@@ il@@ ities impro@@ ve ."
"T@@ aking it a step fur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media la@@ b is working on robot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those robot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ qu@@ e charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of a speci@@ fic person based on the hundre@@ ds of thousands of pie@@ ces of con@@ tent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ log@@ ra@@ m of hi@@ p ho@@ p art@@ ist w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same typ@@ e of technology to be@@ am a re@@ presen@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ om@@ s — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way based on all the con@@ tent they created while they were al@@ ive ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both ex@@ p@@ and ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in cl@@ os@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a de@@ fin@@ ition of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

People re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak : I call them re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"These are people who have taken care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s for el@@ der care , for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , pur@@ su@@ ing a person@@ al intere@@ st or a person@@ al health issue ."
"C@@ lo@@ se@@ ly re@@ la@@ ted are care@@ er trans@@ iti@@ on@@ ers of all kinds : ve@@ ter@@ ans , mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ou@@ ses , re@@ ti@@ re@@ es coming out of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ating ex@@ pat@@ s ."
This dis@@ conne@@ ct is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help sol@@ ve .
"Now , suc@@ cess@@ ful re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are every@@ where and in every field ."
He &apos;s a nu@@ clear phys@@ ic@@ ist in the U@@ K who took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak to be home with his five children .
"And spe@@ aking of long care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s , this is M@@ imi K@@ a@@ h@@ n ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a social wor@@ ker in O@@ range C@@ oun@@ ty , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , who re@@ turned to work in a social serv@@ ices organiz@@ ation after a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
That &apos;s the lon@@ gest care@@ er bre@@ ak that I &apos;m a@@ ware of .
"And this is T@@ r@@ acy S@@ ha@@ p@@ iro , who took a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
"T@@ r@@ acy wr@@ ote in that she was a mo@@ m of five who lo@@ ved her time at home , but she had gone through a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and needed to re@@ turn to work , pl@@ us she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she lo@@ ved working ."
T@@ r@@ acy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
"S@@ he was looking for a fin@@ ance or ac@@ coun@@ ting ro@@ le , and she had just spent the last nin@@ e months very d@@ il@@ ig@@ ently re@@ sear@@ ching companies on@@ line and ap@@ pl@@ ying for j@@ ob@@ s with no resu@@ l@@ ts ."
"I met T@@ r@@ acy in J@@ une of 20@@ 11 , when the T@@ o@@ day S@@ how asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around ."
The first thing I told T@@ r@@ acy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her intere@@ st in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of con@@ vers@@ ations that don &apos;t go any@@ where ."
"E@@ x@@ pe@@ ct that , and don &apos;t be dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged by it ."
"And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is f@@ ro@@ zen in time ."
"And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has d@@ im@@ in@@ i@@ shed over time , as happens with so many of us the far@@ ther re@@ mo@@ ved we are from our pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal iden@@ t@@ ities ."
"So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this ."
And that was that I har@@ dly ke@@ pt up with the business news .
"I believe re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are a ge@@ m of the wor@@ k@@ force , and here &apos;s why ."
We have fe@@ wer sp@@ ou@@ sa@@ l or part@@ ner job re@@ loc@@ ations .
We &apos;re in a more set@@ t@@ led time of life .
We have great work experience .
We have a more ma@@ ture per@@ spe@@ ctive .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ se .
"P@@ l@@ us we have an energy , an en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m about re@@ tur@@ ning to work pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while ."
"O@@ n the f@@ li@@ p side , I speak with em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers , and here are two con@@ cer@@ ns that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers have about hir@@ ing re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers ."
"The first one is , em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers are wor@@ ri@@ ed that re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are techno@@ log@@ ically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
I had done my fin@@ an@@ cial an@@ al@@ ys@@ is so long ago that I used L@@ ot@@ us 1@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3 .
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ one can even remember back that far , but I had to re@@ learn it on E@@ x@@ ce@@ l ."
I tell re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers expe@@ ct them to come to the table with a working knowledge of bas@@ ic off@@ ice man@@ age@@ ment so@@ f@@ t@@ ware .
"And if they &apos;re not up to spe@@ ed , then it &apos;s their respon@@ si@@ bility to get there ."
And they do .
That &apos;s not the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er &apos;s job .
B@@ ack in 20@@ 10 I started not@@ ic@@ ing something .
I saw G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s and S@@ ara Le@@ e start cor@@ por@@ ate re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship pro@@ gr@@ ams .
"And at this point , hundre@@ ds of people have partic@@ i@@ pa@@ ted ."
"This te@@ sting out peri@@ od re@@ mo@@ ves the per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved risk that some man@@ ag@@ ers atta@@ ch to hir@@ ing re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , and they are at@@ trac@@ ting ex@@ ce@@ ll@@ ent can@@ di@@ da@@ tes who are tur@@ ning into great hi@@ res ."
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a re@@ ti@@ ree inter@@ n@@ ship pro@@ gram .
"D@@ i@@ fferen@@ t po@@ o@@ l , same con@@ cept ."
But it was a tem@@ p job .
This was in the f@@ all of 20@@ 11 .
"F@@ ast for@@ ward to 20@@ 15 , T@@ r@@ acy &apos;s been pr@@ omo@@ ted ."
"T@@ r@@ acy &apos;s tem@@ p job was a tr@@ you@@ t , just like an inter@@ n@@ ship , and it en@@ ded up being a w@@ in for both T@@ r@@ acy and her em@@ plo@@ y@@ er ."
"Now , my go@@ al is to bring the re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship con@@ cept to more and more em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers ."
"But in the me@@ an@@ time , if you are re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak , don &apos;t he@@ sit@@ ate to sug@@ gest an inter@@ n@@ ship or an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment to an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er that does not have a forma@@ l re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship pro@@ gram ."
"B@@ e their first suc@@ cess story , and you can be the example for more re@@ la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers to come ."
T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expe@@ cted disco@@ ver@@ ies .

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organiz@@ ation &apos;s science ad@@ vis@@ or .
"I really , really lo@@ ved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feel@@ ing just a little bit dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged ."
So I wan@@ de@@ red down the ha@@ ll@@ way to my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ an@@ sen &apos;s off@@ ice .
"C@@ h@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had dee@@ p institu@@ ti@@ onal knowledge and in@@ s@@ ights ."
I expla@@ ined to Ch@@ r@@ is that I was feel@@ ing a little bit stu@@ ck .
I had been inve@@ st@@ igat@@ ing a number of issu@@ es at the inter@@ se@@ ction of science and ci@@ vi@@ l li@@ ber@@ ties — su@@ per interesting .
"But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to enga@@ ge these issu@@ es in a much big@@ ger way , in a way that could really make a difference ."
"So Ch@@ r@@ is c@@ ut right to the ch@@ ase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issu@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gen@@ e@@ tic dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ation , and re@@ produc@@ tive techno@@ logies , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , there &apos;s this really c@@ ool issue , fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal M@@ R@@ I and using it for li@@ e de@@ te@@ ction , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , and of course , there &apos;s gen@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ts ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yes , you know , pa@@ ten@@ ts on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been issu@@ ing pa@@ ten@@ ts on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my off@@ ice and sen@@ t Ch@@ r@@ is three ar@@ tic@@ les .
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my off@@ ice ."
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! W@@ ho can we su@@ e ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ r@@ is is a really br@@ il@@ li@@ ant la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but he knew almost nothing about pa@@ tent la@@ w and cer@@ tain@@ ly nothing about gen@@ e@@ tics ."
"I knew something about gen@@ e@@ tics , but I wasn &apos;t even a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , let alone a pa@@ tent la@@ w@@ y@@ er ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fi@@ le a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we needed to understand exactly what was pa@@ ten@@ ted when someone pa@@ ten@@ ted a gen@@ e ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ts t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally con@@ tain do@@ zen@@ s of c@@ la@@ im@@ s , but the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; is@@ ol@@ ated DNA &quot; &quot; — nam@@ e@@ ly , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ mo@@ ved from a cell ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pa@@ tent pro@@ pon@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ e ? We didn &apos;t pa@@ tent the gen@@ e in your body , we pa@@ ten@@ ted an is@@ ol@@ ated gen@@ e . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gen@@ e requ@@ i@@ res that it be is@@ ol@@ ated ."
"And the pa@@ ten@@ ts we@@ ren &apos;t just to a particular gen@@ e that they is@@ ol@@ ated , but on every possible ver@@ sion of that gen@@ e ."
So what does that mean ?
"That means that you can &apos;t give your gen@@ e to your doc@@ tor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mu@@ t@@ ations , without per@@ mis@@ sion of the pa@@ tent ho@@ l@@ der ."
It also means that the pa@@ tent ho@@ l@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in research or cl@@ in@@ ical te@@ sting .
"A@@ l@@ lo@@ wing pa@@ tent ho@@ l@@ ders , often pri@@ v@@ ate companies , to lo@@ ck up stre@@ t@@ ches of the human gen@@ ome was har@@ ming patients ."
"C@@ on@@ side@@ r A@@ bi@@ ga@@ i@@ l , a 1@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old with long Q@@ T sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome , a seri@@ ous heart con@@ d@@ ition that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can resu@@ lt in su@@ d@@ den death ."
The company that ob@@ tain@@ ed a pa@@ tent on two gen@@ es as@@ soci@@ ated with this con@@ d@@ ition develop@@ ed a test to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never o@@ ffe@@ red it .
"So another la@@ b tried to off@@ er the test , but the company that he@@ ld the pa@@ ten@@ ts thre@@ a@@ ten@@ ed to su@@ e the la@@ b for pa@@ tent in@@ fr@@ in@@ ge@@ ment ."
"So as a resu@@ lt , for 2 years , no test was av@@ a@@ il@@ able ."
"D@@ uring that time , A@@ bi@@ ga@@ i@@ l died of un@@ di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed long Q@@ T ."
G@@ en@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ts c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
"T@@ ur@@ ns out that the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made clear through a long line of ca@@ ses , that certain things are not pa@@ tent el@@ ig@@ i@@ ble ."
"You can &apos;t pa@@ tent produc@@ ts of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , ele@@ ments of the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table ."
"And you can &apos;t pa@@ tent la@@ ws of nature — the la@@ w of gra@@ v@@ ity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 ."
These things are just too fund@@ amen@@ tal and must re@@ ma@@ in free to all and re@@ ser@@ ved ex@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ vely to n@@ one .
"It seem@@ ed to us that DNA , the most fund@@ amen@@ tal structure of life , that co@@ des for the produc@@ tion of all of our prote@@ ins , is both a produ@@ ct of nature and a la@@ w of nature , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bo@@ dies or sitting in the bot@@ to@@ m of a test tu@@ be ."
"As we de@@ l@@ ved into this issue , we tra@@ ve@@ led all over the country to speak with many different exper@@ ts — scientists , med@@ ical pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ als , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , pa@@ tent la@@ w@@ y@@ ers ."
"M@@ ost of them a@@ gre@@ ed that we were right as a matter of pol@@ ic@@ y , and , at least in the@@ ory , as a matter of la@@ w ."
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gen@@ e-@@ pa@@ tent challenge were about zer@@ o .
Why is that ?
"Well , the pa@@ tent off@@ ice had been issu@@ ing these pa@@ ten@@ ts for more than 20 years ."
There were liter@@ ally thousands of pa@@ ten@@ ts on human gen@@ es .
"The pa@@ tent ba@@ r was dee@@ p@@ ly ent@@ ren@@ ched in the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o , the bio@@ te@@ ch indus@@ try had gro@@ wn up around this pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , and le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation to ban gen@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ts had been in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed year after year in Con@@ gre@@ ss , and had gone absolu@@ tely no@@ where ."
So the bot@@ to@@ m line : cour@@ ts just we@@ ren &apos;t going to be w@@ ill@@ ing to over@@ turn these pa@@ ten@@ ts .
"Now , ne@@ i@@ ther Ch@@ r@@ is no@@ r I were the typ@@ e to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and he@@ ar@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seem@@ ed all the more reason to take on this f@@ ight ."
So we set out to build our case .
"Now , pa@@ tent ca@@ ses te@@ nd to be : C@@ om@@ p@@ any A su@@ es C@@ om@@ p@@ any B over some really nar@@ row , ob@@ sc@@ ure tech@@ n@@ ical issue ."
"We we@@ ren &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much big@@ ger than that ."
"This was about sci@@ enti@@ fic f@@ ree@@ dom , med@@ ical pro@@ gre@@ ss , the r@@ ights of patients ."
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad he@@ ld pa@@ ten@@ ts on two gen@@ es , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 gen@@ es ."
W@@ om@@ en with certain mu@@ t@@ ations along these gen@@ es are conside@@ red to be at a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ a@@ sed risk of develop@@ ing bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had used its pa@@ ten@@ ts to ma@@ inta@@ in a comple@@ te mon@@ op@@ o@@ ly on B@@ R@@ CA te@@ sting in the United States .
It had for@@ ced mul@@ ti@@ ple lab@@ s that were of@@ fer@@ ing B@@ R@@ CA te@@ sting to stop .
"It char@@ ged a lot of money for its test — over 3@@ ,000 dollars ."
It had sto@@ pped shar@@ ing its cl@@ in@@ ical data with the inter@@ national sci@@ enti@@ fic community .
"And perhaps wor@@ st of all , for a peri@@ od of se@@ ver@@ al years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ fu@@ sed to up@@ date its test to inclu@@ de ad@@ diti@@ onal mu@@ t@@ ations that had been iden@@ ti@@ fied by a team of re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"It has been est@@ ima@@ ted that during that peri@@ od , for se@@ ver@@ al years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going te@@ sting re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved the wrong answer — a ne@@ g@@ ative test resu@@ lt that should have been pos@@ itive ."
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en Ma@@ x@@ ian .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s sis@@ ter E@@ il@@ e@@ en develop@@ ed bre@@ ast cancer at age 40 and she was te@@ sted by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was ne@@ g@@ ative .
The family was re@@ li@@ ev@@ ed .
"That me@@ ant that E@@ il@@ e@@ en &apos;s cancer most like@@ ly didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other mem@@ bers of her family didn &apos;t need to be te@@ sted ."
"But two years later , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en was di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with adv@@ an@@ ce@@ d-@@ stage o@@ vari@@ an cancer ."
It turned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s sis@@ ter was am@@ ong the 12 percent who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a f@@ al@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ g@@ ative test resu@@ lt .
"H@@ ad E@@ il@@ e@@ en re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved the pro@@ per resu@@ lt , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been te@@ sted , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
One of the maj@@ or challen@@ ges we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was fig@@ uring out how best to communic@@ ate the science .
"So in order to ar@@ gu@@ e that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inven@@ tion , and that is@@ ol@@ ated B@@ R@@ CA gen@@ es were produc@@ ts of nature , we had to expla@@ in a couple of bas@@ ic con@@ cep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gen@@ e ? What &apos;s DNA ?"
"@@ How is DNA is@@ ol@@ ated , and why isn &apos;t that an inven@@ tion ?"
"We spent hours and hours with our pla@@ in@@ ti@@ f@@ f@@ s and exper@@ ts , trying to come up with ways of expla@@ ining these con@@ cep@@ ts simply yet ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
"And we en@@ ded up rel@@ ying he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly on the use of me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors , like go@@ ld ."
So is@@ ol@@ ating DNA — it &apos;s like ex@@ trac@@ ting go@@ ld from a m@@ oun@@ tain or taking it out of a stre@@ am bed .
"You might be able to pa@@ tent the process for min@@ ing the go@@ ld , but you can &apos;t pa@@ tent the go@@ ld itself ."
"It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and ef@@ for@@ t to di@@ g the go@@ ld out of the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you still can &apos;t pa@@ tent it , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"And the go@@ ld , once it &apos;s ex@@ trac@@ ted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all sor@@ ts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you can make je@@ we@@ l@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pa@@ tent the go@@ ld , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our case ."
"We fil@@ ed in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ is@@ tr@@ ic@@ t of New York , and the case was ran@@ dom@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to J@@ u@@ dge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
"In M@@ ar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , J@@ u@@ dge S@@ we@@ et issu@@ ed his op@@ in@@ ion — 1@@ 5@@ 2 pa@@ ges — and a comple@@ te v@@ ic@@ tory for our side ."
"In read@@ ing the op@@ in@@ ion , we could not get over how e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ently he descri@@ bed the science in the case ."
"I mean , our bri@@ e@@ f — it was pretty good , but not this good ."
How did he develo@@ p such a dee@@ p under@@ standing of this issue in such a sh@@ ort time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ hen@@ d how this had happened .
"So it turned out , J@@ u@@ dge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a la@@ w@@ y@@ er — he was a scient@@ ist ."
He was not just a scient@@ ist — he had a Ph@@ D in molec@@ ular bio@@ logy .
( Laughter ) What an incredi@@ ble str@@ oke of lu@@ ck !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched side@@ s ."
So in the dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t the government sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
"But now in di@@ re@@ ct op@@ pos@@ ition to its own pa@@ tent off@@ ice , the U@@ S government fil@@ es a bri@@ e@@ f that sta@@ tes that is has re@@ conside@@ red this issue in light of the dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion , and has con@@ clu@@ ded that is@@ ol@@ ated DNA is not pa@@ tent el@@ ig@@ i@@ ble ."
"This was a really big deal , tot@@ ally un@@ expe@@ cted ."
"The C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it he@@ ars all pa@@ tent ca@@ ses , and it has a re@@ pu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pa@@ tent ."
"So even with this re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble develop@@ ment , we expe@@ cted to l@@ ose ."
And we did .
S@@ ort of .
"E@@ n@@ ds up s@@ pl@@ it decis@@ ion , 2 to 1 ."
"But the two ju@@ d@@ ges who ru@@ led against us , did so for completely different reas@@ ons ."
"The first one , J@@ u@@ dge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , bio@@ logical the@@ ory — tot@@ ally wrong ."
( Laughter ) He decided M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had created a new chem@@ ical — made absolu@@ tely no sense .
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even ar@@ gu@@ e this , so it came out of the blu@@ e ."
"The other , J@@ u@@ dge M@@ o@@ ore , said she basically a@@ gre@@ ed with us that is@@ ol@@ ated DNA is a produ@@ ct of nature ."
"But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shak@@ e up the bio@@ te@@ ch indus@@ try . &quot; &quot; The third , J@@ u@@ dge B@@ r@@ y@@ son , a@@ gre@@ ed with us ."
So now we sou@@ g@@ h@@ t re@@ view by the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"And when you pe@@ t@@ ition the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to present a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer ."
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a super@@ -@@ long para@@ grap@@ h , like a whole pa@@ ge long with lots and lots of c@@ la@@ u@@ ses , &quot; whe@@ re@@ in this &quot; and &quot; the@@ re@@ fore that . &quot;"
We sub@@ mit@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question presen@@ ted ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pa@@ ten@@ table ?
"Now when Ch@@ r@@ is first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know ."
"I think you have to say , &apos; I@@ s is@@ ol@@ ated DNA pa@@ ten@@ table ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ope ."
"I want the j@@ us@@ tic@@ es to have the very same re@@ action that I had when you br@@ ought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly couldn &apos;t ar@@ gu@@ e with that ."
"The S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only he@@ ars about one percent of the ca@@ ses that it re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves , and it a@@ gre@@ ed to hear our@@ s ."
"The day of the or@@ al ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ar@@ ri@@ ves , and it was really , really exc@@ iting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the mor@@ ning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se ."
"T@@ wo bre@@ ast cancer organiz@@ ations , B@@ re@@ ast C@@ an@@ cer A@@ ction and F@@ O@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organiz@@ ed a demon@@ str@@ ation on the cour@@ thou@@ se ste@@ ps ."
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
"But any re@@ main@@ ing pan@@ ic sub@@ s@@ ided as I wal@@ ked into the cour@@ tro@@ om and looked around at a se@@ a of fri@@ en@@ dly fac@@ es : our individu@@ al women c@@ li@@ ents who had shar@@ ed their dee@@ p@@ ly person@@ al stories , the gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ists who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their bus@@ y care@@ ers to de@@ dic@@ ate themselves to this f@@ ight and re@@ presen@@ t@@ ati@@ ves from a di@@ verse ar@@ ra@@ y of med@@ ical , pati@@ ent adv@@ oc@@ acy , environ@@ mental and rel@@ ig@@ ious organiz@@ ations , who had sub@@ mit@@ ted friend of the cour@@ t bri@@ ef@@ s in the case ."
"A@@ l@@ so in the room were three lea@@ ders of the H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject , inclu@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disco@@ ve@@ re@@ r of DNA him@@ self , J@@ am@@ es W@@ at@@ son , who had sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ fer@@ red to gen@@ e pa@@ ten@@ ting as &quot; &quot; l@@ un@@ acy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The di@@ versity of the commun@@ ities re@@ presen@@ ted in this room and the con@@ tribu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality sp@@ oke vol@@ um@@ es to what was at st@@ ake ."
The ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Ch@@ r@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed br@@ il@@ li@@ an@@ tly .
"But for me , the most thr@@ ill@@ ing as@@ pe@@ ct was wat@@ ching the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es grap@@ ple with is@@ ol@@ ated DNA , through a seri@@ es of col@@ or@@ ful an@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es and fe@@ is@@ ty ex@@ changes , very much the same way as our le@@ ga@@ l team had done for the past seven years ."
J@@ us@@ tic@@ e K@@ ag@@ an l@@ iken@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ating DNA to ex@@ trac@@ ting a me@@ dic@@ inal plant from the A@@ maz@@ on .
J@@ us@@ tic@@ e R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ i@@ shed it from car@@ ving a ba@@ se@@ b@@ all b@@ at from a t@@ ree .

"&quot; &quot; A nat@@ ur@@ ally oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing DNA se@@ g@@ ment is a produ@@ ct of nature , and not pa@@ ten@@ t-@@ el@@ ig@@ i@@ ble me@@ rely because it has been is@@ ol@@ ated ."
"And fur@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ in 2@@ 4 hours of the decis@@ ion , five lab@@ s had an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that they would be@@ gin to off@@ er te@@ sting for the B@@ R@@ CA gen@@ es ."
S@@ ome of them pr@@ om@@ i@@ sed to off@@ er the te@@ sts at a lo@@ wer pr@@ ice than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .

But of course the decis@@ ion goes far be@@ yon@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e of allo@@ wing pa@@ ten@@ ts on human gen@@ es in the United States .

"A few weeks after the cour@@ t issu@@ ed its decis@@ ion , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a small p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge in the ma@@ il ."
"It was from B@@ o@@ b C@@ ook@@ -@@ D@@ ee@@ gan , a pro@@ fe@@ s@@ s@@ or at D@@ uke U@@ ni@@ versity and one the very first people Ch@@ r@@ is and I went to vis@@ it when we started to conside@@ r whether to bring this case ."
I open@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ f@@ f@@ ed anima@@ l .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
P@@ art of what gave us the cou@@ ra@@ ge to take that risk was kno@@ wing that we were doing the right thing .
"The process took ne@@ arly e@@ ight years from the start to fin@@ ish , with many t@@ w@@ ists and turns along the way ."
"A little lu@@ ck cer@@ tain@@ ly hel@@ p@@ ed , but it was the commun@@ ities that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ an@@ ces that we created , that made p@@ ig@@ s f@@ ly ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ an@@ cial S@@ er@@ v@@ ices A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the answer is y@@ es ."
"Th@@ en , predic@@ tions can be made and te@@ sted ."
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is liter@@ ally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
W@@ here are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ tai@@ l was o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a val@@ ue to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"These are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expla@@ in by gi@@ ving you this an@@ al@@ o@@ gy .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through gl@@ imp@@ ses of about e@@ ight of my pro@@ jects , done in col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish art@@ ist S@@ ore@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to be@@ gin with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was insp@@ i@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ stan@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the l@@ ights or to bring him a gl@@ as@@ s of water , a p@@ ack of c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spe@@ cted figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the s@@ itu@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ st@@ i@@ fied me the most was his use of a lan@@ d@@ line te@@ le@@ phone .
He would hold on to the re@@ ce@@ i@@ ver and expe@@ ct me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requ@@ i@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle u@@ ses a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to col@@ le@@ ge , I started mis@@ sing his com@@ man@@ ds ."
And so I made him a go@@ l@@ den t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er through which he could dis@@ pen@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ e@@ ces around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of pap@@ er , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , typ@@ e his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and pu@@ ll the pap@@ er out ."
This dev@@ ice would au@@ to@@ matic@@ ally se@@ nd the in@@ ten@@ ded person the le@@ t@@ ter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of electr@@ on@@ ics that under@@ stan@@ ds all of the me@@ chan@@ ical ac@@ tions and con@@ ver@@ ts it to dig@@ ital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of r@@ itu@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle l@@ ik@@ es it ."
"The next work is a soun@@ d-@@ sen@@ s@@ itive inst@@ all@@ ation that we a@@ ffe@@ c@@ ti@@ ona@@ tely call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a not@@ ion of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ s@@ itive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ el@@ s , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ ures which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ e@@ p out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their ne@@ cks out ."
"And at the sl@@ igh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ el@@ s on three w@@ all@@ s of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"So when it &apos;s qu@@ i@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ el@@ s ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ at@@ ures do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ une to soun@@ ds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to bac@@ k@@ ground soun@@ ds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( N@@ o@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground soun@@ ds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( W@@ his@@ t@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , person@@ al@@ ities and so on ."
So this is a very early pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video inst@@ all@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tr@@ igu@@ ed with pla@@ ying with the not@@ ion of inv@@ is@@ i@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of inv@@ is@@ i@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in c@@ amera sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to develo@@ p a piece of so@@ f@@ t@@ ware with us , using a c@@ amera that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the bac@@ k@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e S@@ ore@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ ces@@ sed video where the c@@ amera has made him inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble ."
S@@ ore@@ n en@@ ters the room . P@@ o@@ p ! He goes inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble .
And you can see that the c@@ amera is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a c@@ amera looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ stan@@ tly inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble whe@@ re@@ ver they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The S@@ un S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oil sp@@ ill or a sun ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ ar@@ ed to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it almost seem@@ ed very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ n@@ ore it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to cl@@ im@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ ky fa@@ shi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted , and it would col@@ l@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ side@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y th@@ ough@@ ts , that it &apos;s sort of f@@ all@@ en into his hat , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a plant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very d@@ run@@ ken fa@@ shi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predic@@ table and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle we@@ ren &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ stan@@ ce — so when people en@@ ter the room , it activ@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vi@@ e@@ wer an inst@@ in@@ ct to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ag@@ es to pu@@ ll itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ n@@ ical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ics right and the equ@@ il@@ i@@ bri@@ um and the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"And it was very important for us to es@@ ta@@ bl@@ ish the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would to@@ pp@@ le over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ick video where we are doing a test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much fas@@ ter .
That &apos;s my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go c@@ at@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ag@@ es to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tr@@ igu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tin@@ y different s@@ iz@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which t@@ win@@ k@@ le like the night s@@ ky ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night s@@ ky .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a b@@ lob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ape of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was han@@ ging from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tr@@ ast something very co@@ ld and dis@@ tan@@ t and ab@@ str@@ act like the universe into the famil@@ i@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ t@@ imate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ ce@@ ive it to be a ho@@ le in the space , and as if you were looking out into the t@@ win@@ k@@ ling night s@@ ky ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ il@@ ler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to in@@ tim@@ i@@ date you by gro@@ wing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s t@@ w@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; e@@ ight &#93; times its vol@@ ume ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ stan@@ tly ex@@ pan@@ ding and con@@ trac@@ ting to create a d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a se@@ cre@@ t within its se@@ ams or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pre@@ ss the emot@@ ions and behavi@@ or@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ ures that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature pop@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ K , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love ."
"And speci@@ fic@@ ally , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love ."
"M@@ ost of us will probably f@@ all in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the En@@ gl@@ ish language , this me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or , f@@ all@@ ing , is really the ma@@ in way that we talk about that experience ."
"I don &apos;t know about you , but when I con@@ cep@@ tu@@ aliz@@ e this me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or , what I picture is stra@@ ight out of a car@@ to@@ on — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s wal@@ king down the side@@ walk , without realiz@@ ing it , he cr@@ os@@ ses over an open man@@ ho@@ le , and he just pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts into the se@@ wer be@@ low ."
And I picture it this way because f@@ all@@ ing is not j@@ um@@ ping .
"F@@ all@@ ing is acc@@ iden@@ tal , it &apos;s un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able ."
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our con@@ sen@@ t .
And this — this is the ma@@ in way we talk about star@@ ting a new relation@@ ship .
"I am a writ@@ er and I &apos;m also an En@@ gl@@ ish teach@@ er , which means I think about words for a living ."
"You could say that I get p@@ ai@@ d to ar@@ gu@@ e that the language we use mat@@ ters , and I would like to ar@@ gu@@ e that many of the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem ."
"So , in love , we f@@ all ."
We &apos;re stru@@ ck .
We are c@@ ru@@ shed .
We s@@ wo@@ on .
We bur@@ n with pas@@ sion .
"L@@ o@@ ve makes us cra@@ z@@ y , and it makes us s@@ ick ."
"O@@ ur he@@ ar@@ ts ach@@ e , and then they bre@@ ak ."
So our me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors equ@@ ate the experience of lo@@ ving someone to extre@@ me viol@@ ence or ill@@ ness .
( Laughter ) They do .
And they pos@@ ition us as the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of un@@ fore@@ seen and tot@@ ally un@@ av@@ oi@@ d@@ able cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces .
"My fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite one of these is &quot; &quot; s@@ mit@@ ten , &quot; &quot; which is the past partic@@ i@@ ple of the word &quot; &quot; s@@ mite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dic@@ tion@@ ary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be de@@ fin@@ ed as both &quot; &quot; g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ous af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I te@@ nd to as@@ soci@@ ate the word &quot; &quot; s@@ mite &quot; &quot; with a very particular con@@ text , which is the O@@ ld T@@ es@@ ta@@ ment ."
"In the B@@ ook of E@@ x@@ od@@ us alone , there are 16 re@@ fe@@ ren@@ ces to s@@ mit@@ ing , which is the word that the B@@ i@@ ble u@@ ses for the ven@@ ge@@ ance of an an@@ gr@@ y God ."
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to expla@@ in a pla@@ gu@@ e of loc@@ us@@ ts . ( Laughter )
Right ?
"So , how did this happen ?"
How have we come to as@@ soci@@ ate love with great pa@@ in and su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing ?
And why do we talk about this os@@ ten@@ si@@ bly good experience as if we are v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s ?
"These are difficult questions , but I have some the@@ or@@ ies ."
"And to think this through , I want to foc@@ us on one me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or in particular , which is the idea of love as ma@@ d@@ ness ."
"When I first started re@@ sear@@ ching r@@ om@@ an@@ tic love , I found these ma@@ d@@ ness me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors every@@ where ."
The history of W@@ es@@ tern culture is full of language that equ@@ ates love to mental ill@@ ness .
These are just a few exam@@ ples .
"W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ h@@ ake@@ spe@@ are : &quot; L@@ o@@ ve is me@@ rely a ma@@ d@@ ness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; A@@ s You L@@ ike It . &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ed@@ r@@ ich N@@ i@@ et@@ z@@ sch@@ e : &quot; There is always some ma@@ d@@ ness in love . &quot;"
"&quot; G@@ ot me looking , got me looking so cra@@ z@@ y in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her , Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é K@@ no@@ w@@ les . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I fe@@ ll in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ent relation@@ ship right from the start ."
"And it was long dis@@ tan@@ ce for the first couple of years , so for me that me@@ ant very high high@@ s and very low lo@@ ws ."
I can remember one moment in particular .
"I was sitting on a bed in a hos@@ te@@ l in S@@ ou@@ th America , and I was wat@@ ching the person I love walk out the do@@ or ."
"And it was l@@ ate , it was ne@@ arly mid@@ night , we &apos;d got@@ ten into an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent over din@@ ner , and when we got back to our room , he thre@@ w his things in the ba@@ g and stor@@ med out ."
"W@@ hi@@ le I can no longer remember what that ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent was about , I very c@@ lear@@ ly remember how I felt wat@@ ching him leave ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , it was my first time in the develop@@ ing world , and I was tot@@ ally alone ."
"I had another week until my fl@@ ight home , and I knew the name of the to@@ wn that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to f@@ ly out , but I had no idea how to get around ."
"I had no gu@@ ide@@ book and very little money , and I sp@@ oke no S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"S@@ ome@@ one more adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just f@@ ro@@ ze ."
I just s@@ at there .
And then I bur@@ st into te@@ ars .
"But de@@ sp@@ ite my pan@@ ic , some small vo@@ ice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow . That was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel mi@@ ser@@ able in love .
"And it soun@@ ds so st@@ range to me now , but at 2@@ 2 , I lon@@ ged to have dra@@ ma@@ tic experi@@ ences , and in that moment , I was ir@@ r@@ ational and fur@@ ious and dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted , and we@@ ir@@ dly enough , I thought that this some@@ how le@@ g@@ it@@ im@@ ized the feel@@ ings I had for the guy who had just left me ."
"I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit cra@@ z@@ y , because I thought that that was how lo@@ ved worked ."
"This really should not be sur@@ pris@@ ing , conside@@ r@@ ing that ac@@ cor@@ ding to W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , there are e@@ ight fil@@ ms , 14 son@@ gs , two al@@ bu@@ ms and one no@@ vel with the t@@ it@@ le &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y L@@ o@@ ve . &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ out half an h@@ our later , he came back to our room ."
We made up .
We spent another mos@@ tly happy week tra@@ ve@@ ling together .
"And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so ter@@ ri@@ ble and so great ."
"This must be a real r@@ om@@ ance . &quot; &quot; I expe@@ cted my first love to feel like ma@@ d@@ ness , and of course , it met that expe@@ c@@ tation very well ."
But lo@@ ving someone like that — as if my entire we@@ ll@@ -@@ being depen@@ ded on him lo@@ ving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I su@@ spe@@ ct this experience of love is not that un@@ usu@@ al .
M@@ ost of us do feel a bit ma@@ d in the early sta@@ ges of r@@ om@@ an@@ tic love .
"In fact , there is research to con@@ fir@@ m that this is some@@ what norma@@ l , because , neur@@ o@@ chem@@ ically spe@@ aking , r@@ om@@ an@@ tic love and mental ill@@ ness are not that eas@@ ily dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ i@@ shed ."
This is true .
This study from 199@@ 9 used blo@@ od te@@ sts to con@@ fir@@ m that the ser@@ oton@@ in le@@ ve@@ ls of the ne@@ w@@ ly in love very clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ed the ser@@ oton@@ in le@@ ve@@ ls of people who had been di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with ob@@ ses@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ comp@@ ul@@ sive dis@@ order .
"( Laughter ) Yes , and low le@@ ve@@ ls of ser@@ oton@@ in are also as@@ soci@@ ated with se@@ as@@ onal a@@ ffe@@ ctive dis@@ order and de@@ pres@@ sion ."
So there is some ev@@ idence that love is as@@ soci@@ ated with changes to our mo@@ o@@ ds and our behavi@@ ors .
And there are other stu@@ dies to con@@ fir@@ m that most relation@@ shi@@ ps be@@ gin this way .
"@@ Re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers believe that the low le@@ ve@@ ls of ser@@ oton@@ in is cor@@ re@@ la@@ ted with ob@@ ses@@ sive thinking about the ob@@ ject of love , which is like this feel@@ ing that someone has set up cam@@ p in your brain ."
And most of us feel this way when we first f@@ all in love .
"But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usu@@ ally from a few months to a couple of years ."
"When I got back from my tri@@ p to S@@ ou@@ th America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , che@@ c@@ king my e@@ ma@@ il , des@@ per@@ ate to hear from the guy I lo@@ ved ."
"I decided that if my friends could not understand my g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ous af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion , then I did not need their fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship ."
So I sto@@ pped han@@ ging out with most of them .
And it was probably the most un@@ happy year of my life .
"But I think I felt like it was my job to be mi@@ ser@@ able , because if I could be mi@@ ser@@ able , then I would pro@@ ve how much I lo@@ ved him ."
"And if I could pro@@ ve it , then we would have to end up together ev@@ en@@ tually ."
"This is the real ma@@ d@@ ness , because there is no cos@@ mi@@ c ru@@ le that says that great su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing equ@@ als great re@@ ward , but we talk about love as if this is true ."
O@@ ur experi@@ ences of love are both bio@@ logical and cul@@ tur@@ al .
"O@@ ur bio@@ logy te@@ lls us that love is good by activ@@ ating these re@@ ward cir@@ cu@@ its in our brain , and it te@@ lls us that love is pain@@ ful when , after a f@@ ight or a bre@@ aku@@ p , that neur@@ o@@ chem@@ ical re@@ ward is with@@ dra@@ wn ."
"And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neur@@ o@@ chem@@ ically spe@@ aking , going through a bre@@ aku@@ p is a lot like going through co@@ ca@@ ine with@@ dra@@ wa@@ l , which I find reas@@ sur@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) And then our culture u@@ ses language to sh@@ ape and re@@ in@@ force these ideas about love .
"In this case , we &apos;re talking about me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors about pa@@ in and ad@@ dic@@ tion and ma@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s kind of an interesting fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ o@@ p .
"L@@ o@@ ve is powerful and at times pain@@ ful , and we ex@@ pre@@ ss this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories pr@@ ime us to expe@@ ct love to be powerful and pain@@ ful ."
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that val@@ u@@ es li@@ fe@@ long mono@@ ga@@ my .
"It seem@@ s like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like ma@@ d@@ ness , and we want it to last an entire li@@ fe@@ time ."
That soun@@ ds ter@@ ri@@ ble .
"( Laughter ) T@@ o re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this , we need to ei@@ ther change our culture or change our expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations ."
"So , imagine if we were all less pas@@ sive in love ."
"If we were more as@@ ser@@ tive , more open@@ -@@ min@@ ded , more gener@@ ous and instead of f@@ all@@ ing in love , we ste@@ pped into love ."
"I know that this is as@@ king a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to sug@@ gest this ."
"In their book , &quot; &quot; M@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ors We L@@ ive B@@ y , &quot; &quot; lin@@ gu@@ ists M@@ ar@@ k J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge L@@ ak@@ off sug@@ gest a really interesting solution to this d@@ il@@ em@@ ma , which is to change our me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors ."
"They ar@@ gu@@ e that me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors really do sh@@ ape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a gu@@ ide for future ac@@ tions , like self-@@ fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill@@ ing pro@@ p@@ he@@ ci@@ es ."
J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off sug@@ gest a new me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or for love : love as a col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
"L@@ in@@ gu@@ ists talk about me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors as having en@@ ta@@ il@@ ments , which is essen@@ ti@@ ally a way of conside@@ r@@ ing all the im@@ plic@@ ations of , or ideas con@@ tain@@ ed within , a given me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"And J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off talk about everything that col@@ lab@@ or@@ ating on a work of art en@@ ta@@ il@@ s : ef@@ for@@ t , comp@@ r@@ om@@ ise , pati@@ ence , shar@@ ed go@@ als ."
"These ideas al@@ ig@@ n n@@ ic@@ e@@ ly with our cul@@ tur@@ al inve@@ st@@ ment in lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m r@@ om@@ an@@ tic comm@@ it@@ ment , but they also work well for other kinds of relation@@ shi@@ ps — sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m , ca@@ su@@ al , pol@@ y@@ am@@ or@@ ous , non@@ -@@ mono@@ ga@@ m@@ ous , a@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al — because this me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or br@@ ings much more complex ideas to the experience of lo@@ ving someone ."
"So if love is a col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative work of art , then love is an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience ."
"L@@ o@@ ve is un@@ predic@@ table , love is cre@@ ative , love requ@@ i@@ res communic@@ ation and dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , it is fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ating and emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally de@@ man@@ ding ."
And love inv@@ ol@@ ves both jo@@ y and pa@@ in .
"@@ U@@ l@@ t@@ ima@@ tely , each experience of love is different ."
"When I was youn@@ ger , it never oc@@ cur@@ red to me that I was allo@@ wed to de@@ m@@ and more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just ac@@ cept whatever love o@@ ffe@@ red ."
"When 1@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old J@@ u@@ li@@ et first mee@@ ts — or , when 1@@ 4@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old J@@ u@@ li@@ et cannot be with R@@ ome@@ o , wh@@ om she has met four days ago , she does not feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted or an@@ g@@ st@@ y ."
W@@ here is she ?
She wan@@ ts to die .
Right ?
"And just as a re@@ f@@ re@@ sh@@ er , at this point in the play , act three of five , R@@ ome@@ o is not de@@ ad ."
"He &apos;s al@@ ive , he &apos;s heal@@ thy , he &apos;s just been ban@@ i@@ shed from the city ."
"I understand that 1@@ 6@@ th@@ -@@ century V@@ er@@ on@@ a is un@@ like con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary Nor@@ th America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , J@@ u@@ li@@ et &apos;s su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing made sense to me ."
"@@ Re@@ fr@@ am@@ ing love as something I get to create with someone I ad@@ m@@ ire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or con@@ sen@@ t , is em@@ power@@ ing ."
It &apos;s still hard .
"L@@ o@@ ve still feel@@ s tot@@ ally ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing and c@@ ru@@ shing some days , and when I feel really fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted , I have to re@@ mind myself : my job in this relation@@ ship is to talk to my part@@ ner about what I want to make together ."
"This isn &apos;t easy , ei@@ ther ."
"But it &apos;s just so much better than the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative , which is that thing that feel@@ s like ma@@ d@@ ness ."
This ver@@ sion of love is not about win@@ ning or l@@ os@@ ing someone &apos;s a@@ ffe@@ ction .
"I@@ n@@ stead , it requ@@ i@@ res that you tr@@ ust your part@@ ner and talk about things when tr@@ us@@ ting feel@@ s difficult , which soun@@ ds so simple , but is actually a kind of re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary , ra@@ d@@ ical act ."
"This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re ga@@ ining or l@@ os@@ ing in your relation@@ ship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to off@@ er ."
"This ver@@ sion of love allo@@ ws us to say things like , &quot; H@@ ey , we &apos;re not very good col@@ lab@@ or@@ at@@ ors . Ma@@ ybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;"
"O@@ r , &quot; &quot; That relation@@ ship was sh@@ or@@ ter than I had plan@@ ned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative work of art is that it will not pa@@ int or dra@@ w or sc@@ ul@@ pt itself ."
This ver@@ sion of love allo@@ ws us to de@@ ci@@ de what it looks like .
Thank you .

I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
"And not f@@ ro@@ zen water , and not water in a ga@@ se@@ ous state , but li@@ qu@@ id water ."
So that lea@@ ves a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem simp@@ ler for ourselves .
You have to be very care@@ ful with that at@@ mos@@ p@@ here .
They &apos;re not st@@ ati@@ c things . They change .
They v@@ ary . They ev@@ ol@@ ve .
And at@@ mos@@ p@@ he@@ res do the same .
"Well , one idea is it es@@ cap@@ ed away to space ."
C@@ ome@@ ts have ta@@ il@@ s that are incredi@@ bly vis@@ i@@ ble re@@ min@@ ders of at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e .
A second way they can get energy is from the sol@@ ar win@@ d .
"This is something that I &apos;m interested in , because it re@@ la@@ tes to ha@@ bit@@ ability ."
"And of course , dis@@ tan@@ ce of a planet from the sun de@@ ter@@ min@@ es its tem@@ per@@ ature ."
This has to play into ha@@ bit@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
"If you have a comp@@ as@@ s , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
The sa@@ il@@ s may ga@@ ther energy from the sol@@ ar win@@ d .
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ en@@ ced them , it &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"And fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally as well , but dee@@ p@@ ly ."
"We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from kno@@ wing of zer@@ o plan@@ e@@ ts outside of our sol@@ ar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to inve@@ st@@ ig@@ ate first ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red s@@ po@@ t , right here ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s ha@@ bit@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
"But for now , this is the only ha@@ bit@@ able planet , and this is our red s@@ po@@ t ."

I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ in@@ k about everything it has br@@ ought us .
"Th@@ in@@ k about all the serv@@ ices we use , all the conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ ity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the comm@@ er@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history book@@ s hundre@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be re@@ mem@@ be@@ red as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very seri@@ ous problems , problems with se@@ cur@@ ity and problems with pri@@ v@@ acy ."
I &apos;ve spent my care@@ er f@@ igh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k in@@ fe@@ cted by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first v@@ iru@@ s we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot se@@ c@@ tor of an in@@ fe@@ cted flo@@ pp@@ y , and if we take a clo@@ ser look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ u@@ es , saying , 198@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first nam@@ es , P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan@@ i first nam@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 198@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C v@@ iru@@ s problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photo@@ s I took while I was in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan ."
"This is from the city of La@@ h@@ ore , which is around 3@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters sou@@ th from A@@ b@@ bot@@ ta@@ bad , where B@@ in La@@ den was ca@@ ught ."
Here &apos;s a typ@@ ical stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad le@@ ad@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am blo@@ ck at A@@ ll@@ ama I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who open@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wr@@ ote the first P@@ C v@@ iru@@ s .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting dis@@ cus@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters in@@ fe@@ cted do@@ zen@@ s of times by completely un@@ re@@ la@@ ted other v@@ iru@@ ses over these years .
So there is some sort of j@@ us@@ tic@@ e in the world after all .
"Now , the v@@ iru@@ ses that we used to see in the 198@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run age@@ -@@ old pro@@ gr@@ ams on a mo@@ der@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a l@@ ist of old v@@ iru@@ ses .
So let me just run some v@@ iru@@ ses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de v@@ iru@@ s first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a cen@@ ti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ lling across your computer when you get in@@ fe@@ cted by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted because it actually shows up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the v@@ iru@@ s called C@@ r@@ as@@ h , inven@@ ted in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ ren no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ ker v@@ iru@@ s does ?"
"@@ Yes , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get in@@ fe@@ cted ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re in@@ fe@@ cted by a v@@ iru@@ s , when the v@@ iru@@ ses were writ@@ ten by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being writ@@ ten by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , v@@ iru@@ ses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the bac@@ k@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack v@@ iru@@ s in@@ fe@@ c@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just b@@ loc@@ ked v@@ iru@@ ses in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ ai@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conne@@ ct back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many v@@ iru@@ ses , how many new exam@@ ples of ma@@ l@@ ware we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the la@@ test v@@ iru@@ s we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hundre@@ ds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of ma@@ l@@ ware every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cr@@ im@@ inal gan@@ gs wr@@ iting these v@@ iru@@ ses because they make money with their v@@ iru@@ ses ."
It &apos;s gan@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ an@@ g@@ sta@@ B@@ u@@ c@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a v@@ iru@@ s writ@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of in@@ fe@@ c@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can se@@ ll those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pa@@ y you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ et@@ ize those in@@ fe@@ cted compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"@@ K@@ ey@@ log@@ g@@ ers sil@@ ently s@@ it on your computer , hid@@ den from view , and they recor@@ d everything you typ@@ e ."
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google sear@@ ches .
E@@ very single Google search you typ@@ e is sa@@ ved and sen@@ t to the cr@@ im@@ in@@ als .
E@@ very single e@@ ma@@ il you write is sa@@ ved and sen@@ t to the cr@@ im@@ in@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are ses@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ cha@@ ses in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"Because when you do pur@@ cha@@ ses in on@@ line sto@@ res , you will be typ@@ ing in your name , the de@@ li@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number and the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard se@@ cur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the ex@@ p@@ ir@@ ation date , that &apos;s the se@@ cur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the o@@ w@@ ner of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you ga@@ in access to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y whatever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground marke@@ t@@ place and business e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem built around on@@ line cr@@ ime .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ et@@ iz@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pa@@ ges of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted per@@ s@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in , or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his part@@ ner in cr@@ ime , also lis@@ ted on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted pa@@ ges , M@@ r@@ . S@@ ha@@ il@@ e@@ sh@@ ku@@ ma@@ r J@@ a@@ in , a U.S@@ . c@@ it@@ izen ."
"These guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cr@@ ime oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted mil@@ lions ."
They are both right now on the run .
N@@ ob@@ o@@ dy kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.S@@ . of@@ fici@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ t be@@ lon@@ ging to M@@ r@@ . J@@ a@@ in , and that ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S@@ . dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cr@@ ime gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als can actually af@@ for@@ d to inve@@ st into their atta@@ cks .
"We know that on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als are hir@@ ing pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ers , hir@@ ing te@@ sting people , te@@ sting their co@@ de , having bac@@ k@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L d@@ ata@@ ba@@ ses ."
And they can af@@ for@@ d to wat@@ ch how we work — like how se@@ cur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any se@@ cur@@ ity pre@@ ca@@ u@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ anta@@ ge .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ l@@ ari@@ fied N@@ et@@ works , which ill@@ us@@ tra@@ tes how one single ma@@ l@@ ware family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is tried to shu@@ t down ."
So you just can &apos;t shu@@ t these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally pol@@ ice oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ ke@@ ts to all the on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als of the world .
"Now , cr@@ im@@ in@@ als who we@@ ren &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one ex@@ plo@@ it fi@@ le .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x d@@ um@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an ex@@ plo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image he@@ a@@ der , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the atta@@ ck star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s de@@ cr@@ yp@@ t it ."
It has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ ction 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start de@@ cr@@ yp@@ ting it .
Well the ye@@ l@@ low part of the co@@ de is now de@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the or@@ ig@@ inal ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that pro@@ gram .
And that &apos;s a bac@@ k@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more intere@@ st@@ ing@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue de@@ cr@@ yp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goo@@ g@@ led for it .
I got zer@@ o hit@@ s ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ oke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them men@@ tion@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone num@@ bers and car l@@ ic@@ en@@ se pla@@ tes and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for con@@ ta@@ cts in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and he run@@ s a blo@@ g under the pop@@ ular L@@ ive J@@ our@@ nal ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very n@@ ice car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er en@@ gine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a n@@ ice car for a 20@@ -@@ something ye@@ ar-@@ old ki@@ d in S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he b@@ log@@ ged about the car .
He actually had a car acc@@ ident .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn S@@ t@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cra@@ shed his car into another car ."
And he put b@@ log@@ ged images about the car acc@@ ident — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the La@@ da S@@ am@@ ara he cra@@ shed into .
And you can actually see that the l@@ ic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ara ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als are ca@@ ught ?"
Well in most ca@@ ses it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cr@@ ime ca@@ ses , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the atta@@ cks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cr@@ im@@ in@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local pol@@ ice don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough ev@@ idence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be eas@@ i@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chan@@ ging at a very rap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it in@@ fe@@ cted these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ e@@ men@@ s S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , pro@@ gr@@ am@@ ma@@ ble logi@@ c &#91; contro@@ l@@ ler &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our inf@@ ra@@ structure .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are pro@@ gr@@ am@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the ele@@ v@@ at@@ ors in this building most like@@ ly are contro@@ ll@@ ed by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net in@@ fe@@ cts one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive re@@ v@@ olution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cr@@ it@@ ical inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ tory , any power plant , any chem@@ ical plant , any food pro@@ ces@@ sing plant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is re@@ li@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very re@@ li@@ ant on Internet , on bas@@ ic things like electr@@ ic@@ ity , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters f@@ ai@@ l .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ p@@ are@@ d@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gr@@ an@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ ku@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ in@@ k about all the serv@@ ices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ in@@ k about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cr@@ ime .
O@@ n@@ line cr@@ ime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t f@@ ight on@@ line cr@@ ime , we are run@@ ning a risk of l@@ os@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment work to find on@@ line cr@@ im@@ inal gan@@ gs — these organiz@@ ed gan@@ gs that are making mil@@ lions out of their atta@@ cks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning an@@ ti@@ -@@ v@@ iru@@ ses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ all@@ s .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these atta@@ cks , and even more importan@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cr@@ ime , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the s@@ kill@@ s , but without the opportun@@ ities and give them the opportun@@ ities to use their s@@ kill@@ s for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chan@@ ging with really re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ je@@ c@@ tions sug@@ gest that the Chin@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s pro@@ je@@ cted that the Chin@@ ese economy will be t@@ w@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the In@@ di@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these pro@@ je@@ c@@ tions were dra@@ wn up before the W@@ es@@ tern fin@@ an@@ cial cr@@ is@@ is .
"A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the la@@ test pro@@ je@@ ction by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ je@@ cted 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The pos@@ t-@@ cr@@ is@@ is pro@@ je@@ ction is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a deca@@ de away .
China is going to change the world in two fund@@ amen@@ tal re@@ spe@@ cts .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a huge develop@@ ing country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been gro@@ wing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a deca@@ de , it will have the lar@@ gest economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the mo@@ der@@ n era has the lar@@ gest economy in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , rather than a develop@@ ed country ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , for the first time in the mo@@ der@@ n era , the dom@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ational ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a w@@ ide@@ spre@@ ad as@@ sum@@ ption in the W@@ est that as countries mo@@ der@@ ni@@ ze , they also w@@ es@@ ter@@ ni@@ ze ."
This is an ill@@ us@@ ion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ sum@@ ption that mo@@ der@@ n@@ ity is a produ@@ ct simply of compe@@ t@@ ition , marke@@ ts and technology ."
It is not . It is also sh@@ ap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"C@@ hin@@ a is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very fund@@ amen@@ tal re@@ spe@@ cts very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ ven@@ ti@@ onal appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ es@@ tern terms , using W@@ es@@ tern ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three building b@@ loc@@ ks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state for the last hun@@ d@@ red years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the v@@ ic@@ tory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state peri@@ od — the bir@@ th of mo@@ der@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es of mo@@ der@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ies most of what we now know as E@@ as@@ tern China , which is where the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of Chin@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is ex@@ tra@@ ordinary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Chin@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Chin@@ ese , comes not from the last hun@@ d@@ red years , not from the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state peri@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the peri@@ od , if you like , of the ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cus@@ tom@@ s like an@@ ce@@ str@@ al wor@@ ship , of a very dis@@ tin@@ ctive not@@ ion of the state , like@@ w@@ ise , a very dis@@ tin@@ ctive not@@ ion of the family , social relation@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an val@@ u@@ es and so on ."
These are all things that come from the peri@@ od of the ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ es@@ tern sta@@ tes and most countries in the world , is sh@@ ap@@ ed by its sense of ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , its ex@@ is@@ ten@@ ce as a ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than as a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ically and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ically , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really a@@ ware of is the fact that China is extre@@ me@@ ly di@@ verse and very pl@@ ur@@ al@@ is@@ tic , and in many ways very dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations ."
I &apos;ll give you two qu@@ ick ones .
"The first is that the most important polit@@ ical val@@ ue for the Chin@@ ese is un@@ ity , is the ma@@ inte@@ nan@@ ce of Chin@@ ese ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Eur@@ ope : bre@@ ak@@ down — the f@@ ra@@ g@@ men@@ tation of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ o@@ man E@@ m@@ p@@ ire ."
"It di@@ v@@ ided , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined di@@ v@@ ided ever since ."
"C@@ hin@@ a , over the same time peri@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite di@@ re@@ ction , very pain@@ fully ho@@ l@@ ding this huge ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pr@@ os@@ ai@@ c , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
D@@ o you remember the han@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by B@@ r@@ ita@@ in to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Chin@@ ese con@@ st@@ itu@@ ti@@ onal pro@@ pos@@ ition was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll la@@ y a wa@@ ger that b@@ are@@ ly any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ do@@ w dre@@ s@@ sing .
"When China gets its hands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the polit@@ ical and le@@ ga@@ l system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ in@@ k of G@@ er@@ man uni@@ fic@@ ation , 199@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state men@@ tal@@ ity .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ ai@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me off@@ er you another building blo@@ ck to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ table one .
"The Chin@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of r@@ ace to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Chin@@ ese , over 90 percent of them think they be@@ long to the same r@@ ace , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most pop@@ ul@@ ous countries ."
"I@@ n@@ dia , the United States , In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il — all of them are mul@@ t@@ ir@@ ac@@ i@@ al ."
The Chin@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only mul@@ t@@ ir@@ ac@@ i@@ al really at the mar@@ gin@@ s .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , essen@@ ti@@ ally is , again , back to the ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ ption , as@@ sim@@ il@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this not@@ ion of the H@@ an em@@ er@@ ged — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a gro@@ wing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tur@@ al iden@@ t@@ ity ."
"Now the great adv@@ anta@@ ge of this his@@ tor@@ ical experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have he@@ ld together ."
The H@@ an iden@@ t@@ ity has been the ce@@ ment which has he@@ ld this country together .
The great dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tur@@ al difference .
"They really believe in their own super@@ i@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ t@@ itu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ g@@ h@@ ur@@ s and to the T@@ i@@ be@@ tan@@ s ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building blo@@ ck , the Chin@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly see@@ m to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and le@@ g@@ it@@ ima@@ cy of the state is a fun@@ ction of demo@@ cr@@ acy .
The problem with this pro@@ pos@@ ition is that the Chin@@ ese state en@@ jo@@ ys more le@@ g@@ it@@ ima@@ cy and more au@@ th@@ or@@ ity am@@ on@@ g@@ st the Chin@@ ese than is true with any W@@ es@@ tern state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with demo@@ cr@@ acy , because in our terms the Chin@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very speci@@ al — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very speci@@ al sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance as the re@@ presen@@ t@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ d@@ im@@ ent and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Chin@@ ese ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , of the ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , whe@@ re@@ as in Eur@@ ope and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously challen@@ ged — I mean in the Eur@@ ope@@ an tra@@ d@@ ition , his@@ tor@@ ically against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other se@@ c@@ tors of the ar@@ is@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Chin@@ ese state has not been challen@@ ged ."
It &apos;s had no seri@@ ous ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ struc@@ ted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ es@@ tern history .
"The resu@@ lt , by the way , is that the Chin@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"W@@ he@@ re@@ as we te@@ nd to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a st@@ ran@@ ger , cer@@ tain@@ ly an or@@ gan wh@@ ose po@@ wers need to be lim@@ ited or de@@ fin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Chin@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Chin@@ ese view the state as an in@@ t@@ imate — not just as an in@@ t@@ imate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Chin@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to our@@ s ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would sug@@ gest to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Chin@@ ese con@@ text , is a new kind of para@@ dig@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ da@@ m S@@ mit@@ h , already wr@@ iting in the l@@ ate 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chin@@ ese market is lar@@ ger and more develop@@ ed and more s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated than anything in Eur@@ ope . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the Ma@@ o peri@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is com@@ b@@ ined with an extre@@ me@@ ly str@@ ong and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s le@@ ad@@ ing fir@@ ms — many of them are still pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ly o@@ w@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , ho@@ we@@ ver large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , de@@ p@@ end in many ways on state pat@@ r@@ ona@@ ge ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ th@@ or@@ ity flo@@ ws into lots of other areas — as we are famil@@ i@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child pol@@ ic@@ y ."
"M@@ ore@@ over , this is a very old state tra@@ d@@ ition , a very old tra@@ d@@ ition of sta@@ te@@ cra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an ill@@ us@@ tr@@ ation of this , the G@@ re@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ struc@@ ted in the first in@@ stan@@ ce in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ ven@@ th century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 14 mil@@ es , lin@@ king B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with H@@ an@@ g@@ z@@ hou and S@@ han@@ g@@ hai ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of ex@@ tra@@ ordinary state inf@@ ra@@ struc@@ tur@@ al pro@@ jects in China , which I supp@@ ose hel@@ ps us to expla@@ in what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ or@@ ges D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state compe@@ ten@@ ce within China ."
"So there we have three building b@@ loc@@ ks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , the not@@ ion of r@@ ace and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ s@@ ist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on W@@ es@@ tern experience , looking at it through W@@ es@@ tern eyes , using W@@ es@@ tern con@@ cep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ing@@ ly see@@ m to get China wrong — our predic@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ re@@ ct — this is the reason .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ t@@ itu@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little W@@ es@@ ter@@ ner men@@ tal@@ ity ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and the@@ re@@ fore we have the uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l me@@ a@@ sure ."
"And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ig@@ nor@@ ant ."
We re@@ f@@ use to really ad@@ dre@@ ss the issue of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pas@@ sage in a book by P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ hen , the American his@@ tori@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ hen ar@@ gu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most cos@@ mo@@ polit@@ an of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ chi@@ al , because for 200 years , the W@@ est has been so dom@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if ne@@ cess@@ ary by force , get its own way ."
"W@@ he@@ re@@ as those cul@@ tures — v@@ ir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ ak@@ er pos@@ ition , vis@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been the@@ re@@ by for@@ ced to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s presen@@ ce in those soci@@ e@@ ties ."
"And the@@ re@@ fore , they are , as a resu@@ lt , more cos@@ mo@@ polit@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , K@@ ore@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the lar@@ gest economic reg@@ ion in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the present ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"What is happening is that , very rap@@ i@@ dly in his@@ tor@@ ical terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sh@@ ap@@ ed , not by the old develop@@ ed countries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 u@@ sur@@ ping very rap@@ i@@ dly the pos@@ ition of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is rap@@ i@@ dly l@@ os@@ ing its inf@@ lu@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ ma@@ tic ill@@ us@@ tr@@ ation of this actually a year ago — C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen , climate change con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce ."
Eur@@ ope was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ got@@ i@@ ating table .
W@@ hen did that last happen ?
I would wa@@ ger it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second im@@ plic@@ ation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ famil@@ i@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sh@@ ap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and his@@ tor@@ ies that we are not really famil@@ i@@ ar with , or con@@ vers@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Eur@@ ope ; America is sl@@ igh@@ tly different — but Eur@@ ope@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ nor@@ ant , are un@@ a@@ ware about the way the world is chan@@ ging ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an En@@ gl@@ ish friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is s@@ le@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ v@@ ion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Eur@@ ope is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of tou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of l@@ oss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Eur@@ ope once , of course , once com@@ man@@ ded the future in its con@@ f@@ idence ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to tas@@ te the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the l@@ ik@@ es of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ han &#93; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tra@@ ins .
China already has a big@@ ger net@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out sh@@ or@@ tly in a sub@@ ur@@ b of B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere you have a me@@ ga@@ bu@@ s , on the u@@ pp@@ er de@@ ck car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It tra@@ ve@@ ls on ra@@ il@@ s down a sub@@ ur@@ ban ro@@ ad , and the c@@ ars tra@@ vel under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ e@@ ds of up to about 100 mil@@ es an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Eur@@ ope and different from the United States : China has huge num@@ bers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solution to a s@@ itu@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ t@@ itu@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very rap@@ i@@ dly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gu@@ e , ab@@ o@@ ve all , a big@@ -@@ picture pos@@ itive for this world ."
"For 200 years , the world was essen@@ ti@@ ally gover@@ ned by a f@@ ra@@ g@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Eur@@ ope and Nor@@ th America re@@ presen@@ ted .
"The ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ don@@ es@@ ia and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and so on , re@@ present the most important single act of demo@@ cr@@ at@@ iz@@ ation in the last 200 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vil@@ iz@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not lis@@ ten@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of re@@ presen@@ tation in this world ."
"As hum@@ an@@ ists , we must we@@ l@@ come , su@@ rely , this trans@@ formation , and we will have to learn about these ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one sa@@ il@@ ed in by Z@@ hen@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great vo@@ y@@ ag@@ es around the S@@ ou@@ th China S@@ ea , the E@@ ast China S@@ ea and across the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Ch@@ ris@@ to@@ ph@@ er C@@ ol@@ um@@ bu@@ s cr@@ os@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look care@@ fully at this sil@@ k sc@@ ro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ hou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re pla@@ ying go@@ l@@ f .
"C@@ h@@ r@@ ist , the Chin@@ ese even inven@@ ted go@@ l@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ v@@ olution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into son@@ g , or you pic@@ k a fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite col@@ or , I want to de@@ f@@ ine what I mean by re@@ v@@ olution ."
"B@@ y re@@ v@@ olution , I mean a dra@@ stic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a re@@ v@@ olution ?"
We need a re@@ v@@ olution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us not living up to our poten@@ tial ."
I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Eur@@ ope in innov@@ ation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ to@@ m , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t val@@ ue innov@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of we@@ ll@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Eur@@ ope , at the very bot@@ to@@ m ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ con@@ om@@ ist ."
"We &apos;re the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st place on Earth , rel@@ ative to G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ ita — the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
W@@ here do we ran@@ k three weeks ago in another re@@ por@@ t by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , ma@@ th and science . L@@ ast ."
B@@ us@@ iness : The lo@@ we@@ st per@@ cep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s pro@@ vi@@ de ben@@ ef@@ its to society .
"W@@ hy as a resu@@ lt , what happens ?"
The lo@@ we@@ st per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ s star@@ ting bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses .
And this is de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the en@@ gine of econom@@ ies .
We h@@ ire the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our en@@ gine &apos;s br@@ ok@@ en , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Eur@@ ope G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ ita .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no sur@@ pr@@ ise , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy I have got against B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is br@@ ok@@ en ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is br@@ ok@@ en ."
"We need a dra@@ stic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be pos@@ itive now . We &apos;re going to get pos@@ itive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dra@@ stic to some of you — because we are han@@ dic@@ app@@ ing ourselves .
We &apos;re ho@@ l@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , ad@@ ul@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"In fact , we de@@ val@@ ue play ."
And we de@@ val@@ ue it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
S@@ o@@ cial : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f commun@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individu@@ al and squ@@ a@@ shing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly , cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity , individu@@ al self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and innov@@ ation ."
"And instead , what do we val@@ ue ?"
"Because it &apos;s sho@@ wn the way we app@@ ly , gener@@ ate and use knowledge is a@@ ffe@@ cted by our social and institu@@ ti@@ onal con@@ text , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?"
T@@ o be seri@@ ous .
"T@@ o be really , really seri@@ ous ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e seri@@ ous .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the par@@ k for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ a@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d they play in the d@@ ir@@ t , the ka@@ l , or even wor@@ se , l@@ ok@@ v@@ i , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and d@@ ya@@ do@@ s that we shou@@ ldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is seri@@ ous and we need to tra@@ in them for the seri@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a seri@@ ous me@@ me run@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e run@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a seri@@ ous gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a bab@@ y . I@@ s@@ ka@@ m bab@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the bab@@ y . W@@ oo@@ ho@@ o !@@ "
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to fur@@ ther my care@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ ffe@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been in@@ fe@@ cted by the seri@@ ous me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"S@@ he pas@@ ses that v@@ iru@@ s on to bab@@ y , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ wo@@ od tre@@ es — for that seri@@ ous me@@ me to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ u@@ es r@@ ote learning , memor@@ iz@@ ation and stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and de@@ val@@ u@@ es self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , self-@@ expl@@ or@@ ation , quest@@ i@@ on@@ ing , cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and play ."
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my ki@@ d .
We went to this pre@@ st@@ ig@@ ious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study ma@@ th 10 times a week and science e@@ ight times a week and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and re@@ cess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cr@@ ime . What a cr@@ ime ."
"And it &apos;s a cr@@ ime that our education system is so seri@@ ous because education is seri@@ ous that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ d@@ less , robot@@ ic wor@@ kers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ d@@ r@@ ill@@ ed ho@@ les ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ d@@ us@@ tri@@ al R@@ ev@@ olution ."
"We need ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ bility , the ability to learn how to be cre@@ ative and innov@@ ative ."
We don &apos;t need me@@ chan@@ ized wor@@ kers .
"But no , now our me@@ me goes into work where we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"We create robot@@ ic wor@@ kers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to le@@ ver and just th@@ row away ."
What are qu@@ al@@ ities of a B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ an work ?
A@@ uto@@ cr@@ ati@@ c — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ oss and I know better than you .
"@@ U@@ n@@ tr@@ us@@ ting — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a cr@@ im@@ inal , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all c@@ amer@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ tro@@ lling — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ illion little pro@@ ces@@ ses for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t step out of the box ."
"So they &apos;re re@@ str@@ ic@@ tive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bi@@ le phone , don &apos;t use your l@@ ap@@ top , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill@@ ing because you &apos;re contro@@ ll@@ ed , you &apos;re re@@ str@@ ic@@ ted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fun ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous , S@@ te@@ ve . What a d@@ um@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"@@ Just play , that &apos;s a stu@@ pi@@ d thing . &quot; &quot; We have the seri@@ ous me@@ me in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ e@@ ch — that play is the c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the re@@ v@@ olution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria for the better ."
P@@ la@@ y : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ v@@ olution has se@@ lec@@ ted , over mil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of years , for play in animals and in humans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ v@@ olution does a really , really good job of de@@ se@@ lec@@ ting tra@@ its that ar@@ en &apos;t adv@@ anta@@ ge@@ ous to us and se@@ lec@@ ting tra@@ its for compe@@ t@@ itive adv@@ anta@@ ge ."
"N@@ ature isn &apos;t stu@@ pi@@ d , and it se@@ lec@@ ted for play ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough@@ out the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , for example : an@@ ts . An@@ ts play ."
Ma@@ ybe you didn &apos;t know that .
"But when they &apos;re pla@@ ying , they &apos;re learning the social order and d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics of things ."
"@@ R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that r@@ ats that play more have big@@ ger bra@@ ins and they learn tas@@ ks better , s@@ kill@@ s ."
K@@ it@@ ten@@ s play . We all know kit@@ ten@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that kit@@ ten@@ s de@@ pri@@ ved of play are un@@ able to inter@@ act soci@@ ally .
"They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
Be@@ ars play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more survi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sho@@ wn , a cor@@ rel@@ ation between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the big@@ ger the bra@@ ins there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big bra@@ ins , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the big@@ gest bra@@ ins are the big@@ gest pla@@ y@@ ers ?
Y@@ our@@ s tru@@ ly : humans .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds play , we play — of every n@@ ation@@ ality , of every r@@ ace , of every col@@ or , of every rel@@ ig@@ ion ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s ad@@ ul@@ ts too ."
Re@@ ally c@@ ool ter@@ m : ne@@ o@@ ten@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in ad@@ ul@@ ts .
And who are the big@@ gest ne@@ o@@ ten@@ ists ?
H@@ um@@ ans . We play sp@@ or@@ ts .
"We do it for fun , or as O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ ans , or as pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ als ."
We play mus@@ ical in@@ stru@@ ments .
"We dan@@ ce , we kis@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop pla@@ ying .
It is a huge ben@@ ef@@ it .
"@@ Just like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its to humans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sho@@ wn to st@@ im@@ ul@@ ate neur@@ al growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , in the area where it contro@@ ls emot@@ ions ."
It &apos;s been sho@@ wn to pr@@ omot@@ e pre@@ -@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of co@@ g@@ nit@@ ion is happening .
"As a resu@@ lt , what happens ?"
We develo@@ p more emot@@ i@@ onal mat@@ ur@@ ity if we play more .
We develo@@ p better decis@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s co@@ ld , hard science ."
These are the ben@@ ef@@ its to play .
"It is a gen@@ e@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ aking or seeing ."
"And if we han@@ dic@@ a@@ p ourselves with play , we han@@ dic@@ a@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We hold ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ ma@@ gine a world without the@@ a@@ ter , without the ar@@ ts , without son@@ g , without dan@@ cing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , without la@@ ughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ lea@@ k .
It &apos;s pretty g@@ lu@@ m .
Now imagine your wor@@ k@@ place .
I@@ s it fun ? I@@ s it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re for@@ ward thinking .
I@@ s it fun ? I@@ s it pla@@ y@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cra@@ p ? I@@ s it au@@ to@@ cr@@ ati@@ c , contro@@ lling , re@@ str@@ ic@@ tive and un@@ tr@@ us@@ ting and un@@ fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill@@ ing ?"
We have this con@@ cept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen pla@@ ying at work .
"&quot; Oh , my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es see me la@@ ugh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ oss might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is bac@@ k@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is de@@ pres@@ sion . It &apos;s de@@ pres@@ sion .
"In fact , play impro@@ ves our work ."
"@@ Just like there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for humans and animals , there &apos;s ben@@ ef@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it st@@ im@@ ul@@ ates cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity ."
It incre@@ a@@ ses our open@@ ness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It pro@@ v@@ ide@@ s a sense of pur@@ p@@ ose and mas@@ ter@@ y — two key mot@@ i@@ v@@ ational things that incre@@ ase produc@@ tiv@@ ity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not seri@@ ous , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous ."
"You know , the pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal a@@ th@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s seri@@ ous about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A doc@@ tor might be seri@@ ous , but la@@ ughter &apos;s still a great me@@ dic@@ ine ."
O@@ ur thinking is bac@@ k@@ wards .
We shou@@ ldn &apos;t be feel@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be ce@@ le@@ br@@ ating play .
Q@@ u@@ ick example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy motto : people , serv@@ ice , pro@@ f@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er , they &apos;re fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , they have a sense of mas@@ ter@@ y and pur@@ p@@ ose ."
"What happens ? They give better serv@@ ice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cus@@ tom@@ ers call for serv@@ ice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make decis@@ ions and are fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , how do the cus@@ tom@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cus@@ tom@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feel@@ ing cus@@ tom@@ ers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your serv@@ ice and they tell more of their friends , which lea@@ ds to more pro@@ f@@ it ."
"@@ People , serv@@ ice , pro@@ f@@ it ."
"P@@ la@@ y incre@@ a@@ ses produc@@ tiv@@ ity , not de@@ cre@@ a@@ ses ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria ."
"@@ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria , you guys . T@@ wo reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , be@@ side@@ s the seri@@ ous me@@ me that we have to k@@ ick out ."
"T@@ wo , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had zer@@ o happy cus@@ tom@@ ers ."
N@@ ot one cus@@ tom@@ er would re@@ fer us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ f@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ gin@@ al pro@@ f@@ its , and we had un@@ happy st@@ ake@@ ho@@ l@@ ders ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough some bas@@ ic change , change like impro@@ ving trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , change like pr@@ omot@@ ing self-@@ di@@ re@@ ction and col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , the things like having a resu@@ l@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ foc@@ us ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the mor@@ ning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cus@@ tom@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at nin@@ e o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ?
B@@ as@@ ically pr@@ omot@@ ing fun .
"Th@@ r@@ ough pr@@ omot@@ ing fun and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three sh@@ ort years — soun@@ ds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cus@@ tom@@ er , from zer@@ o to every cus@@ tom@@ er re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing us , ab@@ o@@ ve a@@ verage pro@@ f@@ its for the indus@@ try and happy st@@ ake@@ ho@@ l@@ ders ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ te@@ red , one of the ran@@ kin@@ gs for best em@@ plo@@ y@@ er for small business ."
In@@ depen@@ den@@ t an@@ al@@ ys@@ is from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ aria ."
"There &apos;s nothing ho@@ l@@ ding us back , ex@@ cept our own men@@ tal@@ ity about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this re@@ v@@ olution through play .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the feel@@ ing of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"W@@ ha@@ tever it was that as a ki@@ d you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ yed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pr@@ omot@@ ion you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be seri@@ ous , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain b@@ ik@@ ing or read@@ ing a book or pla@@ ying a game .
"@@ Re@@ disco@@ ver that because you &apos;re the lea@@ ders , the innov@@ ation lea@@ ders , the thought lea@@ ders ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your friends and ig@@ n@@ ite the fir@@ e of change in the play re@@ v@@ olution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feel@@ ing it , your col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , your em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."

Because it &apos;s by challen@@ ging the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the ru@@ t that we &apos;re in and create innov@@ ative solu@@ tions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as lea@@ ders .
We &apos;re going to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate fe@@ ar .
F@@ e@@ ar is the en@@ e@@ my of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like el@@ im@@ in@@ ate re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bi@@ le phone for person@@ al call@@ s — he@@ a@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on inst@@ ant mes@@ sen@@ g@@ ers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ches .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the re@@ cess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"@@ Let them do it . G@@ ive them some f@@ ree@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have fun at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s supp@@ o@@ sed to be , what , a mi@@ ser@@ able gr@@ in@@ d , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; U@@ n@@ ac@@ cep@@ table . N@@ e@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a dra@@ stic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; re@@ v@@ olution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; re@@ v@@ olution .
What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing . What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing . What we need is a pla@@ y@@ ers &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing .

"So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a free no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life ha@@ ck , and all it requ@@ i@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sma@@ l@@ ler ?
S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es we hold onto our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es we spre@@ ad out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pa@@ y atten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ c@@ ina@@ ted with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ul@@ arly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ shak@@ e ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ im@@ es .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communic@@ ation ."
"When we think about communic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fe@@ ren@@ ces from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or pr@@ omot@@ e , who we ask out on a date ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ m@@ ba@@ dy , a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts U@@ ni@@ versity , shows that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second soun@@ d@@ less c@@ li@@ ps of real phys@@ ic@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the phys@@ ic@@ ian &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that phys@@ ic@@ ian will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . Right ?"
"We are also inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our th@@ ough@@ ts and our feel@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist . I study pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice , and I te@@ ach at a compe@@ t@@ itive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interested in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I became es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interested in non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the anima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , they are about ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically open@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about open@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ s@@ ica T@@ r@@ acy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we te@@ nd to make ourselves sma@@ l@@ ler . We don &apos;t mir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavior in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of spre@@ ad out ."
"You have other people who are v@@ ir@@ tually col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more like@@ ly to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ ron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because partic@@ ip@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business s@@ cho@@ ols have been stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , oka@@ y , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re partic@@ ip@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some ev@@ idence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mi@@ le by ho@@ l@@ ding a p@@ en in our tee@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people te@@ nd to be , not sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ f@@ ident , more op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at ga@@ m@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differen@@ ces . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lea@@ der that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this ev@@ idence , both that the body can sh@@ ape the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can sh@@ ape the mind ."
"So what happens , oka@@ y , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tin@@ y man@@ ip@@ ulation , this tin@@ y inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power po@@ ses .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ c@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l .
"So it seem@@ s that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative s@@ itu@@ ations , like social thre@@ at s@@ itu@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being he@@ c@@ k@@ led ."
People h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ in@@ d to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ in@@ d to the con@@ diti@@ ons .
It &apos;s about the presen@@ ce that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ e@@ ch .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effe@@ ct , or medi@@ ating the effe@@ ct ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it t@@ ill you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an imp@@ os@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car acc@@ ident ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ ll@@ ed se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had iden@@ ti@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of col@@ le@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish col@@ le@@ ge ."
I am an imp@@ os@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to sta@@ y , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ ike , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"L@@ ike , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it t@@ ill you make it ."
F@@ ake it t@@ ill you become it .
D@@ o it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y t@@ we@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ wo minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l down .

"@@ Be@@ au L@@ otto : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , th@@ ree@@ .@@ A@@ u@@ dience : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ maz@@ ing . What about this one ? One , two , th@@ ree@@ .@@ A@@ u@@ dience : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ t@@ ug@@ ue@@ se , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
A@@ u@@ dience : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?"
"It liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ Right ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ ing@@ less information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was u@@ se@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? W@@ h@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ideo ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ yed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our h@@ op@@ es , our dre@@ ams , the clo@@ the@@ s we we@@ ar , f@@ all@@ ing in love , everything begin@@ s with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s problem , because how can we ever see differen@@ tly ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differen@@ tly , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions be@@ gin in the same way ."
They be@@ gin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ as@@ ick@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"@@ Right ? If you go down be@@ low on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in reg@@ is@@ ter with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m standing still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dan@@ ger@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the iron@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tun@@ ately , ev@@ olution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life be@@ gin , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ yon@@ d the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pp@@ ing into that space ."
So what is ev@@ olution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ la@@ y is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually ce@@ le@@ bra@@ ted . U@@ n@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fun .
"@@ Right ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . Right ? It open@@ s possi@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ la@@ y is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scient@@ ist ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not de@@ fin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od se@@ ction of a pap@@ er .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scient@@ ist ?"
And who better to ask than 25 e@@ igh@@ t@@ - to 1@@ 0@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e aren@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the ai@@ m of this was to not just get the kids to see science differen@@ tly , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differen@@ tly . Right ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ tribu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . Right ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation the last five to 15 years . Right ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to exper@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite speci@@ al . Right ?"
"S@@ he was one of the young people who was inv@@ olved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youn@@ gest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the person@@ i@@ fic@@ ation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you p@@ lease come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es P@@ ro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ oo@@ le : Thank you , Be@@ au . We thought that it was easy to see the lin@@ k between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look al@@ ike ."
"But we won@@ de@@ red if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought sim@@ il@@ ar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might sol@@ ve complex problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new s@@ itu@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and con@@ diti@@ ons . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ se@@ ct with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can recogni@@ ze a good flo@@ wer reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any an@@ gle they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain col@@ or , but to a certain col@@ or flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain pat@@ tern ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the ye@@ l@@ low flo@@ wers if the ye@@ l@@ low flo@@ wers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the blu@@ e , or if the blu@@ e flo@@ wers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the ye@@ l@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the be@@ es can learn to sol@@ ve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and Be@@ au , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding ad@@ ul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scient@@ ist to go in and not have a cl@@ ue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a teach@@ er not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it goes to D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick , who was the col@@ lab@@ or@@ ator on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is ob@@ serv@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ serv@@ ations . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ideo ) D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ den@@ t : 5@@ C .
D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ den@@ t : Yeah .
"D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So you keep tr@@ ack of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ den@@ t : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scient@@ ist says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ den@@ t : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ serv@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ the@@ matic@@ s , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation . Right ? So we have to write it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is min@@ e , oka@@ y ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a pap@@ er has four different se@@ c@@ tions : an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , a resu@@ l@@ ts , a dis@@ cus@@ sion ."
"The in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ds , what did you do ? Re@@ su@@ l@@ ts , what was the ob@@ serv@@ ation ?"
"And the dis@@ cus@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? Right ?"
"That &apos;s a science pap@@ er , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a nar@@ r@@ ative , which means that this pap@@ er is writ@@ ten in ki@@ d@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not writ@@ ten by me . It &apos;s writ@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the clas@@ s . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science pap@@ er begin@@ s , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resu@@ l@@ ts se@@ ction , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining p@@ ha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mil@@ ey face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science pap@@ er . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the t@@ it@@ le pa@@ ge . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in bo@@ ld are e@@ ight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton P@@ r@@ im@@ ary S@@ ch@@ ool , because if it were ever re@@ fe@@ ren@@ ced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public access jour@@ nal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the pap@@ er fail@@ s our in@@ iti@@ al qu@@ ality control che@@ cks in se@@ ver@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once up@@ on a time , &quot; &quot; the fig@@ ures are in cra@@ y@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed . So I sen@@ t it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the le@@ ad@@ ing neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ent@@ ists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most or@@ ig@@ inal science pap@@ er I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly de@@ ser@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ po@@ sure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The pap@@ er is mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ sh@@ able if done by ad@@ ul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We se@@ nd it back to the ed@@ it@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ al@@ ie H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to write a com@@ men@@ t@@ ary s@@ itu@@ ating the fin@@ d@@ ings for scientists , right , pu@@ tting in the re@@ fe@@ ren@@ ces , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed by five in@@ depen@@ den@@ t re@@ fe@@ re@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ yp@@ ical science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ d@@ it@@ ors &apos; C@@ ho@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver f@@ ree@@ ly ac@@ ces@@ sible by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only pap@@ er that will ever be f@@ ree@@ ly ac@@ ces@@ sible by this jour@@ nal .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ a@@ ded pap@@ er by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; rec@@ ently . I don &apos;t have words to expla@@ in exactly how I am feel@@ ing right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ ur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , intere@@ st , in@@ no@@ c@@ ence and ze@@ al are the most bas@@ ic and most important things to do science ."
W@@ ho else can have these qu@@ al@@ ities more than children ?
P@@ lease con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physical me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Yeah ye@@ ah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredi@@ ble risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ h@@ imon S@@ cho@@ c@@ ken : Right , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . Right . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demon@@ str@@ ation , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) ( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) O@@ kay , how about if everyone over there shou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ u@@ dience : ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ r@@ il@@ li@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) W@@ here &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ Right ? We norma@@ lly walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . W@@ hen he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the possi@@ bility to step on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about gi@@ ving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pre@@ ss that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this sh@@ ort story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it br@@ ought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the poten@@ tial to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
C@@ han@@ ging the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all depen@@ ds on the way the person feel@@ s about change .
"But chan@@ ging the way I thought about science was sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we pla@@ yed the ga@@ m@@ es and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ ject , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Be@@ au , and the B@@ l@@ ac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton Be@@ e P@@ ro@@ ject ."
Thank you@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the big@@ gest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ v@@ iron@@ men@@ tal@@ ist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and pap@@ er because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and pap@@ er .
"B@@ ot@@ to@@ m line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to l@@ ist some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an d@@ rin@@ king water .
T@@ wo billion people without san@@ it@@ ation .
There are se@@ ver@@ al million people d@@ ying of HIV and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The l@@ ists go on and on .
There &apos;s two bil@@ lions of people who will be se@@ ve@@ rely a@@ ffe@@ cted by climate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy ses@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We iden@@ ti@@ fied 10 of the big@@ gest challen@@ ges in the world , and I will just bri@@ ef@@ ly read them : climate change , communic@@ able dise@@ a@@ ses , con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts , education , fin@@ an@@ cial in@@ sta@@ bility , gover@@ nan@@ ce and cor@@ ru@@ ption , ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition and hun@@ ger , population mig@@ r@@ ation , san@@ it@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ as@@ s the big@@ gest problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the big@@ gest things ?"
W@@ here should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ av@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to foc@@ us on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve problems .
S@@ ure@@ ly the big@@ gest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize problems , but the point is to pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize solu@@ tions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more com@@ plic@@ ated .
T@@ o climate change that would be like K@@ y@@ oto .
"T@@ o communic@@ able dise@@ a@@ ses , it might be health cl@@ in@@ ics or mos@@ qu@@ ito ne@@ ts ."
"T@@ o con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ kee@@ ping for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an imp@@ os@@ sible tas@@ k — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ or@@ ities ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econom@@ ics gets e@@ vi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ to@@ m of the l@@ ist ?
"P@@ lease , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ or@@ ities and the bot@@ to@@ m pri@@ or@@ ities of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s big@@ gest issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ stan@@ tial amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also str@@ on@@ g@@ ly en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these dis@@ cus@@ sions af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a l@@ ist never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
N@@ ob@@ o@@ dy wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a l@@ ist ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also h@@ ate to be not on the top of the l@@ ist .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sp@@ ots on the l@@ ist than there is number ones , it makes perfe@@ ct sense not to want to do such a l@@ ist ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fund@@ amen@@ tal l@@ ist of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ing — any decis@@ ion is a pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ing , if only im@@ plic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ like@@ ly to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a s@@ itu@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pr@@ ices , no@@ r the s@@ iz@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ ma@@ gine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u c@@ ard , but you have no idea what the pr@@ ice is ."
"You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pr@@ ice is ."
"It could be at one doll@@ ar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a famil@@ y-@@ size p@@ iz@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size p@@ iz@@ za , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pr@@ ices on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econom@@ ists , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top econom@@ ists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the ben@@ ef@@ it of that ?
L@@ ike@@ w@@ ise in communic@@ able dise@@ a@@ ses .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pr@@ ice ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ists , e@@ ight of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ists , inclu@@ ding three N@@ o@@ be@@ l La@@ ure@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen in Ma@@ y 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge U@@ ni@@ versity pre@@ fe@@ cts decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econom@@ ics .
"That works very well in Eur@@ ope , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ or@@ it@@ ized l@@ ist .
"And then you ask , why econom@@ ists ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about ma@@ l@@ aria , you ask a ma@@ l@@ aria exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about climate , you ask a cl@@ ima@@ to@@ log@@ ist ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask ei@@ ther of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econom@@ ists do .
They pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting tas@@ k of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the l@@ ist , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a l@@ ist where they said there were bad pro@@ jects — basically , pro@@ jects where if you inve@@ st a doll@@ ar , you get less than a doll@@ ar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s f@@ air pro@@ jects , good pro@@ jects and very good pro@@ jects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good pro@@ jects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from bac@@ k@@ wards so that we end up with the best pro@@ jects .
These were the bad pro@@ jects .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ to@@ m of the l@@ ist was climate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shou@@ ldn &apos;t come back , ei@@ ther ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cur@@ ious ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ a@@ gre@@ e with on the l@@ ist that you wr@@ ote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ oto — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ oto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the a@@ verage of all ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic mode@@ ls , is that K@@ y@@ oto , if everyone a@@ gre@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ stan@@ tial amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment ai@@ d that we give the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mode@@ ls show it will pos@@ t@@ p@@ one war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h who gets a flo@@ od in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 1@@ 0@@ 6 .
"W@@ h@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce , the U.@@ N@@ . actually est@@ imate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could sol@@ ve all maj@@ or bas@@ ic problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an d@@ rin@@ king water , san@@ it@@ ation , bas@@ ic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend t@@ w@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The f@@ air pro@@ jects — not@@ ice I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communic@@ able dise@@ a@@ ses , scale of bas@@ ic health serv@@ ices — just made it , simply because , y@@ es , scale of bas@@ ic health serv@@ ices is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cos@@ tly ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what it te@@ lls us is su@@ d@@ den@@ ly we start thinking about both side@@ s of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good pro@@ jects , a lot of san@@ it@@ ation and water pro@@ jects came in ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , san@@ it@@ ation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also cos@@ ts a lot of inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ or@@ ities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is ma@@ l@@ aria — de@@ al@@ ing with ma@@ l@@ aria .
The in@@ c@@ idence of ma@@ l@@ aria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get in@@ fe@@ cted every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge point of G@@ D@@ P every year for a@@ ffe@@ cted n@@ ations .
"If we inv@@ es@@ ted about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ c@@ idence down to half ."
"We could av@@ oi@@ d about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more importan@@ tly , we could av@@ oi@@ d about a &#91; million &#93; people getting in@@ fe@@ cted every year ."
"We would sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly incre@@ ase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global war@@ ming ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the model sho@@ wed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally c@@ ut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.S@@ . and Eur@@ ope , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an a@@ st@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ird Wor@@ ld ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , the point is to say that we could actually pu@@ ll two to three hun@@ d@@ red million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very ra@@ dic@@ ally f@@ ast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to foc@@ us on ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition .
"N@@ ot just ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very che@@ a@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition , nam@@ e@@ ly , the l@@ ack of mic@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in iron , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and v@@ it@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inve@@ st about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best inve@@ st@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to foc@@ us on HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if we inve@@ st 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next e@@ ight years , we could av@@ oi@@ d 2@@ 8 new million ca@@ ses of HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , what this does and what it fo@@ cu@@ ses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do ei@@ ther , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inve@@ st first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this fo@@ cu@@ ses on is saying , we can do a lot more by inve@@ sting in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"B@@ as@@ ically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So again , what we foc@@ us on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first r@@ ate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ or@@ ities .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity l@@ ist and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ like@@ ly that we should do that ."
"We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually foc@@ us on problems , that we foc@@ us on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s S@@ che@@ lling , one of the partic@@ i@@ pan@@ ts in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most pe@@ s@@ sim@@ is@@ tic imp@@ act sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
est@@ imate that the a@@ verage person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as r@@ ich as we are today .
"M@@ u@@ ch more like@@ ly , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a po@@ or B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ de@@ shi ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly r@@ ich D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly r@@ ich D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ che@@ lling put it , imagine if you were a r@@ ich — as you will be — a r@@ ich Chin@@ ese , a r@@ ich B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a r@@ ich Con@@ go@@ le@@ se , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through climate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my gr@@ and@@ father and my great gr@@ and@@ father , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ p@@ ed so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ or@@ ities stra@@ ight ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the typ@@ ical way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s main@@ ly because climate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ a@@ y A@@ f@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good fil@@ m in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expe@@ ct E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to c@@ ast B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movi@@ e dig@@ ging l@@ at@@ rin@@ es in T@@ an@@ zan@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movi@@ e ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole dis@@ cus@@ sion of pri@@ or@@ ities as a de@@ f@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we realiz@@ e it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media atten@@ tion , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other ob@@ je@@ c@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly a@@ gre@@ e ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the develop@@ ed world decided we were going to spend t@@ w@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ ince then our ai@@ d has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pat@@ h of su@@ d@@ den@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ ike@@ w@@ ise , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ or@@ ities .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right l@@ ist that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econom@@ ists , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up as@@ king old , white American men ."
"And they &apos;re not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 80 young people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
"The only two requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments were that they were stu@@ d@@ ying at the uni@@ versity , and they sp@@ oke En@@ gl@@ ish ."
"The maj@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same materi@@ al but they could go v@@ a@@ st@@ ly outside the sc@@ ope of dis@@ cus@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own l@@ ists ."
And the sur@@ pris@@ ing thing was that the l@@ ist was very sim@@ il@@ ar — with ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition and dise@@ a@@ ses at the top and climate change at the bot@@ to@@ m .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ars and uni@@ versity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same l@@ ist .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pat@@ h a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ or@@ ities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
Ma@@ p out the right pat@@ h for the world — but also to start thinking about polit@@ ical tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can dis@@ a@@ gre@@ e with the dis@@ cus@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize these , but we have to be hon@@ est and f@@ ran@@ k about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ or@@ ities , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A cur@@ ious little inven@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tin@@ y little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble to the nak@@ ed ey@@ e .
S@@ o@@ on comes the med@@ ical disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually ca@@ u@@ ses of ter@@ ri@@ ble human dise@@ a@@ ses .
"I@@ ma@@ gine what happened to the society when they realized that an En@@ gl@@ ish mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was d@@ rin@@ king a mon@@ s@@ ter sou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast for@@ ward 200 years .
"We still have this mon@@ s@@ ter sou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the develop@@ ing countries around the tro@@ p@@ ical be@@ lt ."
"@@ Just for ma@@ l@@ aria itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be te@@ sted because they are at risk for different species of ma@@ l@@ ari@@ al in@@ fe@@ c@@ tions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ s@@ ters .
"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ an@@ ge or a f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent sta@@ in or G@@ i@@ em@@ sa , and a mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"W@@ hy is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in K@@ en@@ ya , F@@ at@@ ima in B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h , N@@ av@@ j@@ oo@@ t in M@@ um@@ bai , and J@@ u@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ gan@@ da still wa@@ it months to be able to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose why they are s@@ ick ?"
And that &apos;s pr@@ im@@ ari@@ ly because sc@@ al@@ ability of the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of mo@@ der@@ n science , research mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es are not desig@@ ned for field te@@ sting ."
N@@ ei@@ ther were they first desig@@ ned for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , bu@@ l@@ ky , really hard to ma@@ inta@@ in , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his a@@ sh@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in India .
"T@@ wo of my students , J@@ i@@ m and J@@ am@@ es , tra@@ ve@@ led around India and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of d@@ ona@@ ted equ@@ ip@@ ment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us gro@@ wing on mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope l@@ en@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ ope ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ ope is a completely fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope , a pl@@ at@@ form for f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence , br@@ igh@@ t-@@ field , pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation , pro@@ je@@ ction , all kinds of adv@@ an@@ ced mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y built pu@@ rely by fol@@ ding pap@@ er ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
What you see here is all the possible comp@@ on@@ ents to build a fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal br@@ igh@@ t-@@ field and f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope .
"So , there are three sta@@ ges : There is the op@@ tical stage , the ill@@ um@@ in@@ ation stage and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ ho@@ l@@ ding stage ."
And there are mic@@ ro op@@ tics at the bot@@ to@@ m that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the pap@@ er itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are pla@@ ying like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This pap@@ er has no in@@ struc@@ tions and no langu@@ ag@@ es .
"There is a co@@ de , a col@@ or co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that te@@ lls you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ al@@ ities of a stan@@ dar@@ d mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ ope , just like an X@@ Y stage , a place where a sam@@ ple s@@ li@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stan@@ dar@@ d that &apos;s been op@@ tim@@ ized for over the years , and many health wor@@ kers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what changes , but the stan@@ dar@@ d sta@@ ins all re@@ ma@@ in the same for many different dise@@ a@@ ses ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y stage , and then there is a foc@@ using stage , which is a f@@ le@@ x@@ ure me@@ chan@@ ism that &apos;s built in pap@@ er itself that allo@@ ws us to move and foc@@ us the l@@ en@@ ses by mic@@ ron ste@@ ps ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students h@@ ate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ g@@ ged dev@@ ices ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re desig@@ ned from a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble materi@@ al , like pap@@ er ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fun fact is , this is what we actually se@@ nd out there as a stan@@ dar@@ d di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic too@@ l , but here in this en@@ velo@@ p@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es of different con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pic@@ k one ran@@ dom@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually desig@@ ned speci@@ fic@@ ally for ma@@ l@@ aria , because it has the f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent fil@@ ters built speci@@ fic@@ ally for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing ma@@ l@@ aria ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es comes out of this .
"So up t@@ ill now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the l@@ ights , p@@ lease , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es are also pro@@ je@@ ction mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es ."
"I have these two mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ se@@ ction of a comp@@ ound ey@@ e , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m in clo@@ ser , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is ."
You actually see how the l@@ en@@ ses are c@@ ut together in the cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ se@@ ction pat@@ tern .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite in@@ se@@ cts , I love to h@@ ate this one , is a mos@@ qu@@ ito , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ na of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
Right there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been field te@@ sting some of our mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es by wa@@ shing my clo@@ the@@ s wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the d@@ r@@ y@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just f@@ lu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also shows you how the pro@@ je@@ ction sc@@ ope works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ je@@ cted and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the l@@ ights back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it cos@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the big@@ gest idea was ro@@ ll@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and cos@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new para@@ dig@@ m in mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y , which we call u@@ se@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ th@@ row mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a qu@@ ick s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
These are the three sta@@ ges that you actually see .
"And the op@@ tical comp@@ on@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture l@@ en@@ ses in pap@@ er itself at really high thr@@ ough@@ pu@@ ts , so it u@@ ses a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and surface ten@@ sion to build ach@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic l@@ en@@ ses in the pap@@ er itself ."
So that &apos;s where the l@@ en@@ ses go .
There are some light sources .
"And essen@@ ti@@ ally , in the end , all the parts line up because of ori@@ ga@@ mi , because of the fact that ori@@ ga@@ mi allo@@ ws us mic@@ ron@@ -@@ scale pre@@ c@@ is@@ ion of op@@ tical al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the as@@ pe@@ cts of engine@@ er@@ ing that go in something like this are fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated ."
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es are ro@@ b@@ ust , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next step actually is really fin@@ i@@ shing our field tri@@ als ."
We are star@@ ting at the end of the sum@@ mer .
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the hig@@ he@@ st den@@ s@@ ity of mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ es ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started collec@@ ting data for ma@@ l@@ aria , C@@ ha@@ ga@@ s disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from patients themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not an@@ tic@@ i@@ pa@@ ted this before , but a really interesting lin@@ k between han@@ d@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the to@@ ols that we &apos;re actually pro@@ vi@@ ding the kids who are going to f@@ ight this mon@@ s@@ ter sou@@ p for tom@@ or@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just pr@@ int out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ ope and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
Thank you .
( Applause )
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ po@@ wers : inv@@ is@@ i@@ bility .
"H@@ ere in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , they col@@ le@@ ct 90 percent of all the was@@ te that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"They may col@@ le@@ ct over 3@@ 00 k@@ il@@ os in their ba@@ gs , sh@@ op@@ ping car@@ ts , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cl@@ es and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"But at this time , gi@@ ving vo@@ ice to the c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and hum@@ or to the cause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which hel@@ p@@ ed call atten@@ tion to the c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s and impro@@ ve their self-@@ es@@ tee@@ m ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not sto@@ pped working since ."
"And then I realized that c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s , in their inv@@ is@@ i@@ bility , are not ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent to help c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et art@@ ist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bi@@ le art ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition ."
"P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o , R@@ i@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro and C@@ ur@@ iti@@ ba ."
So now everybody can jo@@ in .
So c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s are lea@@ ving inv@@ is@@ i@@ bility behind and be@@ coming incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly re@@ spe@@ cted and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to f@@ ight back to pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s and other inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble super@@ her@@ o@@ es from your city ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million c@@ ata@@ d@@ ore@@ s wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , recogni@@ ze them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ ito ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause ) .
"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en La@@ w@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tual Earth , br@@ ought me over to become the arch@@ ite@@ ct of B@@ ing M@@ ap@@ s , which is M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ of@@ t &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ ma@@ pp@@ ing ef@@ for@@ t ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing the way ma@@ ps work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of ma@@ pp@@ ing and di@@ re@@ ction s@@ ite that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might not@@ ice about the ma@@ pp@@ ing s@@ ite is just the f@@ lu@@ id@@ ity of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re famil@@ i@@ ar at all with S@@ e@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ grap@@ hy , it &apos;s also about ima@@ ger@@ y ."
"So , as we z@@ o@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ yon@@ d a certain level this re@@ sol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ i@@ m C@@ it@@ y-@@ like v@@ ir@@ tual view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vi@@ e@@ wed from any of the car@@ din@@ al di@@ rec@@ tions to show you the 3@@ D structure of the city , all the fac@@ a@@ des ."
"Now , we see this space , this th@@ ree@@ -@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sor@@ ts of ap@@ plic@@ ations can play out , and ma@@ p &apos;s di@@ rec@@ tions are really just one of them ."
"If you cl@@ ick on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the dis@@ as@@ ter in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ma@@ p that sho@@ wed before and after pic@@ tures from the s@@ ky ."
"This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local blo@@ gs in real time and ma@@ pp@@ ing those stories , those ent@@ ri@@ es to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the blo@@ gs ."
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more can@@ dy sort of stuff .
"So , we see the ima@@ ger@@ y , of course , not sto@@ pp@@ ing at the s@@ ky ."
These little green bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es re@@ present ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths that u@@ ser@@ s have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them ei@@ ther , but ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths are inte@@ gra@@ ted into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ very@@ thing that &apos;s ca@@ sed in blu@@ e is an area where we &apos;ve taken ima@@ ger@@ y on the ground as well .
"And so , when you f@@ ly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . W@@ hen you f@@ ly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ger@@ y , the first thing that you might not@@ ice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much th@@ ree@@ -@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal under@@ standing of this environment as there is of the th@@ ree@@ -@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal city from ab@@ o@@ ve , so if I cl@@ ick on something to get a clo@@ ser view of it , then , the fact that that trans@@ ition looks as it does , is a fun@@ ction of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D under@@ standing behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation with our friends at F@@ l@@ ick@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ l@@ ick@@ r , ge@@ ore@@ g@@ is@@ te@@ red ima@@ ger@@ y and u@@ ses ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ -@@ like pro@@ ces@@ ses to conne@@ ct that ima@@ ger@@ y to our ima@@ ger@@ y , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pu@@ ll up , but — ( Laughter ) But not@@ ice — this is , of course , a pop@@ ular tou@@ r@@ ist s@@ ite , and there are lots of photo@@ s around here , and these photo@@ s are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ l@@ ick@@ r ph@@ oto , that &apos;s our ima@@ ger@@ y ."
"So you really see how this kind of c@@ ro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced ima@@ ger@@ y is inte@@ gr@@ ating , in a very dee@@ p way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time tra@@ vel ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful his@@ tor@@ ic ima@@ ger@@ y in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ag@@ es and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s c@@ ool about this is that , not only is it a@@ ug@@ men@@ ting this vi@@ su@@ al re@@ presen@@ tation of the world with things that are coming in from u@@ ser@@ s , but it also is the f@@ oun@@ dat@@ ion for a@@ ug@@ men@@ ted reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a trans@@ ition in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , not@@ ice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of ab@@ o@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ ike P@@ l@@ ace M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t .

"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of reg@@ is@@ tr@@ ation , not only of still images , but also of video ."

( Laughter ) OK .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( N@@ o@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m hit@@ ting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ ike P@@ l@@ ace M@@ ar@@ ke@@ t , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting this live .
"O@@ K , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of intere@@ st .
"@@ No , no . The other way ."
"@@ Yeah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , OK , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of intere@@ st over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the s@@ po@@ t , you can think about this — this is taking a step in ad@@ d@@ ition to a@@ ug@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"What the he@@ ll are you guys — o@@ h , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m han@@ ging up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the team ."
They &apos;ve done a f@@ anta@@ stic job of p@@ ul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for te@@ le@@ presen@@ ce , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the s@@ po@@ t , for a@@ ug@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"When you use it on the s@@ po@@ t , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that me@@ ta@@ data and information about the world to you ."

I would like to kind of z@@ oo@@ m in on the mo@@ on .

Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my ba@@ sel@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are ro@@ ck and lots of se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ ome@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I j@@ um@@ p@@ ed in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast off S@@ pa@@ in .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him J@@ oe — what would J@@ oe see ?"
"If J@@ oe j@@ um@@ p@@ ed in a cor@@ al ree@@ f , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y un@@ like@@ ly , J@@ oe would j@@ um@@ p on a pris@@ t@@ ine cor@@ al ree@@ f , a v@@ ir@@ gin cor@@ al ree@@ f with lots of cor@@ al , shar@@ ks , c@@ ro@@ co@@ d@@ il@@ es , man@@ a@@ te@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"So , probably , what J@@ oe would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the picture ."
"H@@ ere we have the extre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , micro@@ bi@@ al sou@@ p and je@@ ll@@ y@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the ree@@ f@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ gro@@ wing the cor@@ als , lots of bac@@ teria , and where the large animals are gone ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scientists have seen too .
This is their ba@@ sel@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started mo@@ der@@ n science with sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine e@@ cos@@ ys@@ tems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like ."
"This se@@ a is an ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ la@@ go be@@ lon@@ ging to K@@ ir@@ i@@ bat@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has se@@ ver@@ al un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited , un@@ fi@@ shed , pris@@ t@@ ine is@@ lan@@ ds and a few in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited is@@ lan@@ ds ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s I@@ s@@ land , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"M@@ ost of the ree@@ f@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are sma@@ l@@ ler than the pen@@ c@@ il@@ s we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single shar@@ k .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ tain C@@ ook disco@@ vered in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7 and he descri@@ bed a huge ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce of shar@@ ks b@@ iting the ru@@ d@@ ders and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going a@@ sh@@ ore .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ an@@ ning I@@ s@@ land , 2@@ ,@@ 500 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would conside@@ r para@@ dis@@ e .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ ori@@ da K@@ e@@ ys N@@ ational M@@ ar@@ ine S@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your ba@@ sel@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ to@@ ll , where I was with J@@ e@@ re@@ my J@@ ac@@ k@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are shar@@ ks ."
You can see shar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ usu@@ al in today &apos;s cor@@ al ree@@ f@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolu@@ tely heal@@ thy and gor@@ ge@@ ous , for@@ ming spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cul@@ ar struc@@ tures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 shar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bio@@ ma@@ ss p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al ree@@ f together and we@@ ig@@ h them , this is what we would expe@@ ct ."
"M@@ ost of the bio@@ ma@@ ss is low on the food cha@@ in , the her@@ bi@@ v@@ ore@@ s , the par@@ r@@ ot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ e@@ ders , these little d@@ am@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a lo@@ wer bio@@ ma@@ ss of car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore@@ s , and a lo@@ wer bio@@ ma@@ ss of top head , or the shar@@ ks , the large s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , the large grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ sequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having stu@@ died de@@ gra@@ ded ree@@ f@@ s .
"When we went to pris@@ t@@ ine ree@@ f@@ s , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bio@@ ma@@ ss , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ e@@ f , which is now prote@@ cted ."
"The good news is that , in ad@@ d@@ ition to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is big@@ ger .
"We have more shar@@ ks , more bio@@ ma@@ ss of s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , more bio@@ ma@@ ss of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ore@@ s , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats ."
"They cle@@ an the ree@@ f ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the ree@@ f cle@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these an@@ ci@@ ent , pris@@ t@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important comp@@ on@@ ents of the e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem like the gi@@ ant cl@@ ams ; pa@@ ve@@ ments of gi@@ ant cl@@ ams in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per squ@@ are me@@ ter ."
"But still , now we have global war@@ ming ."
"If we don &apos;t have fi@@ shing because these ree@@ f@@ s are prote@@ cted by la@@ w or their re@@ mo@@ te@@ ness , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the cor@@ als die .
"So how are these fish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?"
"In Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ma@@ s , where the food we@@ b is really tr@@ im@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not reco@@ vered ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning I@@ s@@ land , the cor@@ als are not reco@@ vered ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that died and col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed .
"And the fish have gra@@ z@@ ed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little lo@@ wer ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ to@@ ll that has more bio@@ ma@@ ss of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ore@@ s , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pris@@ t@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"These places b@@ lea@@ ched too , but they reco@@ vered fas@@ ter ."
"The more inta@@ ct , the more comple@@ te , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the res@@ il@@ i@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more like@@ ly that the system is going to reco@@ ver from the sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m imp@@ ac@@ ts of war@@ ming ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to reco@@ ver that structure ."
We need to make sure that all of the pie@@ ces of the e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem are there so the e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem can ad@@ ap@@ t to the effe@@ cts of global war@@ ming .
"So if we have to re@@ set the ba@@ sel@@ ine , if we have to p@@ us@@ h the e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are se@@ ver@@ al ways ."
"One very clear way is the mar@@ ine prote@@ cted areas , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that we set as@@ ide to al@@ low for the reco@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
This was my ba@@ sel@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a ki@@ d .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au &apos;s shows on T@@ V , with all this ri@@ ch@@ ness and ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce and di@@ versity ."
"And I thought that this ri@@ ch@@ ness be@@ lon@@ ged to tro@@ p@@ ical se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an was a nat@@ ur@@ ally po@@ or se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , until I j@@ um@@ p@@ ed for the first time in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again ."
"So you have this little al@@ ga@@ l fore@@ st , and in the size of a l@@ ap@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , mos@@ tly mic@@ r@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ic f@@ it hundre@@ ds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system reco@@ ver@@ s ."
"And this particular place , the M@@ e@@ des I@@ s@@ lan@@ ds M@@ ar@@ ine Re@@ ser@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 he@@ c@@ tar@@ es , and it br@@ ings 6 million e@@ ur@@ os to the local economy , 20 times more than fi@@ shing , and it re@@ presen@@ ts 8@@ 8 percent of all the tou@@ r@@ ist re@@ ven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem but also help the people who can ben@@ ef@@ it from the e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves do .
"These places , when we prote@@ ct them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prote@@ cted areas ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species incre@@ a@@ ses 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would expe@@ ct 200 more in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ stan@@ tial .
"The size of organ@@ is@@ ms incre@@ a@@ ses a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce , how many fish you have per squ@@ are me@@ ter , incre@@ a@@ ses almost 1@@ 70 percent ."
"And the bio@@ ma@@ ss — this is the most spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cul@@ ar change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ a@@ ter bio@@ ma@@ ss on a@@ verage , just after five to seven years ."
In some places up to 10 times lar@@ ger bio@@ ma@@ ss inside the re@@ ser@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the re@@ ser@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ produ@@ ce . That &apos;s population bio@@ logy 1@@ 0@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow lar@@ ger and they re@@ produ@@ ce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ bra@@ tes . This is the example .
"These are e@@ g@@ g ca@@ ses l@@ ai@@ d by a s@@ nai@@ l off the co@@ ast of C@@ hi@@ le , and this is how many e@@ g@@ gs they la@@ y on the bot@@ to@@ m ."
"O@@ ut@@ side the re@@ ser@@ ve , you cannot even de@@ te@@ ct this ."
One point three million e@@ g@@ gs per squ@@ are me@@ ter inside the mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve where these s@@ na@@ il@@ s are very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
"So these organ@@ is@@ ms re@@ produ@@ ce , the little lar@@ v@@ ae ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can ben@@ ef@@ it from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ ma@@ s : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ un@@ dan@@ ce of grou@@ per@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ve , and the clo@@ ser you get to the re@@ ser@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are c@@ at@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the re@@ ser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats l@@ ined up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are ben@@ ef@@ its be@@ yon@@ d the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es of these re@@ ser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the re@@ ser@@ ve is prote@@ c@@ ting the entire ha@@ bit@@ at . It is building res@@ il@@ i@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world without re@@ ser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
Re@@ ser@@ ves are like sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t tou@@ ch ; that produc@@ es re@@ turns , social , economic and e@@ co@@ logical ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bio@@ ma@@ ss inside the re@@ ser@@ ves , this is like comp@@ ound intere@@ st ."
"T@@ wo exam@@ ples , again , of how these re@@ ser@@ ves can ben@@ ef@@ it people ."
"This is how much fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men get every@@ day in K@@ en@@ ya , fi@@ shing over a seri@@ es of years , in a place where there is no prote@@ ction ; it &apos;s a f@@ ree@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fi@@ shing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were c@@ at@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually c@@ at@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ve on top of that , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fi@@ shing less around an area that is prote@@ cted ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per@@ s in B@@ el@@ ize in the M@@ e@@ so@@ amer@@ ican Re@@ e@@ f .
"This is grou@@ per se@@ x , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the full mo@@ ons of De@@ ce@@ m@@ ber and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a week ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one he@@ c@@ t@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they ca@@ ught them , and they de@@ p@@ le@@ ted them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 20@@ 00 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were au@@ th@@ or@@ ized to c@@ at@@ ch 30 percent of the entire sp@@ a@@ w@@ ning population every year .
"So we did a simple an@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y is going to col@@ l@@ ap@@ se very quickly ."
"And with the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y , the entire re@@ produc@@ tive ability of the species goes ex@@ tin@@ ct ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , tot@@ al , for the entire fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y , se@@ ver@@ al fi@@ shing bo@@ ats ."
"Now , if you do an economic an@@ al@@ ys@@ is and project what would happen if the fish were not c@@ ut , if we br@@ ought just 20 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be su@@ sta@@ in@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"We &apos;re getting clo@@ ser to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prote@@ c@@ tions of the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ la@@ go , and only a fr@@ action of this is fully prote@@ cted from fi@@ shing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic stu@@ dies re@@ com@@ men@@ d that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prote@@ cted .
The est@@ ima@@ ted range is between 20 and 50 percent for a seri@@ es of go@@ als of bio@@ di@@ versity and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y en@@ han@@ ce@@ ment and res@@ il@@ i@@ ence .
"Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are pa@@ ying now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fi@@ shing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to de@@ struc@@ tive fi@@ shing pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es .
"Well , there are a couple est@@ ima@@ tes of how much it would cost to create a net@@ work of prote@@ cted areas co@@ ver@@ ing 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fr@@ action of what we are now pa@@ ying ; the government hands out to a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y that is col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing ."
People are l@@ os@@ ing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies are col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a net@@ work of re@@ ser@@ ves would pro@@ vi@@ de di@@ re@@ ct em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment for more than a million people pl@@ us all the secon@@ dar@@ y j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ dar@@ y ben@@ ef@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so clear that these sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prote@@ cted areas like the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ la@@ go .
"The problem is that we can create these large re@@ ser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , where the polit@@ ical cost is really low and the economic cost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organiz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fi@@ shing ?"
"Well , there are three ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thousands of small re@@ ser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves do , and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men te@@ nd to be really , really de@@ f@@ en@@ sive when it comes to reg@@ ul@@ ating or cl@@ os@@ ing an area , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the gover@@ nan@@ ce is not right because most co@@ as@@ tal commun@@ ities around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity to mon@@ it@@ or the re@@ sources to create the re@@ ser@@ ve and en@@ force it ."
It &apos;s a top down hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical structure where people wa@@ it for government a@@ gen@@ ts to come and this is not effe@@ ctive . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough re@@ sources .
"W@@ h@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more re@@ ser@@ ves , is that the fun@@ ding mode@@ ls have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments spend a lot of time and energy and re@@ sources in a few small areas , usu@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation and co@@ as@@ tal prote@@ ction has become a s@@ in@@ k for government or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ic money , and this is not su@@ sta@@ in@@ able ."
So the solu@@ tions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we need to develo@@ p a global a@@ war@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to insp@@ ire local commun@@ ities and govern@@ ments to create no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ su@@ s the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ econ@@ d , we need to re@@ design our gover@@ nan@@ ce so con@@ serv@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts can be dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ serv@@ ation ef@@ for@@ ts don &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government a@@ gen@@ ci@@ es and can be created by the local commun@@ ities , like it happens in the Ph@@ il@@ ipp@@ ines and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to develo@@ p new business mode@@ ls ."
The ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ y s@@ in@@ k as the only way to create re@@ ser@@ ves is not su@@ sta@@ in@@ able .
"We really need to develo@@ p mode@@ ls , business mode@@ ls , where co@@ as@@ tal con@@ serv@@ ation is an inve@@ st@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves pro@@ vi@@ de social , e@@ co@@ logical and economic ben@@ ef@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organiz@@ ation alone is going to sa@@ ve the ocean ."
"There has been a lot of compe@@ t@@ ition in the past , and we need to develo@@ p a new model of part@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative , where we are looking for comple@@ men@@ ting , not sub@@ st@@ itu@@ ting ."
The st@@ ak@@ es are just too high to contin@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ al@@ a : Thank you .

"F@@ ir@@ st of all , your p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id , your in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id , sho@@ wing 8@@ 5 percent bio@@ ma@@ ss in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that seem@@ s imp@@ os@@ sible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent survi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two ge@@ ars of a wat@@ ch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , and the small one is moving f@@ ast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the lo@@ wer parts of the food cha@@ in , they re@@ produ@@ ce very f@@ ast ; they grow really f@@ ast ; they produ@@ ce mil@@ lions of e@@ g@@ gs ."
"@@ U@@ p there , you have shar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ produ@@ ce very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low me@@ ta@@ b@@ ol@@ ism ; and , basically , they just ma@@ inta@@ in their bio@@ ma@@ ss ."
"So , basically , the produc@@ tion sur@@ pl@@ us of these guys down there is enough to ma@@ inta@@ in this bio@@ ma@@ ss that is not moving ."
They are like cap@@ ac@@ it@@ ors of the system .

"What we found in cor@@ al ree@@ f@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ e@@ ren@@ ge@@ t@@ i , with five lions per w@@ il@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this cannot work ."
But at least on cor@@ al ree@@ f@@ s are systems where there is a bot@@ to@@ m comp@@ on@@ ent with structure .
We think this is uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l .
But we have started stu@@ d@@ ying pris@@ t@@ ine ree@@ f@@ s only very rec@@ ently .
CA : So the num@@ bers you presen@@ ted really are a@@ st@@ oni@@ shing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as mar@@ ine prote@@ cted areas that actually give new living cho@@ ices to the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men as well .
"If the world was a smar@@ ter place , we could sol@@ ve this problem for ne@@ g@@ ative 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ perfor@@ man@@ ce of fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big solu@@ tions is have the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ dies to su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es ."
"C@@ A : O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m he@@ ar@@ ing out there about en@@ ding this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ d@@ ness ."
So th@@ ank you for those num@@ bers .
The last one &apos;s a person@@ al question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oce@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ gra@@ dat@@ ion , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pres@@ sing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feel@@ ing that you must have experi@@ en@@ ced of going to these pris@@ t@@ ine areas and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al experience .
"We go there to try to understand the e@@ cos@@ ys@@ tems , to try to me@@ a@@ sure or coun@@ t fish and shar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feel@@ ing is this bi@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ ia that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ ta@@ med nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger global e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could contin@@ ue doing this job ."
It would be just too de@@ pres@@ sing .
"C@@ A : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for shar@@ ing some of that sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in col@@ le@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ v@@ idence , R@@ ho@@ de I@@ s@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ em@@ plo@@ yed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ gest rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me tot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfe@@ ct im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fig@@ ures out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) Right , the fam@@ ous Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about s@@ itu@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ stand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might str@@ ike you as a st@@ range care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ anta@@ ge : no job compe@@ t@@ ition ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — oka@@ y f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So effe@@ c@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of win@@ d up tra@@ ve@@ ling through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our person@@ al and pro@@ fe@@ s@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ ince you that it is possible to step outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ a@@ test mor@@ al , inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tual and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emot@@ i@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ wers , but they &apos;re ans@@ wers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realiz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ a@@ st@@ ating , it can be re@@ ve@@ l@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy .
D@@ o you remember that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never c@@ at@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ ode of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a b@@ ird , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just kee@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realiz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ re@@ ct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tur@@ al reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of r@@ igh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ ind@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ nal c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ in@@ k back for a moment to ele@@ men@@ t@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in clas@@ s , and your teach@@ er is han@@ ding back qu@@ i@@ z pap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not min@@ e , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this pap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b ki@@ d , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are nin@@ e years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible d@@ im@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad les@@ s@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ spe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just be@@ coming perfe@@ ct little A students , perfe@@ c@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ a@@ chi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ Right , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , a@@ st@@ ro@@ phys@@ ic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ara@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , a@@ st@@ ro@@ phys@@ ic@@ ists , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ara@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we f@@ re@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve got@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ s@@ ist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and v@@ ir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Be@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ ger@@ y ."
Be@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing hos@@ p@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best hos@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ t@@ ized , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — st@@ it@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seem@@ s to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she wak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perfor@@ med a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pres@@ ident for health care qu@@ ality at Be@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ oke about this in@@ c@@ ident , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or whatever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ us@@ ting too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of anything can be very dan@@ ger@@ ous ."
This inter@@ nal sense of r@@ igh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a re@@ li@@ able gu@@ ide to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ nal world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ in@@ k for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just perfe@@ c@@ tly re@@ f@@ le@@ ct reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to expla@@ in all of those people who dis@@ a@@ gre@@ e with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expla@@ in those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a seri@@ es of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we usu@@ ally do when someone dis@@ a@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ sume they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ a@@ gre@@ e with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ ption , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ a@@ gre@@ e with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ ption : they know the tru@@ th , and they are de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately dis@@ tor@@ ting it for their own ma@@ le@@ vol@@ ent pur@@ po@@ ses ."
So this is a c@@ ata@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he .
This at@@ tach@@ ment to our own r@@ igh@@ t@@ ness kee@@ ps us from pre@@ ven@@ ting mis@@ takes when we absolu@@ tely need to and ca@@ u@@ ses us to tre@@ at each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ f@@ fl@@ ing and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perfe@@ c@@ tly trans@@ lu@@ cent win@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differen@@ tly , which is why we can all look up at the same night s@@ ky and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think the@@ re@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . A@@ ug@@ us@@ t@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r the@@ re@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ ug@@ us@@ t@@ ine under@@ sto@@ od that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing de@@ fe@@ ct in the human system , something we can er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fund@@ amen@@ tal to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ ses@@ sed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ ses@@ sion is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tiv@@ ity and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself lis@@ ten@@ ing to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing and I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just ima@@ gin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ l@@ as@@ s , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a sta@@ ff , we j@@ oke that every single ep@@ is@@ ode of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ l@@ as@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of sur@@ pr@@ ise and re@@ ver@@ sa@@ l and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ bers , as lis@@ ten@@ ers , as re@@ a@@ ders , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot t@@ w@@ ists and red her@@ rin@@ gs and sur@@ pr@@ ise en@@ d@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a bun@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ stru@@ ction , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ cr@@ acy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ ni M@@ u@@ b@@ ara@@ k thought he was going to be the dic@@ tat@@ or of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too s@@ ick and could pas@@ s the re@@ ig@@ ns of power onto his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody ha@@ tes for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and a@@ st@@ oni@@ sh@@ es us ."
"@@ No off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ um@@ ent to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about innov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ ce@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .

( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tin@@ y , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of r@@ igh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ a@@ st@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and m@@ ys@@ ter@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."

"I &apos;d been rai@@ sed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary me@@ asu@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s r@@ ace or rel@@ ig@@ ion ."
So what open@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that challen@@ ged this way of thinking was during the 20@@ 00 pres@@ iden@@ tial elec@@ tions .
"Th@@ r@@ ough a col@@ le@@ ge pre@@ p pro@@ gram , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ ou@@ th Con@@ ven@@ tion in Ph@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a ."
"My particular group &apos;s foc@@ us was on you@@ th viol@@ ence , and having been the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of bu@@ ll@@ ying for most of my life , this was a sub@@ ject in which I felt partic@@ ul@@ arly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate ."
The mem@@ bers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"Now , it had taken se@@ ver@@ al days for this de@@ tai@@ l to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural an@@ im@@ os@@ ity between the two of us ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish friend before , and f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ den@@ s , an am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ po@@ sed to people from all sor@@ ts of f@@ ai@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fund@@ amen@@ tal to the develop@@ ment of my charac@@ ter ."
"M@@ ost of my life , I &apos;d been ta@@ ught that h@@ omo@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all ga@@ y people were a ne@@ g@@ ative inf@@ lu@@ ence ."
"As chan@@ ce would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the ga@@ y perfor@@ m@@ ers at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ de@@ st , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met ."
"@@ Be@@ ing bu@@ l@@ li@@ ed as a ki@@ d created a sense of em@@ pa@@ thy in me to@@ ward the su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing of others , and it comes very un@@ nat@@ ur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that feel@@ ing , I was able to con@@ tr@@ ast the ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es I &apos;d been ta@@ ught as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be ga@@ y , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with being ju@@ d@@ ged for something that &apos;s be@@ yon@@ d my control ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; O@@ n a n@@ igh@@ tly bas@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ war@@ t for@@ ced me to be inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own big@@ ot@@ ry and hel@@ p@@ ed me to realiz@@ e that a person &apos;s r@@ ace , rel@@ ig@@ ion or se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s charac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"I@@ n@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation can often come from an un@@ expe@@ cted place , and the fact that a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish com@@ e@@ di@@ an had done more to pos@@ iti@@ vely inf@@ lu@@ ence my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view than my own extre@@ m@@ ist father is not lost on me ."
"One day , I had a con@@ vers@@ ation with my mother about how my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view was star@@ ting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live ."
"S@@ he looked at me with the we@@ ary eyes of someone who had experi@@ en@@ ced enough do@@ g@@ mat@@ ism to last a li@@ fe@@ time , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of h@@ ating people . &quot;"
"In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ g@@ ative energy it takes to hold that hat@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our conne@@ ction with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and poten@@ ti@@ ally put myself in dan@@ ger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the h@@ op@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is compe@@ ll@@ ed to use viol@@ ence may hear my story and realiz@@ e that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been sub@@ je@@ cted to this viol@@ ent , in@@ to@@ l@@ er@@ ant ide@@ o@@ logy , that I did not become f@@ anat@@ ic@@ ized ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to f@@ ight back against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , against the big@@ ot@@ ry ."
"I do it for the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism and their lo@@ ved ones , for the ter@@ ri@@ ble pa@@ in and l@@ oss that ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism has for@@ ced up@@ on their lives ."
"For the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , I will speak out against these sen@@ se@@ less ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that viol@@ ence isn &apos;t in@@ he@@ ren@@ t in one &apos;s rel@@ ig@@ ion or r@@ ace , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )@@ "
I &apos;m de@@ l@@ igh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m hon@@ ore@@ d by the inv@@ it@@ ation , and th@@ an@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I su@@ spe@@ ct that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t intere@@ st many other people ."
"F@@ ir@@ st off , my ba@@ dge says I &apos;m an a@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ er ."
"I would love to talk about my a@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ y , but I su@@ spe@@ ct that the number of people who are interested in ra@@ di@@ ative trans@@ fer in non@@ -@@ gra@@ y at@@ mos@@ p@@ he@@ res and pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation of light in J@@ up@@ it@@ er &apos;s u@@ pp@@ er at@@ mos@@ p@@ here are the number of people who &apos;d f@@ it in a bu@@ s sh@@ el@@ ter ."
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 198@@ 6 and 198@@ 7 , when a computer ha@@ c@@ ker is bre@@ aking into our systems over at La@@ w@@ ren@@ ce B@@ er@@ ke@@ le@@ y L@@ ab@@ s ."
"And I ca@@ ught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ al@@ ing information and se@@ lling it ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ..@@ ."
"I find computer se@@ cur@@ ity , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , to be kind of bor@@ ing ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science ."
"The second time , it &apos;s engine@@ er@@ ing ."
"A third time , it &apos;s just being a tech@@ n@@ ic@@ ian ."
"I &apos;m a scient@@ ist . O@@ n@@ ce I do something , I do something else ."
"So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that ."
"N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvi@@ ous sta@@ te@@ ments from my first book , &quot; &quot; S@@ il@@ ic@@ on S@@ nak@@ e O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , no@@ r am I going to talk about why I believe compu@@ ters don &apos;t be@@ long in s@@ cho@@ ols ."
I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into s@@ cho@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"@@ G@@ et them out of s@@ cho@@ ols , and keep them out of s@@ cho@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent is so obvi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s hun@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de clas@@ s@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
"H@@ a@@ ving said that , I out@@ l@@ ined my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the ma@@ in thing I wr@@ ote on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m supp@@ o@@ sed to talk about the future , y@@ es ?"
"O@@ h , right . And my feel@@ ing is , as@@ king me to talk about the future is b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gra@@ y ha@@ ir , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future ."
"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a techno@@ log@@ ist , a scient@@ ist , a phys@@ ic@@ ist ."
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s wr@@ iting co@@ de .
"@@ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er ."
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teach@@ er , ask an experi@@ en@@ ced one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I su@@ spe@@ ct , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these c@@ ool new things that are going to be there ."
"But to me , things ar@@ en &apos;t the future ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally good at text mes@@ sa@@ ging and spend a huge amount of on@@ -@@ scre@@ en time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?"
"C@@ han@@ ge is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ t@@ ware ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
I@@ s that vis@@ i@@ ble ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ s@@ ided things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"@@ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the au@@ dience who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , yu@@ p , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one s@@ ided . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has zer@@ o vol@@ ume . And it &apos;s non@@ -@@ ori@@ en@@ table .
It has wonderful pro@@ per@@ ties .
"If you take two M@@ ob@@ i@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common e@@ dge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of gl@@ as@@ s ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a co@@ ld . ) H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stan@@ ds for design ."
"@@ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m de@@ l@@ igh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four d@@ im@@ en@@ sions it shou@@ ldn &apos;t be able to hold any f@@ lu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perfe@@ c@@ tly cap@@ able of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al d@@ im@@ en@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al d@@ im@@ en@@ sions , it can hold f@@ lu@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the c@@ ool one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about to@@ po@@ logy with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ stead , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mo@@ m , who pas@@ sed away last sum@@ mer ."
"H@@ ad collec@@ ted photograp@@ h@@ s of me , as mo@@ thers will do ."
C@@ ou@@ ld somebody put this guy up ?
"And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had collec@@ ted a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , in front of a bun@@ ch of di@@ als ."
"And I looked at it , and said , o@@ h my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o !@@ "
"As a tech@@ n@@ ic@@ ian , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing and ma@@ inta@@ ining the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y B@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ al@@ o . And wo@@ w !@@ "
"W@@ a@@ y back machine . And I said to myself , o@@ h ye@@ ah !@@ "
And it sen@@ t me back .
"S@@ o@@ on after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me ."
This guy over here of course is me .
"This man is R@@ ob@@ er@@ t M@@ oo@@ g , the inven@@ tor of the M@@ oo@@ g sy@@ n@@ the@@ s@@ iz@@ er , who pas@@ sed away this past A@@ ug@@ ust ."
"@@ R@@ ob@@ er@@ t M@@ oo@@ g was a gener@@ ous , kind person , ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly compe@@ tent engine@@ er ."
"A mus@@ ic@@ ian who took time from his life to te@@ ach me , a s@@ op@@ h@@ om@@ ore , a f@@ re@@ sh@@ man at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y B@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ al@@ o ."
"He &apos;d come up from T@@ ru@@ man@@ s@@ bur@@ g to te@@ ach me not just about the M@@ oo@@ g sy@@ n@@ the@@ s@@ iz@@ er , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics at the time . This is 19@@ 6@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 ."
"We &apos;re stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics , I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do ."
D@@ on &apos;t get ca@@ ught up in electr@@ on@@ ic music if you &apos;re doing phys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; M@@ en@@ tor@@ ing me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .

"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my clas@@ s — this is through the l@@ ens , and one of the things we used a l@@ ens for was to me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ r@@ ito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ c@@ ill@@ os@@ c@@ ope — me@@ asu@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ ders do you know of who have me@@ asu@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ?
"In ad@@ d@@ ition to that , we &apos;ve me@@ asu@@ red the spe@@ ed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to imp@@ ose up@@ on the po@@ wers that be , and me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !@@ "
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light !@@ "
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound !@@ "
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the e@@ ch@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ou@@ ld we me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light using the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation is the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy times the wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th of any wa@@ ve ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . W@@ hen the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy goes up , the wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th comes down . W@@ a@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th goes up , f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy goes down . So , if we have a wa@@ ve here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the p@@ it@@ ch goes up , things get clo@@ ser , p@@ it@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out ."
Right ? This is simple phys@@ ics .
"A@@ ll of you know this from e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in phys@@ ics — in e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de phys@@ ics — but they should have , and I w@@ ish they had , was that if you mul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy times the wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of sound .
"So , in order to me@@ a@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , ab@@ o@@ ve A , ab@@ o@@ ve A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
"Now , so I know the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 k@@ il@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z . I me@@ a@@ sure its wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th .
"A@@ ll I need now is to f@@ li@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bot@@ to@@ m be@@ am is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll not@@ ice the sp@@ ir@@ al ."
"The s@@ lin@@ ky mo@@ ves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the wa@@ ve , coming out this way ."
"Th@@ ose of you who are phys@@ ic@@ ists , I hear you ro@@ lling your eyes , but be@@ ar with me . ( Laughter ) T@@ o me@@ a@@ sure the wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th , all I need to do is me@@ a@@ sure the dis@@ tan@@ ce from here — one full wa@@ ve — over to here ."
F@@ rom here to here is the wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th of sound .
"So , I &apos;ll put a me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing t@@ ape here , me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing t@@ ape here , move it back over to here ."
I &apos;ve mo@@ ved the micro@@ phone 20 cent@@ ime@@ ters .

"And we &apos;ll say the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 k@@ il@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 1@@ 7@@ 60 ."
The wa@@ ve@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters .

"And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , the squ@@ are ro@@ ot of the l@@ en@@ g@@ th is pro@@ por@@ ti@@ onal to its peri@@ od . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep cl@@ im@@ b@@ ing up , go back ."
I go to a place where a do@@ we@@ l s@@ pl@@ its off .
"There &apos;s a clo@@ ck , clo@@ ck , clo@@ ck , clo@@ ck ."
The time &apos;s going bac@@ k@@ wards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ ore@@ n@@ z con@@ trac@@ tions and E@@ in@@ ste@@ in@@ ian rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ity .
"I cl@@ im@@ b up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you cl@@ im@@ b up this wo@@ o@@ den l@@ ad@@ der ."
"I po@@ p up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a ."
"A d@@ ome , one of these ten@@ -@@ foo@@ t dom@@ es ."
"I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the c@@ op@@ s ba@@ shing students &apos; he@@ ads , sho@@ ot@@ ing te@@ ar ga@@ s , and wat@@ ching students th@@ ro@@ wing br@@ ic@@ ks ."
"And I &apos;m as@@ king , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I remember what my En@@ gl@@ ish teach@@ er in high school said ."
"N@@ ame@@ ly , that when they c@@ ast be@@ lls , they write in@@ scri@@ p@@ tions on them ."
"So , I wi@@ p@@ e the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on man@@ ure off one of the be@@ lls , and I look at it ."
"I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words in@@ scri@@ bed up@@ on the H@@ a@@ y@@ es H@@ all to@@ wer be@@ lls : &quot; &quot; All tru@@ th is one ."
"In this light , may science and rel@@ ig@@ ion en@@ de@@ av@@ or here for the ste@@ ad@@ y ev@@ olution of man@@ kind , from dar@@ k@@ ness to light , from nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ness to bro@@ ad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , from pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice to to@@ l@@ er@@ ance ."
"It is the vo@@ ice of life , which call@@ s us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much ."
"A few years ago , I br@@ oke into my own house ."
"I had just dri@@ ven home , it was around mid@@ night in the de@@ ad of M@@ on@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been vis@@ iting my friend , J@@ ef@@ f , across to@@ wn , and the ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 de@@ gre@@ es — and don &apos;t bo@@ ther as@@ king if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or F@@ a@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two sc@@ al@@ es me@@ et — it was very co@@ ld ."
"And as I sto@@ od on the front por@@ ch fu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing in my po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , I found I didn &apos;t have my ke@@ ys ."
"In fact , I could see them through the win@@ do@@ w , l@@ ying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them ."
"So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws , and they were loc@@ ked t@@ ight ."
"I thought about call@@ ing a loc@@ k@@ s@@ mit@@ h — at least I had my ce@@ ll@@ phone , but at mid@@ night , it could take a while for a loc@@ k@@ s@@ mit@@ h to show up , and it was co@@ ld ."
"I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend J@@ ef@@ f &apos;s house for the night because I had an early fl@@ ight to Eur@@ ope the next mor@@ ning , and I needed to get my pas@@ sp@@ ort and my su@@ it@@ case ."
"So , des@@ per@@ ate and f@@ ree@@ z@@ ing co@@ ld , I found a large ro@@ ck and I br@@ oke through the ba@@ se@@ ment win@@ do@@ w , c@@ lear@@ ed out the shar@@ ds of gl@@ as@@ s , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard and t@@ ap@@ ed it up over the open@@ ing , fig@@ uring that in the mor@@ ning , on the way to the air@@ por@@ t , I could call my con@@ trac@@ tor and ask him to fi@@ x it ."
"This was going to be ex@@ pen@@ sive , but probably no more ex@@ pen@@ sive than a mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night loc@@ k@@ s@@ mit@@ h , so I fig@@ u@@ red , under the cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces , I was coming out even ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ent@@ ist by tra@@ ining and I know a little bit about how the brain perfor@@ ms under stre@@ ss ."
"It re@@ lea@@ ses cor@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l that rai@@ ses your heart r@@ ate , it mod@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine le@@ ve@@ ls and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"So the next mor@@ ning , when I wok@@ e up on too little s@@ le@@ e@@ p , wor@@ r@@ ying about the ho@@ le in the win@@ do@@ w , and a mental not@@ e that I had to call my con@@ trac@@ tor , and the f@@ ree@@ z@@ ing tem@@ per@@ at@@ ures , and the me@@ et@@ ings I had up@@ coming in Eur@@ ope , and , you know , with all the cor@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l in my brain , my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cl@@ ou@@ dy because my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy ."
"( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the air@@ por@@ t che@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ in coun@@ ter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ sp@@ ort . ( Laughter )@@ "
"So I r@@ ac@@ ed home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ sp@@ ort , r@@ ac@@ ed back to the air@@ por@@ t , I made it just in time , but they had given away my se@@ at to someone else , so I got stu@@ ck in the back of the plan@@ e , next to the ba@@ th@@ ro@@ om@@ s , in a se@@ at that wouldn &apos;t re@@ cl@@ ine , on an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our fl@@ ight ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those e@@ ight hours and no s@@ le@@ e@@ p ."
"( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent bad things from happening ?"
"O@@ r at least if bad things happen , will min@@ im@@ ize the like@@ li@@ ho@@ od of it being a tot@@ al c@@ ata@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he ."
"So I started thinking about that , but my th@@ ough@@ ts didn &apos;t cr@@ y@@ st@@ all@@ ize until about a mon@@ th later ."
"I was having din@@ ner with my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e , D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man , the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ se@@ dly told him about having br@@ ok@@ en my win@@ do@@ w , and , you know , for@@ got@@ ten my pas@@ sp@@ ort , and D@@ an@@ n@@ y shar@@ ed with me that he &apos;d been pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing something called pr@@ os@@ pe@@ ctive hin@@ d@@ s@@ ight ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had got@@ ten from the psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had writ@@ ten about it a few years before , also called the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m ."
"Now , you all know what the pos@@ t@@ mor@@ te@@ m is ."
"W@@ hen@@ ever there &apos;s a dis@@ as@@ ter , a team of exper@@ ts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?"
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ an@@ n@@ y expla@@ ined , you look a@@ head and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to pre@@ v@@ ent those things from happening , or to min@@ im@@ ize the da@@ ma@@ ge ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ r@@ ound the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are eas@@ ily lost ."
"Now , this soun@@ ds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ ati@@ al memor@@ y works ."
"There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us , that ev@@ olved over ten@@ s of thousands of years , to keep tr@@ ack of the loc@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of f@@ ru@@ it tre@@ es , where the fri@@ en@@ dly and en@@ e@@ my tri@@ bes live ."
The hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us is the part of the brain that in L@@ on@@ don ta@@ x@@ ic@@ a@@ b dri@@ ver@@ s be@@ comes en@@ lar@@ ged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allo@@ ws squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their nu@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experim@@ ent where they c@@ ut off the ol@@ fac@@ tory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their nu@@ ts ."
"They we@@ ren &apos;t using s@@ me@@ ll , they were using the hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite@@ ly ev@@ olved me@@ chan@@ ism in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we l@@ ose car ke@@ ys and read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses and pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a s@@ po@@ t for your ke@@ ys — a ho@@ ok by the do@@ or , maybe a de@@ cor@@ ative bo@@ w@@ l ."
"For your pas@@ sp@@ ort , a particular dra@@ wer ."
"For your read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses , a particular table ."
"If you desig@@ n@@ ate a s@@ po@@ t and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ p@@ ul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about tra@@ vel ?
"T@@ ake a cell phone picture of your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s l@@ ic@@ en@@ se , your pas@@ sp@@ ort , ma@@ il it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cl@@ oud ."
"If these things are lost or sto@@ l@@ en , you can fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate re@@ plac@@ e@@ ment ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"@@ Re@@ member , when you &apos;re under stre@@ ss , the brain re@@ lea@@ ses cor@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it ca@@ u@@ ses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recogni@@ ze that under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place ."
And there &apos;s perhaps no more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful a s@@ itu@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a med@@ ical decis@@ ion to make .
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that pos@@ ition , where we have to make a very important decis@@ ion about the future of our med@@ ical care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a decis@@ ion ."
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular med@@ ical con@@ d@@ ition .
"But this stan@@ ds as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of med@@ ical decis@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ making , and in@@ de@@ ed for fin@@ an@@ cial decis@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ making , and social decis@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ making — any kind of decis@@ ion you have to make that would ben@@ ef@@ it from a r@@ ational as@@ ses@@ s@@ ment of the fac@@ ts ."
"So supp@@ ose you go to your doc@@ tor and the doc@@ tor says , &quot; I just got your la@@ b work back , your cho@@ le@@ ste@@ ro@@ l &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that high cho@@ le@@ ste@@ ro@@ l is as@@ soci@@ ated with an incre@@ a@@ sed risk of car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease , heart atta@@ ck , str@@ oke ."
"And so you &apos;re thinking having high cho@@ le@@ ste@@ ro@@ l isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doc@@ tor says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a dru@@ g that will help you lo@@ wer your cho@@ le@@ ste@@ ro@@ l , a st@@ at@@ in . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve probably heard of st@@ at@@ ins , you know that they &apos;re am@@ ong the most w@@ ide@@ ly pre@@ scri@@ bed dru@@ gs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them ."
"And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! G@@ ive me the st@@ at@@ in . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a st@@ at@@ is@@ tic you should ask for that most doc@@ tors don &apos;t like talking about , and ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical companies like talking about even less ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a dru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ ger@@ y or any med@@ ical pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure before one person is hel@@ p@@ ed .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of cra@@ z@@ y st@@ at@@ is@@ tic is that ?"
The number should be one .
My doc@@ tor wouldn &apos;t pre@@ scri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
"But actually , med@@ ical pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the doc@@ tor &apos;s fa@@ ult , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s fa@@ ult , it &apos;s the fa@@ ult of scientists like me ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t fig@@ u@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line est@@ ima@@ tes that 90 percent of the dru@@ gs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most w@@ ide@@ ly pre@@ scri@@ bed st@@ at@@ in , what do you supp@@ ose it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ p@@ ed ?
3@@ 00 .
"This is ac@@ cor@@ ding to research by research pr@@ ac@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ ers J@@ er@@ ome G@@ ro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ el@@ a H@@ art@@ z@@ b@@ and , in@@ depen@@ den@@ tly con@@ fir@@ med by B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g@@ .@@ com@@ ."
I ran through the num@@ bers myself .
"@@ 3@@ 00 people have to take the dru@@ g for a year before one heart atta@@ ck , str@@ oke or other ad@@ verse ev@@ ent is pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 3@@ 00 chan@@ ce of lo@@ wer@@ ing my cho@@ le@@ ste@@ ro@@ l ."
"W@@ hy not , do@@ c ? G@@ ive me the pre@@ scri@@ ption any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another st@@ at@@ is@@ tic , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side effe@@ cts . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"So for this particular dru@@ g , the side effe@@ cts oc@@ cu@@ r in five percent of the patients ."
You &apos;re 15 times more like@@ ly to be har@@ med by the dru@@ g than you are to be hel@@ p@@ ed by the dru@@ g .
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the st@@ at@@ in or not ."
I &apos;m just saying you should have this con@@ vers@@ ation with your doc@@ tor .
"M@@ ed@@ ical e@@ th@@ ics requ@@ i@@ res it , it &apos;s part of the prin@@ ci@@ ple of in@@ for@@ med con@@ sen@@ t ."
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to be@@ gin the con@@ vers@@ ation about whether you want to take the ris@@ ks or not .
"Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve p@@ ul@@ led this number out of the air for sho@@ ck val@@ ue , but in fact it &apos;s rather typ@@ ical , this number needed to tre@@ at ."
"For the most w@@ ide@@ ly perfor@@ med sur@@ ger@@ y on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the pr@@ os@@ tate for cancer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ p@@ ed ."
And the side effe@@ cts in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
"They inclu@@ de im@@ poten@@ ce , e@@ rec@@ ti@@ le d@@ ys@@ fun@@ ction , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ tal te@@ ar@@ ing , fe@@ c@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re lu@@ c@@ ky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
So the idea of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think a@@ head of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will p@@ us@@ h the con@@ vers@@ ation for@@ ward .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the s@@ po@@ t .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
"Because you have a cho@@ ice of@@ ten@@ times , do you I want a sh@@ or@@ ter life that &apos;s pain@@ -@@ free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pa@@ in to@@ wards the end ?"
"These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your lo@@ ved ones ."
"You might change your mind in the he@@ at of the moment , but at least you &apos;re pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed with this kind of thinking ."
"@@ Re@@ member , our brain under stre@@ ss re@@ lea@@ ses cor@@ t@@ is@@ o@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bun@@ ch on systems shu@@ t down ."
There &apos;s an ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
"F@@ ace@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ dat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your dig@@ est@@ ive system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ m@@ une system , because if you &apos;re body is ex@@ pen@@ ding me@@ ta@@ b@@ ol@@ ism on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the l@@ ion &apos;s l@@ un@@ ch , and then n@@ one of those things matter ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , one of the things that goes out the win@@ do@@ w during those times of stre@@ ss is r@@ ational , logical thinking , as D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es have sho@@ wn ."
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of s@@ itu@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ z@@ ing that all of us are f@@ la@@ wed .
We all are going to f@@ ai@@ l now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fail@@ ures might be , to put systems in place that will help min@@ im@@ ize the da@@ ma@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"@@ G@@ et@@ ting back to that s@@ no@@ w@@ y night in M@@ on@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my con@@ trac@@ tor inst@@ all a com@@ bin@@ ation lo@@ ck next to the do@@ or , with a key to the front do@@ or in it , an easy to remember com@@ bin@@ ation ."
"And I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I still have p@@ il@@ es of ma@@ il that ha@@ ven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and p@@ il@@ es of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s that I ha@@ ven &apos;t gone through ."
"So I &apos;m not completely organiz@@ ed , but I see organiz@@ ation as a gra@@ du@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Goo@@ d mor@@ ning !
A@@ re you a@@ wake ?
"They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did any@@ one here write their name on the ta@@ g in Ar@@ ab@@ ic ?"
"A@@ n@@ yone ! No one ? All right , no problem ."
"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food ."
"So I looked at the wa@@ it@@ er and said , &quot; D@@ o you have a men@@ u ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) ? &quot;"
"He looked at me st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ e@@ ard ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry ? ( En@@ gl@@ ish ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , p@@ lease . &quot; &quot; He re@@ p@@ li@@ ed , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( En@@ gl@@ ish ) , or &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( F@@ ren@@ ch ) . &quot; &quot; I@@ s the F@@ ren@@ ch pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation cor@@ re@@ ct ?"
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ome , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ it@@ er ."
"He was dis@@ g@@ us@@ ted when talking to me , as if he was saying to him@@ self , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;"
What &apos;s the me@@ an@@ ing of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in Ar@@ ab@@ ic ?
T@@ wo words made a Le@@ ban@@ ese young man ju@@ dge a girl as being bac@@ k@@ ward and ig@@ nor@@ ant .
How could she speak that way ?
"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It de@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly h@@ ur@@ ts !
I &apos;m de@@ ni@@ ed the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
W@@ here could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a stage in their lives , where they inv@@ ol@@ un@@ tari@@ ly give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re mo@@ der@@ n and ci@@ vil@@ ized ."
"S@@ hou@@ ld I for@@ get all my culture , th@@ ough@@ ts , inte@@ l@@ le@@ ct and all my memor@@ ies ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ho@@ od stories might be the best memor@@ ies we have of the war !
"S@@ hou@@ ld I for@@ get everything I learned in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , just to con@@ form ?"
T@@ o be one of them ?
W@@ here &apos;s the logi@@ c in that ?
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ dge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ ged me .
The Ar@@ ab@@ ic language doesn &apos;t sat@@ is@@ f@@ y today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in uni@@ vers@@ ities , a language we use in the wor@@ k@@ place , a language we rely on if we were to per@@ form an adv@@ an@@ ced research project , and it de@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ por@@ t ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d st@@ ri@@ p us of our clo@@ the@@ s ."
"W@@ here can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !@@ "
"So , you want us to use Ar@@ ab@@ ic . W@@ here are we to do so ?"
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Ar@@ ab@@ ic is the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
Re@@ search says that mas@@ ter@@ y of other langu@@ ag@@ es de@@ man@@ ds mas@@ ter@@ y of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e .
M@@ as@@ ter@@ y of the mother ton@@ gu@@ e is a pre@@ requ@@ is@@ ite for cre@@ ative ex@@ pres@@ sion in other langu@@ ag@@ es .
How ?
"@@ G@@ i@@ br@@ an K@@ ha@@ li@@ l G@@ i@@ br@@ an , when he first started wr@@ iting , he used Ar@@ ab@@ ic ."
"A@@ ll his ideas , ima@@ gin@@ ation and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hy were insp@@ i@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the vil@@ la@@ ge where he gre@@ w up , s@@ me@@ lling a speci@@ fic s@@ me@@ ll , he@@ ar@@ ing a speci@@ fic vo@@ ice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started wr@@ iting in En@@ gl@@ ish , he had enough ba@@ g@@ ga@@ ge ."
"E@@ ven when he wr@@ ote in En@@ gl@@ ish , when you read his writ@@ ings in En@@ gl@@ ish , you s@@ me@@ ll the same s@@ me@@ ll , sense the same feel@@ ing ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him wr@@ iting in En@@ gl@@ ish , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ rom a vil@@ la@@ ge on M@@ oun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can ar@@ gu@@ e with ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , it &apos;s often said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its language ."
This is a reality that develop@@ ed soci@@ e@@ ties are a@@ ware of .
"The G@@ er@@ man@@ s , F@@ ren@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Chin@@ ese , all these n@@ ations are a@@ ware of this ."
That &apos;s why they le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ate to prote@@ ct their language .
They make it sa@@ cre@@ d .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produc@@ tion , they pa@@ y a lot of money to develo@@ p it ."
D@@ o we know better than them ?
"A@@ ll right , we ar@@ en &apos;t from the develop@@ ed world , this adv@@ an@@ ced thinking has@@ n &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us yet , and we would like to c@@ at@@ ch up with the ci@@ vil@@ ized world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to st@@ ri@@ ve for develop@@ ment , do research , and c@@ at@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ a and others , they car@@ ri@@ ed their language with them as they were cl@@ im@@ b@@ ing the l@@ ad@@ der , prote@@ cted it like a di@@ am@@ on@@ d ."
They ke@@ pt it close to them .
"Because if you get any produ@@ ct from T@@ ur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not la@@ be@@ led in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local produ@@ ct ."
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produ@@ ct .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ sum@@ ers , cl@@ ue@@ less con@@ sum@@ ers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and produ@@ ce , they had to prote@@ ct their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom , so@@ ve@@ re@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ den@@ ce ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t r@@ ing a be@@ ll , does it ?"
"@@ Re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for con@@ vers@@ ing , just words coming out of our mou@@ ths ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age re@@ presen@@ ts speci@@ fic sta@@ ges in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ o@@ logy that is lin@@ ked to our emot@@ ions ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom , so@@ ve@@ re@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ den@@ ce , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a speci@@ fic image in their own mind , there are speci@@ fic feel@@ ings of a speci@@ fic day in a speci@@ fic his@@ tor@@ ical peri@@ od ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or le@@ t@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that re@@ la@@ tes to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our inte@@ l@@ le@@ ct ?
How do you say whether this guy under@@ stan@@ ds or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom , so@@ ve@@ re@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depen@@ den@@ ce ( En@@ gl@@ ish ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the peri@@ od of the f@@ ree@@ dom ( En@@ gl@@ ish ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ a@@ in ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a f@@ ran@@ c@@ op@@ h@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ ed to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is f@@ ine , but once , I spent a whole night as@@ king and trying to trans@@ l@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ ni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to expla@@ in it to him ."
He was pu@@ z@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
D@@ o@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ ic@@ ide ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ury me ? &apos; ( En@@ gl@@ ish ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exam@@ ples .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"S@@ he said to me , &quot; &quot; He lis@@ ten@@ s to F@@ a@@ iru@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to trans@@ l@@ ate for him so he can feel what I feel when I lis@@ ten to F@@ a@@ iru@@ z . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tried to trans@@ l@@ ate this for him : &quot; F@@ rom them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my hands and sto@@ le you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you be@@ long to them , I re@@ turned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )@@ "
T@@ ran@@ sl@@ ate that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prote@@ ct the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the ci@@ vi@@ l society , and we la@@ un@@ ched a cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?"
F@@ or@@ get about this he@@ a@@ da@@ ch@@ e and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pre@@ ser@@ ve Ar@@ ab@@ ic la@@ un@@ ched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ p@@ ly from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not ac@@ cept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be under@@ sto@@ od ."
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I h@@ ate the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced in a way that re@@ f@@ lec@@ ts our dre@@ ams , as@@ p@@ ir@@ ations and da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that dre@@ s@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ p@@ ly from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the s@@ po@@ t ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very easy , yet cre@@ ative and per@@ su@@ as@@ ive ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we la@@ un@@ ched another cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with sc@@ en@@ es of le@@ t@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a sc@@ en@@ e of a le@@ t@@ ter sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by black and ye@@ l@@ low t@@ ape with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t k@@ ill your language ! &quot; &quot; writ@@ ten on it ."
"W@@ hy ? S@@ er@@ i@@ ously , don &apos;t k@@ ill your language ."
We really shou@@ ldn &apos;t k@@ ill our language .
"If we were to k@@ ill the language , we &apos;d have to find an iden@@ t@@ ity ."
We &apos;d have to find an ex@@ is@@ ten@@ ce .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ yon@@ d just mis@@ sing our chan@@ ce of being mo@@ der@@ n and ci@@ vil@@ ized .
A@@ f@@ ter that we re@@ lea@@ sed photo@@ s of guys and girls we@@ ar@@ ing the Ar@@ ab@@ ic le@@ t@@ ter .
Ph@@ oto@@ s of &quot; &quot; c@@ ool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very c@@ ool !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an En@@ gl@@ ish word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I ad@@ op@@ t the word &apos; c@@ ool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them ob@@ ject ho@@ we@@ ver they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( La@@ ugh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t f@@ it ! We shou@@ ldn &apos;t ki@@ d ourselves .
"But to re@@ ach this point , we all have to be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that we shou@@ ldn &apos;t al@@ low any@@ one who is big@@ ger or thin@@ ks they have any au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want ."
C@@ re@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is the idea .
"So , if we can &apos;t re@@ ach space or build a ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t and so on , we can be cre@@ ative ."
"A@@ t this moment , every one of you is a cre@@ ative project ."
C@@ re@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in your mother ton@@ gu@@ e is the pat@@ h .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a no@@ vel or produ@@ ce a sh@@ ort fil@@ m .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could bring the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !@@ "
"But we have to know that , and be con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that a solution ex@@ ists , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution ."
"In con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , what can you do today ?"
"Now , t@@ wee@@ ts , who &apos;s t@@ wee@@ ting ?"
"P@@ lease , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fin@@ i@@ shed , ei@@ ther Ar@@ ab@@ ic , En@@ gl@@ ish , F@@ ren@@ ch or Chin@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t write Ar@@ ab@@ ic with L@@ at@@ in charac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with num@@ bers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a dis@@ as@@ ter ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a v@@ ir@@ tual world with a v@@ ir@@ tual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and r@@ ise .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"S@@ econ@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to con@@ v@@ ince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring atten@@ tion to the ne@@ cess@@ ity of pre@@ ser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a se@@ cre@@ t .
A bab@@ y first iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ies its father through language .
"When my da@@ ughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your da@@ d , hon@@ ey ( En@@ gl@@ ish ) . &quot; &quot; And in the super@@ market , I pr@@ om@@ ise my da@@ ughter N@@ o@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , Ma@@ man , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her ."
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get ri@@ d of this cul@@ tur@@ al cr@@ in@@ ge . ( Applause )
"S@@ us@@ tain@@ ability re@@ presen@@ ts the what , the where and the how of what is ca@@ ught ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
U@@ n@@ der@@ standing all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ oo@@ d away from a com@@ mod@@ ity to an opportunity to re@@ st@@ ore our e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem .
It allo@@ ws for us to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate the se@@ af@@ oo@@ d that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ oo@@ d .
"W@@ here su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to en@@ d@@ ure and ma@@ inta@@ in , re@@ stor@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ oo@@ d allo@@ ws for an ev@@ ol@@ ving and d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a re@@ source , sug@@ ge@@ sting that we enga@@ ge to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge its res@@ il@@ i@@ en@@ cy ."
"It is a more h@@ ope@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more u@@ se@@ ful way of under@@ standing our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ ide@@ s — stan@@ dar@@ d issue by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very han@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful too@@ l .
"@@ G@@ re@@ en , ye@@ l@@ low and red l@@ ists &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ oo@@ d species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y green , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think t@@ w@@ ice about ye@@ l@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green l@@ ist ."
We can &apos;t su@@ sta@@ in this without the me@@ a@@ sure of our suc@@ cess really chan@@ ging the f@@ ate of the species in the ye@@ l@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green l@@ ist ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ ca@@ ught ye@@ l@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in tun@@ a here — comes from su@@ sta@@ in@@ able sto@@ cks .
P@@ ole ca@@ ught — no b@@ y@@ c@@ at@@ ch .
G@@ re@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ u@@ pp@@ or@@ ting local econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a l@@ ion of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the con@@ text of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a ste@@ ak@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green l@@ ist , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fa@@ v@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a con@@ text , a ga@@ u@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ dan@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to d@@ rin@@ k so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prote@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it reg@@ ar@@ ds our food , and we are pa@@ ying a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost ben@@ e@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce of ex@@ pan@@ ding wa@@ is@@ t@@ l@@ ines .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ s@@ ter pro@@ f@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ oo@@ d is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ oo@@ d might best be re@@ presen@@ ted not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly G@@ re@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es : they might yet sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a l@@ ik@@ es to say that blu@@ e is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blu@@ e .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ oo@@ d possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ oo@@ d though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ mon we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of t@@ il@@ ap@@ ia bre@@ a@@ ded with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mus@@ t@@ ard and cr@@ is@@ p@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ c@@ ru@@ m@@ b@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of pe@@ can qu@@ ino@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ ill@@ ed bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mok@@ y on the outside with just a hin@@ t of chil@@ i fl@@ ake ."
W@@ ho@@ o@@ o !
This is an easy se@@ ll .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are av@@ a@@ il@@ able to every family at the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ ie O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a pat@@ tern here .
F@@ or@@ get nu@@ clear ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to han@@ dic@@ a@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expe@@ ct from our food .
S@@ us@@ tain@@ ability is com@@ plic@@ ated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement rec@@ ently in gre@@ en@@ ing our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and Al@@ ice W@@ a@@ ters are le@@ ad@@ ing pas@@ si@@ ona@@ tely the green food D@@ el@@ ic@@ ious R@@ ev@@ olution .
But green foo@@ ds often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ reg@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ a@@ ters .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ reg@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly sh@@ r@@ im@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any e@@ co@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly all@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ r@@ im@@ p bu@@ ffe@@ t .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ oo@@ d .
"W@@ hi@@ le we try to man@@ age de@@ cl@@ ining mar@@ ine pop@@ ul@@ ations , the media &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding incre@@ a@@ sed con@@ sum@@ ption of se@@ af@@ oo@@ d ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers , gr@@ and@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ oo@@ d ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not w@@ ill@@ ing to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ oo@@ d .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pla@@ tes .
"As a che@@ f , I realiz@@ e the eas@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ du@@ ce the por@@ tion s@@ iz@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"@@ People started bu@@ ying appe@@ t@@ iz@@ ers and s@@ al@@ ads , because they knew they we@@ ren &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es alone ."
"@@ People spent more time enga@@ ging in their me@@ als , enga@@ ging with each other over their me@@ als ."
"@@ People got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prote@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fied me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ v@@ iron@@ mental conside@@ r@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of conside@@ r@@ ation for human intere@@ sts at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was be@@ gin to di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ y the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , ma@@ c@@ ke@@ re@@ l , sar@@ d@@ ines were un@@ common ."
"S@@ he@@ ll@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , o@@ ys@@ ters , cl@@ ams , t@@ il@@ ap@@ ia , ch@@ ar — these were the common species ."
"We were di@@ rec@@ ting ta@@ ste@@ s to@@ wards more res@@ il@@ i@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fa@@ v@@ or .
This is what the green l@@ ist says .
But this is also how we can actually be@@ gin to re@@ st@@ ore our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those fa@@ shi@@ on@@ able species , that green l@@ ist tun@@ a that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
S@@ t@@ art with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pla@@ tes .
"M@@ ound up those four pla@@ tes with ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ gun@@ dy you have , light the can@@ d@@ les and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the opportunity you have to e@@ at this .
"I@@ n@@ v@@ ite your friends and ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I expe@@ ct a lot from food .
I expe@@ ct health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I expe@@ ct that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the commun@@ ion of human intere@@ sts ."
I was lu@@ c@@ ky enough that my father was a f@@ anta@@ stic c@@ ook .
And he ta@@ ught me very early on about the pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ presen@@ ts .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prote@@ in ser@@ ved with c@@ op@@ ious qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities of ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , usu@@ ally r@@ ice ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get s@@ ick when I go to ste@@ ak@@ hou@@ ses .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a han@@ go@@ ver from prote@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting .
"But of all the d@@ ire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ den of de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ o@@ le@@ some in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for but@@ ter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things tas@@ te less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ f@@ le@@ ct to my own person@@ al his@@ tor@@ ies ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first step to min@@ im@@ ize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our blu@@ e planet , our world ban@@ k ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our re@@ sources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hy of the commun@@ ion we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can be@@ gin to share the rest , we can be@@ gin to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate , we can be@@ gin to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ bl@@ es .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or sma@@ l@@ ler por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ oo@@ d .
And we need to sa@@ ve din@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an arch@@ ite@@ ct .
"I am the only arch@@ ite@@ ct in the world making buil@@ d@@ ings out of pap@@ er like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition is the first one I did using pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
"@@ 198@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about e@@ co@@ logical issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started te@@ sting the pap@@ er tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very com@@ plic@@ ated to test the new materi@@ al for the building , but this is much str@@ on@@ ger than I expe@@ cted , and also it &apos;s very easy to wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indus@@ tri@@ al materi@@ al , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the tem@@ por@@ ary structure , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first tem@@ por@@ ary building made out of pap@@ er .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ bes , di@@ ame@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; cent@@ ime@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ bes with a di@@ ame@@ ter of 1@@ 20 cent@@ ime@@ ters , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the ph@@ oto , inside is the to@@ il@@ et ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed with to@@ il@@ et pap@@ er , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very u@@ se@@ ful ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 20@@ 00 , there was a big ex@@ p@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the ex@@ p@@ o was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was cho@@ sen to build the pa@@ vil@@ ion out of pap@@ er tu@@ bes , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able pap@@ er ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"My go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vil@@ ions but after half a year , we create a lot of indus@@ tri@@ al was@@ te , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very lu@@ c@@ ky to w@@ in the compe@@ t@@ ition to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou C@@ en@@ ter in F@@ ran@@ ce in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to ren@@ t an off@@ ice in P@@ ar@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to P@@ ar@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ ar@@ is by ourselves ."
So we br@@ ought the pap@@ er tu@@ bes and the wo@@ o@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We sta@@ yed there for six years without pa@@ ying any ren@@ t .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a tic@@ ke@@ t to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou C@@ en@@ ter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very pop@@ ular mu@@ se@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ um@@ ent for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my pro@@ fe@@ s@@ sion as an arch@@ ite@@ ct , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged people , r@@ ich people , government , develo@@ per@@ s ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are inv@@ is@@ i@@ ble .
So they h@@ ire us to vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ en@@ tal arch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture .
"That is our pro@@ fe@@ s@@ sion , even his@@ tor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their hou@@ ses by natural dis@@ as@@ ters ."
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es never k@@ ill people , but col@@ l@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ d@@ ings k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of arch@@ ite@@ cts .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ por@@ ary hou@@ sing , but there are no arch@@ ite@@ cts working there because we are too bus@@ y working for pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged people ."
"So I thought , even as arch@@ ite@@ cts , we can be inv@@ olved in the re@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of tem@@ por@@ ary hou@@ sing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in dis@@ as@@ ter areas .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big dis@@ as@@ ter in R@@ wan@@ da , Africa ."
"T@@ wo tri@@ bes , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ s@@ i , f@@ ought each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so sur@@ pri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are f@@ ree@@ z@@ ing with bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just pro@@ vi@@ ding a pla@@ stic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to c@@ ut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people c@@ ut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started pro@@ vi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ r@@ ac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y ex@@ pen@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then cu@@ tting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ po@@ sed my idea to impro@@ ve the s@@ itu@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed pap@@ er tu@@ bes because this is so che@@ a@@ p and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.S@@ . dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the d@@ ur@@ ability and mo@@ is@@ ture and ter@@ mit@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kill@@ ed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ ata dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ t , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fir@@ e after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was tot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ po@@ sed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of pap@@ er tu@@ bes ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you cra@@ z@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fir@@ e , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tr@@ us@@ ted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started com@@ mu@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or pla@@ stic sh@@ ee@@ ts in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ po@@ sed to re@@ build . I rai@@ sed — did fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a pap@@ er tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ l@@ ish , I used be@@ er cra@@ tes as a f@@ oun@@ dat@@ ion ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ p@@ ose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ hi be@@ er company made their pla@@ stic be@@ er cra@@ tes red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
The col@@ or co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were expe@@ c@@ ting to have a be@@ er inside the pla@@ stic be@@ er cr@@ ate , but it came em@@ p@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tr@@ us@@ ted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you col@@ le@@ ct money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to sta@@ y there for three years , but actually it sta@@ yed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ po@@ sed to don@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we sen@@ t them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It sta@@ yed there in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ por@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in pap@@ er can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ por@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local materi@@ al to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka , after the S@@ u@@ ma@@ tr@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and tsu@@ nam@@ i , I re@@ built I@@ sl@@ am@@ ic fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s vil@@ la@@ ges ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in C@@ hen@@ g@@ d@@ u , S@@ i@@ chu@@ an area in China , ne@@ arly 7@@ 0,000 people were kill@@ ed , and also es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally many of the s@@ cho@@ ols were de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed because of the cor@@ ru@@ ption between the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and the con@@ trac@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I br@@ ought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chin@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted nin@@ e clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s , over 500 squ@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the curren@@ t ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting ph@@ oto : for@@ mer P@@ r@@ ime M@@ in@@ is@@ ter B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer P@@ r@@ ime M@@ in@@ is@@ ter M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pr@@ ime min@@ is@@ ter ever year ."
"And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ po@@ sed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ por@@ ary music ha@@ ll , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fam@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t ha@@ lls were de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed , so mus@@ ic@@ ians were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ po@@ sed to the ma@@ y@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lu@@ c@@ ky ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i br@@ ought G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our for@@ mer pr@@ ime min@@ is@@ ter came , so they hel@@ p@@ ed us to col@@ le@@ ct money , and I got half a million e@@ ur@@ os from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Ye@@ ar 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s imp@@ os@@ sible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , ne@@ x@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ it@@ i with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and tsu@@ nam@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no pri@@ v@@ acy .
People su@@ f@@ fer men@@ t@@ ally and phys@@ ically .
"So we went there to build part@@ iti@@ ons with all the studen@@ t vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with pap@@ er tu@@ bes , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fr@@ ame and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , some of the fac@@ ility au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really ne@@ cess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at area to build stan@@ dar@@ d government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story hou@@ sing like this one .
"L@@ ook at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vi@@ l government is doing such po@@ or con@@ stru@@ ction of the tem@@ por@@ ary hou@@ sing , so den@@ se and so mes@@ s@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is le@@ aking , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ po@@ sed to the ma@@ y@@ or while I was making part@@ iti@@ ons .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very n@@ ice ma@@ y@@ or in O@@ na@@ gawa vil@@ la@@ ge in M@@ iy@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build th@@ ree@@ -@@ story hou@@ sing on ba@@ se@@ b@@ all &#91; fi@@ el@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shipp@@ ing con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ p@@ ed us to make all the building fur@@ nit@@ ure to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to sta@@ y here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also kill@@ ed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ d@@ r@@ al of the city , the sym@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was tot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ca@@ the@@ d@@ r@@ al .
So this is under con@@ stru@@ ction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ um@@ ents that are be@@ lo@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ists , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ r@@ ational , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the per@@ spe@@ ctive of another person or understand cause and effe@@ ct ."
"In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most br@@ il@@ li@@ ant scientists ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ de@@ st for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feel@@ ing ."
And maybe the har@@ de@@ st thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ yone who &apos;s follo@@ wed polit@@ ics can te@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three ye@@ ar-@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ous@@ ness mono@@ lo@@ gu@@ e about pon@@ ies and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the se@@ cre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of de@@ l@@ ic@@ ious go@@ l@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ac@@ kers ."
"Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ le@@ y , like the cr@@ ac@@ kers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little tas@@ te of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she l@@ ik@@ ed it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she l@@ ik@@ ed the cr@@ ac@@ kers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other san@@ e person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I tas@@ ted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ac@@ kers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , yu@@ ck , cr@@ ac@@ kers ."
"I tas@@ ted the cr@@ ac@@ kers . E@@ w@@ w , yu@@ ck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the bab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they l@@ ik@@ ed or what she l@@ ik@@ ed ?"
"And the re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble thing was that 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies , just b@@ are@@ ly wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers if she l@@ ik@@ ed the cr@@ ac@@ kers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she l@@ ik@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she l@@ ik@@ ed the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble things about this .
"The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies have already disco@@ vered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mar@@ ka@@ bly though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this sug@@ ge@@ sts that these 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this dee@@ p , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundre@@ ds and hundre@@ ds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demon@@ stra@@ ted it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a sh@@ ort time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies super@@ fici@@ ally , they see@@ m pretty u@@ se@@ less ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than u@@ se@@ less , because we have to put so much time and energy into just kee@@ ping them al@@ ive ."
"But if we turn to ev@@ olution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of u@@ se@@ less bab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pr@@ ima@@ tes , but also inclu@@ ding other mam@@ ma@@ ls , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ supi@@ als like kan@@ gar@@ oo@@ s and wom@@ b@@ ats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ par@@ ed to their bo@@ dies and how smar@@ t and f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a New C@@ al@@ e@@ don@@ ian c@@ row .
"And c@@ ro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , ro@@ ok@@ s and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly smar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as smar@@ t as ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es in some re@@ spe@@ cts .
And this is a b@@ ird on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a too@@ l to get food .
"O@@ n the other hand , we have our friend the dom@@ est@@ ic ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
And ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as d@@ um@@ b as d@@ um@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at pe@@ c@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the bab@@ ies , the New C@@ al@@ e@@ don@@ ian c@@ row bab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They de@@ p@@ end on their mom@@ s to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open mou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a b@@ ird ."
W@@ he@@ re@@ as the ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s are actually ma@@ ture within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is the reason why the c@@ ro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s end up in the sou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od that seem@@ s to be conne@@ cted to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the ch@@ ic@@ ken , see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well ."
So they see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to pe@@ c@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ ures , like the c@@ ro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extre@@ me@@ ly good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the dis@@ tribu@@ tion like the c@@ ro@@ ws ."
We have big@@ ger bra@@ ins rel@@ ative to our bo@@ dies by far than any other anima@@ l .
"We &apos;re smar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we survi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mig@@ ra@@ ted to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our bab@@ ies and children are depen@@ den@@ t on us for much longer than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still pop@@ ping those wor@@ ms into those little open mou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ rel@@ ation ?"
"Well an idea is that that stra@@ te@@ gy , that learning stra@@ te@@ gy , is an extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , great stra@@ te@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge ."
"And that one big dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ ge is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ p@@ less ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ sto@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ sho@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . W@@ h@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ sto@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the ev@@ olu@@ tions seem@@ s to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early peri@@ od when we &apos;re completely prote@@ cted .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as ad@@ ul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develop@@ ment di@@ vision of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prote@@ cted blu@@ e s@@ ky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and marke@@ ting ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like de@@ fe@@ ctive grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like ca@@ ter@@ p@@ ill@@ ars and but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies — ex@@ cept that they &apos;re actually the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the gar@@ den and expl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the ca@@ ter@@ p@@ ill@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our nar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , ad@@ ult pat@@ h ."
"If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to learn — and this ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expe@@ ct that they would have really powerful learning me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain seem@@ s to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ v@@ olution in our under@@ standing of machine learning rec@@ ently .
"And it all depen@@ ds on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ve@@ re@@ nd Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s B@@ a@@ y@@ es , who was a st@@ at@@ is@@ tic@@ ian and ma@@ the@@ matic@@ ian in the 18@@ th century ."
"And essen@@ ti@@ ally what B@@ a@@ y@@ es did was to pro@@ vi@@ de a ma@@ the@@ matic@@ al way using prob@@ ability the@@ ory to charac@@ teri@@ ze , descri@@ be , the way that scientists find out about the world ."
So what scientists do is they have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that they think might be like@@ ly to start with .
They go out and test it against the ev@@ idence .
The ev@@ idence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ a@@ y@@ es sho@@ wed was a ma@@ the@@ matic@@ al way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ the@@ matic@@ s is at the c@@ ore of the best machine learning pro@@ gr@@ ams that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I sug@@ ge@@ sted that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ve@@ re@@ nd B@@ a@@ y@@ es &apos;s no@@ te@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making com@@ plic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations with con@@ diti@@ onal prob@@ ab@@ il@@ ities that they &apos;re re@@ vis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might see@@ m like an even tal@@ ler order to actually demon@@ str@@ ate ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about st@@ at@@ is@@ tics , they look extre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ pi@@ d ."
How could it be that children are doing st@@ at@@ is@@ tics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ l@@ ic@@ ke@@ t De@@ te@@ c@@ tor .
This is a box that l@@ ights up and pla@@ ys music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ zen@@ s of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world ."
"@@ Let me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ma@@ r K@@ u@@ sh@@ ner , my studen@@ t ."
"If I sho@@ wed you this de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , you would be like@@ ly to think to be@@ gin with that the way to make the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor go would be to put a blo@@ ck on top of the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor ."
"But actually , this de@@ te@@ c@@ tor works in a bit of a st@@ range way ."
"Because if you wa@@ ve a blo@@ ck over the top of the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to be@@ gin with , the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor will actually activ@@ ate two out of three times ."
"W@@ he@@ re@@ as , if you do the like@@ ly thing , put the blo@@ ck on the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , it will only activ@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ like@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is actually has str@@ on@@ ger ev@@ idence .
It looks as if the wa@@ ving is a more effe@@ ctive stra@@ te@@ gy than the other stra@@ te@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds this pat@@ tern of ev@@ idence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds used the ev@@ idence to wa@@ ve the ob@@ ject on top of the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite com@@ plic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations that will give them a con@@ diti@@ onal prob@@ ability me@@ a@@ sure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that ev@@ idence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is about the world , that seem@@ s very un@@ like@@ ly to be@@ gin with ."
"And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , sim@@ il@@ ar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ like@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is than ad@@ ul@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same tas@@ k ."
"So in these cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces , the children are using st@@ at@@ is@@ tics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
W@@ hen children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; pla@@ ying . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bun@@ ch of interesting stu@@ dies rec@@ ently that have sho@@ wn this pla@@ ying around is really a kind of experim@@ en@@ tal research pro@@ gram .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ris@@ t@@ ine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ris@@ t@@ ine did was use our B@@ l@@ ic@@ ke@@ t De@@ te@@ c@@ tors .
"And what she did was show children that ye@@ l@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ wed them an ano@@ ma@@ ly ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ideo ) B@@ o@@ y : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ lis@@ on G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : O@@ kay , so his first hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is has just been f@@ al@@ si@@ fied ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : This one l@@ igh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ en@@ tal no@@ te@@ book out ."
B@@ o@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scient@@ ist will recogni@@ ze that ex@@ pres@@ sion of de@@ sp@@ air .
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is two ."
B@@ o@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ en@@ ter to do this , to try pu@@ tting it out onto the other loc@@ ation ."
N@@ ot working ei@@ ther .
"B@@ o@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ to@@ m of this box has electr@@ ic@@ ity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electr@@ ic@@ ity ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
B@@ o@@ y : It &apos;s l@@ igh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
"Now that is a partic@@ ul@@ arly — that is a partic@@ ul@@ arly ad@@ or@@ able and ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ris@@ t@@ ine disco@@ vered is this is actually quite typ@@ ical ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expla@@ in something , what they really do is do a seri@@ es of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty typ@@ ical of four ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these br@@ il@@ li@@ ant but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who can test five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ists and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were b@@ are@@ ly consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how ad@@ ult consci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And ad@@ ul@@ ts &apos; atten@@ tion and consci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a sp@@ ot@@ light .
"So what happens for ad@@ ul@@ ts is we de@@ ci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ le@@ v@@ ant or important , we should pa@@ y atten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ ur consci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to be@@ comes extre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we pa@@ y atten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ nal that makes a little part of our brain much more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , more pla@@ stic , better at learning , and shu@@ ts down activ@@ ity in all the rest of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very foc@@ used , pur@@ po@@ se@@ -@@ dri@@ ven kind of atten@@ tion ."
"If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think bab@@ ies and young children see@@ m to have more of a lan@@ tern of consci@@ ous@@ ness than a sp@@ ot@@ light of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at nar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re flo@@ o@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ mit@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and pla@@ st@@ ic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory parts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at pa@@ ying atten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not pa@@ ying atten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of atten@@ tion , the kind of consci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might expe@@ ct from those but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who are desig@@ ned to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a tas@@ te of that kind of bab@@ y consci@@ ous@@ ness as ad@@ ul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about ca@@ ses where we &apos;re put in a new s@@ itu@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ous@@ ness con@@ trac@@ ts , it ex@@ pan@@ ds , so that those three days in P@@ ar@@ is see@@ m to be more full of consci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ ffe@@ e , that wonderful co@@ ffe@@ e you &apos;ve been d@@ rin@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually m@@ im@@ ics the effe@@ ct of those bab@@ y neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ mit@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in P@@ ar@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three dou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a f@@ anta@@ stic way to be , but it does te@@ nd to leave you wak@@ ing up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )@@ "
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and cr@@ oss the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of ef@@ for@@ t into making bab@@ ies think like ad@@ ul@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies , to have open@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , ima@@ gin@@ ation , cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity , innov@@ ation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the ad@@ ul@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner .
And this is the name of my cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"In N@@ o@@ ve@@ m@@ ber of 200@@ 3 , I was inv@@ ited to take part in the la@@ un@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ dat@@ ion — that is his HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ oun@@ dat@@ ion ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a had when he was imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en I@@ s@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ sou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ stage , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the art@@ ists were inv@@ ited to jo@@ in M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en I@@ s@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce to the world &apos;s pre@@ ss , standing in front of his for@@ mer pris@@ on cell ."
You can see the b@@ ars of the win@@ do@@ w there .
It was quite a mom@@ en@@ tou@@ s oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a told the world &apos;s pre@@ ss that there was a v@@ ir@@ tual gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that pos@@ t-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id R@@ ain@@ bo@@ w N@@ ation , a th@@ ous@@ and people were d@@ ying on a dai@@ ly bas@@ is and that the front line v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge imp@@ act on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realized that the HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c was di@@ rec@@ tly a@@ ffe@@ c@@ ting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ ou@@ th Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ e@@ to@@ wn , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I partic@@ i@@ pa@@ ted in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ces , inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws , talking and using my pl@@ at@@ form as a mus@@ ic@@ ian , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a — out of re@@ spe@@ ct for the tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world re@@ spe@@ cts N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a , everyone re@@ ve@@ res N@@ el@@ son M@@ an@@ de@@ l@@ a ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ ou@@ th Africa , his country , the country that had one of the hig@@ he@@ st in@@ c@@ iden@@ ts of trans@@ mis@@ sion of the v@@ iru@@ s ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sho@@ c@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ ma@@ t , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , an incredi@@ ble cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner and activ@@ ist ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was we@@ ar@@ ing a t-@@ shir@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a too@@ l — this te@@ lls you I am in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV ."
"And in a way because of the st@@ ig@@ ma , by we@@ ar@@ ing this t-@@ shir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a member of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and I &apos;m very pr@@ oud to be a member of that incredi@@ ble organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gr@@ as@@ s@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are HI@@ V@@ -@@ pos@@ itive ."
They work in the field .
They have tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living di@@ rec@@ tly with the effe@@ cts of the v@@ iru@@ s .
They have education pro@@ gr@@ ams .
They bring out the issu@@ es of st@@ ig@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite ex@@ tra@@ ordinary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n has supp@@ or@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n in the way that I have tried to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have man@@ ag@@ ed to ra@@ ise has gone di@@ rec@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ ction C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and the incredi@@ ble work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ ou@@ th Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to supp@@ ort me .
I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"H@@ ere I am in O@@ sl@@ o in Nor@@ way , getting a n@@ ice , f@@ at che@@ ck ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In J@@ o@@ han@@ ne@@ s@@ bur@@ g , I had the opportunity to play to a main@@ ly white , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s S@@ ou@@ th Afr@@ ican au@@ dience who en@@ ded up in te@@ ars because I use fil@@ m c@@ li@@ ps that really tou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this ter@@ ri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ oi@@ d , because they are f@@ at@@ igu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solu@@ tions are ."
"A@@ ar@@ on M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the curren@@ t health min@@ is@@ ter , atten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opportunity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his absolu@@ te comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolu@@ tely ne@@ cess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ t@@ ish P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an env@@ o@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and HIV .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ g@@ h with the wonderful Afr@@ ican Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s C@@ ho@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ p@@ han@@ ed because of their family being a@@ ffe@@ cted by the A@@ I@@ D@@ S v@@ iru@@ s ."
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with M@@ ich@@ el S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the di@@ rec@@ tor of U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very hon@@ ore@@ d by the fact that M@@ ich@@ el inv@@ ited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing my pl@@ at@@ form and bro@@ a@@ den@@ ing my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The mes@@ sage that U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S are curren@@ tly sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the v@@ ir@@ tual el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of the trans@@ mis@@ sion of the v@@ iru@@ s from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ed with polit@@ ical will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ g@@ nan@@ t woman , who is HIV pos@@ itive and we &apos;re s@@ mil@@ ing , both of us are s@@ mil@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ f@@ ident , because we know that that young woman is re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the bab@@ y she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her bab@@ y will re@@ ce@@ ive P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that bab@@ y can be born free of the v@@ iru@@ s ."
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the A@@ I@@ D@@ S pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me whe@@ re@@ ver I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she re@@ presen@@ ts one of mil@@ lions of HIV / A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ p@@ han@@ s .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had HIV v@@ iru@@ s — she died from A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ re@@ la@@ ted ill@@ ness .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the v@@ iru@@ s , she was born with the v@@ iru@@ s ."
"And here she is at seven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one ye@@ ar-@@ old bab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing with fu@@ ll@@ -@@ blo@@ wn A@@ I@@ D@@ S and had p@@ ne@@ u@@ mon@@ ia ."
We met her in a hos@@ p@@ ital in the E@@ as@@ tern C@@ ape and spent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very speci@@ al nu@@ tr@@ iti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hos@@ p@@ ital — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survi@@ ve .
"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emot@@ i@@ onal en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feel@@ ing very re@@ son@@ ant with this di@@ re@@ ct experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ ive months later , we went back to S@@ ou@@ th Africa to me@@ et A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the ha@@ ir@@ s on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the ha@@ ir@@ s on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ formation that took place .
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it ex@@ tra@@ ordinary ?
( Applause ) That r@@ ound of ap@@ plause is actually for the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the hos@@ p@@ ital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ formation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the au@@ dience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nu@@ tr@@ ition and good med@@ ical care , and you believe that the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um De@@ velo@@ p@@ ment G@@ o@@ als , speci@@ fic@@ ally five and six , should be absolu@@ tely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa — could you p@@ lease stand up ."
"I think that &apos;s f@@ air to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the ha@@ ll ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was se@@ cre@@ tly moving a large ob@@ ject through a de@@ sol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ it@@ h it , they were h@@ op@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its n@@ ose was a sil@@ ver b@@ all with two ra@@ di@@ os inside .
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they la@@ un@@ ched their ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scientists wr@@ ote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ den days , expl@@ ore@@ rs like V@@ as@@ c@@ o da G@@ ama and C@@ ol@@ um@@ bu@@ s had the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up the ter@@ re@@ st@@ ri@@ al g@@ lo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to env@@ y us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about comple@@ ted ."
"It te@@ lls the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a resu@@ lt ."
"For days after the la@@ un@@ ch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vis@@ i@@ ble by ordinary c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , it insp@@ i@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the polit@@ ic@@ ians told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our en@@ e@@ my had be@@ a@@ ten us in science and technology , and that they could now atta@@ ck us with hy@@ dro@@ gen b@@ om@@ b@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le ."
All he@@ ll br@@ oke lo@@ ose .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sho@@ cks to h@@ it America — his@@ tori@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed the mis@@ si@@ le ga@@ p .
It ex@@ plo@@ ded an ar@@ ms r@@ ace .
It began the space r@@ ace .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gre@@ ss fun@@ ded huge we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ a@@ ses , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 200 nu@@ clear we@@ ap@@ ons to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ yon@@ d we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ a@@ ses .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ une 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ r@@ ill , where ten@@ s of mil@@ lions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ all@@ up P@@ o@@ ll that sho@@ wed that seven in 10 Amer@@ ic@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a nu@@ clear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kill@@ ed ."
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ u@@ pp@@ ort for engine@@ er@@ ing , ma@@ th and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led di@@ rec@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary shows how a free society can be sta@@ m@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also shows how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad s@@ itu@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ lea@@ sed .

I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvi@@ ous .
"H@@ a@@ ve they all a@@ gre@@ ed ? No , not completely ."

"@@ La@@ ter , I under@@ sto@@ od why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ wee@@ ts were a bri@@ be from a con@@ trac@@ tor who was trying to get my father to a@@ ward him a government con@@ tr@@ act .
"My father was respon@@ sible for building ro@@ ads in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r , and he had develop@@ ed a fir@@ m stan@@ ce against cor@@ ru@@ ption , even though he was har@@ as@@ sed and thre@@ a@@ ten@@ ed ."
"H@@ is was a lon@@ e@@ ly stru@@ g@@ gle , because B@@ i@@ ha@@ r was also India &apos;s most cor@@ ru@@ pt state , where public of@@ fici@@ als were en@@ ri@@ ching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the po@@ or who had no means to ex@@ pre@@ ss their an@@ gu@@ ish if their children had no food or no s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing ."

O@@ n@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This pro@@ found gi@@ ft of gener@@ os@@ ity challen@@ ged and changed the very pur@@ p@@ ose of my life .

It was B@@ i@@ ha@@ r all over again .
B@@ i@@ ha@@ r re@@ presen@@ ts the challenge of develop@@ ment : ab@@ ject po@@ ver@@ ty sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by cor@@ ru@@ ption .
"@@ G@@ lob@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ gan@@ da re@@ presen@@ ts the tra@@ diti@@ onal appro@@ ach to these problems that has been pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ ners of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I , 500 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ e@@ ly f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ the@@ red in New H@@ am@@ p@@ shir@@ e , U@@ S@@ A , to es@@ ta@@ bl@@ ish the B@@ re@@ t@@ ton W@@ oo@@ ds institu@@ tions , inclu@@ ding the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"And that tra@@ diti@@ onal appro@@ ach to develop@@ ment had three key ele@@ ments . F@@ ir@@ st , trans@@ fer of re@@ sources from r@@ ich countries in the Nor@@ th to po@@ ore@@ r countries in the S@@ ou@@ th , ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by re@@ form pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions ."
"And third , the enga@@ ge@@ ment in develop@@ ing countries was with a nar@@ row set of government e@@ lit@@ es with little inter@@ action with the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , who are the ul@@ t@@ imate ben@@ e@@ fici@@ ari@@ es of develop@@ ment as@@ sis@@ tan@@ ce ."
"T@@ o@@ day , each of these ele@@ ments is open@@ ing up du@@ e to dra@@ ma@@ tic changes in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en knowledge , open ai@@ d , open gover@@ nan@@ ce , and together , they re@@ present three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ for@@ ming develop@@ ment and that also hold gre@@ a@@ ter hope for the problems I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open knowledge .
"You know , develop@@ ing countries today will not simply ac@@ cept solu@@ tions that are han@@ ded down to them by the U.S@@ . , Eur@@ ope or the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"They get their insp@@ ir@@ ation , their hope , their pr@@ ac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from suc@@ cess@@ ful em@@ er@@ ging econom@@ ies in the S@@ ou@@ th ."
"They want to know how China li@@ f@@ ted 500 million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty in 30 years , how M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ por@@ t@@ uni@@ da@@ des pro@@ gram impro@@ ved s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing and nu@@ tr@@ ition for mil@@ lions of children ."
"This is the new e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem of open@@ -@@ knowledge flo@@ ws , not just tra@@ ve@@ ling Nor@@ th to S@@ ou@@ th , but S@@ ou@@ th to S@@ ou@@ th , and even S@@ ou@@ th to Nor@@ th , with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ por@@ t@@ uni@@ da@@ des today insp@@ ir@@ ing New York C@@ ity ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ ou@@ th trans@@ f@@ ers are open@@ ing up , so too are the develop@@ ment institu@@ tions that chan@@ ne@@ led these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
This is the second shi@@ ft : open ai@@ d .
"@@ Re@@ cent@@ ly , the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank open@@ ed its v@@ a@@ ult of data for public use , re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social in@@ dic@@ at@@ ors for 200 countries over 50 years , and it la@@ un@@ ched a global compe@@ t@@ ition to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ source innov@@ ative ap@@ ps using this data ."
De@@ velo@@ p@@ ment institu@@ tions today are also open@@ ing for public sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y the pro@@ jects they fin@@ ance .
"T@@ ake G@@ e@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ing . In this ma@@ p from K@@ en@@ ya , the red d@@ ots show where all the s@@ cho@@ ols fin@@ an@@ ced by don@@ ors are lo@@ ca@@ ted , and the dar@@ ker the sha@@ de of green , the more the number of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children ."
"So this simple ma@@ shu@@ p re@@ ve@@ als that don@@ ors have not fin@@ an@@ ced any s@@ cho@@ ols in the areas with the most out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ing new questions . I@@ s develop@@ ment as@@ sis@@ tan@@ ce tar@@ ge@@ ting those who most need our help ?"
This is a tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s lea@@ p for@@ ward in trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility of ai@@ d .
"And this lea@@ ds me to the third , and in my view , the most sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant shi@@ ft in develop@@ ment : open gover@@ nan@@ ce . G@@ over@@ n@@ ments today are open@@ ing up just as c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens are de@@ man@@ ding vo@@ ice and ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility ."
"F@@ rom the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ na H@@ a@@ z@@ are movement in India , using mo@@ bi@@ le p@@ hon@@ es and social media not just for polit@@ ical ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility but also for develop@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ ta@@ bility ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing serv@@ ices to the c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ?
"So for in@@ stan@@ ce , se@@ ver@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ as@@ tern Eur@@ ope are open@@ ing their bu@@ d@@ gets to the public ."
"But , you know , there is a big difference between a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s public and a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s ac@@ ces@@ sible ."
"This is a public bu@@ d@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really ac@@ ces@@ sible or under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to an ordinary c@@ it@@ izen that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ en@@ ding its re@@ sources ."
"T@@ o ta@@ c@@ k@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new to@@ ols to vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e the bu@@ d@@ get so it &apos;s more under@@ stan@@ d@@ able to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , the green col@@ or shows those dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ ts that have low sp@@ en@@ ding on s@@ cho@@ ols but good educ@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red col@@ or shows the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of in@@ sc@@ ru@@ table doc@@ um@@ ents into a pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ly under@@ stan@@ d@@ able vi@@ su@@ al , and what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that with this open@@ ness , there are today new opportun@@ ities for c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and enga@@ ge with government ."
"So in the Ph@@ il@@ ipp@@ ines today , parents and students can give re@@ al@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , C@@ he@@ c@@ k@@ m@@ ys@@ cho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"And the government is respon@@ sive . So for in@@ stan@@ ce , when it was re@@ por@@ ted on this we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that 8@@ 00 students were at risk because school re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s had st@@ all@@ ed du@@ e to cor@@ ru@@ ption , the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation in the Ph@@ il@@ ipp@@ ines took s@@ wi@@ ft action ."
"And you know what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that this innov@@ ation is now spre@@ ad@@ ing S@@ ou@@ th to S@@ ou@@ th , from the Ph@@ il@@ ipp@@ ines to In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , K@@ en@@ ya , M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a and be@@ yon@@ d ."
"In D@@ ar es S@@ al@@ a@@ am , T@@ an@@ zan@@ ia , even an im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed community was able to use these to@@ ols to vo@@ ice its as@@ p@@ ir@@ ations ."
"This is what the ma@@ p of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in A@@ ug@@ ust , 20@@ 11 . But within a few weeks , uni@@ versity students were able to use mo@@ bi@@ le p@@ hon@@ es and an open@@ -@@ source pl@@ at@@ form to dra@@ matic@@ ally ma@@ p the entire community inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
"And what is very exc@@ iting is that c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens were then able to give fe@@ ed@@ back as to which health or water poin@@ ts were not working , ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted in the red bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es that you see , which together pro@@ v@@ ide@@ s a grap@@ hi@@ c vi@@ su@@ al of the collec@@ tive vo@@ ices of the po@@ or ."
"T@@ o@@ day , even B@@ i@@ ha@@ r is tur@@ ning around and open@@ ing up under a comm@@ it@@ ted lea@@ der@@ ship that is making government trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ ces@@ sible and respon@@ sive to the po@@ or ."
"But , you know , in many parts of the world , govern@@ ments are not interested in open@@ ing up or in ser@@ ving the po@@ or , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system ."
"These are the lon@@ e@@ ly war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develop@@ ment work is to help these lon@@ e@@ ly war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"So for in@@ stan@@ ce , today , in G@@ han@@ a , cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous re@@ for@@ m@@ ers from ci@@ vi@@ l society , P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent and government , have for@@ ged a co@@ al@@ ition for trans@@ par@@ ent con@@ trac@@ ts in the oil se@@ c@@ tor , and , g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ized by this , re@@ for@@ m@@ ers in P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent are now inve@@ st@@ igat@@ ing du@@ bi@@ ous con@@ trac@@ ts ."
"These exam@@ ples give new hope , new possi@@ bility to the problems I wit@@ ne@@ s@@ sed in U@@ gan@@ da or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ wo years ago , on Ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very l@@ ate at night , and at age 80 , he was typ@@ ing a 7@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge public intere@@ st lit@@ ig@@ ation against cor@@ ru@@ ption in a ro@@ ad project ."
"Th@@ ough he was no la@@ w@@ y@@ er , he ar@@ gu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t him@@ self the next day . He won the ru@@ ling , but later that very ev@@ en@@ ing , he fe@@ ll , and he died ."
"He f@@ ought t@@ ill the end , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate that to com@@ b@@ at cor@@ ru@@ ption and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government of@@ fici@@ als need to be hon@@ est , but c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"These became the two book@@ ends of his life , and the jour@@ ney he tra@@ ve@@ led in between mir@@ ro@@ red the chan@@ ging develop@@ ment lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m insp@@ i@@ red by these changes , and I &apos;m exc@@ ited that at the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank , we are em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing these new di@@ rec@@ tions , a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ gan@@ da 20 years ago ."
"We need to ra@@ dic@@ ally open up develop@@ ment so knowledge flo@@ ws in mul@@ ti@@ ple di@@ rec@@ tions , insp@@ ir@@ ing pr@@ ac@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ ers , so ai@@ d be@@ comes trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and effe@@ ctive , so govern@@ ments open up and c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens are enga@@ ged and em@@ po@@ we@@ red with re@@ for@@ m@@ ers in government ."
We need to ac@@ ce@@ l@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .

H@@ and@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p is one of the most cos@@ t-@@ effe@@ ctive ways of sa@@ ving children &apos;s lives .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of sto@@ pp@@ ing 10 j@@ um@@ bo je@@ ts full of bab@@ ies and children from cra@@ shing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll a@@ gre@@ e with me that that &apos;s a pretty u@@ se@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a minu@@ te .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just shak@@ e their hands .
P@@ lease shak@@ e their hands .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sh@@ ook actually didn &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ il@@ et ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ re@@ tty yu@@ c@@ ky , you would a@@ gre@@ e with me ."
"Well , st@@ at@@ is@@ tics are actually sho@@ wing that four people out of five don &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they come out of the to@@ il@@ et , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got f@@ an@@ cy to@@ il@@ e@@ ts , run@@ ning water , and so@@ a@@ p av@@ a@@ il@@ able , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ tal@@ ity is really high ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ a@@ p ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ a@@ p is av@@ a@@ il@@ able ."
"In 90 percent of hou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of hou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds in K@@ en@@ ya , you will find so@@ a@@ p ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ a@@ p is the lo@@ we@@ st , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why ar@@ en &apos;t people wa@@ shing their hands ?
"W@@ hy is it that Ma@@ y@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t wa@@ shing his hands ?"
"Well , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for la@@ un@@ d@@ ry , so@@ a@@ p is used for wa@@ shing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mod@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t was@@ te it .
"O@@ n a@@ verage , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ a@@ p for wa@@ shing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for wa@@ shing hands with so@@ a@@ p ."
What &apos;s the resu@@ lt of that ?
"C@@ h@@ il@@ dren pic@@ k up disease in the place that &apos;s supp@@ o@@ sed to love them and prote@@ ct them the most , in their h@@ om@@ es ."
Th@@ in@@ k about where you learned to was@@ h your hands .
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ b@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , we all c@@ op@@ y what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tur@@ al nor@@ ms are something that sh@@ ape how we change our behavior , and this is where the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ c@@ tor comes in ."
"E@@ very second in A@@ si@@ a and Africa , 1@@ 11 mo@@ thers will bu@@ y this ba@@ r to prote@@ ct their family ."
"M@@ any women in India will tell you they learned all about hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , dise@@ a@@ ses , from this ba@@ r of so@@ a@@ p from L@@ i@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic b@@ ran@@ ds like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they se@@ ll their produc@@ ts .
"It &apos;s that beli@@ e@@ f , pl@@ us the scale of U@@ ni@@ le@@ ver , that allo@@ ws us to keep talking about han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
B@@ i@@ g bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses and b@@ ran@@ ds can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those ha@@ b@@ its that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ in@@ k about it : M@@ ar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into compe@@ lling mes@@ sa@@ ges ."
"@@ Just for a minu@@ te , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a mes@@ sage as powerful as han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p ."
The pro@@ f@@ it mot@@ ive is trans@@ for@@ ming health out@@ comes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for cent@@ ur@@ ies : the L@@ i@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and was la@@ un@@ ched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ tori@@ an En@@ g@@ land to actually com@@ b@@ at ch@@ ol@@ era .
"L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ han@@ a with the min@@ is@@ ter of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ bre@@ ak in G@@ han@@ a at the moment ."
"A hun@@ d@@ red and e@@ igh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this ba@@ r of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from spre@@ ad@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for pro@@ f@@ it is extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most comm@@ it@@ ted char@@ ity or government ."
"@@ G@@ over@@ n@@ ment is doing what they can , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in terms of the pan@@ de@@ m@@ ics and ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ics such as ch@@ ol@@ era , or E@@ b@@ ol@@ a at the moment , but with compe@@ ting pri@@ or@@ ities ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"And when you think about this , you think about what is requ@@ i@@ red to make han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing a dai@@ ly ha@@ bit , it requ@@ i@@ res su@@ sta@@ ined fun@@ ding to re@@ f@@ ine this behavior ."
"In sh@@ ort , those that f@@ ight for public health are actually depen@@ den@@ t up@@ on the so@@ a@@ p companies to keep pr@@ omot@@ ing han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p ."
"We have friends like U@@ S@@ A@@ I@@ D , the G@@ lob@@ al P@@ u@@ bl@@ ic@@ -@@ P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate P@@ art@@ ner@@ ship for H@@ and@@ wa@@ shing with S@@ o@@ a@@ p , L@@ on@@ don S@@ ch@@ ool of H@@ y@@ gi@@ en@@ e and T@@ ro@@ p@@ ical M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine , P@@ l@@ an , W@@ a@@ ter@@ A@@ id , that all believe for a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ w@@ in part@@ ner@@ ship ."
"W@@ in for the public se@@ c@@ tor , because we help them re@@ ach their tar@@ gets ."
"W@@ in for the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ c@@ tor , because we build new gener@@ ations of future han@@ d@@ wa@@ sh@@ ers ."
"And most importan@@ tly , w@@ in for the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able ."
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 15 , we will ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate G@@ lob@@ al H@@ and@@ wa@@ shing D@@ a@@ y ."
"S@@ cho@@ ols , commun@@ ities , our friends in the public se@@ c@@ tor and our friends in the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ c@@ tor — y@@ es , on that day even our compe@@ t@@ it@@ ors , we all jo@@ in hands to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate the world &apos;s most important public health inter@@ ven@@ tion ."
"What &apos;s requ@@ i@@ red , and again where the pri@@ v@@ ate se@@ c@@ tor can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , cre@@ ative thinking that dri@@ ves adv@@ oc@@ acy ."
"If you take our H@@ el@@ p a Ch@@ il@@ d R@@ each 5 cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , we &apos;ve created great fil@@ ms that bring the mes@@ sage of han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p to the every@@ day person in a way that can rel@@ ate to them ."
We &apos;ve had over 30 million vi@@ e@@ ws .
M@@ ost of these dis@@ cus@@ sions are still happening on@@ line .
I ur@@ ge you to take five minutes and look at those fil@@ ms .
"I come from M@@ al@@ i , one of the world &apos;s po@@ ore@@ st countries ."
I gre@@ w up in a family where every din@@ ner con@@ vers@@ ation was around social j@@ us@@ tic@@ e .
I tra@@ ined in Eur@@ ope &apos;s pre@@ mi@@ er school of public health .
"I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high de@@ gre@@ e in health , and the only one with a doc@@ tor@@ ate in han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ a@@ p ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ine years ago , I decided , with a suc@@ cess@@ ful public health care@@ er in the making , that I could make the big@@ gest imp@@ act coming , se@@ lling and pr@@ omot@@ ing the world &apos;s best inven@@ tion in public health : so@@ a@@ p ."
We run today the world &apos;s lar@@ gest han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing pro@@ gram by any public health stan@@ dar@@ ds .
We &apos;ve re@@ ach@@ ed over 18@@ 3 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the am@@ b@@ ition to re@@ ach one billion by 20@@ 20 .
"O@@ ver the last four years , business has gro@@ wn dou@@ ble dig@@ its , wh@@ il@@ st child mor@@ tal@@ ity has re@@ duc@@ ed in all the places where so@@ a@@ p use has incre@@ a@@ sed ."
It may be un@@ com@@ for@@ table for some to hear — business growth and lives sa@@ ved some@@ how equ@@ ated in the same sen@@ ten@@ ce — but it is that business growth that allo@@ ws us to keep doing more .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we cannot a@@ chi@@ eve the change that we need ."
"L@@ ast week , my team and I spent time vis@@ iting mo@@ thers that have all experi@@ en@@ ced the same thing : the death of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
I &apos;m a mo@@ m . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
"S@@ he had the most beautiful s@@ mi@@ le , the s@@ mi@@ le , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chan@@ ce ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ yo , is her second one ."
"S@@ he had a da@@ ughter who pas@@ sed away at three weeks , and we know that the maj@@ or@@ ity of children that actually die die in the first mon@@ th of their life , and we know that if we give a ba@@ r of so@@ a@@ p to every s@@ kill@@ ed bir@@ th atten@@ d@@ ant , and that if so@@ a@@ p is used before tou@@ ching the bab@@ ies , we can re@@ du@@ ce and make a change in terms of those num@@ bers ."
"And that &apos;s what insp@@ i@@ res me , insp@@ i@@ res me to contin@@ ue in this mis@@ sion , to know that I can equ@@ i@@ p her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing her ne@@ w@@ born ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : bu@@ y her so@@ a@@ p ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inven@@ tion in public health .
I hope you will jo@@ in us and make han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing part of your dai@@ ly lives and our dai@@ ly lives and help more children like M@@ yo re@@ ach their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
Thank you .

"These are simple ob@@ jects : c@@ loc@@ ks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , gl@@ as@@ ses ."
They are the things the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in B@@ os@@ ni@@ a car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their fin@@ al jour@@ ney .
"We are all famil@@ i@@ ar with these m@@ un@@ dan@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
The fact that some of the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s car@@ ri@@ ed person@@ al ite@@ ms such as too@@ th@@ pas@@ te and a too@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h is a clear sig@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for pris@@ on@@ ers of war ."
"These ite@@ ms have been reco@@ vered from num@@ er@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves across my h@@ om@@ el@@ and , and as we speak , fore@@ n@@ s@@ ics are ex@@ hum@@ ing bo@@ dies from ne@@ w@@ ly disco@@ vered ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , 20 years after the war ."
And it is quite possi@@ bly the lar@@ gest ever disco@@ vered .
"D@@ uring the four years of con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t that dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an n@@ ation in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 3@@ 0,000 c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , main@@ ly ci@@ vil@@ ians , went mis@@ sing , pre@@ sum@@ ed kill@@ ed , and another 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 were kill@@ ed during com@@ b@@ at oper@@ ations ."
"M@@ ost of them were kill@@ ed ei@@ ther in the early days of the war or to@@ wards the end of the hos@@ t@@ il@@ ities , when U.@@ N@@ . sa@@ fe z@@ ones like S@@ reb@@ ren@@ ica fe@@ ll into the hands of the S@@ er@@ b ar@@ my ."
The inter@@ national cr@@ im@@ inal tri@@ bun@@ al de@@ li@@ vered a number of sen@@ ten@@ ces for cr@@ im@@ es against hum@@ an@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
"@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic and de@@ li@@ ber@@ ate de@@ stru@@ ction of a r@@ ac@@ i@@ al , polit@@ ical , rel@@ ig@@ ious or e@@ th@@ ni@@ c group ."
A@@ s much as gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de is about kill@@ ing .
"It is also about de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tur@@ al her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely the very not@@ ion that they ever ex@@ is@@ ted ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kill@@ ing ; it is about the de@@ ni@@ ed iden@@ t@@ ity .
There are always trac@@ es — no such thing as a perfe@@ ct cr@@ ime .
There are always re@@ m@@ nan@@ ts of the peri@@ shed ones that are more d@@ ur@@ able than their f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le bo@@ dies and our se@@ lec@@ tive and f@@ ad@@ ing memor@@ y of them .
"These ite@@ ms are reco@@ vered from num@@ er@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , and the ma@@ in go@@ al of this collec@@ tion of the ite@@ ms is a uni@@ qu@@ e process of iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying those who dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed in the kill@@ ings , the first act of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de on Eur@@ ope@@ an so@@ il since the H@@ o@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust ."
N@@ ot a single body should re@@ ma@@ in un@@ disco@@ vered or un@@ iden@@ ti@@ fied .
"O@@ n@@ ce reco@@ vered , these ite@@ ms that the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their way to ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion are care@@ fully cle@@ an@@ ed , an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , c@@ at@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ ed and sto@@ red ."
Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of ar@@ ti@@ fac@@ ts are p@@ ac@@ ked in white pla@@ stic ba@@ gs just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
"These ob@@ jects are used as a fore@@ n@@ si@@ c too@@ l in vi@@ su@@ al iden@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation of the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s , but they are also used as very val@@ u@@ able fore@@ n@@ si@@ c ev@@ idence in the on@@ going war cr@@ im@@ es tri@@ als ."
"S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors are oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally called to try to iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y these ite@@ ms phys@@ ically , but physical bro@@ w@@ sing is extre@@ me@@ ly difficult , an in@@ effe@@ ctive and pain@@ ful process ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the fore@@ n@@ s@@ ics and doc@@ tors and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers are done with these ob@@ jects , they become or@@ p@@ han@@ s of the nar@@ r@@ ative ."
"M@@ any of them get de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of s@@ ight and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to photograp@@ h every single ex@@ hum@@ ed ite@@ m in order to create a vi@@ su@@ al ar@@ chi@@ ve that survi@@ v@@ ors could eas@@ ily bro@@ w@@ se .
"As a stor@@ y@@ te@@ l@@ ler , I like to give back to the community ."
I like to move be@@ yon@@ d ra@@ is@@ ing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"And in this case , someone may recogni@@ ze these ite@@ ms or at least their photograp@@ h@@ s will re@@ ma@@ in as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ a@@ sed and ac@@ cur@@ ate re@@ min@@ der of what happened ."
"P@@ h@@ oto@@ grap@@ hy is about em@@ pa@@ thy , and the famil@@ i@@ ar@@ ity of these ite@@ ms gu@@ aran@@ te@@ e em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"In this case , I am me@@ rely a too@@ l , a fore@@ n@@ si@@ c , if you like , and the resu@@ lt is a photograp@@ hy that is as close as possible of being a doc@@ um@@ ent ."
"O@@ n@@ ce all the mis@@ sing per@@ s@@ ons are iden@@ ti@@ fied , only deca@@ ying bo@@ dies in their gra@@ ves and these every@@ day ite@@ ms will re@@ ma@@ in ."
"In all their sim@@ plic@@ ity , these ite@@ ms are the last te@@ sta@@ ment to the iden@@ t@@ ity of the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s , the last per@@ man@@ ent re@@ min@@ der that these people ever ex@@ is@@ ted ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for cho@@ col@@ ate don@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challen@@ ges .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun ."
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"S@@ ince we are still realiz@@ ing these works , we are lar@@ ge@@ ly working within the re@@ al@@ m of in@@ tu@@ ition and m@@ ys@@ ter@@ y , still ."
So I &apos;m going to try and descri@@ be some of the experi@@ ences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the I@@ m@@ peri@@ al M@@ ono@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ es .
"A vi@@ e@@ wer sort of un@@ su@@ spe@@ c@@ t@@ ing@@ ly wal@@ ks into the room , and c@@ at@@ ches a gl@@ imp@@ se of these pan@@ el@@ s in a mes@@ s@@ y comp@@ os@@ ition on the w@@ all ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in secon@@ ds , as if the pan@@ el@@ s have not@@ ic@@ ed the presen@@ ce of the vi@@ e@@ wer , they appe@@ ar to pan@@ ic and sort of get into a str@@ ic@@ t sym@@ me@@ try ."
( Laughter ) So this is the s@@ ket@@ ch of the two sta@@ tes .
One is tot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is absolu@@ te order .
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ tori@@ al tra@@ diti@@ ons .
"One is the al@@ ta@@ r ta@@ b@@ le@@ ts of the 1@@ 5@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , M@@ al@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s ab@@ str@@ act comp@@ os@@ iti@@ ons ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
"T@@ o give you a sense of scale , the lar@@ gest pan@@ el is about two me@@ ters high ."
That &apos;s about this much . And the sma@@ l@@ le@@ st one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vi@@ e@@ wer en@@ ters the space , and they s@@ na@@ p to atten@@ tion ."
"And after a while , if the vi@@ e@@ wer contin@@ u@@ es to re@@ ma@@ in in the space , the pan@@ el@@ s will sort of become im@@ m@@ une to the presen@@ ce of the vi@@ e@@ wer and become la@@ x and au@@ ton@@ om@@ ous again , until they sort of sense a presen@@ ce in the room or a movement , when they will again s@@ na@@ p to atten@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) So here it appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s the vi@@ e@@ wer that &apos;s sort of inst@@ igat@@ ing the sense of order am@@ ong the pan@@ el@@ s , but it could also be the other way around , that the pan@@ el@@ s are so stu@@ ck within their pre@@ con@@ diti@@ on@@ ed behavi@@ ors that they sort of thr@@ ust the vi@@ e@@ wer with the ro@@ le of a t@@ y@@ r@@ ant ."
"So this br@@ ings me to a qu@@ i@@ e@@ ter , small work called H@@ and@@ he@@ ld ."
"The vi@@ e@@ wer se@@ es a piece of pap@@ er that &apos;s m@@ oun@@ ted on the far end of the w@@ all , but when you go clo@@ ser , you see that it &apos;s a bl@@ ank A@@ 4 , or a le@@ t@@ ter@@ -@@ s@@ ized piece of pap@@ er , that &apos;s he@@ ld on ei@@ ther side by two small hands that appe@@ ar to be car@@ ved with a great deal of atten@@ tion and care from a small blo@@ ck of wo@@ od ."
"The vi@@ e@@ wer also se@@ es that this entire sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture is sort of moving very sl@@ igh@@ tly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the pap@@ er very still for a long peri@@ od of time , and some@@ how are not man@@ ag@@ ing to ."
So this in@@ sta@@ bility in the movement very clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ es the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of images seen through a han@@ d@@ he@@ ld c@@ amera .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tan@@ de@@ m c@@ li@@ ps .
One is through a still c@@ amera and the other is through a han@@ d@@ he@@ ld c@@ amera .
And you im@@ medi@@ ately see how the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of the video sug@@ ge@@ sts the presen@@ ce of an ob@@ ser@@ ver and a sub@@ je@@ ctive point of view .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ mo@@ ved the c@@ amera and trans@@ fer@@ red that movement onto the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
"But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to ev@@ oke a self-@@ ef@@ fac@@ ing ge@@ st@@ ure , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched ar@@ ms behind this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous piece of pap@@ er ."
That sort of l@@ iken@@ s it to the amount of stra@@ in to be at the serv@@ ice of the ob@@ ser@@ ver and present this piece of pap@@ er very de@@ l@@ ic@@ ately to the vi@@ e@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is De@@ co@@ y .
"This is a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard model , so the ob@@ ject is about as t@@ all as I am ."
"It has a r@@ oun@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , he@@ ad@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ na , and its so@@ le pur@@ p@@ ose is to at@@ tr@@ act atten@@ tion to@@ wards itself ."
"So when a vi@@ e@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of t@@ il@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more f@@ ran@@ tic@@ ally as the person gets clo@@ ser ."
So here is the first test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
"You see the two mo@@ ve@@ ments inte@@ gra@@ ted , and the ob@@ ject seem@@ s to be em@@ plo@@ ying its entire being in this ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ per@@ ation ."
"But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s atten@@ tion , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person wh@@ ose atten@@ tion to get ."
( Laughter ) So this is the fin@@ al f@@ ab@@ r@@ ic@@ ated body of the De@@ co@@ y .
It appe@@ ars to be mas@@ s@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ tory like v@@ ac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers and wa@@ shing mach@@ ines .
"Because we are always working from a very person@@ al space , we like how this con@@ su@@ mer a@@ es@@ the@@ tic sort of de@@ person@@ aliz@@ es the ob@@ ject and gi@@ ves us a bit of dis@@ tan@@ ce in its appe@@ aran@@ ce , at least ."
"And so to us this is a kind of s@@ in@@ is@@ ter being which is trying to dis@@ tr@@ act you from the things that actually need your atten@@ tion , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help ."
"The next work is an ob@@ ject , that &apos;s also a kind of sound in@@ stru@@ ment ."
In the sh@@ ape of an am@@ p@@ hi@@ the@@ a@@ ter that &apos;s sc@@ al@@ ed to the size of an au@@ dience as per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved from somebody from the stage .
"So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appe@@ ars to be this big , and the au@@ dience sort of takes the entire field of my vision ."
S@@ e@@ ated in this au@@ dience are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small fig@@ ures .
They &apos;re me@@ chan@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to c@@ la@@ p of their own free will .
"This means that each of them can de@@ ci@@ de if and when they want to c@@ la@@ p , how hard , for how long , how they want to be inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by those around them or inf@@ lu@@ ence others , and if they want to con@@ tribu@@ te to innov@@ ation ."
"So when the vi@@ e@@ wer ste@@ ps in front of the au@@ dience , there will be a respon@@ se ."
"It could be a few cl@@ ap@@ s or a str@@ ong ap@@ plause , and then nothing happens until the vi@@ e@@ wer lea@@ ves the stage , and again the au@@ dience will respon@@ d ."
"It could be anything from a few fe@@ e@@ ble cl@@ ap@@ s from mem@@ bers in the au@@ dience , or it could be a very l@@ oud o@@ v@@ ation ."
"So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an au@@ dience as its own ob@@ ject or its own organ@@ ism that &apos;s also got a sort of mus@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it , an in@@ stru@@ ment ."
"So the vi@@ e@@ wer can play it by el@@ ic@@ iting quite complex and vari@@ ed , nu@@ an@@ ced mus@@ ical or sound pat@@ ter@@ ns , but cannot really pro@@ v@@ oke the au@@ dience into any particular kind of respon@@ se ."
So there &apos;s a sense of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment and cap@@ r@@ ic@@ i@@ ous@@ ness and un@@ eas@@ iness inv@@ olved .
It also has an all@@ uring and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite exc@@ ited about the image of the head s@@ pl@@ it@@ ting to form the two hands .
"So here &apos;s a small vi@@ su@@ al anima@@ tion , as if the two side@@ s of the brain are sort of c@@ la@@ shing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the ten@@ sion ."
And here is a pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be en@@ g@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ kay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the F@@ r@@ amer@@ un@@ ners ."
It comes out of the idea of a win@@ do@@ w .
"This is an ac@@ tual win@@ do@@ w in our stu@@ di@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ick@@ ne@@ s@@ ses of wo@@ o@@ den se@@ c@@ tions ."
So we used the same win@@ do@@ w vo@@ ca@@ bu@@ l@@ ary to con@@ stru@@ ct our own fr@@ ame or g@@ ri@@ d that &apos;s su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in the room and that can be vi@@ e@@ wed from two side@@ s .
This g@@ ri@@ d is in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small fig@@ ures .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different s@@ iz@@ es , as if to sug@@ gest a kind of per@@ spe@@ ctive or lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape on the single pla@@ in ."
E@@ ach of these fig@@ ures can also run bac@@ k@@ ward and for@@ ward in the tr@@ ack and hi@@ de behind two ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent trac@@ ks .
"So in con@@ tr@@ ast to this very t@@ ight g@@ ri@@ d , we wanted to give these fig@@ ures a very com@@ ical and sl@@ ap@@ st@@ ick@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality , as if a pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er has taken them and phys@@ ically anima@@ ted them down the pat@@ h ."
"So we like the idea of these fig@@ ures sort of s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ing along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and care@@ free and happ@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ lu@@ c@@ ky and con@@ tent , until they sort of sense a movement from the vi@@ e@@ wer and they will hi@@ de behind the fas@@ test w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also presen@@ ts its own con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion ."
"These fig@@ ures are sort of en@@ tr@@ app@@ ed within this very str@@ ong g@@ ri@@ d , which is like a pris@@ on , but also a for@@ tre@@ ss , because it allo@@ ws them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and nai@@ ve and care@@ free and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the ex@@ ter@@ nal world ."
"So all these real life qu@@ al@@ ities that I talk about are sort of trans@@ la@@ ted to a very speci@@ fic tech@@ n@@ ical con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation , and we were very lu@@ c@@ ky to col@@ lab@@ or@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ ur@@ ich to develo@@ p the first pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ."
So you see they ex@@ trac@@ ted the mot@@ ion co@@ gs from our anima@@ tions and created a w@@ ig@@ gle that inte@@ gra@@ ted the he@@ ad@@ -@@ b@@ ob@@ b@@ ing movement and the bac@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ for@@ th movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can f@@ it into the p@@ al@@ m of my hand .
"So imagine our exc@@ ite@@ ment when we saw it really working in the stu@@ di@@ o , and here it is ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pl@@ an .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the pap@@ er would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single pap@@ er .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge se@@ ni@@ or the@@ s@@ is , a pap@@ er you &apos;re supp@@ o@@ sed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a pap@@ er like that , my norma@@ l work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
This is how the year would go .
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here ."
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two weeks ."
"It was a very , very bad the@@ s@@ is . ( Laughter )@@ "
"@@ No , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er@@ -@@ b@@ log@@ ger guy ."
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
He lives enti@@ rely in the present moment .
"He has no memor@@ y of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : easy and fun ."
"Now , in the anima@@ l world , that works f@@ ine ."
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another anima@@ l species ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ an@@ ced ci@@ vil@@ iz@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
We can vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e the future .
We can see the big picture .
And that &apos;s when we have a con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t .
"And importan@@ tly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is ter@@ ri@@ fied of ."
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to re@@ lease the spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to write about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
Why are all of these people in such a dar@@ k place ?
It &apos;s usu@@ ally su@@ ffe@@ red qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly and pri@@ v@@ ately .
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cr@@ am@@ ming for some project .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ da@@ r ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on something in life ."
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
( Laughter ) You know .
Thank you .

"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who rec@@ ently was a@@ war@@ ded the con@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ onal M@@ e@@ da@@ l of H@@ on@@ or for his ac@@ tions on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"O@@ n that day , a col@@ um@@ n of American and A@@ f@@ g@@ han tro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan to help prote@@ ct a group of government of@@ fici@@ als , a group of A@@ f@@ g@@ han government of@@ fici@@ als , who would be mee@@ ting with some local vil@@ la@@ ge el@@ ders ."
"The col@@ um@@ n came under am@@ bus@@ h , and was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded on three side@@ s , and am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was recogni@@ z@@ ed for run@@ ning into live fir@@ e to re@@ sc@@ ue the wou@@ n@@ ded and pu@@ ll out the de@@ ad ."
"One of the people he re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ a@@ c hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ c@@ idence , one of the me@@ dev@@ a@@ c me@@ dic@@ s happened to have a G@@ o@@ P@@ ro c@@ amera on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole sc@@ en@@ e on c@@ amera ."
It shows C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ ing@@ ing this wou@@ n@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a gun@@ sho@@ t to the ne@@ ck .
"They put him in the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a kis@@ s before he turns around to re@@ sc@@ ue more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some dee@@ p , dee@@ p emot@@ ion , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mil@@ it@@ ary , they give med@@ als to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice themselves so that others may ga@@ in ."
"In business , we give b@@ on@@ u@@ ses to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice others so that we may ga@@ in ."
We have it bac@@ k@@ wards . Right ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my in@@ iti@@ al con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion was that they &apos;re just better people .
These better people are at@@ trac@@ ted to this con@@ cept of serv@@ ice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble things , and more importan@@ tly , others have that cap@@ ac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to sa@@ ve others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this dee@@ p sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
So tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation are really important here .
"The problem with con@@ cep@@ ts of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are feel@@ ings , they are not in@@ struc@@ tions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply in@@ stru@@ ct two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feel@@ ing .
So where does that feel@@ ing come from ?
"If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic era , to the early days of H@@ omo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , what we find is that the world was f@@ ill@@ ed with dan@@ ger , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
N@@ o@@ thing person@@ al .
"W@@ he@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , l@@ ack of re@@ sources , maybe a sa@@ ber@@ -@@ too@@ the@@ d t@@ ig@@ er , all of these things working to re@@ du@@ ce our li@@ fe@@ sp@@ an ."
"And so we ev@@ olved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ fe@@ ty , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we be@@ lon@@ ged ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ he@@ ren@@ t ben@@ ef@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ e@@ p at night and tr@@ ust that someone from within my tri@@ be will wat@@ ch for dan@@ ger .
"If we don &apos;t tr@@ ust each other , if I don &apos;t tr@@ ust you , that means you won &apos;t wat@@ ch for dan@@ ger ."
B@@ ad system of survi@@ v@@ al .
The mo@@ der@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is f@@ ill@@ ed with dan@@ ger , things that are trying to fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ate our lives or re@@ du@@ ce our suc@@ cess , re@@ du@@ ce our opportunity for suc@@ cess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the economy , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the sto@@ ck market ."
It could be a new technology that ren@@ ders your business model ob@@ so@@ le@@ te over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your compe@@ t@@ ition that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ate your growth and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"These are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only vari@@ able are the con@@ diti@@ ons inside the organiz@@ ation , and that &apos;s where lea@@ der@@ ship mat@@ ters , because it &apos;s the lea@@ der that se@@ ts the t@@ one ."
"When a lea@@ der makes the cho@@ ice to put the sa@@ fe@@ ty and lives of the people inside the organiz@@ ation first , to sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice their com@@ for@@ ts and sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the tan@@ gi@@ ble resu@@ l@@ ts , so that the people re@@ ma@@ in and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they be@@ long , re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was wit@@ ness to an in@@ c@@ ident where a pas@@ sen@@ ger atte@@ m@@ p@@ ted to bo@@ ard before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had br@@ ok@@ en the la@@ w , like a cr@@ im@@ inal ."
He was ye@@ ll@@ ed at for atte@@ m@@ p@@ ting to bo@@ ard one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like c@@ at@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the ru@@ les , I could get in tr@@ ou@@ ble or l@@ ose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was telling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her lea@@ ders .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines is not because they ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly h@@ ire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fe@@ ar their lea@@ ders .
"You see , if the con@@ diti@@ ons are wrong , we are for@@ ced to ex@@ p@@ end our own time and energy to prote@@ ct ourselves from each other , and that in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly we@@ ak@@ ens the organiz@@ ation ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organiz@@ ation , we will nat@@ ur@@ ally com@@ b@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our st@@ ren@@ g@@ ths and work ti@@ re@@ les@@ s@@ ly to face the dan@@ g@@ ers outside and se@@ ize the opportun@@ ities ."
"The clo@@ se@@ st an@@ al@@ o@@ gy I can give to what a great lea@@ der is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child opportun@@ ities , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine them when ne@@ cess@@ ary , all so that they can grow up and a@@ chi@@ eve more than we could for ourselves ."
G@@ re@@ at lea@@ ders want exactly the same thing .
"They want to pro@@ vi@@ de their people opportunity , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine when ne@@ cess@@ ary , build their self-@@ con@@ f@@ idence , give them the opportunity to try and f@@ ai@@ l , all so that they could a@@ chi@@ eve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves ."
"C@@ har@@ li@@ e K@@ i@@ m , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ex@@ t J@@ um@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a te@@ ch company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever conside@@ r la@@ ying off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we conside@@ r la@@ ying off people inside our organiz@@ ation ?
C@@ har@@ li@@ e imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted a pol@@ ic@@ y of li@@ fe@@ time em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ex@@ t J@@ um@@ p , you cannot get fi@@ red for perfor@@ man@@ ce issu@@ es ."
"In fact , if you have issu@@ es , they will co@@ ach you and they will give you supp@@ ort , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school ."
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vis@@ cer@@ al hat@@ red , an@@ ger , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate s@@ al@@ ari@@ es and b@@ on@@ us struc@@ tures ."
It &apos;s not the num@@ bers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very de@@ fin@@ ition of lea@@ der@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this dee@@ p@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ tr@@ act .
"We know that they allo@@ wed their people to be sa@@ c@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed so they could prote@@ ct their own intere@@ sts , or wor@@ se , they sa@@ c@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed their people to prote@@ ct their own intere@@ sts ."
"This is what so off@@ ends us , not the num@@ bers ."
W@@ ou@@ ld any@@ body be off@@ en@@ ded if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to G@@ and@@ hi ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ e@@ re@@ sa ?
D@@ o we have an issue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
G@@ re@@ at lea@@ ders would never sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice
the people to sa@@ ve the num@@ bers .
They would so@@ on@@ er sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the num@@ bers to sa@@ ve the people .
"B@@ o@@ b C@@ ha@@ p@@ man , who run@@ s a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company in the M@@ id@@ we@@ st called B@@ ar@@ r@@ y-@@ W@@ e@@ h@@ mil@@ ler , in 200@@ 8 was h@@ it very hard by the rec@@ es@@ sion , and they lost 30 percent of their or@@ ders over@@ night ."
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer af@@ for@@ d their lab@@ or po@@ o@@ l ."
"They needed to sa@@ ve 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the bo@@ ard got together and dis@@ cus@@ sed la@@ yo@@ f@@ f@@ s ."
And B@@ o@@ b re@@ fu@@ sed .
"You see , B@@ o@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ du@@ ce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough pro@@ gram .
"E@@ very em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e , from se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary to C@@ E@@ O , was requ@@ i@@ red to take four weeks of un@@ p@@ ai@@ d v@@ ac@@ ation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ se@@ cu@@ ti@@ vely ."
But it was how B@@ o@@ b an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced the pro@@ gram that mat@@ te@@ red so much .
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all su@@ f@@ fer a little than any of us should have to su@@ f@@ fer a lot , and mor@@ ale went up ."
"They sa@@ ved 20 million dollars , and most importan@@ tly , as would be expe@@ cted , when the people feel sa@@ fe and prote@@ cted by the lea@@ der@@ ship in the organiz@@ ation , the natural re@@ action is to tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ate ."
"And quite spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body expe@@ cted , people started tra@@ ding with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could af@@ for@@ d it more would tra@@ de with those who could af@@ for@@ d it less .
People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Le@@ a@@ der@@ ship is a cho@@ ice . It is not a ran@@ k .
I know many people at the se@@ ni@@ or@@ most le@@ ve@@ ls of organiz@@ ations who are absolu@@ tely not lea@@ ders .
"They are au@@ th@@ or@@ ities , and we do what they say because they have au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ tom@@ s of organiz@@ ations who have no au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and they are absolu@@ tely lea@@ ders , and this is because they have cho@@ sen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have cho@@ sen to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a lea@@ der is .
"I heard a story of some M@@ ar@@ ines who were out in the@@ a@@ ter , and as is the M@@ ar@@ ine cus@@ to@@ m , the of@@ fic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the field , his men br@@ ought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lea@@ ders because they go first .
We call them lea@@ ders because they take the risk before any@@ body else does .
"We call them lea@@ ders because they will cho@@ ose to sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice so that their people may be sa@@ fe and prote@@ cted and so their people may ga@@ in , and when we do , the natural respon@@ se is that our people will sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice for us ."
"They will give us their blo@@ od and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars to see that their lea@@ der &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your blo@@ od and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organiz@@ ation we would all like to work in ?

One of every hun@@ d@@ red children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can sol@@ ve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy .
The fe@@ tu@@ s needs to survi@@ ve inside the mother .
S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al depen@@ ds on communic@@ ation between the sy@@ ste@@ mi@@ c and the p@@ ul@@ mon@@ ary blo@@ od .
"A@@ t the moment of bir@@ th , this communic@@ ation needs to stop ."
It is ca@@ used by pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ity and gen@@ e@@ tic con@@ diti@@ ons .
But what we know today is that a l@@ ack of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen is also one of the ca@@ u@@ ses .
"As you can see in the ch@@ art , the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy of this kind of ho@@ le dra@@ matic@@ ally incre@@ a@@ ses with al@@ t@@ itu@@ de ."
"@@ V@@ ideo : ( B@@ ab@@ y cr@@ ying ) W@@ hen you look at patients with this con@@ d@@ ition , they see@@ m des@@ per@@ ate to bre@@ a@@ the ."
"T@@ o close the ho@@ le , maj@@ or sur@@ ger@@ y used to be the only solution ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the A@@ maz@@ on reg@@ ion ."
The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fir@@ e was a green av@@ o@@ ca@@ do b@@ ran@@ ch .
Th@@ en came a moment of insp@@ ir@@ ation .
So we used the b@@ ran@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first inven@@ tion .
The ho@@ les in children &apos;s he@@ ar@@ ts can be clo@@ sed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of w@@ ire wr@@ app@@ ed onto itself .
"It maybe doesn &apos;t look so f@@ an@@ cy to you now , but that was our first suc@@ cess@@ ful atte@@ m@@ pt to create a dev@@ ice for this maj@@ or problem ."
"In this video , we can see how a very tin@@ y ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clo@@ ses the ho@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of insp@@ ir@@ ation , there came a very long time of ef@@ for@@ t develop@@ ing a pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ."
In v@@ it@@ ro and in vi@@ v@@ o stu@@ dies took thousands of hours of work in the la@@ b .
"The co@@ il , if it works , can sa@@ ve lives ."
"I re@@ turned from G@@ er@@ many to B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , thinking that whe@@ re@@ ver we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference ."
"W@@ it@@ h my wi@@ fe and part@@ ner , D@@ r@@ . A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ra H@@ e@@ ath , we started to see patients ."
"A@@ f@@ ter suc@@ cess@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ a@@ stic ."
"But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et high ."
"And , the patients there need a speci@@ al dev@@ ice to sol@@ ve their heart con@@ d@@ ition ."
"The ho@@ le in al@@ t@@ itu@@ de patients is different , because the ori@@ f@@ ice between the ar@@ teri@@ es is lar@@ ger ."
"M@@ ost patients cannot af@@ for@@ d to be tre@@ ated on time , and they die ."
The first co@@ il could suc@@ cess@@ fully tre@@ at only half of the patients in B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a .
The search started again .
We went back to the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s ind@@ ig@@ en@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , we ob@@ tain@@ ed a new dev@@ ice ."

"It seem@@ s this time , the we@@ a@@ ving allo@@ ws us to create a se@@ am@@ less dev@@ ice that doesn &apos;t r@@ ust because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very complex struc@@ tures by a pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure that took deca@@ des to develo@@ p .
"As you can see , the dev@@ ice en@@ ters the body through the natural chan@@ ne@@ ls ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the ho@@ le .
"O@@ ur dev@@ ice ex@@ pan@@ ds , places itself and clo@@ ses the ho@@ le ."

"O@@ ur go@@ al is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access ."
So we have to start a f@@ oun@@ dat@@ ion with a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one model .
We will give one dev@@ ice for free to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .

"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o and M@@ pu@@ ma@@ lan@@ ga , a little to@@ wn called M@@ o@@ te@@ tem@@ a ."
"W@@ a@@ ter and electr@@ ic@@ ity supp@@ ly are as un@@ predic@@ table as the we@@ a@@ ther , and gro@@ wing up in these t@@ ough s@@ itu@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was re@@ la@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of min@@ e in win@@ ter , and we were su@@ n@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ imp@@ op@@ o sun gets really ho@@ t in win@@ ter .
"So as we were su@@ n@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your s@@ kin and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sho@@ c@@ king st@@ at@@ is@@ tics ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per access to water and san@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hun@@ d@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ ou@@ th Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ari@@ ous dise@@ a@@ ses th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dra@@ stic of which is called tra@@ ch@@ oma ."
T@@ ra@@ ch@@ oma is an in@@ fe@@ ction of the ey@@ e du@@ e to d@@ ir@@ t getting into your ey@@ e . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple in@@ fe@@ c@@ tions of tra@@ ch@@ oma can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ in@@ d .
"The disease lea@@ ves e@@ ight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ in@@ d each and every year . The sho@@ c@@ king part about it is that to av@@ oi@@ d being in@@ fe@@ cted with tra@@ ch@@ oma , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no me@@ dic@@ ine , no p@@ ill@@ s , no in@@ je@@ c@@ tions ."
"So after seeing these sho@@ c@@ king st@@ at@@ is@@ tics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tr@@ us@@ ty little ste@@ ed , my N@@ ok@@ ia 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a l@@ ap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , ex@@ cept for the 20@@ -@@ ran@@ d-@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ iki@@ pe@@ dia , on Google , about l@@ ot@@ ions , cre@@ ams , the comp@@ os@@ iti@@ ons , the me@@ l@@ ting poin@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ ic@@ ities — I did high school science — and I wr@@ ote down a little for@@ mul@@ a on a piece of pap@@ er ,@@ "
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C speci@@ al sp@@ ice , you know ?"
"So I was like , oka@@ y , so we &apos;ve got the for@@ mul@@ a ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e .
"F@@ ast for@@ ward four years later , after having writ@@ ten a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge business pl@@ an on the cell phone , having writ@@ ten my pa@@ tent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ gest pa@@ ten@@ t-@@ ho@@ l@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had inven@@ ted D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th@@ -@@ sub@@ st@@ itu@@ ting l@@ ot@@ ion ."
"You liter@@ ally put it on your s@@ kin , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the lim@@ ited re@@ sources I had , I went to uni@@ versity , met a few people , got it into pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , and we have a fully fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing produ@@ ct that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually av@@ a@@ il@@ able on the market ."
So we learned a few les@@ s@@ ons in comm@@ er@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or commun@@ ities don &apos;t bu@@ y produc@@ ts in bu@@ l@@ k .
"They bu@@ y produc@@ ts on de@@ m@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t bu@@ y a box of c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes . They bu@@ y one c@@ ig@@ are@@ tte each day , even though it &apos;s more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ged D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these innov@@ ative little sa@@ che@@ ts .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ ee@@ ze it out ."
"And the c@@ ool part is , one sa@@ ch@@ et sub@@ st@@ itu@@ tes one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting the produ@@ ct ."
We realized that even r@@ ich kids from the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we realized that we could sa@@ ve 80 million lit@@ ers of water on a@@ verage each time they s@@ ki@@ pped a b@@ ath , and also we would sa@@ ve two hours a day for kids who are in r@@ ural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for h@@ ome@@ work , two hours more to just be a ki@@ d ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we nar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key val@@ ue pro@@ pos@@ ition , which was cle@@ an@@ l@@ iness and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a r@@ ich man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ fe@@ sa@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produ@@ ct into pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of se@@ lling the produ@@ ct onto a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the re@@ tai@@ l market , and one question I have for the au@@ dience today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ ads of L@@ imp@@ op@@ o , with an allo@@ wan@@ ce of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s sto@@ pp@@ ing you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot thr@@ ough@@ out this whole process , last year Google nam@@ ed me as one of the br@@ igh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also curren@@ tly the best studen@@ t ent@@ re@@ pre@@ ne@@ ur in the world , the first Afr@@ ican to get that ac@@ col@@ a@@ de , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ ive years ago , I was on a sa@@ b@@ bat@@ ical , and I re@@ turned to the med@@ ical uni@@ versity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the white co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ age@@ ment con@@ su@@ l@@ tan@@ t ."
There were two things that sur@@ pri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the dis@@ cus@@ sions we had were hos@@ p@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ the@@ red me , actually , was that se@@ ver@@ al of the col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es I met , for@@ mer friends from med@@ ical school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated , enga@@ ged and pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ n@@ ical , di@@ sen@@ ga@@ ged , or had dis@@ tan@@ ced themselves from hos@@ p@@ ital man@@ age@@ ment ."
"So with this foc@@ us on cos@@ t-@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the pati@@ ent ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from stru@@ g@@ gle with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms ai@@ m at ho@@ l@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for patients for sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and the@@ re@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In se@@ ver@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ tent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the cos@@ tly decis@@ ions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and f@@ ra@@ il pati@@ ent ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the de@@ gre@@ es of f@@ ree@@ dom of phys@@ ic@@ ians , this is a way to hold cos@@ ts down ."
"And ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely , some phys@@ ic@@ ians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es are fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ ag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to a@@ chi@@ eve ? &quot;"
"@@ U@@ l@@ t@@ ima@@ tely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a lim@@ ited , or af@@ for@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ ue@@ -@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by val@@ ue : out@@ comes that matter to patients rel@@ ative to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ i@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ l@@ iz@@ a@@ be@@ th T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by his three beautiful da@@ ugh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the cos@@ ts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fas@@ c@@ ina@@ ted us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are hos@@ p@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ a@@ st@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differen@@ ces were dra@@ ma@@ tic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ f@@ f@@ ers from pr@@ os@@ tate cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"Now living in Eur@@ ope , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a we@@ ll@@ -@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the a@@ verage hos@@ p@@ ital , he will have the risk of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start we@@ ar@@ ing di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ in@@ ic called the M@@ ar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ lin@@ i@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many hos@@ p@@ it@@ als for many different dise@@ a@@ ses , we see these huge differen@@ ces ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
N@@ ob@@ o@@ dy kno@@ ws .
So going the hos@@ p@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h or@@ th@@ ope@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ nu@@ al mee@@ ting , and they were dis@@ cus@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"T@@ o the left of this s@@ li@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of me@@ tal pie@@ ces , ar@@ ti@@ fici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ mit@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to me@@ a@@ sure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should me@@ a@@ sure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should me@@ a@@ sure that . &quot;"
And they finally a@@ gre@@ ed .
"And once they had a@@ gre@@ ed , they started me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing , and started shar@@ ing the data ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y quickly , they found that if you put ce@@ ment in the b@@ one of the pati@@ ent before you put the me@@ tal sh@@ af@@ t in , it actually l@@ as@@ ted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ for@@ med cl@@ in@@ ical pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ ince then , they pu@@ bl@@ ish every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they pu@@ bl@@ ish the lea@@ gu@@ e table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ to@@ m ?"
"And they vis@@ it each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ vement ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best resu@@ l@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the phys@@ ic@@ ians get together , they a@@ gre@@ e on what qu@@ ality is , they start me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ vement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have foc@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the lo@@ we@@ st cos@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ p@@ ose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ ger@@ y story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ par@@ ed the U.S@@ . and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ ger@@ y .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary sur@@ ger@@ ies , and so much un@@ ne@@ cess@@ ary su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year peri@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sa@@ v@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ a@@ ses , actually a qu@@ ality which is be@@ low the a@@ verage in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would foc@@ us a lot more on me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of a@@ verage O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 500 billion U.S@@ . dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these num@@ bers are f@@ anta@@ stic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ gu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The a@@ gen@@ ts of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e as a con@@ su@@ l@@ tan@@ t , I me@@ et probably a hun@@ d@@ red or more than a hun@@ d@@ red doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other hos@@ p@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care sta@@ ff every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they a@@ chi@@ eve in terms of qu@@ ality for their patients .
"P@@ h@@ ys@@ ic@@ ians are , like most of you in the au@@ dience , very compe@@ t@@ itive ."
They were always best in clas@@ s .
We were always best in clas@@ s .
"And if somebody can show them that the resu@@ lt they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But phys@@ ic@@ ians have another charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er recog@@ nit@@ ion .
"If a car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist call@@ s another car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist in a compe@@ ting hos@@ p@@ ital and dis@@ cus@@ ses why that other hos@@ p@@ ital has so much better resu@@ l@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to impro@@ ve .
"So it is , by me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing and cre@@ ating trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ vement , which is what this s@@ li@@ de shows ."
"Now , you may say this is a n@@ ice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to me@@ a@@ sure and comp@@ are what we a@@ chi@@ eve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c institu@@ tions , M@@ i@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ ch@@ ool , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ s@@ ka In@@ st@@ itu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has for@@ med something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
It stan@@ ds for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ e@@ asu@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together le@@ ad@@ ing phys@@ ic@@ ians and patients to dis@@ cus@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we me@@ a@@ sure , and to make those stan@@ dar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : c@@ at@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for in@@ stan@@ ce , heart atta@@ ck , and pr@@ os@@ tate cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will pu@@ bl@@ ish their data in N@@ o@@ ve@@ m@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ex@@ t year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do e@@ ight dise@@ a@@ ses , the year after , 16 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pl@@ an to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . W@@ ho &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ ive months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ gest uni@@ versity hos@@ p@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Eur@@ ope ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big institu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with phys@@ ic@@ ians , n@@ ur@@ ses and other sta@@ ff , dis@@ cus@@ sing le@@ uke@@ mi@@ a in children ."
"The group dis@@ cus@@ sed , how do we me@@ a@@ sure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we me@@ a@@ sure it better than we do ?
"We dis@@ cus@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
"And we dis@@ cus@@ sed what are the cos@@ ts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more ef@@ fici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the mee@@ ting , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ part@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he rai@@ sed his hand , I for@@ got that — he rai@@ sed his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his f@@ ist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally dis@@ cus@@ sing what this hos@@ p@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only cos@@ ts but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make sta@@ ff in hos@@ p@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solution ."
"I believe me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing val@@ ue in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a re@@ v@@ olution , and I &apos;m con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that the f@@ oun@@ der of mo@@ der@@ n me@@ dic@@ ine , the G@@ ree@@ k H@@ ipp@@ oc@@ ra@@ tes , who always put the pati@@ ent at the cen@@ ter , he would s@@ mi@@ le in his gra@@ ve ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the gre@@ a@@ test for@@ ms to make the world a better place .
"If you take a group of people with the right equ@@ ity in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves and organ@@ ize them in a star@@ tu@@ p , you can un@@ lo@@ ck human poten@@ tial in a way never before possible ."
You get them to a@@ chi@@ eve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
"But if the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is so great , why do so many f@@ ai@@ l ?"
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And I wanted to try to be sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic about it , av@@ oi@@ d some of my inst@@ in@@ cts and maybe mis@@ per@@ cep@@ tions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
"I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been star@@ ting bus@@ in@@ es@@ ses since I was 12 years old when I so@@ ld can@@ dy at the bu@@ s stop in j@@ uni@@ or high school , to high school , when I made sol@@ ar energy dev@@ ices , to col@@ le@@ ge , when I made l@@ ou@@ d@@ spe@@ ak@@ ers ."
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from col@@ le@@ ge , I started so@@ f@@ t@@ ware companies ."
We learned a lot from those fail@@ ures .
So I looked at these five .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
I nam@@ ed my company I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b for how much I wor@@ ship the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion , ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ bility , that mat@@ te@@ red even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er M@@ ike T@@ y@@ son on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body has a pl@@ an , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
So much about a team &apos;s ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion is its ability to ad@@ ap@@ t to getting p@@ un@@ ched in the face by the cus@@ tom@@ er .
The cus@@ tom@@ er is the true reality .
And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
Th@@ en I started looking at the business model .
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very clear pat@@ h gener@@ ating cus@@ tom@@ er re@@ ven@@ u@@ es ?
That started ris@@ ing to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ te@@ red most for suc@@ cess .
Ma@@ ybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then of course , the tim@@ ing ."
I@@ s the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
"I@@ s it early , as in , you &apos;re in adv@@ ance and you have to educ@@ ate the world ?"
I@@ s it just right ?
"O@@ r is it too l@@ ate , and there &apos;s already too many compe@@ t@@ it@@ ors ?"
So I tried to look very care@@ fully at these five fac@@ tors across many companies .
"And I looked across all 100 I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , and 100 non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies to try and come up with something sci@@ enti@@ fic about it ."
"So first , on these I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , the top five companies — C@@ it@@ y@@ search , C@@ ar@@ s@@ D@@ i@@ re@@ ct , G@@ o@@ T@@ o , N@@ et@@ Z@@ er@@ o , T@@ ic@@ ket@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m — those all became bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ doll@@ ar suc@@ ces@@ ses ."
"And the five companies on the bot@@ to@@ m — Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , In@@ side@@ r P@@ ag@@ es , M@@ y@@ L@@ i@@ fe , D@@ es@@ k@@ top F@@ ac@@ tory , Pe@@ op@@ le@@ lin@@ k — we all had high h@@ op@@ es for , but didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
So I tried to ran@@ k across all of those at@@ tribu@@ tes how I felt those companies sc@@ ore@@ d on each of those d@@ im@@ en@@ sions .
"And then for non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , I looked at w@@ il@@ d suc@@ ces@@ ses , like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b and In@@ sta@@ gram and U@@ ber and Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be and L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In ."
"And some fail@@ ures : W@@ e@@ b@@ v@@ an , K@@ o@@ z@@ mo , P@@ et@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m F@@ lo@@ o@@ z and F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s@@ ter ."
"The bot@@ to@@ m companies had in@@ ten@@ se fun@@ ding , they even had business mode@@ ls in some ca@@ ses , but they didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"I tried to look at what fac@@ tors actually ac@@ coun@@ ted the most for suc@@ cess and fail@@ ure across all of these companies , and the resu@@ l@@ ts really sur@@ pri@@ sed me ."
The number one thing was tim@@ ing .
T@@ im@@ ing ac@@ coun@@ ted for 4@@ 2 percent of the difference between suc@@ cess and fail@@ ure .
"T@@ e@@ am and ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion came in second , and the idea , the differen@@ ti@@ ability of the idea , the uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of the idea , that actually came in third ."
"Now , this isn &apos;t absolu@@ tely de@@ fin@@ itive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much sur@@ pri@@ sed me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing ."
S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es it mat@@ te@@ red more when it was actually tim@@ ed .
"The last two , business model and fun@@ ding , made sense to me actually ."
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and ad@@ d one later if your cus@@ tom@@ ers are de@@ man@@ ding what you &apos;re cre@@ ating .
"And fun@@ ding , I think as well , if you &apos;re under@@ fun@@ ded at first but you &apos;re ga@@ ining tr@@ action , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get in@@ ten@@ se fun@@ ding ."
So now let me give you some speci@@ fic exam@@ ples about each of these .
So take a w@@ il@@ d suc@@ cess like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b that everybody kno@@ ws about .
"Well , that company was fam@@ ously pas@@ sed on by many smar@@ t inve@@ stor@@ s because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to ren@@ t out a space in their home to a st@@ ran@@ ger . &quot;"
"O@@ f course , people pro@@ ved that wrong ."
"But one of the reas@@ ons it suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded , as@@ ide from a good business model , a good idea , great ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion , is the tim@@ ing ."
"That company came out right during the he@@ ight of the rec@@ es@@ sion when people really needed ex@@ tr@@ a money , and that maybe hel@@ p@@ ed people over@@ come their ob@@ je@@ ction to ren@@ ting out their own home to a st@@ ran@@ ger ."
S@@ ame thing with U@@ ber .
"@@ U@@ ber came out , incredi@@ ble company , incredi@@ ble business model , great ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion , too ."
But the tim@@ ing was so perfe@@ ct for their need to get dri@@ ver@@ s into the system .
"D@@ ri@@ ver@@ s were looking for ex@@ tr@@ a money ; it was very , very important ."
"S@@ ome of our early suc@@ ces@@ ses , C@@ it@@ y@@ search , came out when people needed we@@ b pa@@ ges ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ T@@ o@@ .@@ co@@ m , which we an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced actually at TED in 199@@ 8 , was when companies were looking for cos@@ t-@@ effe@@ ctive ways to get tra@@ f@@ fic ."
"We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the tim@@ ing was probably maybe more important ."
And then some of our fail@@ ures .
"We started a company called Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , it was an on@@ line en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment company ."
"We were so exc@@ ited about it — we rai@@ sed enough money , we had a great business model , we even sig@@ ned incredi@@ bly great H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od tal@@ ent to jo@@ in the company ."
But bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ation was too low in 199@@ 9@@ -@@ 20@@ 00 .
"It was too hard to wat@@ ch video con@@ tent on@@ line , you had to put co@@ dec@@ s in your bro@@ w@@ ser and do all this stuff , and the company ev@@ en@@ tually went out of business in 200@@ 3 ."
"@@ Just two years later , when the co@@ de@@ c problem was sol@@ ved by A@@ do@@ be F@@ l@@ as@@ h and when bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ation cr@@ os@@ sed 50 percent in America , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be was perfe@@ c@@ tly tim@@ ed ."
"@@ G@@ re@@ at idea , but un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able tim@@ ing ."
"In fact , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started ."
It wasn &apos;t even certain that that would work out .
"But that was beauti@@ fully , beauti@@ fully tim@@ ed ."
"So what I would say , in sum@@ mar@@ y , is ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion de@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly mat@@ ters a lot ."
The idea mat@@ ters a lot .
But tim@@ ing might matter even more .
And the best way to really as@@ se@@ ss tim@@ ing is to really look at whether con@@ sum@@ ers are really ready for what you have to off@@ er them .
"And to be really , really hon@@ est about it , not be in de@@ ni@@ al about any resu@@ l@@ ts that you see , because if you have something you love , you want to p@@ us@@ h it for@@ ward , but you have to be very , very hon@@ est about that fac@@ tor on tim@@ ing ."
"As I said ear@@ li@@ er , I think star@@ tu@@ ps can change the world and make the world a better place ."
"I hope some of these in@@ s@@ ights can maybe help you have a sl@@ igh@@ tly high@@ er suc@@ cess r@@ ati@@ o , and th@@ us make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise ."
"Th@@ ank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great au@@ dience ."

"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ations for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully en@@ te@@ red the studen@@ t life of lec@@ tures , par@@ ties and tra@@ f@@ fic c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually dee@@ p@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ se@@ c@@ ure and fund@@ am@@ ent@@ ally fr@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed — fr@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fail@@ ure and of the em@@ p@@ tin@@ ess that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , fu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hun@@ d@@ red times before , when su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the cl@@ ar@@ ity and decis@@ i@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mis@@ tak@@ able ."
&quot; She is open@@ ing the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ sis@@ ted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , nar@@ r@@ ating everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a lec@@ ture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did not@@ ice that its cal@@ m ex@@ teri@@ or sometimes s@@ li@@ pped and that it oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally mir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ ex@@ pres@@ sed emot@@ ion ."
"So , for example , if I was an@@ gr@@ y and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ de@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound fr@@ us@@ tra@@ ted ."
"A sub@@ tle con@@ diti@@ on@@ ing process had be@@ gun , the im@@ plic@@ ation that norma@@ l people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very seri@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time telling the col@@ le@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be f@@ air , I was des@@ per@@ ate for intere@@ st and help , and I began to tell him about my st@@ range com@@ men@@ tat@@ or ."
"For example , I was part of a studen@@ t T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news bu@@ l@@ le@@ tin@@ s around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was run@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to rap@@ i@@ dly over@@ take me .
"A hos@@ p@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion follo@@ wed , the first of many , a di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is of s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ ni@@ a came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , tor@@ men@@ ting sense of h@@ op@@ ele@@ s@@ s@@ ness , hum@@ il@@ i@@ ation and de@@ sp@@ air about myself and my pr@@ os@@ pe@@ cts ."
"But having been en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ged to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sym@@ p@@ to@@ m , my fe@@ ar and res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce to@@ wards it in@@ ten@@ si@@ fied ."
"Now essen@@ ti@@ ally , this re@@ presen@@ ted taking an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive stan@@ ce to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of psy@@ chi@@ c ci@@ vi@@ l war , and in turn this ca@@ used the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely hos@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that gl@@ as@@ s of water ?
"In effe@@ ct , a v@@ ic@@ ious cy@@ cle of fe@@ ar , av@@ oi@@ dan@@ ce , mis@@ tr@@ ust and mi@@ su@@ n@@ der@@ standing had been es@@ ta@@ bli@@ shed , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of es@@ ta@@ bli@@ shing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation ."
"T@@ wo years later , and the de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole f@@ ren@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gro@@ te@@ squ@@ e vis@@ ions , b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , in@@ trac@@ table de@@ l@@ us@@ ions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ ka@@ ge and de@@ sp@@ air of those years , it seem@@ s to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A br@@ ok@@ en and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who em@@ er@@ ged was a survi@@ v@@ or and would ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely grow into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memor@@ ies grow p@@ ale and fa@@ int in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ p@@ ed me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as l@@ ate as Ma@@ y , but sum@@ mer always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ d@@ it those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ought with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to we@@ l@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ ized , lon@@ e@@ ly place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ar@@ ed so hos@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this re@@ spe@@ ct , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ a@@ ten@@ ed to atta@@ ck my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fe@@ ar and in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , ob@@ je@@ ctive dan@@ ger ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prote@@ ct them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t me@@ ss with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a pla@@ stic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ te@@ gi@@ c ."
"It was ar@@ med with this knowledge that ul@@ t@@ ima@@ tely I would ga@@ ther together my sh@@ atte@@ red self , each f@@ ra@@ g@@ ment re@@ presen@@ ted by a different vo@@ ice , gra@@ du@@ ally with@@ dra@@ w from all my me@@ dic@@ ation , and re@@ turn to psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side ."

T@@ ell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ hy .
O@@ r is it photograp@@ hy ?
"Because , of course , this is a photograp@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your c@@ amera ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my intere@@ st in photograp@@ hy started as I got my first dig@@ ital c@@ amera at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the c@@ amera , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photograp@@ h with a c@@ amera , the process ends when you pre@@ ss the tr@@ ig@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photograp@@ hy was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pre@@ ss the tr@@ ig@@ ger ."
Ph@@ oto@@ s like this : con@@ stru@@ ction going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ expe@@ cted t@@ w@@ ist .
"And de@@ sp@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"O@@ r photo@@ s like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"When I say re@@ al@@ ism , I mean photo@@ -@@ re@@ al@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photograp@@ h ."
Ph@@ oto@@ s where you will need a bri@@ e@@ f moment to think to figure out the tr@@ ick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tr@@ ick that makes it look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the ill@@ us@@ ion ?
S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es the per@@ spe@@ ctive is the ill@@ us@@ ion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a t@@ wo@@ -@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks re@@ al@@ is@@ tic really ."
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different pie@@ ces of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three perfe@@ c@@ tly ima@@ gin@@ able physical ob@@ jects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a th@@ ree@@ -@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks th@@ ree@@ -@@ d@@ im@@ en@@ si@@ onal , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tr@@ ick our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ bin@@ ing photograp@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ bin@@ ing different re@@ al@@ ities .
"So the things that make a photograp@@ h look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our dai@@ ly lives ."
"But when com@@ bin@@ ing photograp@@ h@@ s , this is really important to conside@@ r , because o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to a@@ chi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic resu@@ lt .
"As you can see , these images ar@@ en &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that photo@@ s com@@ b@@ ined should have the same per@@ spe@@ ctive .
"S@@ econ@@ dly , photo@@ s com@@ b@@ ined should have the same typ@@ e of light ."
And these two images both fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill these two requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same typ@@ e of light .
The third one is about making it imp@@ os@@ sible to dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish where the different images be@@ gin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it imp@@ os@@ sible to say how the image actually was com@@ po@@ sed .
"So by mat@@ ching col@@ or , con@@ tr@@ ast and br@@ igh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hi@@ c de@@ fe@@ cts like de@@ p@@ th of field , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundre@@ ds of la@@ y@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ ip@@ ul@@ ated .
But this image is actually enti@@ rely com@@ po@@ sed of photograp@@ h@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
"I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comp@@ r@@ om@@ ise with the ideas in your head ."
But it does requ@@ ire a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pl@@ an it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ shing tri@@ p ."
The sh@@ ore@@ s are from a different loc@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to a@@ chi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic resu@@ lt , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ket@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ bin@@ ing the different photograp@@ h@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the photo@@ s , the resu@@ lt can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our ima@@ gin@@ ation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The P@@ r@@ ime M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of I@@ ce@@ land has re@@ sig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the b@@ ru@@ tal S@@ y@@ ri@@ an dic@@ tat@@ or B@@ a@@ sh@@ ar Al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d has also got off@@ sh@@ ore companies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ le@@ g@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that lea@@ ds back to P@@ res@@ ident V@@ l@@ ad@@ im@@ ir P@@ ut@@ in of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od friend , who happens to be a top ce@@ ll@@ ist ."
And there will be a lot of r@@ ich individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of le@@ ak@@ ed doc@@ um@@ ents .

"It seem@@ s very dis@@ tan@@ t from you , me , ordinary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the tru@@ th is that if r@@ ich and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money off@@ sh@@ ore and not pa@@ y the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for v@@ ital public serv@@ ices like heal@@ th@@ care , education , ro@@ ads ."
"Now , for my organiz@@ ation G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al ."
We have the world &apos;s media and polit@@ ical lea@@ ders talking about how individu@@ als can use off@@ sh@@ ore se@@ cre@@ cy to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ ise their as@@ se@@ ts — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a deca@@ de .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world ba@@ f@@ fl@@ ing and con@@ f@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an do@@ ll .
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ sa@@ ck F@@ on@@ se@@ c@@ a has fe@@ wer American c@@ li@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw le@@ ak@@ s from the C@@ a@@ y@@ man I@@ s@@ lan@@ ds or even from De@@ la@@ ware or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ a@@ da , you would see many more ca@@ ses and exam@@ ples lin@@ king back to Amer@@ ic@@ ans ."
It has allo@@ wed sc@@ am@@ m@@ ers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able inve@@ stor@@ s .
This is the sort of behavior that a@@ ffe@@ cts all of us .
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we sen@@ t in an under@@ co@@ ver inve@@ st@@ igat@@ or to 1@@ 3 M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan la@@ w fir@@ ms .
"O@@ ur inve@@ st@@ igat@@ or po@@ sed as an Afr@@ ican min@@ is@@ ter who wanted to move su@@ spe@@ ct fun@@ ds into the United States to bu@@ y a house , a ya@@ ch@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"These were all pre@@ lim@@ in@@ ary me@@ et@@ ings , and n@@ one of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers took us on as a c@@ li@@ ent and of course no money mo@@ ved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individu@@ al ca@@ ses .
"This is about how a system works , that ent@@ ren@@ ches cor@@ ru@@ ption , ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ ion , po@@ ver@@ ty and in@@ sta@@ bility ."
"And in order to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le this , we need to change the game ."
"This may see@@ m like do@@ om and g@@ lo@@ om , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be r@@ ich and powerful individu@@ als ."
"But as a natural op@@ tim@@ ist , I do see that we are star@@ ting to get some change ."
"One of the things that is sa@@ d is that , actually , the U@@ S is la@@ g@@ ging behind ."
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ ama le@@ ak@@ s , this huge pe@@ e@@ k into the off@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of open@@ ing up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
"We need business lea@@ ders to stand up and say , &quot; S@@ e@@ cre@@ cy like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need polit@@ ical lea@@ ders to recogni@@ ze the problem , and to comm@@ it to chan@@ ging the la@@ w to open up this sort of se@@ cre@@ cy ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we can end the se@@ cre@@ cy that is curren@@ tly allo@@ wing ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ ion , cor@@ ru@@ ption , money la@@ under@@ ing to fl@@ our@@ ish ."
"C@@ h@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : J@@ u@@ li@@ an , we@@ l@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has re@@ lea@@ sed more clas@@ si@@ fied doc@@ um@@ ents than the rest of the world &apos;s media com@@ b@@ ined ."
C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"@@ J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ s@@ san@@ ge : Yeah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activ@@ ists is able to re@@ lease more of that typ@@ e of information than the rest of the world pre@@ ss com@@ b@@ ined .

"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — clas@@ s@@ ical wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this sta@@ te@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , pas@@ s it through le@@ ga@@ l j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those le@@ ga@@ l prote@@ c@@ tions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the reg@@ ular pos@@ tal ma@@ il , en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted or not , ve@@ t it like a reg@@ ular news organiz@@ ation , forma@@ t it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant d@@ ata@@ ba@@ ses of information — re@@ lease it to the public and then de@@ f@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able le@@ ga@@ l and polit@@ ical atta@@ cks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an ef@@ for@@ t to en@@ sure the doc@@ um@@ ents are le@@ g@@ it@@ imate , but you actually almost never know who the iden@@ t@@ ity of the source is ?"
"@@ J@@ A : That &apos;s right , ye@@ ah . V@@ er@@ y rare@@ ly do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we de@@ st@@ ro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( Ph@@ one r@@ ing ) God d@@ am@@ n it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A as@@ king what the co@@ de is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you le@@ ak@@ ed a few years ago .
If we can have this doc@@ um@@ ent up ...
So this was a story in K@@ en@@ ya a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ por@@ t .
This was a se@@ cre@@ t inte@@ llig@@ ence re@@ por@@ t comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an government after its elec@@ tion in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ ya was ru@@ led by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ara@@ p M@@ oi for about 18 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ tat@@ or of K@@ en@@ ya .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ aki got into power — through a co@@ al@@ ition of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ ption in K@@ en@@ ya — they comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed this re@@ por@@ t , spent about two million p@@ oun@@ ds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ por@@ t ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for polit@@ ical le@@ verage on M@@ oi , who was the ri@@ che@@ st man — still is the ri@@ che@@ st man — in K@@ en@@ ya ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of K@@ en@@ y@@ an jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ ag@@ ed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , De@@ ce@@ m@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ lea@@ sed that re@@ por@@ t , we did so three days after the new pres@@ ident , K@@ i@@ b@@ aki , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ara@@ p M@@ oi , so this re@@ por@@ t then became a de@@ ad al@@ bat@@ ross around P@@ res@@ ident K@@ i@@ b@@ aki &apos;s ne@@ ck ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the re@@ por@@ t le@@ ak@@ ed into K@@ en@@ ya , not from the of@@ fici@@ al media , but in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ ion , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front pa@@ ge of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding countries of K@@ en@@ ya , in T@@ an@@ zan@@ ian and S@@ ou@@ th Afr@@ ican pre@@ ss ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an pre@@ ss feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 n@@ ights stra@@ ight on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an inte@@ llig@@ ence re@@ por@@ t , which changed the resu@@ lt of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your lea@@ k really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Ye@@ p .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p from this B@@ ag@@ h@@ da@@ d air@@ str@@ ike video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p ."
"This is — this is in@@ ten@@ se materi@@ al , I should war@@ n you ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ... just fu@@ c@@ kin &apos; , once you get on &apos; e@@ m just open &apos; e@@ m up ."
"I see your ele@@ ment , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..@@ ."
You &apos;re clear . All right . F@@ ir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sh@@ oo@@ t .
L@@ ight &apos; e@@ m all up .
"@@ C &apos;@@ mon , fir@@ e !@@ "

"@@ we need to move , time now !@@ "
"A@@ ll right , we just enga@@ ged all e@@ ight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Yeah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing ."
R@@ o@@ ger . I got &apos; e@@ m .
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , this is T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"@@ God d@@ am@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ haha . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ ag@@ h@@ da@@ d to fur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three atta@@ cks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that atta@@ ck , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ wo Re@@ u@@ ters em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were wou@@ n@@ ded ."
There were between 18 and 2@@ 6 people kill@@ ed all together .
CA : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used w@@ ide@@ spre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key ele@@ ment of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gr@@ oss dis@@ par@@ ity in force .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a re@@ la@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an A@@ pa@@ ch@@ e hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter sitting up at one k@@ il@@ ome@@ ter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0@@ -@@ m@@ ill@@ ime@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ e@@ lls on everyone — looking for any exc@@ use to do so — and kill@@ ing people re@@ sc@@ u@@ ing the wou@@ n@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ n@@ al@@ ists inv@@ olved that c@@ lear@@ ly we@@ ren &apos;t in@@ sur@@ gen@@ ts because that &apos;s their fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S@@ . inte@@ llig@@ ence an@@ al@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ res@@ ted , and it &apos;s al@@ le@@ ged that he con@@ fe@@ s@@ sed in a ch@@ at room to have le@@ ak@@ ed this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 clas@@ si@@ fied U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have de@@ ni@@ ed re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been char@@ ged , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ab@@ les and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had re@@ lea@@ sed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ ja@@ vi@@ k U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y , but this is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly conne@@ cted ."
"I mean , I was a known vis@@ it@@ or of that em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ ce@@ ive thousands of U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y di@@ plo@@ ma@@ tic c@@ ab@@ les ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have re@@ lea@@ sed them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true hum@@ an@@ -@@ r@@ ights a@@ bu@@ ses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at de@@ clas@@ si@@ fied c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of materi@@ al that &apos;s there ."
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ hy ?"
Why is it right to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge le@@ aking of se@@ cre@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can a@@ chi@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ en@@ ding economic ef@@ for@@ t into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ nal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ en@@ ding work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , ei@@ ther to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where le@@ aking can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ lea@@ sed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of person@@ al — person@@ ally iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ g@@ it@@ imate se@@ cre@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a le@@ g@@ it@@ imate se@@ cre@@ t — but we deal with wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ blo@@ wers that are coming for@@ ward that are really sort of we@@ ll@@ -@@ mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated ."
CA : So they are we@@ ll@@ -@@ mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an in@@ cen@@ tive to put out ."
It shows a U.S@@ . sol@@ di@@ er la@@ ugh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pres@@ sion , has given the im@@ pres@@ sion , to mil@@ lions of people around the world that U.S@@ . sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ ag@@ h@@ da@@ d , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in A@@ f@@ g@@ han@@ is@@ tan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ ion . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ ion of the people who are pa@@ ying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
CA : So you found a way to shin@@ e light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k se@@ cre@@ ts in companies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any iron@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to shin@@ e that light , you have to , yourself , create se@@ cre@@ cy around your sources ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s dis@@ s@@ iden@@ ts yet ."
We don &apos;t have sources who are dis@@ s@@ iden@@ ts on other sources .
"S@@ hou@@ ld they come for@@ ward , that would be a tr@@ ick@@ y s@@ itu@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally compe@@ ll@@ ed to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cur@@ ious as to the op@@ in@@ ion in the TED au@@ dience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vi@@ e@@ ws of W@@ iki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s and of J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ an@@ ger@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker .
W@@ ho &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
W@@ ho &apos;s got the dan@@ ger@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker view ?
"@@ J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tr@@ igu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sam@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in N@@ o@@ ve@@ m@@ ber last year — there was a seri@@ es of well blo@@ wou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well blo@@ w@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ por@@ t — a sort of engine@@ er@@ ing an@@ al@@ ys@@ is into what happened — saying that , in fact , se@@ cur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous compe@@ ting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tru@@ cks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ er@@ ing re@@ por@@ t had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ me@@ ly difficult doc@@ um@@ ent for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a compe@@ ting oil fir@@ m just sort of pla@@ ying the issue up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The materi@@ al looks good , it feel@@ s right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a le@@ t@@ ter just this week from the company who wr@@ ote it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What doc@@ um@@ ent is it , pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had le@@ ga@@ l au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that doc@@ um@@ ent ?
I@@ s it really you@@ rs ? &quot; &quot; So they sen@@ t us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ of@@ t Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of iden@@ ti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a materi@@ al is , is to try and get these guys to write le@@ t@@ ters ."
CA : Yeah . H@@ a@@ ve you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of seri@@ ous fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ er@@ ing ef@@ for@@ t ."
So our pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation r@@ ate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ im@@ ized while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ er@@ ing our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public intere@@ st that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of gro@@ wing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity of wh@@ is@@ t@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ su@@ res of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and ve@@ t this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ e@@ ck , basically jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic s@@ al@@ ari@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Ye@@ p . Yeah , and tr@@ us@@ ted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of materi@@ al we deal with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will deal with the hig@@ he@@ st national se@@ cur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer se@@ cur@@ ity ca@@ ses ."
CA : So help us understand a bit about you person@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a ki@@ d you went to 3@@ 7 different s@@ cho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movi@@ e business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ bin@@ ation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for b@@ ree@@ ding par@@ ano@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the movi@@ e business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a ha@@ c@@ ker at an early age and ran into the au@@ th@@ or@@ ities early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist activ@@ ist at an early age ."
"I wr@@ ote a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with ha@@ c@@ ker .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be de@@ plo@@ yed for vari@@ ous things .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , at the moment , it &apos;s mos@@ tly de@@ plo@@ yed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ r@@ ase is not , not as n@@ ice as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Yeah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s ban@@ k ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your c@@ ore val@@ u@@ es ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ c@@ ident in your life that hel@@ p@@ ed de@@ ter@@ min@@ e them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ c@@ ident .
"But the c@@ ore val@@ u@@ es : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ b@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s , which is to pol@@ ice per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors of cr@@ ime ."
And so that is something that has been in my charac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minu@@ te , the story : what happened in I@@ ce@@ land ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , ran into tr@@ ou@@ ble with a ban@@ k , then the news serv@@ ice there was in@@ jun@@ cted from run@@ ning the story ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , they pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ized your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ ce@@ land . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ ce@@ land went through this fin@@ an@@ cial cr@@ is@@ is .
It was the har@@ de@@ st h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king se@@ c@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the economy .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so we re@@ lease this re@@ por@@ t in J@@ u@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ jun@@ cted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movi@@ e : in@@ jun@@ ction lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news re@@ a@@ der was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very fam@@ ous in I@@ ce@@ land , went to I@@ ce@@ land and sp@@ oke about this issue ."
"And there was a feel@@ ing in the community that that should never happen again , and as a resu@@ lt , working with I@@ ce@@ lan@@ di@@ c polit@@ ic@@ ians and some other inter@@ national le@@ ga@@ l exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge of le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation for I@@ ce@@ land to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the free pre@@ ss , with the str@@ on@@ gest jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic prote@@ c@@ tions in the world , with a new N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch ."
"I@@ ce@@ land &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ ce@@ lan@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ an@@ im@@ ously ."
CA : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more like@@ ly to be B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more se@@ cre@@ cy , or us wat@@ ching B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be pla@@ yed for ei@@ ther way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize f@@ ree@@ dom of spe@@ e@@ ch le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation and trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
W@@ h@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ f@@ lec@@ ting the au@@ dience &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion to say , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )@@ "
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the W@@ h@@ ite H@@ ou@@ se , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Yor@@ ker a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a for@@ mer pres@@ ident . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ les@@ sing as a for@@ mer pres@@ ident , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I famil@@ i@@ ar with the 50 sta@@ tes in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vis@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time pro@@ gr@@ ams in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pres@@ ident , but we also me@@ et the vil@@ la@@ g@@ ers who live in the most re@@ mot@@ e areas of Africa ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pr@@ omot@@ e human r@@ ights , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ v@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human r@@ ights on Earth is , st@@ ran@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to be@@ gin with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of rel@@ ig@@ ious scri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ es@@ ta@@ ment , New T@@ es@@ ta@@ ment , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant pos@@ iti@@ ons in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ches and in the mos@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordin@@ ari@@ ly re@@ le@@ ga@@ ted to a secon@@ dar@@ y pos@@ ition com@@ par@@ ed to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very seri@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ari@@ ly not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 20@@ 00 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist for 70 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ un@@ day school every S@@ un@@ day ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ un@@ day as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 20@@ 00 decided that women should play a secon@@ dar@@ y pos@@ ition , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent pos@@ ition to men ."
"So they issu@@ ed an e@@ dic@@ t , in effe@@ ct , that pre@@ v@@ ents women from being pri@@ est@@ s , pa@@ stor@@ s , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or ch@@ ap@@ la@@ ins in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a clas@@ s@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist se@@ min@@ ary , they cannot te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , that say that a woman shou@@ ldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the bas@@ ic thing is the scri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant pos@@ ition .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ ive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ us@@ ive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er , for in@@ stan@@ ce , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of God , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I pa@@ y them equ@@ al pa@@ y for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very seri@@ ous bl@@ ight that ca@@ u@@ ses this problem is the ex@@ ces@@ sive re@@ sort to viol@@ ence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for in@@ stan@@ ce , we have had an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of po@@ or people , mos@@ tly black people and min@@ or@@ ities , by pu@@ tting them in pris@@ on ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as gover@@ no@@ r of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Amer@@ ic@@ ans were in pris@@ on ."
"N@@ o@@ wa@@ days , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pris@@ on ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase .
"And since I left the W@@ h@@ ite H@@ ou@@ se , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 00 percent incre@@ ase in the number of women who are black who are in pris@@ on ."
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death pen@@ al@@ ty that is a develop@@ ed country .
And we ran@@ k right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ us@@ ive in all ele@@ ments of human r@@ ights in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a now , and I fig@@ u@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a has spent four billion dollars in con@@ v@@ ic@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the death pen@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to se@@ nd a person to be ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted ."
"N@@ e@@ br@@ as@@ ka this week just pas@@ sed a la@@ w ab@@ o@@ li@@ shing the death pen@@ al@@ ty , because it cos@@ ts so much . ( Applause ) So the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and ab@@ use of po@@ or people and hel@@ p@@ less people is another cause of the incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of women ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few a@@ bu@@ ses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ t@@ il@@ ation .
"@@ G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ t@@ il@@ ation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely c@@ ut away by a so@@ -@@ called cu@@ t@@ ter who has a ra@@ z@@ or b@@ la@@ de and , in a non@@ -@@ s@@ ter@@ il@@ ized way , they re@@ move the ex@@ teri@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me ca@@ ses but not very r@@ are ca@@ ses , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ stru@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets mar@@ ri@@ ed , the same cu@@ t@@ ter goes in and open@@ s the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have se@@ x ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for in@@ stan@@ ce , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ ma@@ les that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ t@@ il@@ ated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are c@@ ut that way before they re@@ ach mat@@ ur@@ ity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very seri@@ ous thing is hon@@ or kill@@ ings , where a family with mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation , again , of a ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ ur@@ an that man@@ da@@ tes this — will ex@@ e@@ cu@@ te a girl in their family if she is rap@@ ed or if she mar@@ ri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she we@@ ars in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate clo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family be@@ comes mur@@ de@@ re@@ rs when the girl br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ n an@@ al@@ ys@@ is was done in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it sho@@ wed that 7@@ 5 percent of these mur@@ ders of a girl are per@@ pe@@ tra@@ ted by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the mur@@ ders are con@@ duc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that re@@ la@@ tes to women partic@@ ul@@ arly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ wa@@ days ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from Africa into s@@ la@@ very in the New Wor@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States De@@ part@@ ment of S@@ tate now has a man@@ date from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ por@@ t every year , and the S@@ tate De@@ part@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ da@@ ge , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is lo@@ ca@@ ted and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y U@@ ni@@ versity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta has the bus@@ i@@ est air@@ por@@ t in the world , and they also have a lot of pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers that come from the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n H@@ em@@ is@@ p@@ here ."
"If a bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a girl that has bro@@ wn or black s@@ kin , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ ite@@ -@@ s@@ kin@@ ned girl br@@ ings se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the a@@ verage bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The se@@ x tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the tot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very seri@@ ous problem , and the bas@@ ic problem is pr@@ os@@ t@@ itu@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ ore@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the local of@@ fici@@ als , the local pol@@ ic@@ em@@ en , or the chi@@ e@@ f of pol@@ ice or the ma@@ y@@ or and so for@@ th ."
"And this lea@@ ds to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ought incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly and put into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very in all countries in the world ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ners and the p@@ imp@@ s and the ma@@ le cus@@ tom@@ ers are pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ t@@ itu@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite pos@@ ition ."
"For every ma@@ le ar@@ res@@ ted for il@@ le@@ ga@@ l se@@ x tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ res@@ ted in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ a@@ da , I@@ rel@@ and , I &apos;ve already said S@@ we@@ den , F@@ ran@@ ce , and other countries are moving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ we@@ dis@@ h model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great institu@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ m@@ ire : our mil@@ it@@ ary and our great uni@@ versity system .
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ing how many se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"The last re@@ por@@ t I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts that took place in the mil@@ it@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a bat@@ tal@@ ion in the Ar@@ my or a company in the M@@ ar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to de@@ ci@@ de whether to pro@@ se@@ cu@@ te a rap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"A@@ b@@ out one out of four girls who en@@ ter American uni@@ vers@@ ities will be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted before she gra@@ du@@ ates , and this is now getting a lot of pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ity , par@@ ti@@ ally because of my book , but other things , and so 8@@ 9 uni@@ vers@@ ities in America are now con@@ de@@ m@@ ned by the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation under T@@ it@@ le I@@ X because the of@@ fici@@ als of the uni@@ vers@@ ities are not taking care of the women to prote@@ ct them from se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ult ."
"The De@@ part@@ ment of J@@ us@@ tic@@ e says that more than half of the rap@@ es on a col@@ le@@ ge cam@@ p@@ us take place by seri@@ al rap@@ ists , because outside of the uni@@ versity system , if they r@@ ape somebody , they &apos;ll be pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted , but when they get on a uni@@ versity cam@@ p@@ us , they can r@@ ape with imp@@ un@@ ity ."
They &apos;re not pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very seri@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al pa@@ y for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pres@@ ident , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some pro@@ gre@@ ss , par@@ ti@@ ally because I was pres@@ ident and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no pro@@ gre@@ ss made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 500 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 500 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an a@@ verage than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground f@@ igh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head dro@@ pp@@ ing b@@ om@@ b@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that atta@@ ck people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t dro@@ p a b@@ om@@ b , we didn &apos;t la@@ un@@ ch a mis@@ si@@ le , we didn &apos;t fir@@ e a bu@@ l@@ let ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ u@@ ses , are the bas@@ ic ca@@ u@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The a@@ verage man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged pos@@ ition that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y , and this is very sim@@ il@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had ex@@ is@@ ted ."
"@@ R@@ ac@@ i@@ al dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ation , le@@ g@@ ally , had ex@@ is@@ ted for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ et@@ ween the States , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son got the b@@ ill@@ s pas@@ sed for equ@@ al r@@ ights ."
"But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that r@@ ac@@ i@@ al dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ation was oka@@ y , but they sta@@ yed qu@@ i@@ et , because they en@@ jo@@ yed the pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ges of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ qu@@ e access to j@@ ury du@@ ty , better s@@ cho@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that ex@@ ists today , because the a@@ verage man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged pos@@ ition ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the uni@@ versity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mil@@ it@@ ary system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great rel@@ ig@@ ions ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful n@@ ations like this one , and where you come from , Eur@@ ope and so for@@ th , who have inf@@ lu@@ ence and who have f@@ ree@@ dom to speak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on your@@ selves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to r@@ ac@@ i@@ al dis@@ cr@@ im@@ in@@ ation against girls and women all over the world ."
The a@@ verage woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her da@@ ugh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ t@@ il@@ ated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to de@@ tai@@ l about that .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds to realiz@@ e that these a@@ bu@@ ses on the col@@ le@@ ge cam@@ pu@@ ses and the mil@@ it@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prote@@ ct your da@@ ugh@@ ters and your gr@@ and@@ da@@ ugh@@ ters ."
"I have 12 gr@@ and@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ children , and I think often about them and about the pl@@ ight that they will face in America , not only if they li@@ ved in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or a fore@@ ig@@ n country , in having equ@@ al r@@ ights , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion for women and girls around the world and prote@@ ct their human r@@ ights ."
Thank you very much .

"The differen@@ ces are what intere@@ st me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ omo e@@ rec@@ tu@@ s made the same too@@ l for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but to@@ ols changed s@@ lo@@ wer than s@@ ke@@ le@@ t@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no pro@@ gre@@ ss , no innov@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
W@@ he@@ re@@ as the ob@@ ject on the right is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the ob@@ ject on the left is made from one sub@@ stan@@ ce ."
"The ob@@ ject on the right is made from a con@@ fe@@ ction of different sub@@ stan@@ ces , from sil@@ ic@@ on and me@@ tal and pla@@ stic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ fe@@ ction of different ideas , the idea of pla@@ stic , the idea of a la@@ ser , the idea of trans@@ is@@ tors ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ bin@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tr@@ igu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the se@@ cre@@ t to under@@ standing what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an acc@@ um@@ ulation of ideas too : the idea of s@@ kin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"@@ How does ev@@ olution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it u@@ ses se@@ x@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an a@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al species , if you get two different mu@@ t@@ ations in different cre@@ at@@ ures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ tin@@ ct for the other to survi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ u@@ al species , then it &apos;s possible for an individu@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ t@@ ations from different lin@@ e@@ ag@@ es ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individu@@ al to dra@@ w up@@ on the gen@@ e@@ tic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effe@@ ct in cul@@ tur@@ al ev@@ olution as se@@ x is having in bio@@ logical ev@@ olution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ chan@@ ging one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ ature .
No other anima@@ l does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the lab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ ject for another never happens .
"As A@@ da@@ m S@@ mit@@ h said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a f@@ air ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , a@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al culture ."
"C@@ h@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es , k@@ il@@ ler wha@@ les , these kinds of cre@@ at@@ ures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tra@@ diti@@ ons which are han@@ ded down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cr@@ ack nu@@ ts with ro@@ cks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never ex@@ p@@ and , never grow , never acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ a@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a S@@ t@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ da@@ m takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and a@@ x@@ es than A@@ da@@ m .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ da@@ m .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and a@@ x@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ da@@ m make two a@@ x@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sa@@ ved an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ da@@ m is going to get at making a@@ x@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beauti@@ es of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more speci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ da@@ m and O@@ z both sa@@ ved an h@@ our of time .
"That is pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity , the sa@@ ving of time in sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to pro@@ vi@@ de for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ en@@ ing to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ ee@@ p . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a can@@ dle , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the a@@ verage wa@@ ge in B@@ r@@ ita@@ in today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for e@@ ight secon@@ ds on the a@@ verage wa@@ ge to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or serv@@ ice ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the a@@ verage wa@@ ge ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a can@@ dle that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the a@@ verage person on the a@@ verage wa@@ ge could not af@@ for@@ d a can@@ dle in 18@@ 00 ."
"@@ G@@ o back to this image of the a@@ x@@ e and the mou@@ se , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; W@@ ho made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one a@@ x@@ e was made by someone for him@@ self ."
It was self-@@ su@@ f@@ fici@@ en@@ cy .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the ob@@ ject on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably mil@@ lions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ ffe@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was d@@ r@@ ill@@ ing for oil , which was going to be made into the pla@@ stic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a mou@@ se for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were r@@ ich , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be r@@ ich ; you em@@ plo@@ yed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or whatever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his din@@ ner every night .
"But a mo@@ der@@ n tou@@ r@@ ist going around the p@@ al@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner ton@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in b@@ is@@ tro@@ s and ca@@ f@@ es and re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts and sh@@ op@@ s all over P@@ ar@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s not@@ ice with an ex@@ ce@@ ll@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w up@@ on speci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stan@@ dar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a clas@@ si@@ c example ; wor@@ kers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ kers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ aliz@@ e with re@@ spe@@ ct to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ s@@ ist on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in En@@ g@@ land , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ ue@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ de@@ st ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no ev@@ idence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work ma@@ le for fe@@ ma@@ le and fe@@ ma@@ le for ma@@ le .
"In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ the@@ re@@ r soci@@ e@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing di@@ vision of lab@@ or between , on the whole , hun@@ ting ma@@ les and ga@@ ther@@ ing fe@@ ma@@ les ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dis@@ tin@@ ction between speci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for ma@@ les and fe@@ ma@@ les ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it ben@@ ef@@ its both side@@ s .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — dig@@ ging ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get access to prote@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ting hun@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any dig@@ ging to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kill@@ s a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both side@@ s ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stan@@ dar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a high@@ ly inte@@ llig@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on a@@ verage , by the end , were big@@ ger than you@@ rs and min@@ e in this room today ."
They were ima@@ gin@@ ative . They bur@@ i@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disco@@ vered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic s@@ kill@@ s .
They were br@@ il@@ li@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no ev@@ idence of a se@@ x@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no ev@@ idence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavior by fe@@ ma@@ les .
It looks like the fe@@ ma@@ les were co@@ oper@@ ative hun@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no ev@@ idence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the ob@@ jects that you find in N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from local materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ au@@ ca@@ su@@ s there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find local N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from local ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are mo@@ der@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same date , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving ob@@ jects around like this , it was ev@@ idence that they were ex@@ chan@@ ging between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
People for@@ get that . People think of tra@@ de as a mo@@ der@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hun@@ d@@ red th@@ ous@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est ev@@ idence for it c@@ ro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long dis@@ tan@@ ces in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ a@@ sh@@ e@@ lls — as disco@@ vered by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 mil@@ es in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ ger@@ ia .
And that &apos;s ev@@ idence that people have started ex@@ chan@@ ging between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ dis@@ tan@@ ce movement means tra@@ de rather than mig@@ r@@ ation ?
"Well , you look at mo@@ der@@ n hun@@ ter ga@@ the@@ re@@ rs like ab@@ or@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one a@@ x@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry o@@ w@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ ka@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s for things like st@@ ing@@ ra@@ y bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that st@@ one a@@ x@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ ia ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ dis@@ tan@@ ce movement of to@@ ols is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not mig@@ r@@ ation ."
"What happens when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ e ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down techno@@ logical pro@@ gre@@ ss , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ verse ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the se@@ a level r@@ ose and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia became an is@@ land 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ en@@ ced s@@ lo@@ wer pro@@ gre@@ ss than people on the main@@ land , they actually experi@@ en@@ ced re@@ gre@@ ss ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and fi@@ shing equ@@ ip@@ ment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ inta@@ in the speci@@ aliz@@ ed s@@ kill@@ s ne@@ cess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a de@@ ser@@ t is@@ land .
"@@ How many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts could we contin@@ ue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ ra de@@ l F@@ ue@@ go — sim@@ il@@ ar is@@ land , sim@@ il@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ ra de@@ l F@@ ue@@ go is se@@ para@@ ted from S@@ ou@@ th America by a much nar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ ight , and there was tra@@ ding con@@ ta@@ ct across that stra@@ ight thr@@ ough@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ ians were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"@@ G@@ o back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one a@@ x@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer mou@@ se ?
"N@@ ob@@ o@@ dy , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer mou@@ se .
I mean this quite seri@@ ously .
The pres@@ ident of the computer mou@@ se company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to d@@ r@@ ill an oil well to get oil out to make pla@@ stic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wr@@ ote about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to min@@ e grap@@ h@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to fe@@ ll tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ it@@ h language we have to trans@@ fer ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ yon@@ d our cap@@ ab@@ il@@ ities ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ yon@@ d the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interested in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
"What &apos;s re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the collec@@ tive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the net@@ work .
We &apos;re the neur@@ ons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the mee@@ ting and ma@@ ting of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using techno@@ logical pro@@ gre@@ ss , incre@@ men@@ t@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ ward , we will , of course , experience ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be war@@ s ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the conne@@ c@@ tions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to ma@@ te as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and the@@ re@@ fore living stan@@ dar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ oud , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d sour@@ cing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the e@@ lit@@ es but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and ma@@ te , we are su@@ rely ac@@ ce@@ l@@ er@@ ating the r@@ ate of innov@@ ation ."

"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite pain@@ tin@@ gs , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ v@@ es@@ ters &quot; &quot; by P@@ i@@ e@@ ter B@@ ru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the M@@ et ."
I see this pl@@ us sig@@ n .
"If the mu@@ se@@ um has given us the image , you cl@@ ick on it ."
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interested in art , you can cl@@ ick this — but I &apos;m going to cl@@ ick this off right now ."
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call g@@ ig@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ el@@ s ."
And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ el@@ s ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ el@@ s .
You can z@@ oo@@ m around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pr@@ ic@@ e@@ less .
But then you really want to go dee@@ p .
"And so I started pla@@ ying around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That soun@@ ds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started not@@ ic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , sp@@ oke to a couple of my con@@ ta@@ cts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which inv@@ ol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a st@@ ick on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite pop@@ ular .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really dee@@ p in , you can really get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ spe@@ ctive , I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m out so you really see what you get ."
"H@@ ere is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly j@@ um@@ p into the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ it@@ es , &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I sho@@ wed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ."
But what if you want to see br@@ us@@ h str@@ ok@@ es ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ o@@ g@@ h actually created this mas@@ ter@@ piece ?
You z@@ oo@@ m in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite parts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real c@@ ool part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ lec@@ tions .
"A@@ n@@ y one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re r@@ ich , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a f@@ an@@ cy house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mu@@ se@@ um on@@ line — create your own collec@@ tion across all these images .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ o@@ wer of Z@@ oo@@ m — you can just z@@ oo@@ m around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ dor@@ s , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ all@@ er@@ y ."
"You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , se@@ nd it to your friends and really get a con@@ vers@@ ation going about what you &apos;re feel@@ ing when you go through these mas@@ ter@@ pie@@ ces ."
"So I think , in con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ ion , even come from the mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ."
I probably shou@@ ldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these art@@ ists .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bl@@ ing experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this dig@@ ital medi@@ um that we do j@@ us@@ tic@@ e to their art@@ work and re@@ present it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the big@@ gest question I get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ plic@@ ate the experience of going to a mu@@ se@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ te@@ l@@ ler .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , wr@@ iting no@@ ve@@ ls — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures called the d@@ jin@@ ni ."
"But before I go there , p@@ lease al@@ low me to share with you gl@@ imp@@ ses of my person@@ al story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical sh@@ ape , the cir@@ cle , so thr@@ ough@@ out my talk , you will come across se@@ ver@@ al cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , F@@ ran@@ ce to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ para@@ ted , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ rom then on , I was rai@@ sed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ k@@ ara , that was a bit un@@ usu@@ al ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od was full of large famil@@ ies , where fa@@ thers were the he@@ ads of hou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"O@@ n the one hand was my mother , a we@@ ll@@ -@@ e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted , se@@ cul@@ ar , mo@@ der@@ n , w@@ es@@ ter@@ ni@@ z@@ ed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"O@@ n the other hand was my gr@@ and@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al , less e@@ du@@ ca@@ ted and de@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly less r@@ ational ."
This was a woman who read co@@ ffe@@ e gr@@ oun@@ ds to see the future and me@@ l@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous sh@@ ap@@ es to f@@ end off the e@@ vi@@ l ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people vis@@ ited my gr@@ and@@ mother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their hands ."
"E@@ ach time , my gr@@ and@@ mother would ut@@ ter some words in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , take a red ap@@ ple and sta@@ b it with as many r@@ ose th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ cir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with dar@@ k in@@ k ."
"A week later , the pati@@ ent would come back for a follo@@ w@@ -@@ up exam@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m a@@ ware that I should not be saying such things in front of an au@@ dience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scientists , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who vis@@ ited my gr@@ and@@ mother for their s@@ kin con@@ diti@@ ons , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of p@@ ra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , p@@ ra@@ ying is effe@@ ctive , but also be@@ ware of the power of cir@@ cl@@ es . &quot; &quot; F@@ rom her , I learned , am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous les@@ son — that if you want to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ m@@ ish or the human sou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ r@@ ound it with th@@ ick w@@ all@@ s ."
It will d@@ ry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tur@@ al cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , clas@@ s ."
"But if we have no conne@@ ction wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ yon@@ d the one we take for gr@@ an@@ ted , then we too run the risk of d@@ r@@ ying up inside ."
"O@@ ur ima@@ gin@@ ation might sh@@ rin@@ k ; our he@@ ar@@ ts might d@@ win@@ dle , and our hum@@ an@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we sta@@ y for too long inside our cul@@ tur@@ al co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s , col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle re@@ se@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded with our mir@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my gr@@ and@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver mir@@ r@@ ors with ve@@ l@@ ve@@ t or to han@@ g them on the w@@ all@@ s with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ as@@ tern tra@@ d@@ ition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not heal@@ thy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion .
"I@@ ron@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; commun@@ ities of the like@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ a@@ test dan@@ g@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , am@@ ong li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves , ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics and beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s , the r@@ ich and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est al@@ ike ."
"We te@@ nd to form cl@@ us@@ ters based on sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produ@@ ce ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about other cl@@ us@@ ters of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ ion , one way of tran@@ sc@@ en@@ ding these cul@@ tur@@ al g@@ he@@ t@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ telling ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies cannot demo@@ l@@ ish fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ un@@ ch ho@@ les in our mental w@@ all@@ s ."
"And through those ho@@ les , we can get a gl@@ imp@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion at the age of e@@ ight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise no@@ te@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in kee@@ ping a person@@ al jour@@ nal .
"In re@@ tr@@ os@@ pe@@ ct , I think she was sl@@ igh@@ tly wor@@ ri@@ ed about my san@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ stan@@ tly telling stories at home , which was good , ex@@ cept I told this to ima@@ gin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with col@@ ore@@ d cra@@ y@@ ons and ap@@ o@@ log@@ iz@@ ing to ob@@ jects when I bu@@ m@@ p@@ ed into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ ences and emot@@ ions ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was ter@@ ri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long pas@@ sion for wr@@ iting fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ to@@ bio@@ grap@@ h@@ ical man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation than a tran@@ sc@@ en@@ den@@ tal jour@@ ney into other lives , other possi@@ bil@@ ities ."
And p@@ lease be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ plo@@ ma@@ t .
"So from this small , super@@ st@@ iti@@ ous , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ clas@@ s ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od of my gr@@ and@@ mother , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ presen@@ t@@ ative fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our clas@@ s@@ room , there were children from all n@@ ation@@ al@@ ities , yet this di@@ versity did not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly le@@ ad to a cos@@ mo@@ polit@@ an , e@@ g@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an clas@@ s@@ room demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , it gener@@ ated an at@@ mos@@ p@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individu@@ al on his own , but as the re@@ presen@@ t@@ ative of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was fun , ex@@ cept wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ g@@ ative , with reg@@ ar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a rel@@ ig@@ ion , took place ."
"The child who re@@ presen@@ ted it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ed and bu@@ l@@ li@@ ed en@@ d@@ les@@ s@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a mil@@ it@@ ary tak@@ e@@ over happened in my country , a gun@@ man of my n@@ ation@@ ality ne@@ arly kill@@ ed the P@@ ope , and T@@ ur@@ key got zer@@ o poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Eur@@ o@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of be@@ coming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first tas@@ te of cul@@ tur@@ al ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the movi@@ e &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night E@@ x@@ pre@@ ss , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qu@@ i@@ red how many c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes a day I s@@ mok@@ ed , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mok@@ ers , and they won@@ de@@ red at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to learn that these were the three ma@@ in ste@@ re@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about my country : polit@@ ics , c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pa@@ in , we went to J@@ or@@ dan , G@@ er@@ many and An@@ k@@ ara again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I felt like my ima@@ gin@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies gave me a sense of cen@@ ter , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ he@@ ren@@ ce , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mid@@ -@@ t@@ w@@ enti@@ es , I mo@@ ved to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ verse ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od where I wr@@ ote se@@ ver@@ al of my no@@ ve@@ ls ."
I was in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the mor@@ ning , I saw something that sto@@ pped me in my trac@@ ks ."
"There was the local gro@@ cer there — a g@@ ru@@ m@@ p@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t se@@ ll al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ gin@@ als ."
He was sitting next to a trans@@ ve@@ st@@ ite with a long black wi@@ g and ma@@ sc@@ ara run@@ ning down her che@@ e@@ ks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing hands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ serv@@ ative gro@@ cer and a cr@@ ying trans@@ ve@@ st@@ ite s@@ mok@@ ing together on the side@@ walk ."
"In the face of death and de@@ stru@@ ction , our m@@ un@@ dan@@ e differen@@ ces ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a sim@@ il@@ ar effe@@ ct on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are read@@ ing a good no@@ vel , we leave our small , co@@ z@@ y ap@@ art@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ a@@ sed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s col@@ le@@ ge in B@@ os@@ ton , then M@@ ich@@ ig@@ an ."
"I experi@@ en@@ ced this , not so much as a ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical shi@@ ft , as a lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic one ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion in En@@ gl@@ ish .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mig@@ r@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the com@@ mu@@ te between langu@@ ag@@ es gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create myself ."
"I love wr@@ iting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emot@@ i@@ onal , and I love wr@@ iting in En@@ gl@@ ish , which to me is very ma@@ the@@ matic@@ al and ce@@ re@@ br@@ al ."
So I feel conne@@ cted to each language in a different way .
"For me , like mil@@ lions of other people around the world today , En@@ gl@@ ish is an ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a la@@ te@@ com@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tual fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ation ."
"As la@@ te@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cr@@ ack better j@@ ok@@ es , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the ton@@ gu@@ e ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ tim@@ i@@ dat@@ ing .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fr@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also st@@ im@@ ul@@ ating ."
And this is what I disco@@ vered in B@@ os@@ ton — that fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ation was very st@@ im@@ ul@@ ating .
"A@@ t this stage , my gr@@ and@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , started to inclu@@ de in her dai@@ ly p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ gen@@ tly get mar@@ ri@@ ed so that I could set@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ri@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of set@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , I started com@@ mu@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a and I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a no@@ ma@@ d , phys@@ ically and sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ ally ."
"S@@ tor@@ ies ac@@ company me , kee@@ ping my pie@@ ces and memor@@ ies together , like an ex@@ is@@ ten@@ tial g@@ lu@@ e ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , rec@@ ently , I &apos;ve also be@@ gun to think that they l@@ ose their ma@@ gi@@ c if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ ject that I would love to think about together .
"When my first no@@ vel writ@@ ten in En@@ gl@@ ish came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cr@@ it@@ ic ."
"&quot; I l@@ ik@@ ed your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had writ@@ ten it differen@@ tly . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic charac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a uni@@ versity cam@@ p@@ us in B@@ os@@ ton , so to me , it was norma@@ l that there be more inter@@ national charac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ters , but I under@@ sto@@ od what my cr@@ it@@ ic was looking for ."
And I also under@@ sto@@ od that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my iden@@ t@@ ity .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of iden@@ t@@ ity polit@@ ics a@@ ffe@@ cts the way stories are being cir@@ cul@@ ated , read and re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but non@@ -@@ W@@ es@@ tern au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly ."
"If you &apos;re a woman writ@@ er from the Mus@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are expe@@ cted to write the stories of Mus@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy Mus@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re expe@@ cted to write in@@ forma@@ tive , po@@ ig@@ nan@@ t and charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic stories and leave the experim@@ en@@ tal and av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de to your W@@ es@@ tern col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es ."
What I experi@@ en@@ ced as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as cre@@ ative individu@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ presen@@ t@@ ati@@ ves of their re@@ spe@@ ctive cul@@ tures : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very dis@@ tin@@ ctive , if not pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ."
The writ@@ er and com@@ mu@@ ter J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in gave an inter@@ view in 198@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ a@@ te@@ dly asked about his h@@ omo@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wer tried to p@@ ig@@ e@@ on@@ ho@@ le him as a ga@@ y writ@@ er , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in sto@@ pped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; W@@ hen iden@@ t@@ ity polit@@ ics tries to put la@@ be@@ ls on us , it is our f@@ ree@@ dom of ima@@ gin@@ ation that is in dan@@ ger ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ z@@ y ca@@ te@@ gor@@ y called mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al liter@@ ature in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the W@@ es@@ tern world are l@@ um@@ p@@ ed together .
"I never for@@ get my first mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three writ@@ ers , one from the Ph@@ il@@ ipp@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ es@@ ian — like a j@@ oke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were br@@ ought together was not because we shar@@ ed an art@@ is@@ tic st@@ y@@ le or a liter@@ ary tas@@ te .
It was only because of our pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al writ@@ ers are expe@@ cted to tell real stories , not so much the ima@@ gin@@ ary ."
A fun@@ ction is at@@ tribu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the writ@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ ti@@ onal charac@@ ters become the re@@ presen@@ t@@ ati@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this ten@@ den@@ cy to see a story as more than a story does not so@@ le@@ ly come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ en@@ ced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ ti@@ onal charac@@ ters u@@ tte@@ red in a no@@ vel .
"I had in@@ ten@@ ded to write a con@@ struc@@ tive , mul@@ ti@@ -@@ la@@ ye@@ red no@@ vel about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My mic@@ ro story became a ma@@ cr@@ o issue when I was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cr@@ it@@ ic@@ ized , others p@@ rai@@ sed me for wr@@ iting about the T@@ ur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both side@@ s that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to be@@ little my work ."
"I want to love and ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ rit@@ ers are ent@@ it@@ led to their polit@@ ical op@@ in@@ ions , and there are good polit@@ ical no@@ ve@@ ls out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of dai@@ ly polit@@ ics ."
"C@@ he@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the cor@@ re@@ ct way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the l@@ at@@ ter is an art@@ ist &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility . &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ t@@ ity polit@@ ics di@@ v@@ ide@@ s us . F@@ ic@@ tion conne@@ cts .
One is interested in s@@ wee@@ ping gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
"The other , in nu@@ an@@ ces ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ oun@@ d@@ ari@@ es .
The other recogni@@ z@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ den@@ t@@ ity polit@@ ics is made of so@@ li@@ d br@@ ic@@ ks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ to@@ man times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ te@@ ll@@ ers called &quot; &quot; med@@ da@@ h . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ ffe@@ e hou@@ ses , where they would tell a story in front of an au@@ dience , often impro@@ vis@@ ing ."
"W@@ it@@ h each new person in the story , the med@@ da@@ h would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ person@@ ating that charac@@ ter ."
"E@@ very@@ body could go and lis@@ ten , you know — ordinary people , even the su@@ l@@ tan , Mus@@ lim@@ s and non@@ -@@ Mus@@ lim@@ s ."

"B@@ ook@@ s have sa@@ ved the in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted , tim@@ id child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also a@@ ware of the dan@@ ger of fe@@ ti@@ shi@@ z@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ stic , R@@ umi , met his sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al compan@@ ion , S@@ ha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the l@@ at@@ ter did was to t@@ oss R@@ umi &apos;s book@@ s into water and wat@@ ch the le@@ t@@ ters dis@@ sol@@ ve ."
"The S@@ u@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ yon@@ d yourself is far wor@@ se than ig@@ nor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tur@@ al g@@ he@@ t@@ to@@ s is not l@@ ack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not be@@ yon@@ d ourselves : it makes us e@@ lit@@ ist , dis@@ tan@@ t and dis@@ conne@@ cted ."
There &apos;s a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing comp@@ as@@ s .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the comp@@ as@@ s is st@@ ati@@ c , ro@@ o@@ ted in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ stan@@ tly moving ."
"L@@ ike that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ o@@ ted in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l , with str@@ ong T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part tra@@ ve@@ ls the world , conne@@ c@@ ting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the res@@ idence of O@@ t@@ to@@ man su@@ l@@ tan@@ s for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the p@@ al@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ jin@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ d@@ ings .
I &apos;m in@@ tr@@ igu@@ ed by this con@@ cept .
We usu@@ ally dis@@ tr@@ ust those areas that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the do@@ ma@@ in of super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures like the d@@ jin@@ n , who are made of s@@ mok@@ e@@ less fir@@ e and are the sym@@ bo@@ l of el@@ us@@ i@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ us@@ ive space is what writ@@ ers and art@@ ists need most .
W@@ hen I write fic@@ tion I ch@@ er@@ ish el@@ us@@ i@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 pa@@ ges later .
I like it when my charac@@ ters sur@@ pr@@ ise me .
"I might write about a Mus@@ li@@ m woman in one no@@ vel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a han@@ d@@ some , ga@@ y pro@@ fe@@ s@@ s@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our he@@ ar@@ ts , we can write about anything and everything ."
"A@@ u@@ d@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fa@@ thers ta@@ ught us to say , &apos; I think , the@@ re@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She sug@@ ge@@ sted , &quot; &quot; I feel , the@@ re@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in cre@@ ative wr@@ iting cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
P@@ er@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ ma@@ gin@@ ative liter@@ ature is not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly about wr@@ iting who we are or what we know or what our iden@@ t@@ ity is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to ex@@ p@@ and our he@@ ar@@ ts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tur@@ al g@@ he@@ tto and go vis@@ it the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ sh@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ cl@@ es be@@ yon@@ d cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"They conne@@ ct all hum@@ an@@ ity , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of iden@@ t@@ ity polit@@ ics , and that is the good news ."

I &apos;m J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ oni@@ ga@@ l . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do a@@ chi@@ eve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , collec@@ ti@@ vely all the Wor@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft ga@@ m@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the v@@ ir@@ tual problems of A@@ zer@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing ."
We &apos;re ev@@ ol@@ ving to be a more col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
And we actually build str@@ on@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resu@@ lt .
F@@ ive million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
H@@ is work is br@@ il@@ li@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ t@@ ima@@ l s@@ itu@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"@@ Be@@ fore we had a@@ we@@ some game contro@@ ll@@ ers , we had sh@@ ee@@ p &apos;s k@@ nu@@ c@@ k@@ les ."
People were su@@ f@@ fer@@ ing . People were f@@ igh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al d@@ ice game ."
"We want to imagine ep@@ ic w@@ ins , and then give people the means to a@@ chi@@ eve the ep@@ ic w@@ in ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ ve@@ ling up in s@@ kill@@ s like local in@@ s@@ ight , knowledge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , vision and re@@ sour@@ ce@@ fu@@ l@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ ora@@ do , called C@@ rai@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ zen squ@@ are mil@@ es . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es .
And the job in question was sh@@ ee@@ p ran@@ ch@@ er .
"My ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an ap@@ pre@@ n@@ tic@@ e , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ities are to simply try and keep up and give an hon@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ ee@@ p . G@@ re@@ at .
We go to C@@ rai@@ g and we che@@ ck in to a ho@@ te@@ l and I realiz@@ e the next day that ca@@ str@@ ation is going to be an absolu@@ te part of this work .
"So , norma@@ lly , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y sub@@ ject , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very C@@ han@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tra@@ y ac@@ cur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of re@@ spe@@ ct for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some l@@ am@@ b@@ s , C@@ an you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little sma@@ l@@ ler ."
"This one was actually around the pla@@ ying car@@ ds I got y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , but it had a certain famil@@ i@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the tai@@ l , t@@ igh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um , t@@ igh@@ tly ."
B@@ lo@@ od f@@ low is s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ tar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; G@@ re@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the l@@ am@@ b@@ s and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of anima@@ l h@@ us@@ ban@@ d@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ ie is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the l@@ am@@ b — two hands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , like@@ w@@ ise on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the p@@ ost , she open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ right . G@@ re@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always wat@@ ch the process done the first time before I try it .
"@@ Be@@ ing an ap@@ pre@@ n@@ tic@@ e , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ c@@ ke@@ t to pu@@ ll out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of fl@@ ic@@ ked it open in a way that ca@@ ught the sun that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ t@@ il@@ age of the tai@@ l , right next to the but@@ t of the l@@ am@@ b , and very quickly the tai@@ l was gone and in the bu@@ c@@ ke@@ t that I was ho@@ l@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well call@@ ou@@ sed fore@@ fin@@ ger , he had the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gr@@ as@@ p ."
"And he p@@ ul@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , M@@ i@@ cha@@ el — you don &apos;t , OK ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , th@@ ro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his shou@@ l@@ der , and then gr@@ ab@@ s the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um and pu@@ sh@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ sc@@ uring my view , but what I hear is a sl@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a no@@ ise that soun@@ ds like V@@ el@@ cr@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a st@@ ick@@ y w@@ all and I am not even ki@@ d@@ ding ."
C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sh@@ oo@@ t , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ ime out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no wr@@ iting , there &apos;s no scri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t f@@ ool around , we don &apos;t re@@ he@@ ar@@ se — we sh@@ oo@@ t what we get !@@ "
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is nu@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is cra@@ z@@ y .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are te@@ st@@ ic@@ les in this bu@@ c@@ ke@@ t and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him expla@@ in , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; L@@ ike the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety ."
"@@ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the l@@ am@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on t@@ w@@ ice a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very C@@ han@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he p@@ ul@@ ls out a ba@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up another l@@ am@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , b@@ and goes on the tai@@ l , b@@ and goes on the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , l@@ am@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , f@@ all@@ s down , gets up , shak@@ es a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , f@@ all@@ s down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this l@@ am@@ b , at all ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ ts up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qu@@ i@@ ver@@ ing , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvi@@ ous dis@@ tre@@ ss ."
"And I &apos;m looking at the l@@ am@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ber@@ t , how long ?"
"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;"
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the l@@ am@@ b that he had just did his little pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ an@@ cing around , b@@ le@@ e@@ ding sto@@ pped ."
"He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ bl@@ ing on some gr@@ as@@ s , f@@ ro@@ l@@ ic@@ king ."
"And I was just so blo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second ."
"And I was re@@ min@@ ded how ut@@ ter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time ."
"( Laughter ) And I was es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously sh@@ ort stra@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these l@@ am@@ b@@ s in the p@@ en , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s star@@ ting to feel like a G@@ er@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the l@@ am@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , open@@ s it up ."
Al@@ ber@@ t hands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .
"I go in , tai@@ l comes off ."
"I go in , I gra@@ b the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ p comes off ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t in@@ stru@@ cts , &quot; &quot; P@@ us@@ h it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do ."

"@@ Just b@@ ite &apos; e@@ m off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words ."
"( Laughter ) L@@ ike , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mom@@ ents where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , I &apos;m standing there , in the R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es , and all I can think of is the A@@ ris@@ to@@ te@@ li@@ an de@@ fin@@ ition of a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."

"I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my s@@ ight , so I did what I had to do ."
I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m standing there with two te@@ st@@ ic@@ les on my chin .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shak@@ e the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; P@@ o@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in A@@ ris@@ tot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come cra@@ shing into my head that I ha@@ ven &apos;t heard since my clas@@ s@@ ics pro@@ fe@@ s@@ s@@ or in col@@ le@@ ge d@@ r@@ ill@@ ed them there ."
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
A@@ nag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
A@@ nag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the G@@ ree@@ k word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the trans@@ ition from ig@@ nor@@ ance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is ."
It &apos;s what our net@@ work does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .

"The other word , peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ dies , you know — Eur@@ ip@@ ide@@ s and S@@ op@@ ho@@ cl@@ es — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he su@@ d@@ den@@ ly realiz@@ es that ho@@ t ch@@ ick he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ e@@ ping with and having bab@@ ies with is his mother .

That &apos;s peri@@ pe@@ ty or peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a on my chin .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great dev@@ ice though ."

It &apos;s c@@ ru@@ shing when the au@@ dience se@@ es it the right way .

"L@@ ook@@ ing at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was stru@@ ck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pa@@ te@@ tic mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment up@@ on ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ ist but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey M@@ ike ."
"L@@ ook , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realiz@@ e you &apos;ve sho@@ t in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fi@@ shing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every maj@@ or indus@@ try ."

"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their th@@ ough@@ ts , collec@@ ti@@ vely , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , te@@ st@@ ic@@ les are on my chin , th@@ ough@@ ts are b@@ oun@@ cing around ."
"And , after that sh@@ oo@@ t , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , person@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other not@@ ions of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ sum@@ ing are sa@@ cr@@ os@@ an@@ ct , and they &apos;re not ."
People with d@@ ir@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are happ@@ i@@ er than you think .

"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ is@@ t@@ ling &quot; &quot; L@@ ook for the U@@ ni@@ on La@@ be@@ l , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ ker cra@@ p ."

So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we challen@@ ged some of these sa@@ cre@@ d co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .

"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard gro@@ wing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — B@@ o@@ b C@@ om@@ b@@ s , the pi@@ g far@@ mer in L@@ as V@@ e@@ ga@@ s who collec@@ ts the un@@ e@@ a@@ ten sc@@ rap@@ s of food from the c@@ as@@ ino@@ s and fe@@ e@@ ds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."

He &apos;s making a great living .

"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got o@@ ffe@@ red like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ e@@ ga@@ s ."

"So I started to look at pas@@ sion , I started to look at ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy ver@@ su@@ s effe@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess — as T@@ i@@ m tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge dis@@ tin@@ ction ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ at@@ itu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; suc@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies &quot; &quot; that han@@ g with that sch@@ ma@@ l@@ t@@ z@@ y art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om@@ s around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ a@@ fe@@ ty — sa@@ fe@@ ty first ?
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ um@@ ane S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is he@@ res@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ fe@@ ty third ?"
Right ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I val@@ ue my sa@@ fe@@ ty on these cra@@ z@@ y j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ er@@ ing S@@ ea , I was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; De@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 mil@@ es off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 5@@ 0@@ -@@ foo@@ t se@@ as , big wa@@ ves , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"M@@ ost ha@@ z@@ ar@@ dou@@ s environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , la@@ shing the p@@ ots down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 fe@@ et off the de@@ ck , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean ."
U@@ n@@ spe@@ ak@@ ably dan@@ ger@@ ous .
"I sc@@ am@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ d@@ ul@@ ity , &quot; C@@ ap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ ce@@ an . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ tory flo@@ or or any con@@ stru@@ ction s@@ ite .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he call@@ s me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ si@@ bility is not to get you home al@@ ive .
"My respon@@ si@@ bility is to get you home r@@ ich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home al@@ ive , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this f@@ al@@ se — this sense of com@@ plac@@ en@@ cy when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility as though it &apos;s our own , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at l@@ en@@ g@@ th about the many little dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tions we made and the en@@ d@@ less l@@ ist of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I for@@ med a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ main@@ ing two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a ci@@ vi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a co@@ ld war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t t@@ w@@ ist our mus@@ tach@@ e in some Ma@@ chi@@ a@@ ve@@ l@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve wa@@ ged this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od ."
The way we por@@ tra@@ y working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s la@@ ug@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 p@@ oun@@ ds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant but@@ t cr@@ ack . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ un@@ ch l@@ ines ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve wa@@ ged this war on M@@ ad@@ is@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a mes@@ sage , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ t@@ ire a little fas@@ ter , if you could p@@ un@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ a@@ shin@@ g@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even be@@ gin to talk about the de@@ als and pol@@ ic@@ ies in place that a@@ ffe@@ ct the bot@@ to@@ m line reality of the av@@ a@@ il@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , I mean — how many people have an i@@ Ph@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re pl@@ ug@@ ged in ; we &apos;re conne@@ cted .
I would never sug@@ gest for a second that something bad has come out of the te@@ ch re@@ v@@ olution .
"@@ Goo@@ d g@@ ri@@ e@@ f , not to this c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would sug@@ gest that innov@@ ation without im@@ it@@ ation is a comple@@ te was@@ te of time .
And no@@ body ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tes im@@ it@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our i@@ Ph@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the gen@@ i@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know ."
O@@ ur to@@ ols today don &apos;t look like sho@@ ve@@ ls and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the collec@@ tive effe@@ ct of all of that has been this mar@@ gin@@ aliz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too l@@ ate in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the te@@ st@@ ic@@ les on my chin ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n for work , man@@ u@@ al lab@@ or , s@@ kill@@ ed lab@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ got@@ ten ben@@ ef@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about gr@@ and@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
B@@ ar@@ ack wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The inf@@ ra@@ structure is a huge deal .
"This war on work , that I supp@@ ose ex@@ ists , has ca@@ su@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The inf@@ ra@@ structure &apos;s the first one ; de@@ cl@@ ining tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electr@@ ic@@ ians , fe@@ wer car@@ pen@@ ters , fe@@ wer pl@@ um@@ bers , fe@@ wer we@@ l@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The inf@@ ra@@ structure j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in de@@ cl@@ ine , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tr@@ illion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l En@@ gin@@ e@@ ers — that we need to ex@@ p@@ end to even make a den@@ t in the inf@@ ra@@ structure , which is curren@@ tly ra@@ ted at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were run@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to st@@ ick un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce is to ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and d@@ ir@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ pos@@ it@@ es ."
"They &apos;re two side@@ s of the same co@@ in , just like innov@@ ation and im@@ it@@ ation , like risk and respon@@ si@@ bility , like peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that po@@ or little l@@ am@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qu@@ i@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment dor@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ e@@ p .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ e@@ p ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I br@@ oke my che@@ e@@ k@@ b@@ one , I got five st@@ it@@ ches on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ e@@ p .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with med@@ ical doc@@ tors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more insp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ e@@ p ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new fe@@ min@@ ist issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ e@@ p our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ e@@ p de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a v@@ ir@@ ility sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ g@@ ged that he had only got@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ e@@ p the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had got@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ e@@ p de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ a@@ shin@@ g@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about e@@ ight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re like@@ ly to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s oka@@ y , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fe@@ ren@@ ce call@@ s and me@@ et you at e@@ ight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ il@@ li@@ ant lea@@ ders in business , in fin@@ ance , in polit@@ ics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble decis@@ ions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lea@@ der , because the essen@@ ce of lea@@ der@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it hit@@ s the T@@ itan@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs hit@@ ting our T@@ itan@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ is@@ ters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hi@@ le all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conne@@ cted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sis@@ ter would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have wok@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ e@@ p and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple c@@ ri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a person@@ al level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gr@@ at@@ itu@@ de , effe@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to shu@@ t your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to shu@@ t your engin@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ e@@ p ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minu@@ te about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly , th@@ ree@@ -@@ p@@ ound ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ a@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ ste@@ ll@@ ar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate itself con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of neur@@ o@@ logy , and h@@ ope@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ous or@@ gan ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of pr@@ oto@@ pl@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this activ@@ ity em@@ er@@ ges the whole spe@@ c@@ tru@@ m of ab@@ il@@ ities that we call human nature and human consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small reg@@ ion of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small reg@@ ion of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ r@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ g@@ nit@@ ive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly se@@ lec@@ tive l@@ oss of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pre@@ ser@@ ved inta@@ ct , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ f@@ idence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ ction onto structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few str@@ ik@@ ing exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m gi@@ ving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome .
"If you look at the first s@@ li@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ por@@ al lo@@ bes , fron@@ tal lo@@ bes , par@@ i@@ e@@ tal lo@@ bes , OK — the lo@@ bes that con@@ st@@ itu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the tem@@ por@@ al lo@@ bes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fus@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you can no longer recogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogni@@ ze them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s J@@ oe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogni@@ ze yourself in the mir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
OK . Now that sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome is well known as ca@@ used by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fus@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phys@@ ic@@ ians have heard about it , not even neur@@ o@@ log@@ ists ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s de@@ l@@ us@@ ion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely norma@@ l , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely norma@@ l , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"W@@ hy would somebody — and this person is perfe@@ c@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and inte@@ llig@@ ent in all other re@@ spe@@ cts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his de@@ l@@ us@@ ion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry te@@ x@@ t@@ book@@ s , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong se@@ x@@ u@@ al at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us complex of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develo@@ ps , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these la@@ tent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ ma@@ ging the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these la@@ tent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the surface , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ ex@@ plic@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your da@@ ma@@ ged brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ ious , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same de@@ l@@ us@@ ion , a pati@@ ent having the same de@@ l@@ us@@ ion , about his pe@@ t po@@ o@@ dle . ( Laughter )@@ "
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the la@@ tent be@@ st@@ i@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expla@@ in this cur@@ ious dis@@ order , we look at the structure and fun@@ c@@ tions of the norma@@ l vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ ma@@ lly , vi@@ su@@ al sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vi@@ su@@ al areas in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after pro@@ ces@@ sing all that , the mes@@ sage goes to a small structure called the fus@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ s@@ itive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the mes@@ sage c@@ as@@ ca@@ des into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emot@@ i@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , ga@@ ug@@ es the emot@@ i@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it ma@@ te ?
"O@@ r is it something absolu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ int , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?"
W@@ h@@ ich you can completely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ ges then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ ton@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and me@@ a@@ sure the change in s@@ kin res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ou@@ sed , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minu@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al areas and , ho@@ we@@ ver , and it &apos;s pro@@ ces@@ sed in the fus@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and you recogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the mes@@ sage c@@ as@@ ca@@ des into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ ton@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emot@@ i@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the acc@@ ident ."
"So because the fus@@ i@@ form is inta@@ ct , the cha@@ p can still recogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is c@@ ut to the emot@@ i@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? Right ?"
"( Laughter ) And the@@ re@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ ex@@ plic@@ able l@@ ack of emot@@ ions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some st@@ range woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and me@@ a@@ sure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic s@@ kin respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can me@@ a@@ sure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ bre@@ ll@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a l@@ ion , or a t@@ ig@@ er , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about norma@@ l people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and me@@ a@@ sure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic s@@ kin respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ int , nothing happens , as in norma@@ l people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic s@@ kin respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emot@@ i@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vi@@ su@@ al areas to the emot@@ i@@ onal cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vision is norma@@ l because the vi@@ su@@ al areas are norma@@ l , his emot@@ ions are norma@@ l — he &apos;ll la@@ ug@@ h , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vision to emot@@ ions is c@@ ut and the@@ re@@ fore he has this de@@ l@@ us@@ ion that his mother is an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , neur@@ al psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome and say that the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ c@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neur@@ al anat@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother p@@ hon@@ es from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — p@@ hon@@ es him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? W@@ here are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no de@@ l@@ us@@ ion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the he@@ ar@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the emot@@ i@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the acc@@ ident ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he recogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an imp@@ os@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this complex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by conside@@ r@@ ing another cur@@ ious sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome called p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b .
And you all know what a p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , for gan@@ g@@ ren@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a seri@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the presen@@ ce of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a p@@ han@@ to@@ m ar@@ m or a p@@ han@@ to@@ m le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a p@@ han@@ to@@ m with almost any part of the body ."
"@@ Be@@ li@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ nal vis@@ cer@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ te@@ ru@@ s re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ste@@ rec@@ tom@@ y — who have a p@@ han@@ to@@ m u@@ te@@ ru@@ s , inclu@@ ding p@@ han@@ to@@ m men@@ stru@@ al cr@@ am@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one studen@@ t asked me the other day , &quot; D@@ o they get p@@ han@@ to@@ m P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for sci@@ enti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ ai@@ m that they can move the p@@ han@@ to@@ m ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the shou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rin@@ gs , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"These are very compe@@ lling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ations ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not de@@ l@@ us@@ i@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a compe@@ lling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ we@@ ver , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be re@@ li@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It soun@@ ds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ ee@@ ts , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s , the or@@ ig@@ inal ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve su@@ p@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was c@@ ut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle acc@@ ident ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ided atte@@ m@@ pt to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ ta@@ tes the ar@@ m , and then you get a p@@ han@@ to@@ m ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a seri@@ ous cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ic@@ ide , OK ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this sy@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves su@@ p@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the p@@ han@@ to@@ m itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was inta@@ ct , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , OK ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ s@@ ation of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your p@@ han@@ to@@ m , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , so you can re@@ li@@ eve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the p@@ han@@ to@@ m ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now se@@ nd the comm@@ and to the p@@ han@@ to@@ m , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can re@@ li@@ eve the p@@ han@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , the p@@ han@@ to@@ m cr@@ am@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , v@@ ir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding a@@ gen@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mir@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard box with a mir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the p@@ han@@ to@@ m — so my first pati@@ ent , De@@ re@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted ."
"He had a p@@ han@@ to@@ m ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed p@@ han@@ to@@ m ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a mir@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his p@@ han@@ to@@ m left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and the norma@@ l hand on the right side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the p@@ han@@ to@@ m being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion of the norma@@ l ar@@ m in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this p@@ han@@ to@@ m has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ gle your p@@ han@@ to@@ m — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al im@@ pres@@ sion that the p@@ han@@ to@@ m is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the a@@ st@@ oni@@ shing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my p@@ han@@ to@@ m is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is re@@ li@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at your re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion of your p@@ han@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; And he started g@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my p@@ han@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your norma@@ l hand and p@@ han@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my p@@ han@@ to@@ m . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your norma@@ l hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my p@@ han@@ to@@ m is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being re@@ li@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes ."
&quot; And move your norma@@ l hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , o@@ h my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and the cr@@ it@@ ical ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his p@@ han@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely u@@ se@@ less ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )@@ "
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ ys@@ is that you see in neur@@ o@@ logy , like str@@ oke , foc@@ al d@@ y@@ st@@ oni@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a mir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , De@@ re@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , De@@ re@@ k , take it home and pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a peri@@ od of pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ e , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , re@@ li@@ eve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he p@@ hon@@ es me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mir@@ ro@@ r box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this p@@ han@@ to@@ m I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; De@@ re@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a p@@ han@@ to@@ m ar@@ m and the@@ re@@ fore no p@@ han@@ to@@ m el@@ bo@@ w pa@@ in , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no p@@ han@@ to@@ m fore@@ ar@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my p@@ han@@ to@@ m fin@@ g@@ ers dan@@ gl@@ ing from the shou@@ l@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and el@@ im@@ in@@ ate my p@@ han@@ to@@ m fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ic@@ ian ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ ges from vision saying the p@@ han@@ to@@ m is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your moto@@ r comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , the brain says , to he@@ ll with it , there is no p@@ han@@ to@@ m , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of de@@ ni@@ al — it ga@@ tes the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ zen@@ s of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for p@@ han@@ to@@ m pa@@ in , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for str@@ oke re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tr@@ oke you norma@@ lly think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of str@@ oke par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using mir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also gone through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ ious ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the nin@@ e@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely norma@@ l , had the follo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ ore@@ d ."
"F@@ ive is blu@@ e , seven is ye@@ l@@ low , e@@ ight is char@@ tre@@ use , nin@@ e is ind@@ igo , OK ?"
"@@ Be@@ ar in mind , these people are completely norma@@ l in other re@@ spe@@ cts ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , ton@@ es ev@@ oke col@@ or ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is blu@@ e , F shar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be ye@@ l@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dis@@ tin@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ d@@ dle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pe@@ cts of this problem are very in@@ tr@@ igu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in famil@@ ies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a he@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity — sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a is e@@ ight times more common am@@ ong art@@ ists , po@@ e@@ ts , no@@ ve@@ l@@ ists and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ we@@ red before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ u@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a sci@@ enti@@ fic the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id jun@@ ki@@ es and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ a@@ y A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a . All right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fus@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some acc@@ iden@@ tal cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and num@@ bers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cr@@ os@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ member I said it run@@ s in famil@@ ies ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ norma@@ l gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ u@@ ses this ab@@ norma@@ l cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain reg@@ ion is wi@@ red to every other reg@@ ion , and these are tr@@ im@@ med down to create the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mod@@ ular arch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tr@@ im@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ ta@@ tes , then you get de@@ fici@@ ent tr@@ im@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain areas ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get ton@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ conne@@ cted ?"
"Well , think about what art@@ ists , no@@ ve@@ l@@ ists and po@@ e@@ ts have in common , the ability to enga@@ ge in me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king see@@ min@@ g@@ ly un@@ re@@ la@@ ted ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the S@@ un . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ ma@@ l people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the sun , she &apos;s ra@@ di@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the sun ."
"I@@ n@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ sume that this gre@@ a@@ ter cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ a@@ ter pro@@ pen@@ s@@ ity to@@ wards me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in people with sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the e@@ ight times more common in@@ c@@ idence of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ e@@ ts , art@@ ists and no@@ ve@@ l@@ ists ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ re@@ no@@ logical view of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last demon@@ str@@ ation — can I take one minu@@ te ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in de@@ ni@@ al about it ."

N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ nin@@ e percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a M@@ ar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ model sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p inf@@ lec@@ tion — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ iki , m@@ im@@ ics the vi@@ su@@ al inf@@ lec@@ tion , su@@ d@@ den inf@@ lec@@ tion of that j@@ ag@@ ged sh@@ ape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is enga@@ ging in a pr@@ im@@ itive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly ill@@ us@@ ion , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sh@@ ape , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory pat@@ tern , but the brain is able to ex@@ tr@@ act the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a pr@@ im@@ itive form of ab@@ str@@ action , and we now know this happens in the fus@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , these people l@@ ose the ability to enga@@ ge in B@@ ou@@ ba K@@ iki , but they also l@@ ose the ability to enga@@ ge in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and shin@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to me@@ a@@ sure its speci@@ fic gra@@ v@@ ity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing ."

Thank you .
( Applause ) S@@ or@@ ry about that .

This story is about taking ima@@ gin@@ ation seri@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ te@@ red this ordinary materi@@ al , fi@@ sh@@ net , used the same way for cent@@ ur@@ ies ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bil@@ lo@@ wing , v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous for@@ ms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buil@@ d@@ ings in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ like@@ ly person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ died sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ er@@ ing or arch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture ."
"In fact , after col@@ le@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to seven art s@@ cho@@ ols and was re@@ je@@ cted by all seven ."
"I went off on my own to become an art@@ ist , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was o@@ ffe@@ red a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iti@@ ons of pain@@ tin@@ gs , I shipp@@ ed my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pur@@ am ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ shing vil@@ la@@ ge was fam@@ ous for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tried br@@ on@@ ze ca@@ sting .
But to make large for@@ ms was too he@@ av@@ y and ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men bun@@ dle their ne@@ ts into m@@ oun@@ ds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differen@@ tly — a new appro@@ ach to sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make v@@ olu@@ me@@ tri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was made in col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it t@@ it@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ ide H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ is@@ ted them on pol@@ es to photograp@@ h .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ pp@@ le of win@@ d in con@@ stan@@ tly chan@@ ging pat@@ ter@@ ns .
I was mes@@ mer@@ ized .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stu@@ d@@ ying cra@@ ft tra@@ diti@@ ons and col@@ lab@@ or@@ ating with art@@ is@@ ans , next in L@@ i@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace mak@@ ers ."
"I l@@ ik@@ ed the f@@ ine de@@ tai@@ l it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"@@ R@@ et@@ ur@@ ning to India to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed k@@ not@@ s — inst@@ all@@ ed bri@@ ef@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist M@@ an@@ u@@ al S@@ ol@@ a@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wa@@ ter@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ ga@@ l ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ ur@@ able , engin@@ ee@@ red , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ pos@@ ition to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cr@@ ati@@ c , de@@ l@@ ic@@ ate and ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move f@@ lu@@ i@@ dly in the win@@ d ."
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ f@@ fic cir@@ cle .
"So we rai@@ sed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an a@@ verage b@@ ree@@ ze and survi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ er@@ ing so@@ f@@ t@@ ware to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant a@@ er@@ ona@@ u@@ tical engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up r@@ ac@@ ing ya@@ ch@@ ts nam@@ ed Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ p@@ ed me ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the t@@ w@@ in challen@@ ges of pre@@ c@@ ise sh@@ ape and gen@@ tle movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed k@@ not@@ s we@@ ren &apos;t going to with@@ stand a h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane .
"So I develop@@ ed a relation@@ ship with an indus@@ tri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ tory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and fig@@ u@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ l@@ ate this an@@ ci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cr@@ ati@@ c han@@ d@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could produ@@ ce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we rai@@ sed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ foo@@ t l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had ima@@ gin@@ ed was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ l@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ se@@ ction had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the win@@ d &apos;s ch@@ ore@@ o@@ grap@@ hy un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ te@@ red and , at the same time , conne@@ cted to lim@@ it@@ less s@@ ky ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ a@@ ses of sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two di@@ rec@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ is@@ tor@@ ic Ph@@ il@@ a@@ de@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ za , I felt , needed a materi@@ al for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture that was l@@ igh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we experim@@ en@@ ted with tin@@ y at@@ om@@ ized water partic@@ les to create a d@@ ry m@@ ist that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the win@@ d and in te@@ sting , disco@@ vered that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting we@@ t ."
I &apos;m using this sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture materi@@ al to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y of the city &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ex@@ t challenge , the B@@ i@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Amer@@ ic@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ es@@ tern he@@ mis@@ p@@ here and their inter@@ conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to be@@ gin , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the re@@ cent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in C@@ hi@@ le and the tsu@@ nam@@ i that ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s te@@ c@@ ton@@ ic pla@@ tes , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s r@@ ot@@ ation and liter@@ ally sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed the l@@ en@@ g@@ th of the day ."
"So I con@@ ta@@ cted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsu@@ nam@@ i , and trans@@ la@@ ted it into this ."
I@@ ts t@@ it@@ le : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of micro@@ secon@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sh@@ ape was too complex now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the me@@ tal ar@@ ma@@ ture with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine mes@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times str@@ on@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ rely so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to ex@@ is@@ ting buil@@ d@@ ings — liter@@ ally be@@ coming part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ t@@ ware that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ v@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ ig@@ h L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tur@@ al me@@ th@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of s@@ ky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the tra@@ diti@@ onal things , in cra@@ ft for@@ ms ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ te@@ ch materi@@ als and engine@@ er@@ ing to create v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lo@@ wing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ d@@ ings ."
My art@@ is@@ tic hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
"A@@ n at@@ tor@@ ney in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interested in art , never vis@@ ited the local art mu@@ se@@ um , dra@@ g@@ ged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the gr@@ as@@ s , not@@ ic@@ ing the chan@@ ging pat@@ ter@@ ns of win@@ d be@@ side people they didn &apos;t know , shar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this s@@ li@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal a@@ x@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pu@@ ber@@ ty , we f@@ all off the ma@@ p ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
So when I was a ki@@ d ...
this was my team .
( Laughter ) I st@@ un@@ k at sp@@ or@@ ts .
"I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to wat@@ ch them ."
So this is what I did . I went fi@@ shing .
"And for all of my gro@@ wing up I fi@@ shed on the sh@@ ore@@ s of Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut , and these are the cre@@ at@@ ures that I saw on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is ."
"But after I gre@@ w up and went to col@@ le@@ ge , and I came home in the early 90 &apos;s , this is what I found ."
My team had sh@@ run@@ k .
It was like liter@@ ally having your r@@ os@@ ter dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted .
"And as I sort of looked into that , from a very person@@ al point of view as a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , I started to kind of figure out , well , what was the rest of the world thinking about it ?"
F@@ ir@@ st place I started to look was fish marke@@ ts .
"And when I went to fish marke@@ ts , in sp@@ ite of where I was — whether I was in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina , or P@@ ar@@ is , or L@@ on@@ don , or whe@@ re@@ ver — I ke@@ pt seeing this we@@ ir@@ dly re@@ pe@@ ating tro@@ p@@ e of four cre@@ at@@ ures , again and again — on the men@@ us , on ice — sh@@ r@@ im@@ p , tun@@ a , s@@ al@@ mon and c@@ od ."
"And I thought this was pretty st@@ range , and as I looked at it , I was wonder@@ ing , did any@@ one else not@@ ice this sort of sh@@ rin@@ king of the market ?"
"Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team ."
"O@@ r@@ din@@ ary people , the way they looked at se@@ af@@ oo@@ d was like this ."
It &apos;s not an un@@ usu@@ al human charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic to re@@ du@@ ce the natural world down to very few ele@@ ments .
"We did it before , 1@@ 0,000 years ago , when we came out of our ca@@ ves ."
"If you look at fir@@ e p@@ its from 1@@ 0,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see r@@ ac@@ co@@ ons , you &apos;ll see , you know , wo@@ l@@ ves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"But if you te@@ le@@ sc@@ ope to the age of — you know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four mam@@ ma@@ ls : p@@ ig@@ s , co@@ ws , sh@@ ee@@ p and go@@ ats ."
"It &apos;s true of bir@@ ds , too ."
"You look at the men@@ us in New York C@@ ity re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts 1@@ 50 years ago , 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see s@@ ni@@ p@@ e , wo@@ od@@ co@@ ck , grou@@ se , do@@ zen@@ s of duc@@ ks , do@@ zen@@ s of ge@@ ese ."
"But te@@ le@@ sc@@ ope a@@ head to the age of mo@@ der@@ n anima@@ l h@@ us@@ ban@@ d@@ ry , and you &apos;ll see four : tur@@ ke@@ ys , duc@@ ks , ch@@ ic@@ ken and ge@@ ese ."
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve he@@ a@@ ded in this di@@ re@@ ction .
But how have we he@@ a@@ ded in this di@@ re@@ ction ?
Well ...
"@@ first it &apos;s a very , very new problem ."
This is the way we &apos;ve been fi@@ shing the oce@@ ans over the last 50 years .
Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I was a tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s in@@ cen@@ tive to ar@@ m ourselves in a war against fish .
"A@@ ll of the technology that we perfe@@ cted during Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I — son@@ ar , l@@ igh@@ t@@ we@@ ight pol@@ y@@ m@@ ers — all these things were re@@ di@@ rec@@ ted to@@ wards fish ."
"And so you see this tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s buil@@ d@@ up in fi@@ shing cap@@ ac@@ ity , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ing in the course of time , from the end of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I to the present time ."
And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 90 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons out of the se@@ a every year .
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the human we@@ ight of China taken out of the se@@ a every year .
And it &apos;s no co@@ in@@ c@@ idence that I use China as the example because China is now the lar@@ gest fi@@ shing n@@ ation in the world .
"Well , that &apos;s only half the story ."
"The other half of the story is this incredi@@ ble bo@@ om in fish far@@ ming and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , which is now , only in the last year or two , star@@ ting to ex@@ ce@@ ed the amount of w@@ il@@ d fish that we produ@@ ce ."
"So that if you ad@@ d w@@ il@@ d fish and far@@ med fish together , you get the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two Chin@@ as created from the ocean each and every year ."
"And again , it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ c@@ idence that I use China as the example , because China , in ad@@ d@@ ition to being the big@@ gest c@@ at@@ ch@@ er of fish , is also the big@@ gest far@@ mer of fish ."
So let &apos;s look though at the four cho@@ ices we are making right now .
"The first one — by far the most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ af@@ oo@@ d in America and in much of the W@@ est , is sh@@ r@@ im@@ p ."
S@@ h@@ r@@ im@@ p in the w@@ il@@ d — as a w@@ il@@ d produ@@ ct — is a ter@@ ri@@ ble produ@@ ct .
"@@ 5 , 10 , 15 p@@ oun@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fish are reg@@ ul@@ arly kill@@ ed to bring one p@@ ound of sh@@ r@@ im@@ p to the market ."
They &apos;re also incredi@@ bly fu@@ el in@@ ef@@ fici@@ ent to bring to the market .
"In a re@@ cent study that was produc@@ ed out of D@@ al@@ hou@@ si@@ e U@@ ni@@ versity , it was found that dra@@ g@@ ging for sh@@ r@@ im@@ p is one of the most car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ in@@ ten@@ sive ways of fi@@ shing that you can find ."
"So you can far@@ m them , and people do far@@ m them , and they far@@ m them a lot in this very area ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m is ...
the place where you far@@ m sh@@ r@@ im@@ p is in these w@@ il@@ d ha@@ bit@@ ats — in man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts .
Now look at those lo@@ vely ro@@ ots coming down .
"Th@@ ose are the things that hold so@@ il together , prote@@ ct co@@ a@@ sts , create ha@@ bit@@ ats for all sor@@ ts of young fish , young sh@@ r@@ im@@ p , all sor@@ ts of things that are important to this environment ."
"Well , this is what happens to a lot of co@@ as@@ tal man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts ."
We &apos;ve lost mil@@ lions of ac@@ res of co@@ as@@ tal man@@ gro@@ ves over the last 30 or 40 years .
"That r@@ ate of de@@ stru@@ ction has s@@ lo@@ wed , but we &apos;re still in a maj@@ or man@@ gro@@ ve de@@ fic@@ it ."
"The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker M@@ ar@@ k B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in called &quot; &quot; G@@ rin@@ ding N@@ e@@ mo . &quot; &quot; This ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is very , very re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to anything that you &apos;ve ever seen on a tro@@ p@@ ical ree@@ f ."
"Because what &apos;s going on right now , we have sh@@ r@@ im@@ p dra@@ g@@ g@@ ers dra@@ g@@ ging for sh@@ r@@ im@@ p , c@@ at@@ ching a huge amount of b@@ y@@ c@@ at@@ ch , that b@@ y@@ c@@ at@@ ch in turn gets ground up and turned into sh@@ r@@ im@@ p food ."
"And sometimes , many of these v@@ es@@ sel@@ s — man@@ ned by s@@ la@@ ves — are c@@ at@@ ching these so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; tr@@ as@@ h fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would love to see on a ree@@ f , gr@@ in@@ ding them up and tur@@ ning them into sh@@ r@@ im@@ p fe@@ ed — an e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem liter@@ ally e@@ ating itself and sp@@ it@@ ting out sh@@ r@@ im@@ p ."
"The next most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ af@@ oo@@ d in America , and also thr@@ ough@@ out the W@@ est , is tun@@ a ."
So tun@@ a is this ul@@ t@@ imate global fish .
These huge man@@ age@@ ment areas have to be ob@@ ser@@ ved in order for tun@@ a to be well man@@ ag@@ ed .
"O@@ ur own man@@ age@@ ment area , called a Re@@ gi@@ onal F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ ies M@@ an@@ age@@ ment O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation , is called I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T , the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion for the Con@@ serv@@ ation of A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic T@@ un@@ as ."
"The great nat@@ ur@@ al@@ ist C@@ ar@@ l S@@ af@@ ina once called it , &quot; The Inter@@ national Con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy to C@@ at@@ ch all the T@@ un@@ as . &quot;"
"O@@ f course we &apos;ve seen incredi@@ ble impro@@ vement in I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T in the last few years , there is tot@@ al room for impro@@ vement , but it re@@ ma@@ ins to be said that tun@@ a is a global fish , and to man@@ age it , we have to man@@ age the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"Well , we could also try to grow tun@@ a but tun@@ a is a spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cul@@ arly bad anima@@ l for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
M@@ any people don &apos;t know this but tun@@ a are war@@ m@@ -@@ blo@@ o@@ ded .
"They can he@@ at their bo@@ dies 20 de@@ gre@@ es ab@@ o@@ ve am@@ bi@@ ent tem@@ per@@ ature , they can s@@ wi@@ m at over 40 mil@@ es an h@@ our ."
"So that pretty much el@@ im@@ ina@@ tes all the adv@@ anta@@ ges of far@@ ming a fish , right ?"
"A far@@ med fish is — or a fish is col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , it doesn &apos;t move too much ."
That &apos;s a great thing for gro@@ wing prote@@ in .
"But if you &apos;ve got this cra@@ z@@ y , w@@ il@@ d cre@@ ature that s@@ w@@ im@@ s at 40 mil@@ es an h@@ our and he@@ ats its blo@@ od — not a great can@@ di@@ date for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
The next cre@@ ature — most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ af@@ oo@@ d in America and thr@@ ough@@ out the W@@ est — is s@@ al@@ mon .
"Now s@@ al@@ mon got its pl@@ under@@ ing , too , but it didn &apos;t really ne@@ cess@@ ari@@ ly happen through fi@@ shing ."
This is my home state of Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut .
Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut used to be home to a lot of w@@ il@@ d s@@ al@@ mon .
"But if you look at this ma@@ p of Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut , every do@@ t on that ma@@ p is a da@@ m ."
"There are over 3@@ ,000 d@@ ams in the state of Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut ."
"I often say this is why people in Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut are so up@@ t@@ ight — ( Laughter ) If somebody could just un@@ blo@@ ck Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut &apos;s chi , I feel that we could have an in@@ fin@@ ite@@ ly better world ."
"But I made this particular com@@ ment at a con@@ ven@@ tion once of national par@@ ks of@@ fic@@ ers , and this guy from Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina si@@ d@@ led up to me , he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you ough@@ t@@ n &apos;t be so hard on your Con@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut , cause we here in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina , we got 3@@ 5@@ ,000 d@@ ams . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c , it &apos;s an inter@@ national ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c ."
"And there are d@@ ams every@@ where , and these are pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly the things that stop w@@ il@@ d s@@ al@@ mon from re@@ ach@@ ing their sp@@ a@@ w@@ ning gr@@ oun@@ ds ."
"So as a resu@@ lt , we &apos;ve turned to a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , and s@@ al@@ mon is one the most suc@@ cess@@ ful , at least from a num@@ bers point of view ."
"When they first started far@@ ming s@@ al@@ mon , it could take as many as six p@@ oun@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fish to make a single p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ mon ."
"The indus@@ try has , to its cre@@ d@@ it , gre@@ at@@ ly impro@@ ved ."
"They &apos;ve got@@ ten it be@@ low two to one , al@@ though it &apos;s a little bit of a che@@ at because if you look at the way a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture fe@@ ed is produc@@ ed , they &apos;re me@@ a@@ sur@@ ing pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts — p@@ oun@@ ds of pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts per p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ mon ."
Th@@ ose pe@@ l@@ le@@ ts are in turn re@@ duc@@ ed fish .
"So the ac@@ tual — what &apos;s called the F@@ I@@ F@@ O , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say ."
"But in any case , cre@@ d@@ it to the indus@@ try , it has lo@@ we@@ red the amount of fish per p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ mon ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m is we &apos;ve also gone cra@@ z@@ y with the amount of s@@ al@@ mon that we &apos;re produc@@ ing .
A@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture is the fas@@ test gro@@ wing food system on the planet .
It &apos;s gro@@ wing at something like seven percent per year .
"And so even though we &apos;re doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still kill@@ ing a lot of these little fish ."
"And it &apos;s not just fish that we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding fish to , we &apos;re also fe@@ e@@ ding fish to ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s and p@@ ig@@ s ."
"So we &apos;ve got ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s and they &apos;re e@@ ating fish , but we@@ ir@@ dly , we also have fish that are e@@ ating ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s ."
"Because the b@@ y@@ produc@@ ts of ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s — fe@@ a@@ thers , blo@@ od , b@@ one — get ground up and f@@ ed to fish ."
"So I often won@@ der , is there a fish that ate a ch@@ ic@@ ken that ate a fish ?"
"It &apos;s sort of a re@@ working of the ch@@ ic@@ ken and e@@ g@@ g thing . An@@ y@@ way — ( Laughter ) All together , though , it resu@@ l@@ ts in a ter@@ ri@@ ble me@@ ss ."
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons of w@@ il@@ d cre@@ at@@ ures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
"That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the se@@ a each and every year ."
The last of the four is a kind of am@@ or@@ p@@ hou@@ s thing .
"It &apos;s what the indus@@ try call@@ s &quot; &quot; wh@@ ite@@ fish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish that get cy@@ cl@@ ed into this wh@@ ite@@ fish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , I think , is through that clas@@ si@@ c piece of American cul@@ in@@ ary innov@@ ation , the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich ."
So the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich actually started as ha@@ li@@ but .
"And it started because a local f@@ ran@@ ch@@ ise o@@ w@@ ner found that when he ser@@ ved his M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s on F@@ ri@@ day , no@@ body came ."
"Because it was a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c community , they needed fish ."
"So he went to R@@ a@@ y K@@ ro@@ c and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring you a fish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich , going to be made out of ha@@ li@@ but . &quot;"
"@@ R@@ a@@ y K@@ ro@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work ."
"I want to do a H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger , and there &apos;s going to be a sl@@ ice of p@@ in@@ e@@ ap@@ ple on a bun ."
"But let &apos;s do this , let &apos;s have a be@@ t ."
"W@@ ho@@ se@@ ver san@@ d@@ w@@ ich se@@ lls more , that will be the win@@ ning san@@ d@@ w@@ ich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sa@@ d for the ocean that the H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger didn &apos;t w@@ in ."
So he made his ha@@ li@@ but san@@ d@@ w@@ ich .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tun@@ ately though , the san@@ d@@ w@@ ich came in at 30 c@@ ents ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ y wanted the san@@ d@@ w@@ ich to come in at 25 c@@ ents , so he turned to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic c@@ od ."
We all know what happened to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic c@@ od in New En@@ g@@ land .
"So now the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish san@@ d@@ w@@ ich is made out of Al@@ as@@ ka pol@@ lo@@ ck , it &apos;s the lar@@ gest f@@ in fish fi@@ sh@@ er@@ y in the United States , 2 to 3 billion p@@ oun@@ ds of fish taken out of the se@@ a every single year ."
"If we go through the pol@@ lo@@ ck , the next cho@@ ice is probably going to be t@@ il@@ ap@@ ia ."
T@@ il@@ ap@@ ia is one of those fish no@@ body ever heard of 20 years ago .
"It &apos;s actually a very ef@@ fici@@ ent con@@ ver@@ ter of plant prote@@ in into anima@@ l prote@@ in , and it &apos;s been a go@@ d@@ se@@ nd to the third world ."
"It &apos;s actually a tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly su@@ sta@@ in@@ able solution , it goes from an e@@ g@@ g to an ad@@ ult in nin@@ e months ."
"The problem is that when you look about the W@@ est , it doesn &apos;t do what the W@@ est wan@@ ts it to do ."
It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called an oi@@ ly fish pro@@ fi@@ le .
It doesn &apos;t have the E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s that we all think are going to make us live fore@@ ver .
So what do we do ?
"I mean , first of all , what about this po@@ or fish , the clu@@ pe@@ i@@ ds ?"
The fish that re@@ present a huge part of that 20 to 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons .
"Well , one possi@@ bility that a lot of con@@ serv@@ ation@@ ists have rai@@ sed is could we e@@ at them ?"
C@@ ou@@ ld we e@@ at them di@@ rec@@ tly instead of fe@@ e@@ ding them to s@@ al@@ mon ?
There are ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents for it .
"They are tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly fu@@ el ef@@ fici@@ ent to bring to market , a fr@@ action of the fu@@ el cost of say , sh@@ r@@ im@@ p , and at the very top of the car@@ bon ef@@ fici@@ en@@ cy scale ."
"They also are ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 r@@ ich , a great source for E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ."
So that is a poten@@ tial .
"And if we were to go down that rou@@ te what I would say is , instead of pa@@ ying a few bu@@ cks a p@@ ound — or a few bu@@ cks a ton , really — and making it into a@@ qu@@ a@@ fe@@ ed , could we hal@@ ve the c@@ at@@ ch and dou@@ ble the pr@@ ice for the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men and make that our way of tre@@ ating these particular fish ?"
"O@@ ther possi@@ bility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bi@@ val@@ ves , partic@@ ul@@ arly mus@@ sel@@ s ."
"Now , mus@@ sel@@ s are very high in E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A , they &apos;re sim@@ il@@ ar to can@@ ned tun@@ a ."
They &apos;re also extre@@ me@@ ly fu@@ el ef@@ fici@@ ent .
T@@ o bring a p@@ ound of mus@@ sel@@ s to market is about a th@@ ir@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the car@@ bon as requ@@ i@@ red to bring be@@ e@@ f to market .
"They requ@@ ire no for@@ age fish , they actually get their ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s by fil@@ ter@@ ing the water of micro@@ al@@ ga@@ e ."
"In fact , that &apos;s where ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish ."
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ al@@ ga@@ e make the ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , they &apos;re only bio@@ con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted in fish ."
Mus@@ sel@@ s and other bi@@ val@@ ves do tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s amoun@@ ts of water fil@@ tr@@ ation .
A single mus@@ se@@ l can fil@@ ter do@@ zen@@ s of g@@ all@@ ons every single day .
And this is incredi@@ bly important when we look at the world .
"@@ Right now , nit@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation , over@@ use of ph@@ os@@ p@@ ha@@ tes in our wa@@ ter@@ ways are ca@@ using tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s al@@ ga@@ l blo@@ om@@ s ."
"O@@ ver 4@@ 00 new de@@ ad z@@ ones have been created in the last 20 years , tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s sources of mar@@ ine life death ."
We also could look at not a fish at all .
We could look at a ve@@ ge@@ table .
"We could look at se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , the ke@@ l@@ ps , all these different vari@@ e@@ ties of things that can be high in ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , can be high in prote@@ ins , tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly good things ."
They fil@@ ter the water just like mus@@ sel@@ s do .
"And we@@ ir@@ dly enough , it turns out that you can actually fe@@ ed this to co@@ ws ."
"Now , I &apos;m not a big f@@ an of c@@ at@@ tle ."
"But if you wanted to keep gro@@ wing c@@ at@@ tle in a time and place where water re@@ sources are lim@@ ited , you &apos;re gro@@ wing se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — maj@@ or conside@@ r@@ ation ."
And the last fish is a question mar@@ k .
We have the ability to create a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ red fish that cre@@ ates a net ga@@ in of mar@@ ine prote@@ in for us .
"This cre@@ ature would have to be ve@@ ge@@ tari@@ an , it would have to be f@@ ast gro@@ wing , it would have to be ad@@ ap@@ table to a chan@@ ging climate and it would have to have that oi@@ ly fish pro@@ fi@@ le , that E@@ P@@ A , D@@ H@@ A , ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id pro@@ fi@@ le that we &apos;re looking for ."
This ex@@ ists kind of on pap@@ er .
I have been re@@ por@@ ting on these sub@@ jects for 15 years .
"E@@ very time I do a new story , somebody te@@ lls me , &quot; &quot; We can do all that . We can do it . We &apos;ve fig@@ u@@ red it all out ."
We can produ@@ ce a fish that &apos;s a net ga@@ in of mar@@ ine prote@@ in and has ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at .
It doesn &apos;t see@@ m to be getting sc@@ al@@ ed up .
It is time to scale this up .
"If we do , 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons of se@@ af@@ oo@@ d , a third of the world c@@ at@@ ch , sta@@ ys in the water ."
So I gu@@ ess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
We te@@ nd to go with our appe@@ t@@ it@@ es rather than our min@@ ds .
"But if we went with this , or some con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation of it , we might have a little more of this ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I essen@@ ti@@ ally became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvi@@ ous that the two he@@ mis@@ p@@ he@@ res are completely se@@ par@@ ate from one another ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ use me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a jo@@ y .
"I@@ n@@ formation , in the form of energy , stre@@ ams in sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously through all of our sen@@ sor@@ y systems and then it ex@@ plo@@ des into this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous col@@ la@@ ge of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment s@@ me@@ lls like and ta@@ ste@@ s like , what it feel@@ s like and what it soun@@ ds like ."
I am an ener@@ g@@ y-@@ being conne@@ cted to the energy all around me through the consci@@ ous@@ ness of my right he@@ mis@@ p@@ here .

O@@ ur left he@@ mis@@ p@@ here thin@@ ks lin@@ early and me@@ th@@ o@@ dic@@ ally .
And our left he@@ mis@@ p@@ here thin@@ ks in language .
And all I could de@@ te@@ ct was this energy — energy .

And I felt l@@ igh@@ ter in my body .
