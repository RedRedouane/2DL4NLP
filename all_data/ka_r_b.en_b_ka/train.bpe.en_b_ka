"We live in difficult and chall@@ eng@@ ing economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first vic@@ tim@@ s of difficult economic times , I think , is public sp@@ en@@ ding of any kind , but certain@@ ly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is public sp@@ en@@ ding for science , and particul@@ arly cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ led science and explo@@ ration ."
So I want to try and con@@ vin@@ ce you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous and l@@ ud@@ ic@@ ro@@ us thing to do .
"But I think to set the scen@@ e , I want to show — the next sl@@ ide is not my at@@ tem@@ pt to show the wor@@ st TE@@ D sl@@ ide in the history of TE@@ D , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my fa@@ ult ; it &apos;s from the G@@ uar@@ dian ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful demon@@ stra@@ tion of how much science co@@ st@@ s .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for contin@@ u@@ ing to sp@@ end on cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ driv@@ en science and explo@@ ration , I should tell you how much it co@@ st@@ s ."
So this is a ga@@ me called &quot; &quot; spo@@ t the science b@@ ud@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . government sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science b@@ ud@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of bl@@ obs and then y@@ el@@ low set of bl@@ obs ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ el@@ low set of bl@@ obs around the big y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion po@@ un@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from me@@ d@@ ical research , space explo@@ ration , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ eva , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and hum@@ an@@ ities , f@@ und@@ ed from the science b@@ ud@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b around the or@@ an@@ ge blo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arg@@ u@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cent@@ age , by the way , is about the same in the U.@@ S@@ . and G@@ er@@ many and F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"@@ R &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; D in tot@@ al in the econom@@ y , pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ly f@@ und@@ ed , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arg@@ u@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is stra@@ ight from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; is that our explo@@ ration of the sol@@ ar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ descri@@ b@@ ably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini space pro@@ be around S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , after we &apos;d fin@@ i@@ shed fil@@ m@@ ing &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the mo@@ on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So that big s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing , white sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , which is actually in the bac@@ k@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that c@@ res@@ cent there is the mo@@ on En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , which is about as big as the Brit@@ ish I@@ s@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 kilo@@ me@@ ters in di@@ ame@@ ter .
"So , tiny mo@@ on ."
What &apos;s fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ proc@@ ess@@ ed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , stra@@ ight from S@@ at@@ ur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fa@@ in@@ t , sort of , w@@ is@@ ps of almost smo@@ ke ris@@ ing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vis@@ ual@@ ize that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful graph@@ ic .
What we found out were that those fa@@ in@@ t w@@ is@@ ps are actually f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of ice ris@@ ing up from the sur@@ face of this tiny mo@@ on .
"That &apos;s fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the me@@ chan@@ ism for power@@ ing those f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins requ@@ ir@@ es there to be l@@ ak@@ es of li@@ qu@@ id water ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of this mo@@ on ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qu@@ id water , we find life ."
"So , to find st@@ rong evidence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of a mo@@ on 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away from the Earth is really quite as@@ t@@ oun@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essenti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a h@@ ab@@ it@@ at for life in the sol@@ ar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a graph@@ ic . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
This is when C@@ as@@ s@@ ini f@@ le@@ w ben@@ e@@ ath En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So it made a very low pas@@ s , just a few hundred kilo@@ me@@ ters ab@@ ove the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ris@@ ing up into space , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ da@@ te for life in the sol@@ ar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a mo@@ on of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the J@@ ov@@ ian system to get any sense that this mo@@ on , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of roc@@ k ."
It &apos;s actually an ice mo@@ on .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the mo@@ on Eu@@ rop@@ a , which is a th@@ ic@@ k she@@ et of ice , probably a hundred kilo@@ me@@ ters th@@ ic@@ k ."
"But by meas@@ uring the way that Eu@@ rop@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the mag@@ ne@@ tic field of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and looking at how those cra@@ c@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that graph@@ ic move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an oc@@ e@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"So bel@@ ow the ice , there &apos;s an oc@@ e@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id around the whole mo@@ on ."
"It could be hund@@ re@@ ds of kilo@@ me@@ ters de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s sal@@ tw@@ ater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that mo@@ on of J@@ up@@ it@@ er than there is in all the oc@@ e@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little mo@@ on around J@@ up@@ it@@ er , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ da@@ te for fin@@ ding life on a mo@@ on or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful discover@@ y .
O@@ ur explo@@ ration of the sol@@ ar system has t@@ au@@ ght us that the sol@@ ar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ wer@@ ing one of the most prof@@ ound questions that you can possi@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we al@@ one in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to explo@@ ration and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very f@@ amo@@ us picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas E@@ ve , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by A@@ pol@@ lo 8 as it went around the back of the mo@@ on .
E@@ ar@@ th@@ r@@ ise from A@@ pol@@ lo 8 .
"A f@@ amo@@ us picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sav@@ ed 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent year — the stud@@ ent ri@@ ots in P@@ aris , the he@@ ight of the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at TE@@ D , is that this picture , arg@@ u@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mov@@ able , kind of in@@ des@@ tr@@ uc@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , fra@@ g@@ il@@ e-@@ looking world just han@@ ging against the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not often said about the space explo@@ ration , about the A@@ pol@@ lo program , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make argum@@ ents that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achi@@ ev@@ ement and del@@ iver@@ ed pic@@ tures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , the economic im@@ p@@ act of A@@ pol@@ lo ."
The big@@ gest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by Ch@@ ase E@@ con@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics .
"And it sho@@ wed that for every $ 1 sp@@ ent on A@@ pol@@ lo , 1@@ 4 came back into the U.@@ S@@ . econom@@ y ."
"So the A@@ pol@@ lo program pa@@ id for itself in insp@@ i@@ ration , in engine@@ ering , achi@@ ev@@ ement and , I think , in insp@@ ir@@ ing young scient@@ ists and engine@@ ers 1@@ 4 times over ."
So explo@@ ration can pa@@ y for itself .
What about scientific discover@@ y ?
What about driv@@ ing in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vir@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tr@@ um of hy@@ d@@ rog@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scient@@ ists , many ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light given off from at@@ oms ."
And they saw stran@@ ge pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a pr@@ ism is that you he@@ at hy@@ d@@ rog@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a white light , it just em@@ its light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light bl@@ ue one , some dark bl@@ ue ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of at@@ omi@@ c structure because the way that &apos;s expla@@ ined is at@@ oms are a single n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with elec@@ t@@ rons going around them .
And the elec@@ t@@ rons can only be in particular places .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they em@@ it light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that at@@ oms , when you he@@ at them up , only em@@ it light at very spec@@ if@@ ic col@@ ors , was one of the k@@ ey driv@@ ers that led to the develop@@ ment of the quan@@ tum theory , the theory of the structure of at@@ oms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tr@@ um of the Su@@ n .
"And now , this is a picture of at@@ oms in the Su@@ n &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when elec@@ t@@ rons j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black lin@@ es in that spec@@ tr@@ um .
And the el@@ ement h@@ eli@@ um was discover@@ ed just by star@@ ing at the light from the Su@@ n because some of those black lin@@ es were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known el@@ ement .
And that &apos;s why h@@ eli@@ um &apos;s called h@@ eli@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; h@@ eli@@ os &quot; &quot; — h@@ eli@@ os from the Su@@ n .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic , and inde@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pur@@ su@@ it , but the quan@@ tum theory qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly led to an understanding of the behav@@ i@@ ors of elec@@ t@@ rons in mater@@ i@@ als like sil@@ ic@@ on , for example ."
"The way that sil@@ ic@@ on behav@@ es , the fact that you can build trans@@ ist@@ ors , is a pur@@ ely quan@@ tum ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
"So without that cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ driv@@ en understanding of the structure of at@@ oms , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic theory , quan@@ tum me@@ chan@@ ics , then we wouldn &apos;t have trans@@ ist@@ ors , we wouldn &apos;t have sil@@ ic@@ on ch@@ i@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the bas@@ is of our moder@@ n econom@@ y ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful tw@@ ist to that tal@@ e ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; we ke@@ pt em@@ ph@@ as@@ iz@@ ing the laws of physics are univer@@ sal ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredi@@ ble things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can trans@@ port it , not only to the plan@@ ets , but to the most dis@@ t@@ ant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing predic@@ tions of quan@@ tum me@@ chan@@ ics , just by looking at the structure of at@@ oms — the same theory that descri@@ b@@ es trans@@ ist@@ ors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are big@@ ger than , quite speci@@ fic@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mass of the Su@@ n ."
That &apos;s a li@@ mit im@@ posed on the mass of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of p@@ aper in a labo@@ rat@@ ory , get a tel@@ esc@@ ope , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars big@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mass of the Su@@ n ."
That &apos;s quite an incredi@@ ble predic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; &quot; our gar@@ den &quot; &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Su@@ n in it ."
It &apos;s just one of bil@@ lions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic cor@@ e , which is why it &apos;s shin@@ ing out so bri@@ gh@@ tly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s shin@@ ing as bri@@ gh@@ tly as the center of the galaxy with a billion sun@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a Ty@@ p@@ e I@@ a super@@ no@@ va explo@@ sion .
"Now that &apos;s an incredi@@ ble ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena , because it &apos;s a star that s@@ its there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It s@@ its there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the mass of the Su@@ n ."
"And it has a bin@@ ary compan@@ ion that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of ga@@ s ."
"And what it does is it suc@@ ks ga@@ s off its compan@@ ion star , until it gets to this li@@ mit called the Ch@@ and@@ ra@@ se@@ khar li@@ mit , and then it explo@@ des ."
"And it explo@@ des , and it shin@@ es as bri@@ gh@@ tly as a billion sun@@ s for about two weeks , and rel@@ eas@@ es , not only energy , but a huge amount of chem@@ ical el@@ em@@ ents into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe at the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g ."
And there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe throu@@ gh@@ out the first gener@@ ation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in explo@@ sions like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into plan@@ ets , stars , new sol@@ ar syst@@ ems and , inde@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able demon@@ stra@@ tion of the power and be@@ aut@@ y and univer@@ sal@@ ity of the laws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of at@@ oms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er F@@ l@@ em@@ ing : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I wo@@ ke up just after da@@ wn on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I certain@@ ly didn &apos;t pl@@ an to revolu@@ tion@@ ize all medic@@ ine by discover@@ ing the world &apos;s first an@@ ti@@ bi@@ ot@@ ic . &quot; &quot; Now , the ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not in@@ t@@ end to inv@@ ent the trans@@ ist@@ or ."
"And they certain@@ ly didn &apos;t in@@ t@@ end to descri@@ be the me@@ chan@@ ics of super@@ no@@ va explo@@ sions , which even@@ tually told us where the building bloc@@ ks of life were sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ ized in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing things .
"It can also , I think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most prof@@ ound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like S@@ at@@ ur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a f@@ amo@@ us picture , not because of the be@@ aut@@ y and maj@@ es@@ ty of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a tiny , fa@@ in@@ t blo@@ b just han@@ ging under@@ ne@@ ath one of the r@@ ings ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a mo@@ on , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tu@@ red in that fra@@ me of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away .
"I think the Earth has got a stran@@ ge pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dis@@ t@@ ant or most f@@ amo@@ us picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for sc@@ ale .
The V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s curr@@ ently 10 billion mil@@ es away from Earth , trans@@ mit@@ ting with that dis@@ h , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in cont@@ act with it ."
"But it vis@@ ited J@@ up@@ it@@ er , S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and N@@ ep@@ tun@@ e ."
"And after it vis@@ ited all four of those plan@@ ets , C@@ ar@@ l S@@ a@@ gan , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of turn@@ ing V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er around and taking a picture of every planet it had vis@@ ited ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ ale B@@ l@@ ue D@@ ot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in that red sh@@ af@@ t of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion mil@@ es away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ a@@ gan w@@ ro@@ te about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Con@@ sid@@ er again that dot ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was liv@@ ed out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ t@@ es of jo@@ y and suf@@ fer@@ ing thousands of con@@ f@@ id@@ ent relig@@ ions , ide@@ ologi@@ es and economic doc@@ tr@@ ines , every h@@ un@@ ter and fo@@ ra@@ ger , every her@@ o and co@@ ward , every cre@@ at@@ or and des@@ tro@@ y@@ er of civiliz@@ ation , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul child , inv@@ ent@@ or and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er , every teacher of moral@@ s , every cor@@ ru@@ pt polit@@ ician , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me lead@@ er , every sa@@ in@@ t and sin@@ ner in the history of our spec@@ ies , liv@@ ed there , on a mo@@ te of d@@ ust , s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in a sun@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that astro@@ no@@ my &apos;s a hum@@ bl@@ ing and charac@@ ter@@ -@@ building experience .
There is perhaps no better demon@@ stra@@ tion of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ ce@@ its than this dis@@ t@@ ant imag@@ e of our tiny world .
"@@ To me , it under@@ sc@@ or@@ es our respon@@ si@@ bility to de@@ al more kin@@ d@@ ly with one another and to pres@@ er@@ ve and cher@@ ish the p@@ ale bl@@ ue dot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ auti@@ ful words about the power of science and explo@@ ration ."
"The argum@@ ent has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the trans@@ ist@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ ur@@ ely , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disc@@ over anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly becom@@ ing a her@@ o of mine , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under as@@ sa@@ ult all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ Just explo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the progress of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
You might hear it like secon@@ d@@ -@@ hand smo@@ ke at the air@@ port ...
"And it does , doesn &apos;t it ?"
I was cl@@ app@@ ing . They were cl@@ app@@ ing .
"Th@@ ank you , th@@ ank you ."
"We &apos;re going to share a lot of sec@@ re@@ ts today , you and I , and in doing so , I hope that we can li@@ ft some of the sh@@ ame many of us feel about sex ."
How many here have ever been cat@@ called by a stran@@ ger ?
L@@ ots of women .
"For me , the time I remember best is when that stran@@ ger was a stud@@ ent of mine ."
"He came up to me after class that night and his words con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed what I already knew : &quot; &quot; I am so sor@@ ry , prof@@ ess@@ or ."
"If I had known it was you , I would never have said those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I wasn &apos;t a person to him until I was his prof@@ ess@@ or ."
"This con@@ cept , called ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation , is the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion of s@@ ex@@ ism , and we see it re@@ in@@ for@@ ced through every as@@ p@@ ect of our lives ."
We see it in the government that re@@ f@@ uses to p@@ un@@ ish men for ra@@ ping women .
We see it in adv@@ ert@@ is@@ em@@ ents .
How many of you have seen an adv@@ ert@@ is@@ ement that uses a woman &apos;s bre@@ ast to s@@ ell an enti@@ rel@@ y un@@ rel@@ ated produc@@ t ?
O@@ r movi@@ e after movi@@ e after movi@@ e that port@@ ra@@ ys women as only love interes@@ ts ?
M@@ ed@@ ia pla@@ ys a large ro@@ le in per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ating the ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation of women .
Let &apos;s consid@@ er the clas@@ si@@ c rom@@ an@@ tic co@@ me@@ d@@ y .
"We &apos;re t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to two kinds of women in these movi@@ es , two kinds of des@@ i@@ ra@@ ble women , any@@ way ."
The first is the s@@ ex@@ y bomb@@ sh@@ ell .
This is the un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous woman with the per@@ fect body .
The first is the sl@@ ut .
She is to be con@@ sum@@ ed and for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
She is much too av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
Mar@@ ri@@ age material .
"We &apos;re actually told that women have two ro@@ les , but these two ro@@ les have a difficult time ex@@ is@@ ting within the same woman ."
"O@@ n the r@@ are oc@@ cas@@ ion that I share with a new ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ce that I study sex , if they don &apos;t end the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion right then , they &apos;re us@@ u@@ ally pretty in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed ."
&quot; O@@ h . T@@ ell me more . &quot;
So I do .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; O@@ h . H@@ u@@ h .
Do pre@@ gn@@ ant people even have sex ?
"I asked this question in a surv@@ ey of over 5@@ 00 ad@@ ults , and most respon@@ ded with &quot; &quot; bel@@ ly &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; ro@@ und &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; c@@ ute . &quot; &quot; This didn &apos;t sur@@ pr@@ ise me too much ."
What else do we lab@@ el as c@@ ute ?
B@@ ab@@ ies . P@@ up@@ pi@@ es . K@@ it@@ ten@@ s .
The el@@ der@@ ly . R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en we lab@@ el an ad@@ ult as c@@ ute , though , we take away a lot of their intelligence , their compl@@ ex@@ ity ."
We reduc@@ e them to chil@@ d@@ like qu@@ alit@@ ies .
M@@ o@@ st of the respon@@ ses were ne@@ ga@@ tive .
&quot; G@@ ross . &quot;
&quot; A@@ w@@ k@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; Not s@@ ex@@ y . &quot; &quot; O@@ d@@ d . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ com@@ for@@ table . &quot;
&quot; How ? &quot;
That last one really st@@ uc@@ k with me .
"We might think that because we div@@ or@@ ce pre@@ gn@@ ant women and mo@@ ms from s@@ ex@@ ual@@ ity , we are re@@ mov@@ ing the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of s@@ ex@@ ual ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation ."
Not exactly .
What happens instead is a different kind of ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation .
"In my ef@@ for@@ ts to explain this to others , one con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion led to the V@@ en@@ us of W@@ ill@@ end@@ or@@ f , a P@@ al@@ e@@ oli@@ th@@ ic fig@@ ur@@ ine s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars as@@ sum@@ ed was a g@@ od@@ d@@ ess of love and be@@ aut@@ y , h@@ ence the name V@@ en@@ us ."
They also as@@ sum@@ ed that she was me@@ ant to be hel@@ d or plac@@ ed l@@ ying down because her tiny fe@@ et don &apos;t al@@ low her to be fre@@ es@@ tan@@ ding .
She also had no face .
"For this reason , it was as@@ sum@@ ed that she was a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of f@@ ert@@ il@@ ity and not a port@@ ra@@ it of a person ."
She was an object .
"In the history of her inter@@ pret@@ ation , she went from object of ide@@ al be@@ aut@@ y and love to object of re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"When a woman becom@@ es pre@@ gn@@ ant , she le@@ aves the real@@ m of men &apos;s s@@ ex@@ ual des@@ ire and sl@@ ides into her re@@ produc@@ tive and chil@@ d@@ -@@ re@@ aring ro@@ le ."
"I &apos;ve taken to call@@ ing this the W@@ ill@@ end@@ or@@ f ef@@ fect , and once again we see it re@@ in@@ for@@ ced in many as@@ pec@@ ts of her life ."
H@@ as any@@ one here ever been vis@@ ib@@ ly pre@@ gn@@ ant ?
O@@ r asked p@@ riv@@ ate questions about your bir@@ th pl@@ an ?
And then told why those cho@@ ices are all wrong ?
"Y@@ eah , me too ."
O@@ r had a ser@@ ver re@@ f@@ use to bring you a gl@@ as@@ s of w@@ ine ?
"This one might give you p@@ ause , I know , but st@@ ay with me ."
This is a huge sec@@ ret .
It is actually sa@@ fe to dr@@ ink in moder@@ ation d@@ uring pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy .
M@@ any of us don &apos;t know this because doc@@ tors don &apos;t tr@@ ust pre@@ gn@@ ant women with this sec@@ ret — ( Laughter ) es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally if she &apos;s less educ@@ ated or a woman of c@@ olo@@ r .
"What this tel@@ ls us is , this W@@ ill@@ end@@ or@@ f ef@@ fect , it &apos;s also clas@@ s@@ ist and ra@@ c@@ ist ."
Wh@@ en we tell women that s@@ ex@@ ual pl@@ eas@@ ure — exc@@ use me .
"When we tell women that sex isn &apos;t wor@@ th the ris@@ k d@@ uring pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy , what we &apos;re telling her is that her s@@ ex@@ ual pl@@ eas@@ ure doesn &apos;t matter ."
"So what we are telling her is that she in fact doesn &apos;t matter , even though the needs of her f@@ et@@ us are not at od@@ ds with her own needs ."
"So me@@ d@@ ical pro@@ vid@@ ers , such as the American C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge of O@@ b@@ st@@ et@@ r@@ ici@@ ans and G@@ y@@ nec@@ olog@@ ists have the opportun@@ ity to educ@@ ate about the saf@@ ety of sex d@@ uring pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy ."
"( Applause ) P@@ re@@ gn@@ ant women are not fac@@ el@@ ess , id@@ ent@@ it@@ y-@@ less v@@ ess@@ els of re@@ produc@@ tion who can &apos;t st@@ and on their own two fe@@ et ."
"But the tr@@ uth is , the real sec@@ ret is , we tell all women that their s@@ ex@@ ual pl@@ eas@@ ure doesn &apos;t matter ."
She is revolu@@ tion@@ ary .
"That is a woman who in@@ s@@ ists that you make room for her at the table of power , and that is the most ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying of all because we can &apos;t make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold ."
I am the mother of two bo@@ ys and we could use your help .
"E@@ ven though my bo@@ ys hear me say re@@ gul@@ arly that it &apos;s important for men to reco@@ gni@@ ze women as equ@@ als and they see their father mod@@ el@@ ing this , we need what happens in the world to re@@ in@@ force what happens in our home ."
This is not a men &apos;s problem or a women &apos;s problem .
"This is everyone &apos;s problem , and we all play a ro@@ le in dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling syst@@ ems of in@@ equality ."
"If you don &apos;t know her , don &apos;t even ask to tou@@ ch her bel@@ ly ."
You wouldn &apos;t any@@ body else .
D@@ on &apos;t tell her what she can and cannot e@@ at .
"If you &apos;re somebody who has sex with women , pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize her pl@@ eas@@ ure ."
"If you have children — ( Laughter ) have con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions about sex as early as possible , because kids don &apos;t look up s@@ -@@ e-@@ x in the dic@@ tion@@ ary any@@ more ."
They look it up on the inter@@ n@@ et .
A@@ d@@ mit it .
"And re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether you have children or not , sup@@ port com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive sex education that doesn &apos;t sh@@ ame our te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."

To@@ day I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the me@@ th@@ od works .
You are ready ?
O@@ p@@ en your mo@@ uth as w@@ ide as possible until it &apos;s s@@ qu@@ are .
You get a mo@@ uth .
This is a person going for a wal@@ k .

This is a t@@ ree .
T@@ ree .
This is a mo@@ un@@ tain .
The su@@ n .
The mo@@ on .
The sym@@ bo@@ l of the do@@ or looks like a pa@@ ir of sa@@ lo@@ on do@@ ors in the w@@ il@@ d w@@ est .
I call these eight charac@@ ters rad@@ ic@@ als .
They are the building bloc@@ ks for you to create lots more charac@@ ters .
A person .
"If someone wal@@ ks be@@ h@@ ind , that is &quot; &quot; to fol@@ low . &quot; &quot; A@@ s the old saying goes , two is compan@@ y , three is a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
"If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their ar@@ ms w@@ ide , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the mo@@ uth , the person is tra@@ pped ."
"He &apos;s a pris@@ on@@ er , just like J@@ on@@ ah inside the wh@@ ale ."
"One t@@ ree is a t@@ ree . T@@ w@@ o tre@@ es together , we have the wo@@ ods ."
"Th@@ ree tre@@ es together , we create the for@@ est ."

R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber fir@@ e ?
"@@ T@@ w@@ o fir@@ es together , I get really h@@ ot ."
"Th@@ ree fir@@ es together , that &apos;s a lot of fl@@ am@@ es ."
"S@@ et the fir@@ e under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es , it &apos;s b@@ urn@@ ing ."
"For us , the su@@ n is the s@@ our@@ ce of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity ."

"Th@@ ree together , that &apos;s s@@ par@@ kl@@ es ."
"P@@ ut the su@@ n and the mo@@ on shin@@ ing together , it &apos;s bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
"It also means to@@ mor@@ row , after a day and a night ."
The su@@ n is coming up ab@@ ove the hor@@ iz@@ on . S@@ un@@ r@@ ise .
"A do@@ or . P@@ ut a plan@@ k inside the do@@ or , it &apos;s a do@@ or b@@ ol@@ t ."
"P@@ ut a mo@@ uth inside the do@@ or , as@@ king questions ."

"@@ T@@ w@@ o women together , they have an argum@@ ent ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ree women together , be care@@ ful , it &apos;s ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ y ."
So we have gone through almost 30 charac@@ ters .
"B@@ y using this me@@ th@@ od , the first eight rad@@ ic@@ als will al@@ low you to build 3@@ 2 ."
The next group of eight charac@@ ters will build an extra 3@@ 2 .
"So with very little ef@@ for@@ t , you will be able to learn a couple hundred charac@@ ters , which is the same as a Ch@@ in@@ ese e@@ igh@@ t-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old ."
"So after we know the charac@@ ters , we start building ph@@ ra@@ ses ."
"For example , the mo@@ un@@ tain and the fir@@ e together , we have fir@@ e mo@@ un@@ tain . It &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o ."
We know Jap@@ an is the land of the ris@@ ing su@@ n .
"This is a su@@ n plac@@ ed with the or@@ ig@@ in , because Jap@@ an li@@ es to the e@@ ast of China ."
"So a su@@ n , or@@ ig@@ in together , we build Jap@@ an ."
"A person be@@ h@@ ind Jap@@ an , what do we get ?"
A Jap@@ an@@ ese person .
The charac@@ ter on the left is two mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins st@@ ac@@ ked on top of each other .
"In an@@ ci@@ ent China , that means in ex@@ ile , because Ch@@ in@@ ese em@@ per@@ ors , they put their political en@@ e@@ mi@@ es in ex@@ ile be@@ y@@ ond mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys , ex@@ ile has turned into getting out ."

We had no idea what was ca@@ using this disease .
And it was a high@@ ly rom@@ an@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed disease .
And some people actually thought it gave you he@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed sen@@ sit@@ iv@@ ity and con@@ fer@@ red cre@@ ative gen@@ i@@ us .
"They were more social , more ener@@ ge@@ tic ."
"So acc@@ id@@ ental discover@@ y is not un@@ common in science , but it requ@@ ir@@ es more than just a happy acc@@ id@@ ent ."
You have to be able to reco@@ gni@@ ze it for discover@@ y to oc@@ c@@ ur .
"Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , since the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , we &apos;ve develop@@ ed some other dru@@ gs and we can actually now c@@ ure t@@ ub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is ."
"And at le@@ ast in the United States , though not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily in other countries , we have clo@@ sed our san@@ it@@ ori@@ um@@ s and probably most of you are not too wor@@ ri@@ ed about T@@ B ."
"We are in the middle of an ep@@ ide@@ mic of mo@@ od dis@@ or@@ d@@ ers like depres@@ sion and pos@@ t-@@ tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic stress dis@@ order , or P@@ T@@ S@@ D ."
"And also , like t@@ ub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , we don &apos;t know what ca@@ uses it ."
And this sort of re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing is actually quite chall@@ eng@@ ing .
"When doc@@ tors first saw this mo@@ od@@ -@@ en@@ han@@ cing ef@@ fect of i@@ pro@@ ni@@ az@@ id , they didn &apos;t really reco@@ gni@@ ze what they saw ."
"So they re@@ com@@ men@@ ded that i@@ pro@@ ni@@ az@@ id only be used in cas@@ es of extre@@ me T@@ B and in patients that were high@@ ly emo@@ tion@@ ally st@@ able , which is of course the ex@@ act op@@ pos@@ ite of how we use it as an an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"They were so used to looking at it from the per@@ spec@@ tive of this one disease , they could not see the larg@@ er im@@ plic@@ ations for another disease ."
"And to be fa@@ ir , it &apos;s not enti@@ rel@@ y their fa@@ ult ."
F@@ un@@ c@@ tional fi@@ x@@ ed@@ ness is a bi@@ as that af@@ fec@@ ts all of us .
But it does make you won@@ der what else we &apos;ve mis@@ sed .
"That incl@@ ud@@ es li@@ ver to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity , we@@ ight ga@@ in of over 50 po@@ un@@ ds , su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality ."
"And that was 30 years ago , and since then we have mo@@ st@@ ly just worked on op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ing those dru@@ gs ."
"And in science , we try and re@@ move our bi@@ as , right , by run@@ ning d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ bl@@ ind@@ ed experim@@ ents or being stat@@ is@@ tically ag@@ no@@ s@@ tic as to what our results will be ."
But bi@@ as cre@@ e@@ ps in more in@@ sid@@ i@@ ously in what we cho@@ ose to study and how we cho@@ ose to study it .
"So we &apos;ve foc@@ used on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in now for the past 30 years , often to the ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ion of other things ."
"We still have no c@@ ures , and what if ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in isn &apos;t all there is to depres@@ sion ?"
What if it &apos;s not even the k@@ ey part of it ?
"It works on gl@@ ut@@ a@@ mate , which is another neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter ."
And it &apos;s also re@@ pur@@ posed .
It was t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ ally used as an@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia in sur@@ ger@@ y .
There was no man@@ ia to sign@@ al its effec@@ ts .
So we could have st@@ op@@ ped there .
And it looked kind of like this .
"So if you look at the far left , if you put a mo@@ use in a new space , this is the bo@@ x , it &apos;s very exc@@ iting , a mo@@ use will wal@@ k around and ex@@ pl@@ ore , and you can see that p@@ ink line is actually the measure of them wal@@ king ."
And we also give it another mo@@ use in a pen@@ ci@@ l c@@ up that it can dec@@ ide to inter@@ act with .
It will be social .
"Y@@ et the m@@ ice that had g@@ ot@@ ten that one in@@ jec@@ tion of C@@ al@@ yp@@ so@@ l , here on your right , they were ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing , they were social ."
"They looked like they had never been st@@ res@@ sed at all , which is im@@ possible ."
"And I remember us y@@ el@@ ling , which you &apos;re not sup@@ posed to do in an an@@ ima@@ l room where you &apos;re tes@@ ting , because it had worked ."
"It se@@ em@@ ed like these m@@ ice were pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ted against stress , or they were in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ately happy , ho@@ w@@ ever you want to call it ."
And we were really exc@@ ited .
So we ra@@ n it again .
"And every time someone ra@@ n it , they con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed the same thing ."
It se@@ em@@ ed like this one in@@ jec@@ tion of C@@ al@@ yp@@ so@@ l was some@@ how pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ting against stress for weeks .
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this pas@@ sive pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y .
It &apos;s the ab@@ s@@ ence of s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility fac@@ tors and ris@@ k fac@@ tors for these dis@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
But what if it were ac@@ tive ?
"M@@ a@@ ybe we could en@@ h@@ ance it , sort of ak@@ in to put@@ ting on ar@@ mo@@ r ."
We had acc@@ id@@ ent@@ ally discover@@ ed the first res@@ il@@ i@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ en@@ han@@ cing dru@@ g .
"And like I said , we only gave a tiny amount of the dru@@ g , and it las@@ ted for weeks , and that &apos;s not like anything you see with an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts ."
But it is actually kind of si@@ mil@@ ar to what you see in im@@ mun@@ e v@@ acc@@ ines .
"So in im@@ mun@@ e v@@ acc@@ ines , you &apos;ll get your sh@@ ots , and then weeks , months , years later , when you &apos;re actually ex@@ posed to bac@@ ter@@ ia , it &apos;s not the v@@ acc@@ ine in your body that pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ts you ."
"O@@ r si@@ mil@@ ar to as I said before , with this p@@ al@@ li@@ ative , you &apos;ll take something that will sup@@ pres@@ s the sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms , but it won &apos;t treat the under@@ l@@ ying in@@ fec@@ tion , and you &apos;ll only feel better d@@ uring the time in which you &apos;re taking it , which is why you have to keep taking it ."
And in depres@@ sion and P@@ T@@ S@@ D — here we have your stress ex@@ pos@@ ure — we only have p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care .
"A@@ n@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts only sup@@ pres@@ s sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the l@@ eng@@ th of your own life ."
"So that &apos;s first respon@@ d@@ ers and fi@@ re@@ f@@ igh@@ ters , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , pris@@ on@@ ers and pris@@ on gu@@ ar@@ ds , sol@@ di@@ ers , you name it ."
"And to give you a sense of the sc@@ ale of these dis@@ eas@@ es , in 20@@ 10 , the global bur@@ den of disease was es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed at 2@@ .@@ 5 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars , and since they are ch@@ ron@@ ic , that cost is com@@ po@@ und@@ ing and is ther@@ e@@ fore expec@@ ted to r@@ ise up to six tr@@ il@@ lion dollars in just the next 15 years ."
It &apos;s used in children . We use it on the b@@ att@@ le@@ field .
"If we had discover@@ ed ket@@ am@@ ine as a par@@ av@@ acc@@ ine first , it &apos;d be pretty easy for us to devel@@ op it , but as is , we have to comp@@ et@@ e with our func@@ tional fi@@ x@@ ed@@ ness and mental set that kind of inter@@ f@@ ere ."
And that will be years .
We could devel@@ op it for a fra@@ c@@ tion of the pr@@ ice and a fra@@ c@@ tion of the time .
"But actually , be@@ y@@ ond func@@ tional fi@@ x@@ ed@@ ness and mental set , there &apos;s a real other challenge to re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing dru@@ gs , which is pol@@ ic@@ y ."
"R@@ e@@ gar@@ d@@ less , the idea itself is completely no@@ vel in psych@@ i@@ at@@ ry , to use dru@@ gs to pre@@ v@@ ent mental ill@@ ness as op@@ posed to just treat it ."
"It is possible that 20 , 50 , 100 years from now , we will look back now at depres@@ sion and P@@ T@@ S@@ D the way we look back at t@@ ub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is san@@ it@@ ori@@ um@@ s as a thing of the past ."
This could be the beginning of the end of the mental health ep@@ ide@@ mic .
"But as a great scient@@ ist once said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ly a fo@@ ol is sure of anything ."
"A w@@ ise man ke@@ e@@ ps on gu@@ ess@@ ing . &quot; &quot; Thank you , gu@@ ys ."

"It goes without saying that it &apos;s really difficult for me to be here today , but my bro@@ ther D@@ eah , his wi@@ fe Y@@ us@@ or , and her sis@@ ter R@@ az@@ an don &apos;t give me much of a cho@@ ice ."
"I &apos;m h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul that by the end of this talk you will make a cho@@ ice , and jo@@ in me in st@@ anding up against h@@ ate ."
"It &apos;s D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 7 , 20@@ 1@@ 4 : the mor@@ ning of my bro@@ ther &apos;s w@@ ed@@ ding day ."

And she is .
"A@@ t just 2@@ 1 , she &apos;d rec@@ ently been ac@@ cep@@ ted to jo@@ in D@@ eah at U@@ N@@ C den@@ t@@ al school ."

"M@@ y lit@@ t@@ l@@ er bro@@ ther , a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ -@@ ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed k@@ id , had become and trans@@ form@@ ed into an ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed young man ."

"The man who m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed my bro@@ ther turned h@@ im@@ self in to the pol@@ ice shor@@ tly after the m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers , saying he k@@ il@@ led three kids , ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le , over a par@@ king dis@@ p@@ ute ."
"The pol@@ ice issu@@ ed a pre@@ mat@@ ure public stat@@ ement that mor@@ ning , e@@ cho@@ ing his cl@@ a@@ im@@ s without bo@@ ther@@ ing to question it or fur@@ ther inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ te ."
It turns out there was no par@@ king dis@@ p@@ ute .
There was no argum@@ ent .
No viol@@ ation .
"I s@@ it on my bro@@ ther &apos;s bed and remember his words , the words he gave me so fre@@ ely and with so much love , &quot; I am who I am because of you . &quot;"
That &apos;s what it takes for me to c@@ lim@@ b through my cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing g@@ ri@@ ef and spe@@ ak out .
I cannot let my family &apos;s de@@ a@@ ths be di@@ min@@ i@@ shed to a se@@ g@@ ment that is bar@@ ely disc@@ us@@ sed on loc@@ al news .
"They were m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed by their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or because of their fa@@ ith , because of a piece of cl@@ ot@@ h they ch@@ ose to don on their head@@ s , because they were vis@@ ib@@ ly M@@ us@@ li@@ m ."
A ter@@ ro@@ r@@ ist att@@ ack .
"When white men com@@ mit ac@@ ts of violence in the U@@ S , they &apos;re l@@ one w@@ ol@@ ves , m@@ ent@@ ally ill or driv@@ en by a par@@ king dis@@ p@@ ute ."
"I know that I have to give my family vo@@ ice , and I do the only thing I know how : I sen@@ d a F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok mes@@ sa@@ ge to everyone I know in me@@ dia ."
"A couple of hours later , in the mid@@ st of a cha@@ ot@@ ic h@@ ou@@ se over@@ f@@ lowing with friends and family , our ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or N@@ e@@ al comes over , s@@ its down next to my parents and as@@ ks , &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; N@@ e@@ al had over two dec@@ ades of experience in j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ism , but he makes it c@@ lear that he &apos;s not there in his cap@@ ac@@ ity as j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist , but as a ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or who wan@@ ts to help ."
E@@ ven now I don &apos;t have the words to th@@ ank him .
"&quot; &quot; Just tell me when , and I &apos;ll have all the news chan@@ nel@@ s present , &quot; &quot; he said ."
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves in a moment of dev@@ as@@ t@@ ation .
"I del@@ iver@@ ed the pres@@ s stat@@ ement , still we@@ aring sc@@ r@@ ub@@ s from the pre@@ vi@@ ous night ."
"The fol@@ lowing day , maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers — incl@@ ud@@ ing the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es , Ch@@ ic@@ ago Tri@@ bun@@ e — published stories about D@@ eah , Y@@ us@@ or and R@@ az@@ an , al@@ lowing us to re@@ cl@@ a@@ im the nar@@ ra@@ tive and call at@@ ten@@ tion the main@@ stre@@ am@@ ing of an@@ ti@@ -@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ m h@@ at@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese days , it fe@@ els like I@@ sl@@ amo@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia is a soci@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ table form of big@@ ot@@ ry ."
We just have to put up with it and s@@ mil@@ e .
"The n@@ as@@ ty star@@ es , the p@@ al@@ p@@ able fear when bo@@ ar@@ ding a plan@@ e , the ran@@ dom p@@ at do@@ w@@ n@@ s at air@@ por@@ ts that happen 9@@ 9 percent of the time ."
It doesn &apos;t stop there .
We have polit@@ ici@@ ans re@@ ap@@ ing political and fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al ga@@ ins off our bac@@ ks .
"@@ Just a couple months ago , K@@ hal@@ id J@@ ab@@ ara , a L@@ eb@@ an@@ es@@ e-@@ American Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an , was m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in O@@ kl@@ a@@ h@@ om@@ a by his ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or — a man who called him a &quot; &quot; fil@@ thy A@@ ra@@ b . &quot; &quot; This man was pre@@ vi@@ ously j@@ a@@ il@@ ed for a mere 8 months , after at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting run over K@@ hal@@ id &apos;s mother with his c@@ ar ."
"@@ Ch@@ an@@ ces are you hav@@ en &apos;t heard K@@ hal@@ id &apos;s story , because it didn &apos;t make it to national news ."
The le@@ ast we can do is call it what it is : a h@@ ate cri@@ me .
I was di@@ she@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed .
H@@ um@@ il@@ i@@ ated .
"D@@ a@@ ys later ro@@ und@@ ing on the same pati@@ ent , she looks at me and says , &quot; Y@@ our people are k@@ il@@ ling people in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es . &quot;"
I look around expec@@ tan@@ tly .
A@@ ga@@ in : sil@@ ence .
"I s@@ it on her bed and gen@@ tly ask her , &quot; &quot; H@@ ave I ever done anything but treat you with res@@ p@@ ect and kin@@ d@@ ness ?"
"O@@ d@@ ds are you may have experien@@ ced it , whether for your ra@@ ce , gen@@ der , s@@ ex@@ ual@@ ity or relig@@ ious beli@@ ef@@ s ."
We &apos;ve all been in sit@@ u@@ ations where we &apos;ve w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something wrong and didn &apos;t spe@@ ak up .

Ma@@ ybe we wer@@ en &apos;t even aw@@ are of our own im@@ pl@@ icit bi@@ as@@ es .
"We can all ag@@ ree that big@@ ot@@ ry is un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table , but when we see it , we &apos;re sil@@ ent , because it makes us un@@ com@@ for@@ table ."
But ste@@ p@@ ping right into that dis@@ com@@ for@@ t means you are also ste@@ p@@ ping into the ally z@@ one .
There may be over three million M@@ us@@ li@@ ms in America .

"A@@ l@@ so in the B@@ ible , one se@@ es that the death pen@@ al@@ ty was the ac@@ cep@@ ted p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment for cri@@ m@@ es such as ho@@ mos@@ ex@@ ual@@ ity , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ y , bl@@ as@@ ph@@ em@@ y , id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry , talking back to your parents — ( Laughter ) — and pic@@ king up s@@ tic@@ ks on the S@@ ab@@ b@@ ath ."
"Well , let &apos;s cl@@ ic@@ k the zo@@ om l@@ ens down one order of mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de , and look at the century sc@@ ale ."
"A@@ l@@ though we don &apos;t have stat@@ is@@ tics for war@@ f@@ are throu@@ gh@@ out the M@@ id@@ dle A@@ g@@ es to moder@@ n times , we know just from con@@ ven@@ tional history — the evidence was under our no@@ se all along that there has been a reduc@@ tion in soci@@ ally san@@ c@@ tion@@ ed for@@ ms of violence ."
"For example , any social history will re@@ ve@@ al that m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation and t@@ or@@ ture were ro@@ ut@@ ine for@@ ms of cri@@ min@@ al p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment . The kind of in@@ fra@@ c@@ tion today that would give you a fin@@ e , in those days would res@@ ult in your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e being c@@ ut out , your e@@ ars being c@@ ut off , you being bl@@ ind@@ ed , a hand being ch@@ op@@ ped off and so on ."
"There were num@@ er@@ ous in@@ gen@@ ious for@@ ms of sa@@ dis@@ tic cap@@ ital p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment : b@@ urn@@ ing at the st@@ ake , dis@@ em@@ bo@@ wel@@ ing , bre@@ ak@@ ing on the whe@@ el , being pul@@ led ap@@ art by hor@@ ses and so on ."
"What about on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one m@@ ur@@ der ? Well , there , there are good stat@@ is@@ tics , because many mun@@ ici@@ p@@ alit@@ ies rec@@ or@@ ded the cause of death ."
"The cri@@ min@@ olog@@ ist M@@ an@@ u@@ el E@@ is@@ ner s@@ cou@@ red all of the hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ or@@ ds across Eu@@ rop@@ e for h@@ om@@ ic@@ ide rat@@ es in any village , h@@ am@@ let , to@@ wn , coun@@ ty that he could find , and he sup@@ pl@@ em@@ ented them with national data , when na@@ tions started ke@@ ep@@ ing stat@@ is@@ tics ."
Let &apos;s cl@@ ic@@ k down now to the dec@@ ade sc@@ ale .
"And , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 6@@ 5@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths per con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t per year in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s to less than 2@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths per con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t per year in this dec@@ ade , as hor@@ ri@@ fic as it is ."
"E@@ ven in the year sc@@ ale , one can see a de@@ cl@@ ine of violence ."
"S@@ in@@ ce the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , there have been fe@@ wer civ@@ il w@@ ars , fe@@ wer gen@@ oc@@ ides — inde@@ ed , a 90 percent reduc@@ tion since pos@@ t-@@ W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I high@@ s — and even a re@@ ver@@ sal of the 19@@ 6@@ 0s up@@ tic@@ k in h@@ om@@ ic@@ ide and viol@@ ent cri@@ me ."
"This is from the F@@ B@@ I U@@ ni@@ form C@@ ri@@ me St@@ at@@ is@@ tics .

"P@@ res@@ id@@ ent C@@ lin@@ ton , if you &apos;re here , th@@ ank you ."
One of them is we have better re@@ port@@ ing . The A@@ s@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress is a better ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ l@@ er of w@@ ars over the sur@@ face of the Earth than si@@ x@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ century mon@@ ks were .
"There &apos;s a co@@ gn@@ itive ill@@ us@@ ion . We co@@ gn@@ itive psych@@ olog@@ ists know that the eas@@ ier it is to rec@@ all spec@@ if@@ ic in@@ stan@@ ces of something , the high@@ er the prob@@ ability that you as@@ si@@ g@@ n to it ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe I had better sho@@ ot him , before he sho@@ ots me , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to k@@ ill me , he &apos;s probably wor@@ r@@ ying right now that I might k@@ ill him before he k@@ il@@ ls me . &quot; &quot; And so on ."
"Now , one way of de@@ al@@ ing with this problem is by de@@ ter@@ r@@ ence ."
"You don &apos;t st@@ ri@@ ke first , but you have a pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ly an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced pol@@ ic@@ y that you will re@@ tal@@ i@@ ate sav@@ ag@@ ely if you are inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ fe becom@@ es an ep@@ is@@ od@@ e of &quot; &quot; The S@@ op@@ ran@@ os . &quot; &quot; H@@ ob@@ b@@ es &apos; solu@@ tion , the &quot; &quot; L@@ ev@@ ia@@ than , &quot; &quot; was that if au@@ th@@ or@@ ity for the le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ mate use of violence was v@@ es@@ ted in a single democra@@ tic ag@@ en@@ cy — a lev@@ ia@@ than — then such a state can reduc@@ e the tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation of att@@ ack , because any kind of ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion will be p@@ un@@ i@@ shed , le@@ av@@ ing its prof@@ it@@ ability as z@@ ero . That would re@@ move the tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation to inv@@ ade pre@@ emp@@ ti@@ vely , out of fear of them att@@ ac@@ king you first ."
So that &apos;s a bit of a sup@@ port for the lev@@ ia@@ than theory .
"A@@ l@@ so sup@@ port@@ ing it is the fact that we today see er@@ up@@ tions of violence in z@@ ones of an@@ arch@@ y , in fa@@ il@@ ed st@@ ates , coll@@ ap@@ sed em@@ pir@@ es , fron@@ ti@@ er regi@@ ons , ma@@ fi@@ as , stre@@ et gan@@ gs and so on ."
"The second ex@@ plan@@ ation is that in many times and places , there is a w@@ id@@ es@@ pre@@ ad senti@@ ment that life is che@@ a@@ p ."
"In ear@@ li@@ er times , when suf@@ fer@@ ing and early death were common in one &apos;s own life , one has fe@@ wer comp@@ un@@ c@@ tions about in@@ fl@@ ic@@ ting them on others . And as technology and economic ef@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy make life longer and more pl@@ eas@@ ant , one put@@ s a high@@ er value on life in gener@@ al ."
This was an argum@@ ent from the political scient@@ ist J@@ am@@ es P@@ ay@@ ne .
"And there are a number of possi@@ bil@@ ities , such as increas@@ ing cir@@ cl@@ es of re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ity in the sense that R@@ ob@@ ert W@@ right arg@@ ues for ."
Thank you very much .

"@@ Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : I lo@@ ved that talk . I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that ex@@ pan@@ sion of — that you were talking about , that P@@ et@@ er S@@ in@@ ger tal@@ ks about , is also driv@@ en by , just by technology , by gre@@ ater vis@@ i@@ bility of the other , and the sense that the world is ther@@ e@@ fore getting sm@@ all@@ er . I mean , is that also a gra@@ in of tr@@ uth ?"
"C@@ A : Well , St@@ eve , I would love every news me@@ dia ow@@ ner to hear that talk at some point in the next year . I think it &apos;s really important . Thank you so much ."
S@@ P : My pl@@ eas@@ ure .
"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Un@@ iver@@ sity of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"@@ Here is a l@@ um@@ p of fl@@ esh , about three po@@ un@@ ds , which you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand ."
But it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ar space .
"It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the mean@@ ing of its own ex@@ ist@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is tr@@ ul@@ y the most amazing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est my@@ ster@@ y con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the ad@@ ult human brain .
"And each neuro@@ n makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And bas@@ ed on this , people have cal@@ cul@@ ated that the number of per@@ m@@ ut@@ ations and com@@ bin@@ ations of brain acti@@ vity ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ s the number of el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ les in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stud@@ ying the brain ?"
"One appro@@ ach is to look at patients who had les@@ ions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior ."
This is what I spo@@ ke about in the last TE@@ D .
"@@ To@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different appro@@ ach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually rec@@ or@@ d the acti@@ vity of individ@@ ual ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ or@@ t of e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one rec@@ ent discover@@ y that has been made by rese@@ arch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in P@@ ar@@ ma , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ at@@ ti and his colle@@ ag@@ ues , is a group of neurons called mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordin@@ ary mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fir@@ e when a person per@@ for@@ ms a spec@@ if@@ ic action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an app@@ le , a mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neuro@@ n in the front of my brain will fir@@ e ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an object , another neuro@@ n will fir@@ e , com@@ man@@ ding me to pul@@ l that object ."
These are called mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ at@@ ti found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fir@@ e when I &apos;m looking at somebody else per@@ form@@ ing the same action ."
"So , here is a neuro@@ n that fir@@ es when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fir@@ es when I wat@@ ch J@@ o@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is tr@@ ul@@ y as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neuro@@ n is ad@@ op@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ form@@ ing a vir@@ tual reality sim@@ ul@@ ation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of these mir@@ ro@@ r neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ ol@@ ved in things like im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ul@@ ation .
Because to im@@ it@@ ate a compl@@ ex act requ@@ ir@@ es my brain to ad@@ op@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sl@@ ide ."
"So , how do you do im@@ it@@ ation ? Why is im@@ it@@ ation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and im@@ it@@ ation , em@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ d@@ den em@@ er@@ gence and ra@@ p@@ id sp@@ read of a number of sk@@ il@@ ls that are un@@ i@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fir@@ e , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavior ."
All of that happened rel@@ ati@@ vely qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had achi@@ ev@@ ed its present size almost three or four hundred thou@@ s@@ and years ago , 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years ago all of this happened very , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"And I cl@@ a@@ im that what happened was the su@@ d@@ den em@@ er@@ gence of a soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system , which al@@ lowed you to em@@ ul@@ ate and im@@ it@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ d@@ den acc@@ id@@ ental discover@@ y by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fir@@ e , or a particular typ@@ e of to@@ ol , instead of d@@ ying out , this sp@@ read ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly , hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was trans@@ mit@@ ted ver@@ tically , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ d@@ den@@ ly L@@ am@@ arc@@ k@@ ian , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ ian ."
D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ ian evolution is s@@ low ; it takes hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A pol@@ ar be@@ ar , to evol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just wat@@ ch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another pol@@ ar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , f@@ ur on the body , and learn it in one step . What the pol@@ ar be@@ ar took 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ read@@ s in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The im@@ it@@ ation of compl@@ ex sk@@ il@@ ls is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of civiliz@@ ation .
"Now there is another kind of mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n , which is inv@@ ol@@ ved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for action , there are mir@@ ro@@ r neurons for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ch@@ es me , my hand , neuro@@ n in the so@@ ma@@ to@@ sen@@ s@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ s@@ ory regi@@ on of the brain fir@@ es ."
"But the same neuro@@ n , in some cas@@ es , will fir@@ e when I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ ing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fir@@ e when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different loc@@ ations . D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent neurons for different loc@@ ations ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fir@@ e even when I wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same loc@@ ation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"Now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : If I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ f@@ used and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ sa@@ tion mer@@ ely by wat@@ ch@@ ing somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pa@@ in re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise you &apos;ll get con@@ f@@ used and mud@@ d@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sign@@ al that v@@ et@@ o@@ es the sign@@ al of the mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from conscious@@ ly experien@@ cing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the bra@@ ch@@ ial pl@@ ex@@ us , so the ar@@ m is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sa@@ tions coming in , if I now wat@@ ch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ h@@ i neurons , or em@@ pa@@ thy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical sense .
"A@@ ll that &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"R@@ emo@@ ve the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ as@@ tern philosoph@@ y , and that is there is no real inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just v@@ ia F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok and In@@ tern@@ et , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole cha@@ ins of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dis@@ tin@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of your consciousness from somebody else &apos;s consciousness .
And this is not m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o philosoph@@ y .
It em@@ er@@ g@@ es from our understanding of bas@@ ic neuro@@ science .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . If the ar@@ m has been re@@ mov@@ ed and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , if you have pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ sa@@ ge the other person &apos;s hand , that rel@@ i@@ ev@@ es the pa@@ in in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neuro@@ n were ob@@ ta@@ ining rel@@ i@@ ef from mer@@ ely wat@@ ch@@ ing somebody else being mas@@ sa@@ g@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sl@@ ide ."
F@@ or the lon@@ gest time people have re@@ gar@@ ded science and hum@@ an@@ ities as being dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now spo@@ ke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , hum@@ an@@ ities on the other ; never the t@@ wa@@ in sh@@ all me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mir@@ ro@@ r neuro@@ n system under@@ li@@ es the inter@@ face al@@ lowing you to re@@ think about issu@@ es like consciousness , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of self , what se@@ par@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what al@@ lo@@ ws you to em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the em@@ er@@ gence of culture and civiliz@@ ation , which is un@@ i@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings .

"It &apos;s a great h@@ on@@ or today to share with you The D@@ ig@@ ital Un@@ iver@@ se , which was created for hum@@ an@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the video that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ us@@ ic ) The fl@@ at hor@@ iz@@ on that we &apos;ve evol@@ ved with has been a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded resour@@ ces and un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed cap@@ ac@@ ity for dis@@ po@@ sal of was@@ te .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ ove the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here and had seen the hor@@ iz@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a li@@ mit@@ ed con@@ d@@ ition ."
The D@@ ig@@ ital Un@@ iver@@ se A@@ t@@ l@@ as has been built at the American M@@ us@@ e@@ um of N@@ at@@ ural H@@ ist@@ ory over the past 12 years .
"We main@@ tain that , put that together as a pro@@ ject to really ch@@ art the universe across all sc@@ al@@ es ."
"What we see here are sa@@ tel@@ lit@@ es around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per re@@ g@@ ist@@ ration against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A sup@@ port@@ ed this work 12 years ago as part of the reb@@ u@@ il@@ ding of the H@@ ay@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ ig@@ ital Un@@ iver@@ se is the bas@@ is of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our ma@@ in space sho@@ ws in the do@@ me .
"But what you see here is the res@@ ult of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we ho@@ st@@ ed with L@@ in@@ kop@@ ing Un@@ iver@@ sity in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their grad@@ u@@ ate work , and the res@@ ult has been this sof@@ tw@@ are called Un@@ iv@@ i@@ ew and a compan@@ y called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en ."
"This sof@@ tw@@ are al@@ lo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tual f@@ light pat@@ h and movi@@ e that we see here was actually f@@ lo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tu@@ red this live from my l@@ ap@@ top in a c@@ af@@ e called Earth M@@ at@@ ters on the L@@ o@@ wer E@@ ast S@@ ide of M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ labo@@ ra@@ tive pro@@ ject with the R@@ ub@@ in M@@ us@@ e@@ um of H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an A@@ r@@ t for an ex@@ h@@ ib@@ it on com@@ par@@ ative co@@ smo@@ lo@@ gy ."
"And so as we move out , we see contin@@ u@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the real@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , ligh@@ t-@@ tr@@ av@@ el time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dis@@ t@@ ant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essenti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P m@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be mean@@ ingl@@ ess , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment of the vis@@ ible universe .
We know the universe is big@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , we see here the radi@@ o sp@@ here that we j@@ um@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are pos@@ it@@ ions , the l@@ at@@ est pos@@ it@@ ions of ex@@ o@@ plan@@ ets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pped , and our su@@ n here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own sol@@ ar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly between s@@ ever@@ al or@@ d@@ ers of mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the sol@@ ar system — these are the pa@@ ths of V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ ion@@ e@@ er 11 and P@@ ion@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to have left the sol@@ ar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in clo@@ s@@ er , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This map can be up@@ da@@ ted , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ ar@@ ol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the c@@ amer@@ a P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini mis@@ sion .
"But here we see the compl@@ ex tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory of the C@@ as@@ s@@ ini mis@@ sion c@@ olo@@ r cod@@ ed for different mis@@ sion ph@@ as@@ es , in@@ gen@@ i@@ ously develop@@ ed so that 4@@ 5 en@@ coun@@ ters with the larg@@ est mo@@ on , T@@ it@@ an , which is larg@@ er that the planet M@@ er@@ cur@@ y , div@@ erts the or@@ bit into different parts of mis@@ sion ph@@ ase ."
This sof@@ tw@@ are al@@ lo@@ ws us to come clo@@ se and look at parts of this .
This sof@@ tw@@ are can also be n@@ et@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we n@@ et@@ work dom@@ es ."
And we can n@@ et@@ work between dom@@ es and clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
We &apos;re actually shar@@ ing t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in G@@ h@@ ana as well as new li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ ia and a high school in C@@ amb@@ od@@ ia .
And the C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ ans have actually contro@@ l@@ led the H@@ ay@@ den P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um from their high school .
"This is an imag@@ e from S@@ at@@ ur@@ day , ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ ed by the A@@ qu@@ a sa@@ tel@@ lit@@ e , but through the Un@@ iv@@ i@@ ew sof@@ tw@@ are ."
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is N@@ ep@@ al .
"This is , in fact , right here is the val@@ le@@ y of L@@ h@@ asa , right here in Ti@@ b@@ et ."
But we can see the h@@ aze from fir@@ es and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ le@@ y down bel@@ ow in India .
This is N@@ ep@@ al and Ti@@ b@@ et .
"And just in clo@@ sing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to br@@ ave in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larg@@ er con@@ d@@ ition now and a much larg@@ er sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essenti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .
"And to be able to see our cont@@ ex@@ t in this larg@@ er sense at all sc@@ al@@ es hel@@ ps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"And this idea is n@@ ic@@ ely sum@@ mar@@ ized by the Brit@@ ish c@@ rit@@ ic W@@ il@@ li@@ am H@@ az@@ lit@@ t , who w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; &quot; P@@ re@@ j@@ ud@@ ice is the child of ign@@ or@@ ance . &quot; &quot; I want to try to con@@ vin@@ ce you here that this is mis@@ taken . I want to try to con@@ vin@@ ce y@@ ou@@ "
"So , start with ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es . You look at me , you know my name , you know certain fac@@ ts about me , and you could make certain j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments ."
"You could make gu@@ ess@@ es about my e@@ th@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , my political af@@ fil@@ i@@ ation , my relig@@ ious beli@@ ef@@ s ."
"And the thing is , these j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments t@@ end to be ac@@ cu@@ rate ."
We &apos;re very good at this sort of thing .
"And we &apos;re very good at this sort of thing because our ability to ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e people is not some sort of ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary qu@@ ir@@ k of the mind , but rather it &apos;s a spec@@ if@@ ic inst@@ ance of a more gener@@ al process , which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that f@@ all into cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies , and we can use our experience to make gener@@ aliz@@ ations about no@@ vel in@@ stan@@ ces of these cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies ."
Now we might be wrong .
"But for the most part , we &apos;re good at this ."
"And in fact , H@@ az@@ lit@@ t later on in his wonderful es@@ say con@@ c@@ ed@@ es this ."
But other times we &apos;re pro@@ u@@ d of it .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er : G@@ ets to your question , the question in the h@@ all , on for@@ e@@ ign a@@ id ? Y@@ es , ma &apos;@@ am ."
W@@ o@@ man : The American people are suf@@ fer@@ ing in our country right now .
Why do we contin@@ ue to sen@@ d for@@ e@@ ign a@@ id to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
"A@@ C : G@@ over@@ n@@ or P@@ er@@ ry , what about that ?"
"And in fact , in gener@@ al , people are often s@@ wa@@ yed by feel@@ ings of sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity , lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty , pr@@ ide , pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ism , to@@ wards their country or to@@ wards their e@@ th@@ n@@ ic group ."
Now some of you may re@@ ject this .
"But even you soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ates ac@@ cept that there should be some pul@@ l to@@ wards the in@@ -@@ group in the do@@ ma@@ in of friends and family , of people you &apos;re clo@@ se to , and so even you make a dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between us ver@@ su@@ s them ."
T@@ a@@ j@@ fe@@ l was born in P@@ ol@@ and in 19@@ 1@@ 9 .
And what started his career is an in@@ sight that the way most people were thinking about the H@@ olo@@ ca@@ ust was wrong .
"M@@ any people , most people at the time , vie@@ wed the H@@ olo@@ ca@@ ust as sort of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing some tra@@ g@@ ic fl@@ a@@ w on the part of the G@@ er@@ man@@ s , some gen@@ e@@ tic ta@@ in@@ t , some au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ arian person@@ ality ."
And T@@ a@@ j@@ fe@@ l re@@ jec@@ ted this .
"And to ex@@ pl@@ ore this , he did a ser@@ ies of clas@@ si@@ c studies with Brit@@ ish ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents ."
"And in one of his studies , what he did was he asked the Brit@@ ish ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents all sor@@ ts of questions , and then bas@@ ed on their ans@@ w@@ ers , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve looked at your ans@@ w@@ ers , and bas@@ ed on the ans@@ w@@ ers , I have de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed that you are ei@@ ther &quot; &quot; — he told half of them — &quot; &quot; a K@@ and@@ in@@ sk@@ y lo@@ ver , you love the work of K@@ and@@ in@@ sk@@ y , or a K@@ le@@ e lo@@ ver , you love the work of K@@ le@@ e . &quot; &quot; It was enti@@ rel@@ y bo@@ g@@ us ."
"But what he found was , these cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies mat@@ ter@@ ed , so when he later gave the sub@@ jects money , they would pre@@ fer to give the money to mem@@ bers of their own group than mem@@ bers of the other group ."
So one of the p@@ up@@ p@@ ets might like gre@@ en be@@ ans .
"They test the b@@ ab@@ ies own food pre@@ fer@@ ences , and b@@ ab@@ ies t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally pre@@ fer the gra@@ h@@ am cra@@ c@@ k@@ ers ."
"But the question is , does this matter to b@@ ab@@ ies in how they treat the p@@ up@@ p@@ ets ? And it mat@@ ters a lot ."
"( Laughter ) We see this sort of in@@ -@@ group , ou@@ t-@@ group psych@@ ology all the time ."
We see it in political cl@@ ash@@ es within gro@@ ups with different ide@@ ologi@@ es .
S@@ ter@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es can also go aw@@ ry .
"So often they &apos;re ra@@ tional and us@@ ef@@ ul , but sometimes they &apos;re ir@@ ra@@ tional , they give the wrong ans@@ w@@ ers , and other times they le@@ ad to pla@@ in@@ ly im@@ moral con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ."
And the case that &apos;s been most stu@@ died is the case of ra@@ ce .
"There was a fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating study pri@@ or to the 200@@ 8 elec@@ tion where social psych@@ olog@@ ists looked at the ext@@ ent to which the can@@ di@@ da@@ t@@ es were as@@ soci@@ ated with America , as in an un@@ consci@@ ous as@@ soci@@ ation with the American fl@@ a@@ g ."
"And in one of their studies they com@@ par@@ ed O@@ b@@ am@@ a and M@@ c@@ C@@ ain , and they found M@@ c@@ C@@ ain is thought of as more American than O@@ b@@ am@@ a , and to some ext@@ ent , people ar@@ en &apos;t that sur@@ pris@@ ed by he@@ aring that ."
"But they were respon@@ ding , of course , to the c@@ olo@@ r of his sk@@ in ."
"In one rec@@ ent study , rese@@ arch@@ ers put ad@@ s on e@@ B@@ ay for the sa@@ le of bas@@ eb@@ all car@@ ds ."
"S@@ ome of them were hel@@ d by white hands , others by black hands ."
They were the same bas@@ eb@@ all car@@ ds .
"In research done at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d , psych@@ olog@@ ists ex@@ pl@@ ored the case of people s@@ ent@@ en@@ ced for the m@@ ur@@ der of a white person ."
And there are different av@@ en@@ ues .
"One av@@ en@@ ue is to ap@@ pe@@ al to people &apos;s emo@@ tional respon@@ ses , to ap@@ pe@@ al to people &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy , and we often do that through stories ."
P@@ eople don &apos;t t@@ end to del@@ u@@ ge people with fac@@ ts and stat@@ is@@ tics .
This is H@@ ar@@ ri@@ et B@@ e@@ e@@ ch@@ er S@@ to@@ we .
And that could well have been a cat@@ al@@ y@@ st for great social change .
"So A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith star@@ ts by as@@ king you to imagine the death of thousands of people , and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not famil@@ i@@ ar with ."
It could be China or India or a country in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a .
"And S@@ m@@ ith says , how would you res@@ po@@ nd ?"
"And you would say , well that &apos;s too bad , and you &apos;d go on to the rest of your life ."
"But imagine instead , S@@ m@@ ith says , you were to learn that to@@ mor@@ row you were to have your little fin@@ ger ch@@ op@@ ped off ."
"S@@ m@@ ith says , that would matter a lot ."
So this ra@@ is@@ es the question : W@@ ould you sa@@ cri@@ f@@ ice thousands of lives to sa@@ ve your little fin@@ ger ?
"Now answer this in the p@@ riv@@ ac@@ y of your own head , but S@@ m@@ ith says , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely not , what a hor@@ ri@@ d thought ."
"And this princi@@ ple of im@@ par@@ ti@@ ality man@@ if@@ es@@ ts itself in all of the world &apos;s relig@@ ions , in all of the different ver@@ sions of the gol@@ den rul@@ e , and in all of the world &apos;s moral philosoph@@ ies , which dif@@ fer in many ways but share the pre@@ sup@@ position that we should j@@ ud@@ ge moral@@ ity from sort of an im@@ par@@ ti@@ al point of view ."
We have b@@ ound ourselves .
And we b@@ ind ourselves in other ways as well .
I think pre@@ j@@ ud@@ ice and bi@@ as ill@@ ust@@ rate a fundamental d@@ ual@@ ity of human nature .
Thank you .

"In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s with a lot of un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ."
And I &apos;m going to talk about some of those con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences and just present a whole bun@@ ch of really interesting pro@@ jects that I think give us tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous reas@@ ons to be really op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic that the big des@@ ign and develop@@ ment pro@@ ject of the next 50 years is going to be re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia .
"So whether it &apos;s re@@ develop@@ ing d@@ ying m@@ all@@ s or re@@ -@@ in@@ h@@ ab@@ iting de@@ ad big@@ -@@ bo@@ x stor@@ es or re@@ con@@ struc@@ ting w@@ et@@ lan@@ ds out of par@@ king lots , I think the fact is the gro@@ wing number of emp@@ ty and under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ing , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally re@@ ta@@ il , sit@@ es throu@@ gh@@ out sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia giv@@ es us actually a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous opportun@@ ity to take our le@@ as@@ t-@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ able l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ es right now and con@@ ver@@ t them into more su@@ st@@ ain@@ able places ."
"And in the process , what that al@@ lo@@ ws us to do is to re@@ direc@@ t a lot more of our growth back into ex@@ is@@ ting commun@@ ities that could use a bo@@ o@@ st , and have the in@@ fra@@ structure in place , instead of contin@@ u@@ ing to te@@ ar down tre@@ es and to te@@ ar up the gre@@ en space out at the ed@@ g@@ es ."
So why is this important ?
"I think there are any number of reas@@ ons , and I &apos;m just going to not get into deta@@ il but men@@ tion a few ."
"@@ Just from the per@@ spec@@ tive of cli@@ mate change , the average ur@@ b@@ an d@@ wel@@ l@@ er in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"@@ has about on@@ e-@@ third the car@@ b@@ on fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t of the average sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an d@@ wel@@ l@@ er , mo@@ st@@ ly because sub@@ ur@@ ban@@ it@@ es dr@@ ive a lot more , and living in det@@ ach@@ ed buil@@ din@@ gs , you have that much more ex@@ ter@@ ior sur@@ face to le@@ ak energy out of ."
"So str@@ ic@@ tly from a cli@@ mate change per@@ spec@@ tive , the c@@ ities are already rel@@ ati@@ vely gre@@ en ."
The big opportun@@ ity to reduc@@ e gre@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se ga@@ s em@@ is@@ sions is actually in ur@@ ban@@ iz@@ ing the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s .
"A@@ ll that driv@@ ing that we &apos;ve been doing out in the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s , we have d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed the amount of mil@@ es we dr@@ ive ."
It &apos;s increas@@ ed our de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce on for@@ e@@ ign o@@ il des@@ p@@ ite the ga@@ ins in fu@@ el ef@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy .
We &apos;re just driv@@ ing so much more ; we hav@@ en &apos;t been able to keep up technolo@@ g@@ ically .
P@@ ub@@ li@@ c health is another reason to consid@@ er re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting .
R@@ es@@ e@@ arch@@ ers at the C@@ D@@ C and other places have increas@@ ing@@ ly been lin@@ king sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an develop@@ ment patterns with s@@ ed@@ ent@@ ary lif@@ est@@ y@@ les .
"And those have been lin@@ ked then with the rather al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , gro@@ wing rat@@ es of ob@@ es@@ ity , sho@@ wn in these ma@@ ps here , and that ob@@ es@@ ity has also been tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing great increas@@ es in heart disease and diab@@ et@@ es to the point where a child born today has a on@@ e-@@ in@@ -@@ three chan@@ ce of develop@@ ing diab@@ et@@ es ."
"And that rate has been es@@ cal@@ ating at the same rate as children not wal@@ king to school any@@ more , again , because of our develop@@ ment patterns ."
And then there &apos;s finally — there &apos;s the af@@ for@@ da@@ bility question .
"I mean , how af@@ for@@ da@@ ble is it to contin@@ ue to live in sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia with ris@@ ing ga@@ s pr@@ ices ?"
"S@@ ub@@ ur@@ b@@ an ex@@ pan@@ sion to che@@ a@@ p land , for the last 50 years — you know the che@@ a@@ p land out on the edge — has hel@@ ped gener@@ ations of famil@@ ies en@@ jo@@ y the American dre@@ am ."
"But increas@@ ing@@ ly , the sa@@ vin@@ gs prom@@ ised by driv@@ e-@@ t@@ ill@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ qu@@ al@@ if@@ y af@@ for@@ da@@ bility — which is basically our mo@@ del — those sa@@ vin@@ gs are wi@@ ped out when you consid@@ er the trans@@ port@@ ation co@@ st@@ s ."
"For inst@@ ance , here in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , about half of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds make between $ 20@@ ,000 and $ 5@@ 0,000 a year , and they are sp@@ en@@ ding 2@@ 9 percent of their income on h@@ ous@@ ing and 3@@ 2 percent on trans@@ port@@ ation ."
"I mean , that &apos;s 200@@ 5 fig@@ ures ."
That &apos;s before we got up to the four b@@ uc@@ ks a g@@ all@@ on .
"You know , n@@ one of us really t@@ end to do the mat@@ h on our trans@@ port@@ ation co@@ st@@ s , and they &apos;re not going down any time so@@ on ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther you love sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia &apos;s le@@ af@@ y p@@ riv@@ ac@@ y or you h@@ ate its s@@ ou@@ l@@ less com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al st@@ ri@@ ps , there are reas@@ ons why it &apos;s important to re@@ tro@@ f@@ it ."
But is it prac@@ tical ?
I think it is .
"@@ J@@ un@@ e W@@ il@@ li@@ am@@ son and I have been rese@@ arch@@ ing this t@@ op@@ ic for over a dec@@ ade , and we &apos;ve found over 80 vari@@ ed pro@@ jects ."
"But that they &apos;re really all market driv@@ en , and what &apos;s driv@@ ing the market in particular — number one — is maj@@ or demo@@ graph@@ ic shi@@ f@@ ts ."
"We all t@@ end to think of sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia as this very famil@@ y-@@ foc@@ used place , but that &apos;s really not the case any@@ more ."
"S@@ in@@ ce 2@@ 000 , already tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia did not have kids in them ."
We just hav@@ en &apos;t c@@ au@@ ght up with the ac@@ tual real@@ ities of this .
"The reas@@ ons for this have a lot to with the domin@@ ance of the two big demo@@ graph@@ ic gro@@ ups right now : the B@@ ab@@ y B@@ o@@ om@@ ers re@@ ti@@ r@@ ing — and then there &apos;s a ga@@ p , G@@ ener@@ ation X , which is a small gener@@ ation ."
They &apos;re still having kids — but G@@ ener@@ ation Y h@@ as@@ n &apos;t even started h@@ it@@ ting chil@@ d@@ -@@ re@@ aring age .
They &apos;re the other big gener@@ ation .
"So as a res@@ ult of that , demo@@ graph@@ ers predic@@ t that through 20@@ 25 , 7@@ 5 to 8@@ 5 percent of new h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds will not have kids in them ."
"And the market research , con@@ sum@@ er research , as@@ king the B@@ o@@ om@@ ers and G@@ en Y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tel@@ ls us there is going to be a huge de@@ m@@ and — and we &apos;re already seeing it — for more ur@@ b@@ an lif@@ est@@ y@@ les within sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia ."
"That basically , the B@@ o@@ om@@ ers want to be able to age in place , and G@@ en Y would like to live an ur@@ b@@ an lif@@ est@@ y@@ le , but most of their j@@ obs will contin@@ ue to be out in sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia ."
The other big d@@ y@@ na@@ mic of change is the she@@ er per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of under@@ per@@ form@@ ing as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
"Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an in@@ die roc@@ k b@@ and , but develop@@ ers gener@@ ally use it to re@@ fer to under@@ used par@@ king lots — and sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia is ful@@ l of them ."
"When the pos@@ tw@@ ar sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s were first built out on the che@@ a@@ p land away from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn , it made sense to just build sur@@ face par@@ king lots ."
"But those sit@@ es have now been le@@ ap@@ f@@ rog@@ g@@ ed and le@@ ap@@ f@@ rog@@ g@@ ed again , as we &apos;ve just contin@@ u@@ ed to sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l , and they now have a rel@@ ati@@ vely cent@@ ral loc@@ ation ."
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more val@@ u@@ able than just sur@@ face par@@ king lots .
"It now makes sense to go back in , build a dec@@ k and build up on those sit@@ es ."
"So what do you do with a de@@ ad m@@ all , de@@ ad off@@ ice par@@ k ?"
"It turns out , all sor@@ ts of things ."
"In a s@@ low econom@@ y like ours , re@@ -@@ in@@ h@@ ab@@ it@@ ation is one of the more popul@@ ar stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es ."
So this happens to be a de@@ ad m@@ all in St@@ . L@@ ou@@ is that &apos;s been re@@ -@@ in@@ h@@ ab@@ ited as art@@ -@@ space .
"It &apos;s now home to art@@ ist stu@@ di@@ os , the@@ ater gro@@ ups , dan@@ ce tro@@ up@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not pul@@ ling in as much ta@@ x re@@ ven@@ ue as it once was , but it &apos;s serv@@ ing its commun@@ ity ."
It &apos;s ke@@ ep@@ ing the ligh@@ ts on .
"It &apos;s becom@@ ing , I think , a really great inst@@ it@@ u@@ tion ."
"O@@ ther m@@ all@@ s have been re@@ -@@ in@@ h@@ ab@@ ited as n@@ ur@@ sing h@@ om@@ es , as univer@@ s@@ ities , and as all vari@@ ety of off@@ ice space ."
"We also found a lot of exam@@ pl@@ es of de@@ ad big@@ -@@ bo@@ x stor@@ es that have been con@@ v@@ ert@@ ed into all sor@@ ts of commun@@ it@@ y-@@ serv@@ ing uses as well — lots of scho@@ ols , lots of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and lots of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies like this one ."
"This was a little gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , a F@@ ood L@@ ion gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , that is now a public li@@ br@@ ary ."
"In ad@@ d@@ ition to , I think , doing a beautiful ada@@ p@@ tive re@@ use , they t@@ ore up some of the par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es , put in bi@@ os@@ wal@@ es to coll@@ ect and c@@ le@@ an the run@@ off , put in a lot more s@@ ide@@ wal@@ ks to con@@ n@@ ect to the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
"And they &apos;ve made this , what was just a stor@@ e along a com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al st@@ ri@@ p , into a commun@@ ity ga@@ ther@@ ing space ."
"This one is a little L@@ -@@ shap@@ ed st@@ ri@@ p sh@@ op@@ ping center in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x , A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a ."
"R@@ e@@ ally all they did was they gave it a f@@ res@@ h co@@ at of b@@ right pain@@ t , a g@@ our@@ me@@ t gro@@ cer@@ y , and they put up a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in the old pos@@ t off@@ ice ."
N@@ ever under@@ es@@ ti@@ mate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a des@@ tin@@ ation .
"It &apos;s been so success@@ ful , they &apos;ve now taken over the st@@ ri@@ p across the stre@@ et ."
"The real est@@ ate ad@@ s in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od all very pro@@ ud@@ ly pro@@ cl@@ a@@ im , &quot; W@@ al@@ king dis@@ tan@@ ce to L@@ e G@@ ran@@ de O@@ ran@@ ge , &quot; because it pro@@ vid@@ ed its ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od with what soci@@ olog@@ ists like to call &quot; a third place . &quot;"
"If home is the first place and work is the second place , the third place is where you go to han@@ g out and build commun@@ ity ."
"And es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally as sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia is becom@@ ing less cen@@ ter@@ ed on the family , the family h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , there &apos;s a real h@@ un@@ ger for more third places ."
"So the most dra@@ ma@@ tic re@@ tro@@ f@@ its are really those in the next cat@@ eg@@ ory , the next stra@@ te@@ gy : re@@ develop@@ ment ."
"Now , d@@ uring the bo@@ om , there were s@@ ever@@ al really dra@@ ma@@ tic re@@ develop@@ ment pro@@ jects where the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al building was sc@@ ra@@ ped to the ground and then the whole s@@ ite was reb@@ u@@ il@@ t at si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly gre@@ ater den@@ sity , a sort of comp@@ act , wal@@ k@@ able ur@@ b@@ an ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
But some of them have been much more incre@@ mental .
"This is M@@ ash@@ pe@@ e C@@ om@@ mon@@ s , the ol@@ d@@ est re@@ tro@@ f@@ it that we &apos;ve found ."
"And it &apos;s just incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , over the last 20 years , built ur@@ ban@@ ism on top of its par@@ king lots ."
So the black and white ph@@ ot@@ o sho@@ ws the simple 60 &apos;s st@@ ri@@ p sh@@ op@@ ping center .
"And then the ma@@ ps ab@@ ove that show its grad@@ ual trans@@ forma@@ tion into a comp@@ act , mi@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ use New Engl@@ and village , and it has plan@@ s now that have been appro@@ ved for it to con@@ n@@ ect to new res@@ id@@ enti@@ al ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods across the ar@@ ter@@ i@@ als and over to the other side ."
"So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incre@@ mental ."
"S@@ ome@@ times , it &apos;s all at once ."
"This is another in@@ f@@ ill pro@@ ject on the par@@ king lots , this one of an off@@ ice par@@ k outside of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
"When M@@ et@@ ro@@ ra@@ il exp@@ and@@ ed trans@@ it into the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s and op@@ en@@ ed a st@@ ation ne@@ ar@@ by to this s@@ ite , the ow@@ n@@ ers decided to build a new par@@ king dec@@ k and then in@@ s@@ ert on top of their sur@@ face lots a new M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et , s@@ ever@@ al ap@@ art@@ ments and con@@ do buil@@ din@@ gs , while ke@@ ep@@ ing the ex@@ is@@ ting off@@ ice buil@@ din@@ gs ."
Here is the s@@ ite in 19@@ 40 : It was just a little far@@ m in the village of H@@ y@@ at@@ ts@@ vil@@ le .
"B@@ y 19@@ 80 , it had been sub@@ d@@ ivid@@ ed into a big m@@ all on one side and the off@@ ice par@@ k on the other and then some b@@ uf@@ fer sit@@ es for a li@@ br@@ ary and a ch@@ ur@@ ch to the far right ."
"@@ To@@ day , the trans@@ it , the M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et and the new h@@ ous@@ ing have all been built ."
"E@@ ven@@ tually , I exp@@ ect that the stre@@ ets will probably ext@@ end through a re@@ develop@@ ment of the m@@ all ."
P@@ l@@ ans have already been an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced for a lot of those gar@@ den ap@@ art@@ ments ab@@ ove the m@@ all to be re@@ develop@@ ed .
Trans@@ it is a big driv@@ er of re@@ tro@@ f@@ its .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
You can sort of see the fun@@ k@@ y new con@@ do buil@@ din@@ gs in between the off@@ ice buil@@ din@@ gs and the public space and the new M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et .
"This one is one of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es , B@@ el@@ ma@@ r ."
I think they really built an at@@ trac@@ tive place here and have just emp@@ lo@@ yed all@@ -@@ gre@@ en con@@ struc@@ tion .
There &apos;s massive P@@ .@@ V@@ . ar@@ ra@@ ys on the ro@@ of@@ s as well as w@@ ind tur@@ bin@@ es .
This was a very large m@@ all on a hund@@ re@@ d@@ -@@ ac@@ re super@@ bloc@@ k .
"It &apos;s now 2@@ 2 wal@@ k@@ able ur@@ b@@ an bloc@@ ks with public stre@@ ets , two public par@@ ks , eight b@@ us lin@@ es and a ran@@ ge of h@@ ous@@ ing typ@@ es , and so it &apos;s really given L@@ ak@@ e@@ wo@@ od , C@@ olo@@ ra@@ do the do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn that this particular sub@@ ur@@ b never had ."
Here was the m@@ all in its he@@ y@@ day .
They had their p@@ rom in the m@@ all . They lo@@ ved their m@@ all .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite in 19@@ 7@@ 5 with the m@@ all .
"B@@ y 19@@ 9@@ 5 , the m@@ all has died ."
The de@@ par@@ t@@ ment stor@@ e has been ke@@ pt — and we found this was true in many cas@@ es .
The de@@ par@@ t@@ ment stor@@ es are mul@@ t@@ ist@@ ory ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re@@ -@@ ada@@ p@@ ted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at pro@@ jec@@ ted buil@@ d@@ -@@ out .
"This pro@@ ject , I think , has great connec@@ ti@@ vity to the ex@@ is@@ ting ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods ."
"It &apos;s pro@@ vid@@ ing 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds with the op@@ tion of a more ur@@ b@@ an lif@@ est@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s about tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et looks like .
"It &apos;s very success@@ ful , and it &apos;s hel@@ ped to prom@@ pt — eight of the 1@@ 3 regi@@ on@@ al m@@ all@@ s in D@@ en@@ ver have now , or have an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced plan@@ s to be , re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ted ."
But it &apos;s important to not@@ e that all of this re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting is not oc@@ curr@@ ing — just b@@ ul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers are coming and just p@@ lowing down the whole c@@ ity .
"@@ No , it &apos;s po@@ c@@ ket@@ s of wal@@ k@@ ability on the sit@@ es of under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ing pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"And so it &apos;s giving people more cho@@ ices , but it &apos;s not taking away cho@@ ices ."
But it &apos;s also not really enough to just create po@@ c@@ ket@@ s of wal@@ k@@ ability .
You want to also try to get more sy@@ ste@@ mic trans@@ forma@@ tion .
We need to also re@@ tro@@ f@@ it the cor@@ r@@ id@@ ors themselves .
So this is one that has been re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ted in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia .
"They took the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al st@@ ri@@ p sho@@ wn on the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white imag@@ es bel@@ ow , and they built a b@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard that has become the M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et for their to@@ wn ."
"And it &apos;s trans@@ form@@ ed from being an u@@ g@@ ly , un@@ sa@@ fe , und@@ es@@ i@@ ra@@ ble ad@@ d@@ ress , to becom@@ ing a beautiful , at@@ trac@@ tive , di@@ gni@@ fied sort of good ad@@ d@@ ress ."
"I mean now we &apos;re h@@ op@@ ing we start to see it ; they &apos;ve already built C@@ ity H@@ all , at@@ trac@@ ted two h@@ ot@@ els ."
I could imagine beautiful h@@ ous@@ ing going up along there without te@@ aring down another t@@ ree .
"So there &apos;s a lot of great things , but I &apos;d love to see more cor@@ r@@ id@@ ors getting re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting ."
But den@@ si@@ fic@@ ation is not going to work every@@ where .
S@@ ome@@ times re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing is really the better answer .
"There &apos;s a lot to learn from success@@ ful l@@ and@@ ban@@ king program@@ s in c@@ ities like F@@ lin@@ t , M@@ ich@@ i@@ gan ."
There &apos;s also a bur@@ ge@@ on@@ ing sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an far@@ m@@ ing mov@@ ement — sort of vic@@ t@@ ory gar@@ den@@ s me@@ ets the In@@ tern@@ et .
"But perhaps one of the most important re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing as@@ pec@@ ts is the opportun@@ ity to re@@ stor@@ e the loc@@ al ec@@ ology , as in this example outside of M@@ in@@ ne@@ apo@@ lis ."
"When the sh@@ op@@ ping center died , the c@@ ity re@@ st@@ ored the s@@ ite &apos;s or@@ ig@@ in@@ al w@@ et@@ lan@@ ds , cre@@ ating l@@ ak@@ ef@@ ron@@ t pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y , which then at@@ trac@@ ted p@@ riv@@ ate inv@@ est@@ ment , the first p@@ riv@@ ate inv@@ est@@ ment to this very low@@ -@@ income ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in over 40 years ."
So they &apos;ve man@@ ag@@ ed to both re@@ stor@@ e the loc@@ al ec@@ ology and the loc@@ al econom@@ y at the same time .
This is another re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing example .
It also makes sense in very st@@ rong mar@@ ket@@ s .
This one in S@@ e@@ at@@ tle is on the s@@ ite of a m@@ all par@@ king lot ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to a new trans@@ it stop .
And the w@@ av@@ y line is a pat@@ h al@@ on@@ g@@ side a cre@@ e@@ k that has now been da@@ y@@ l@@ it .
The cre@@ e@@ k had been cul@@ v@@ ert@@ ed under the par@@ king lot .
But da@@ y@@ ligh@@ ting our cre@@ e@@ ks really impro@@ ves their water qu@@ ality and con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions to h@@ ab@@ it@@ at .
So I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you some of the first gener@@ ation of re@@ tro@@ f@@ its .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three chall@@ eng@@ es for the future .
The first is to pl@@ an re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting much more syst@@ em@@ ically at the me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an sc@@ ale .
We need to be able to t@@ arg@@ et which are@@ as really should be re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ed .
Wh@@ ere should we be re@@ develop@@ ing ?
And where should we be en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging re@@ -@@ in@@ h@@ ab@@ it@@ ation ?
These sl@@ ides just show two imag@@ es from a larg@@ er pro@@ ject that looked at trying to do that for A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta .
I led a te@@ am that was asked to imagine A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta 100 years from now .
"And we ch@@ ose to try to re@@ ver@@ se sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l through three simple mov@@ es — exp@@ en@@ sive , but simple ."
"One , in a hundred years , trans@@ it on all maj@@ or ra@@ il and ro@@ ad cor@@ r@@ id@@ ors ."
"@@ T@@ w@@ o , in a hundred years , thou@@ s@@ and fo@@ ot b@@ uf@@ fer@@ s on all stre@@ am cor@@ r@@ id@@ ors ."
"It &apos;s a little extre@@ me , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem ."
"In a hundred years , sub@@ div@@ is@@ ions that simply end up too clo@@ se to water or too far from trans@@ it won &apos;t be vi@@ able ."
And so we &apos;ve created the ec@@ o@@ -@@ ac@@ re trans@@ fer@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ trans@@ fer develop@@ ment ri@@ gh@@ ts to the trans@@ it cor@@ r@@ id@@ ors and al@@ low the re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing of those form@@ er sub@@ div@@ is@@ ions for food and energy produc@@ tion .
So the second challenge is to impro@@ ve the arch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ ral des@@ ign qu@@ ality of the re@@ tro@@ f@@ its .
"And I clo@@ se with this imag@@ e of democra@@ cy in action : This is a pro@@ test that &apos;s happening on a re@@ tro@@ f@@ it in S@@ il@@ ver S@@ pr@@ ing , Mar@@ y@@ land on an A@@ st@@ ro@@ tur@@ f to@@ wn gre@@ en ."
"Now , re@@ tro@@ f@@ its are often acc@@ used of being exam@@ pl@@ es of f@@ au@@ x do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ w@@ n@@ s and inst@@ ant ur@@ ban@@ ism , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more ph@@ on@@ y than an A@@ st@@ ro@@ tur@@ f to@@ wn gre@@ en ."
"I have to say , these are very hy@@ bri@@ d places ."
They are new but trying to look old .
"They have ur@@ b@@ an stre@@ ets@@ cap@@ es , but sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an par@@ king ra@@ ti@@ os ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir popul@@ ations are more d@@ iver@@ se than typ@@ ical sub@@ ur@@ b@@ ia , but they &apos;re less d@@ iver@@ se than c@@ ities ."
"And they are public places , but that are man@@ ag@@ ed by p@@ riv@@ ate compan@@ ies ."
And just the sur@@ face ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance are often — like the A@@ st@@ ro@@ tur@@ f here — they make me w@@ in@@ ce .
"So , you know , I mean I &apos;m gl@@ ad that the ur@@ ban@@ ism is doing its job ."
"The fact that a pro@@ test is happening really does mean that the la@@ y@@ out of the bloc@@ ks , the stre@@ ets and bloc@@ ks , the put@@ ting in of public space , comp@@ rom@@ ised as it may be , is still a really great thing ."
But we &apos;ve got to get the arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture better .
The fin@@ al challenge is for all of you .
"I want you to jo@@ in the pro@@ test and start de@@ man@@ ding more su@@ st@@ ain@@ able sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an places — more su@@ st@@ ain@@ able places , peri@@ od ."
"But cul@@ tur@@ ally , we t@@ end to think that do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ w@@ n@@ s should be d@@ y@@ na@@ mic , and we exp@@ ect that ."
But we seem to have an expec@@ t@@ ation that the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s should for@@ ever re@@ ma@@ in f@@ ro@@ z@@ en in wh@@ at@@ ever ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent form they were first given bir@@ th to .
"It &apos;s time to let them grow up , so I want you to all sup@@ port the zon@@ ing changes , the ro@@ ad di@@ ets , the in@@ fra@@ structure impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents and the re@@ tro@@ f@@ its that are coming so@@ on to a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ne@@ ar you ."
Thank you .
How do they dif@@ fer from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great ar@@ en@@ as of life , by the time L@@ en was 30 , L@@ en was en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly success@@ ful ."
"B@@ y the time he was 20 , he was an op@@ tions t@@ rad@@ er ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , in play , he &apos;s a national ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on br@@ id@@ ge pla@@ y@@ er ."
"And the reason he was , was that L@@ en is a c@@ old f@@ ish ."
What you get out of that is not s@@ mil@@ ey@@ -@@ ness .
"So , that &apos;s the second pat@@ h ."
"This is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ in@@ ess@@ es , t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ ally ."
"Now , O@@ K , you can open your ey@@ es ."
"And we ask the question as a func@@ tion of the three different lives , how much life sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of mean@@ ing is the st@@ ron@@ gest .
"A@@ l@@ l@@ is@@ on H@@ un@@ t : My three minutes h@@ as@@ n &apos;t started yet , has it ?"
"@@ Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes ."
"R@@ es@@ et the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fa@@ ir ."
"A@@ H : O@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s h@@ ars@@ h up here ."
I mean I &apos;m nerv@@ ous enough as it is .
But I am not as nerv@@ ous as I was five weeks ago .
F@@ ive weeks ago I had tot@@ al hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ement sur@@ ger@@ y .
Do you know that sur@@ ger@@ y ?
"E@@ lec@@ tri@@ c saw , power dr@@ ill , tot@@ ally dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing un@@ less you &apos;re D@@ av@@ id B@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ y , in which case it &apos;s all tr@@ uth and be@@ aut@@ y ."
"S@@ ure D@@ av@@ id , if it &apos;s not your hi@@ p , it &apos;s tr@@ uth and be@@ aut@@ y ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , I did have a really big e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any around the sit@@ u@@ ation , so Ch@@ ris in@@ vit@@ ed me to tell you about it ."
But first you need to know two things about me .
Just two things .
"I &apos;m C@@ an@@ a@@ dian , and I &apos;m the youn@@ gest of seven kids ."
"Now , in C@@ an@@ ada , we have that great heal@@ th@@ care system ."
That means we get our new hi@@ ps for f@@ ree .
"And being the youn@@ gest of seven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . O@@ K ?"
So my hi@@ p had been h@@ ur@@ ting me for years .
"I finally went to the doc@@ tor , which was f@@ ree ."
"And she re@@ fer@@ red me to an or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on , also f@@ ree ."
F@@ in@@ ally got to see him after 10 months of wa@@ iting — almost a year .
That is what f@@ ree gets you .
"I me@@ t the sur@@ ge@@ on , and he took some f@@ ree X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , and I got a good look at them . And you know , even I could tell my hi@@ p was bad , and I actually work in mar@@ ket@@ ing ."
"So he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ l@@ l@@ is@@ on , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table ."
I &apos;m going to re@@ place your hi@@ p — it &apos;s about an 18@@ -@@ mon@@ th wa@@ it . &quot; &quot; 18 more months .
"I &apos;d already wa@@ ited 10 months , and I had to wa@@ it 18 more months ."
"You know , it &apos;s such a long wa@@ it that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TE@@ D@@ s ."
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for this TE@@ D .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a .
I would not have my new hi@@ p for TE@@ D@@ 200@@ 8 .
I would still be on my bad hi@@ p . That was so disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting .
"So , I left his off@@ ice and I was wal@@ king through the ho@@ sp@@ ital , and that &apos;s when I had my e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
This youn@@ gest of seven had to get her@@ self to the front of the line .
O@@ h ye@@ ah .
C@@ an I tell you how un@@ -@@ C@@ an@@ a@@ dian that is ?
We do not think that way .
We don &apos;t talk about it . It &apos;s not even a consid@@ er@@ ation .
"In fact , when we &apos;re tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing ab@@ ro@@ ad , it &apos;s how we id@@ enti@@ f@@ y fel@@ low C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ ans ."
"&quot; A@@ f@@ ter you . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , no , no . A@@ f@@ ter you . &quot;"
"H@@ ey , are you from C@@ an@@ ada ? &quot; &quot; O@@ h , me too ! H@@ i ! &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at ! E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ! &quot;"
"So no , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I wasn &apos;t aver@@ se to b@@ ut@@ ting any ge@@ ez@@ er off the l@@ ist ."
"S@@ ome 7@@ 0-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old who wanted his new hi@@ p so he could be back golf@@ ing , or gar@@ den@@ ing ."
"@@ No , no . F@@ ron@@ t of the line ."
"So by now I was wal@@ king the lob@@ by , and of course , that h@@ ur@@ t , because of my hi@@ p , and I kind of needed a si@@ g@@ n ."
And I saw a si@@ g@@ n .
"In the w@@ ind@@ ow of the ho@@ sp@@ ital &apos;s tiny gi@@ ft sho@@ p there was a si@@ g@@ n that said , &quot; &quot; V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers N@@ e@@ ed@@ ed . &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m ."
"Well , they sign@@ ed me up im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"@@ No re@@ fer@@ ence ch@@ ec@@ ks . N@@ one of the us@@ ual bac@@ k@@ ground stuff , no ."
They were des@@ per@@ ate for vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers because the average age of the vol@@ un@@ te@@ er at the ho@@ sp@@ ital gi@@ ft sho@@ p was 7@@ 5 .
Y@@ eah . They needed some young blo@@ od .
"So , next thing you know , I had my b@@ right bl@@ ue vol@@ un@@ te@@ er v@@ est , I had my ph@@ ot@@ o I@@ D , and I was fully tra@@ ined by my 8@@ 9@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ ss ."
I worked al@@ one .
E@@ very F@@ ri@@ day mor@@ ning I was at the gi@@ ft sho@@ p .
"Wh@@ ile r@@ ing@@ ing in ho@@ sp@@ ital st@@ af@@ f &apos;s T@@ ic T@@ ac@@ s , I &apos;d cas@@ u@@ ally ask , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I &apos;d tell them , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m getting my hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ed — in 18 months ."
"It &apos;s gon@@ na be so great when the pa@@ in st@@ op@@ s . O@@ w ! &quot; &quot; All the st@@ af@@ f got to know the pl@@ uc@@ k@@ y , young vol@@ un@@ te@@ er ."
"M@@ y next sur@@ ge@@ on &apos;s ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment was , co@@ in@@ c@@ id@@ ent@@ ally , right after a shi@@ ft at the gi@@ ft sho@@ p ."
"So , nat@@ ur@@ ally , I had my v@@ est and my id@@ enti@@ fic@@ ation ."
I dra@@ ped them cas@@ u@@ ally over the cha@@ ir in the doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice .
"And you know , when he wal@@ ked in , I could just tell that he saw them ."
"M@@ om@@ ents later , I had a sur@@ ger@@ y da@@ te just weeks away , and a big f@@ at pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for P@@ er@@ co@@ c@@ et ."
"Now , word on the stre@@ et was that it was actually my vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering that got me to the front of the line ."
"And , you know , I &apos;m not even ash@@ amed of that ."
T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hi@@ p ."
"But also I in@@ t@@ end to s@@ tic@@ k with the vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering , which actually lead@@ s me to the big@@ gest e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any of them all ."
"E@@ ven when a C@@ an@@ a@@ dian che@@ at@@ s the system , they do it in a way that ben@@ ef@@ its society ."
There &apos;s a group of people in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
P@@ eople c@@ ross oc@@ e@@ ans to go see them .
These people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they k@@ ill lions .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the Ma@@ a@@ sa@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s co@@ ol ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Ma@@ a@@ sa@@ is , the bo@@ ys are b@@ rou@@ ght up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are b@@ rou@@ ght up to be mo@@ thers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was en@@ gag@@ ed to be marri@@ ed as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed pub@@ ert@@ y ."
"M@@ y mother , my grand@@ mother , my a@@ un@@ ties , they con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your h@@ us@@ b@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ o@@ ol , ye@@ ah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a per@@ fect woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the mor@@ ning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing the h@@ ou@@ se , co@@ o@@ king for my si@@ bl@@ ings , col@@ lec@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a per@@ fect wi@@ fe .
I went to school not because the Ma@@ a@@ sa@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she con@@ stan@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ bl@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living ."
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a pol@@ ic@@ e@@ man in the c@@ ity .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
My mother worked hard in the far@@ m to grow c@@ rop@@ s so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ar@@ ed the co@@ ws and the go@@ at@@ s so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would s@@ ell the co@@ ws , he would s@@ ell the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and dr@@ ank with his friends in the b@@ ars ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not al@@ lowed to own any pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y , and by de@@ fa@@ ult , everything in my family any@@ way bel@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ tion@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
Te@@ ach@@ ers looked n@@ ice .
"They we@@ ar n@@ ice d@@ res@@ ses , high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ ed sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ for@@ table , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just writ@@ ing on the bo@@ ard — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , com@@ par@@ ed to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our t@@ rad@@ ition , there is a cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a rite of pas@@ sa@@ ge to w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"And then I was just fin@@ ish@@ ing my e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a trans@@ ition for me to go to high school ."
This was the c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this t@@ rad@@ ition , I was going to become a wi@@ fe ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of becom@@ ing a teacher will not come to pas@@ s ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pl@@ an to figure these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ra@@ n away , my father will have a s@@ ti@@ g@@ ma , people will be call@@ ing him the father of that gir@@ l who didn &apos;t go through the cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y ."
It was a sh@@ ame@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he fig@@ ured out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; o@@ kay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of exc@@ it@@ ement .
It &apos;s a cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y . P@@ eople are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tual cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y happens , we were dan@@ cing , having exc@@ it@@ ement , and through all the night we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tual day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ou@@ se that we were dan@@ cing in . Y@@ es , we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cou@@ rt@@ yar@@ d , and there were a bun@@ ch of people wa@@ iting ."
They were all in a cir@@ cle .
"And as we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this cir@@ cle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman sit@@ ting in the middle of it , and this woman was wa@@ iting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sis@@ ters and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I sa@@ t down ."
"And I sa@@ t down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ r@@ ying a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ri@@ ed the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the c@@ lit@@ oris , and she c@@ ut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I bl@@ ed . I bl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing for a while , I fa@@ in@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , I never died — but many die ."
"It &apos;s prac@@ tic@@ ed , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and b@@ rou@@ ght a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree weeks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I me@@ t a young gen@@ t@@ le@@ man from our village who had been to the Un@@ iver@@ sity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was we@@ aring a white t-@@ shir@@ t , j@@ e@@ ans , c@@ amer@@ a , white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about clo@@ th@@ es , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have p@@ av@@ ed ro@@ ad@@ s . It was quite at@@ trac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and wa@@ iting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This gen@@ t@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in high school also , my dad was sic@@ k ."
"He got a st@@ ro@@ ke , and he was really , really sic@@ k , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body who is my dad &apos;s age , mal@@ e in the commun@@ ity , is my father by de@@ fa@@ ult — my un@@ cl@@ es , all of them — and they dic@@ t@@ ate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ o@@ man &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and I couldn &apos;t come without the sup@@ port of the village , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to buy the air tic@@ k@@ et ."
I got a s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but I needed to get my@@ self here .
"But I needed the sup@@ port of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an opportun@@ ity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lo@@ st opportun@@ ity ."
This should have been given to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the t@@ rad@@ ition .
There &apos;s a beli@@ ef amo@@ n@@ g our people that mor@@ ning br@@ ings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the mor@@ ning , because there &apos;s good news in the mor@@ ning ."
"And in the village also , there is one ch@@ i@@ ef , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the mor@@ ning , as the su@@ n ro@@ se ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ ens his do@@ or is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . C@@ an you sup@@ port me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I prom@@ ised him that I would be the best gir@@ l , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it al@@ one . &quot; &quot; He gave me a l@@ ist of another 15 men that I went — 1@@ 6 more men — every single mor@@ ning I went and vis@@ ited them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to sup@@ port me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ riv@@ ed in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al@@ -@@ Mar@@ ts , v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and lots of food in the c@@ af@@ et@@ eria ."
I was in a land of pl@@ ent@@ y .
"I en@@ jo@@ yed my@@ self , but d@@ uring that moment while I was here , I discover@@ ed a lot of things ."
"I learned that that cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called f@@ em@@ ale gen@@ ital m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we spe@@ ak right now , three million girls in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a are at ris@@ k of going through this m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me an@@ gr@@ y .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting marri@@ ed ."
"They were getting m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated , and here , after I grad@@ u@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my grad@@ u@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mo@@ thers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had prom@@ ised you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I spo@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a gir@@ l is ra@@ ped when she &apos;s wal@@ king to school , the mother is bl@@ amed for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got marri@@ ed , the mother is bl@@ amed for that , and she &apos;s p@@ un@@ i@@ shed ."
She &apos;s be@@ at@@ en .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mov@@ ed , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for bo@@ ys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for bo@@ ys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a si@@ g@@ n of com@@ mit@@ ment ."
And they did . They don@@ ated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any c@@ rit@@ eria that we had ."
"She &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was ol@@ der . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h gra@@ de ."
"A@@ n@@ g@@ el@@ ine had been mov@@ ing from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father — mov@@ ing from one grand@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ou@@ se to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . She had no st@@ ability in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something be@@ y@@ ond what I was seeing in An@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was ol@@ der to be in f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h gra@@ de ."
We gave her the opportun@@ ity to come to the class .
"F@@ ive months later , that is An@@ g@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ forma@@ tion had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
An@@ g@@ el@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a p@@ il@@ ot so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stud@@ ent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stud@@ ent , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re div@@ ision that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ har@@ on . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ vel@@ y@@ n . F@@ ive months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we spe@@ ak right now , 1@@ 25 girls will never be m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated ."
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls will not be marri@@ ed when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achi@@ ev@@ ing their dre@@ ams .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them opportun@@ ities where they can r@@ ise ."
"As we spe@@ ak right now , women are not being be@@ at@@ en because of the revolu@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our commun@@ ity ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are list@@ en@@ ing to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ sion@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war ends , no pov@@ ert@@ y ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our to@@ mor@@ row better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . P@@ eople will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e b@@ old . St@@ and up . B@@ e fe@@ ar@@ less . B@@ e con@@ f@@ id@@ ent .
"M@@ ove out , because as you change your world , as you change your commun@@ ity , as we believe that we are im@@ p@@ ac@@ ting one gir@@ l , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your commun@@ ity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . If you do that , and I do that , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I have a question for you : A@@ re you relig@@ ious ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a relig@@ ious person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many beli@@ ev@@ ers at a TE@@ D Con@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual in any way , shap@@ e or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the maj@@ or@@ ity ."
My Tal@@ k today is about self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ den@@ ce .
It &apos;s just a bas@@ ic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just mel@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c and we re@@ ach for met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ lif@@ ted or el@@ ev@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
So here &apos;s the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ou@@ se with many ro@@ oms , most of which we &apos;re very famil@@ i@@ ar with ."
But sometimes it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way ap@@ pe@@ ars from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens on@@ to a st@@ air@@ case .
We c@@ lim@@ b the st@@ air@@ case and experience a state of al@@ ter@@ ed consciousness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psych@@ olog@@ ist W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es w@@ ro@@ te about the many vari@@ eties of relig@@ ious experience ."
He col@@ lec@@ ted all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exc@@ iting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ rad@@ le@@ y , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ es@@ us in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ rad@@ le@@ y said about it .
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ rad@@ le@@ y : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shap@@ e for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , ap@@ pe@@ aring to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing ."
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die .
This world had no place in my af@@ fec@@ tions .
"P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ f@@ ish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I des@@ i@@ red the wel@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st en@@ e@@ mi@@ es ."
"@@ J@@ H : So not@@ e how B@@ rad@@ le@@ y &apos;s p@@ et@@ ty , moral@@ is@@ tic self just dies on the way up the st@@ air@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he becom@@ es lo@@ v@@ ing and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many relig@@ ions have found so many ways to help people c@@ lim@@ b the st@@ air@@ case .
O@@ thers use psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c sc@@ ro@@ ll sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ sil@@ oc@@ y@@ b@@ in m@@ ush@@ room and at the same moment get y@@ an@@ ked up the st@@ air@@ case by a go@@ d .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ den@@ ce in nature .
O@@ thers over@@ come their self at rav@@ es .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ d@@ est place of all : war .
"So many bo@@ o@@ ks about war say the same thing , that nothing br@@ ings people together like war ."
And that br@@ ing@@ ing them together op@@ ens up the possi@@ bility of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ d@@ ent experi@@ ences .
I &apos;m going to play for you an exc@@ er@@ pt from this book by G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ ra@@ y .
G@@ ra@@ y was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ ra@@ y : M@@ any v@@ et@@ er@@ ans will ad@@ mit that the experience of commun@@ al ef@@ for@@ t in b@@ at@@ tle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becom@@ es &quot; our &quot; and individ@@ ual fa@@ ith lo@@ ses its cent@@ ral import@@ ance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ sur@@ ance of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality that makes self-@@ sa@@ cri@@ f@@ ice at these mo@@ ments so rel@@ ati@@ vely easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not die , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ rad@@ es for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It fe@@ els some@@ how up@@ lif@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cent@@ ral in the writ@@ ing of the great F@@ ren@@ ch soci@@ olog@@ ist E@@ mil@@ e D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im .
"D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im even called us H@@ om@@ o du@@ pl@@ ex , or tw@@ o@@ -@@ level man ."
The lower level he called the level of the prof@@ ane .
Now prof@@ ane is the op@@ pos@@ ite of sa@@ cre@@ d .
It just means ordin@@ ary or common .
And in our ordin@@ ary lives we ex@@ ist as individ@@ ual@@ s .
We want to sat@@ is@@ f@@ y our individ@@ ual des@@ ir@@ es .
We pur@@ su@@ e our individ@@ ual go@@ als .
But sometimes something happens that tri@@ g@@ g@@ ers a ph@@ ase change .
"I@@ n@@ d@@ ivid@@ ual@@ s un@@ ite into a te@@ am , a mov@@ ement or a na@@ tion , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im called this level the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the func@@ tion of relig@@ ion was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral commun@@ ity ."
D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us takes on an air of sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people cir@@ cle around some sa@@ cre@@ d object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a te@@ am and fi@@ ght to de@@ f@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im w@@ ro@@ te about a set of in@@ ten@@ se col@@ lec@@ tive emo@@ tions that ac@@ compl@@ ish this mi@@ ra@@ cle of E pl@@ ur@@ ib@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of individ@@ ual@@ s ."
Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive jo@@ y in Brit@@ ain on the day W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive an@@ ger in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which b@@ rou@@ ght down a dic@@ t@@ at@@ or ."
So let me sum@@ mar@@ ize where we are .
I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or of a st@@ air@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ pl@@ ex and this st@@ air@@ case takes us up from the prof@@ ane level to the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d .
So here &apos;s the mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ doll@@ ar question for social scient@@ ists like me : I@@ s the st@@ air@@ case a fe@@ ature of our evolu@@ tion@@ ary des@@ ign ?
"I@@ s it a produc@@ t of natural sel@@ ec@@ tion , like our hands ?"
Well many scient@@ ists who study relig@@ ion take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ ists , for example , arg@@ ue that relig@@ ion is a set of mem@@ es , sort of par@@ as@@ it@@ ic mem@@ es , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of crazy relig@@ ious stuff , self-@@ des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive stuff , like su@@ ic@@ ide bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to lo@@ se ourselves ?"
How could it ever be ada@@ p@@ tive for any organ@@ ism to over@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in w@@ ro@@ te a great de@@ al about the evolution of moral@@ ity — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in not@@ ed that many of our vir@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our gro@@ ups ."
But really the way to think about this is as mul@@ t@@ il@@ ev@@ el sel@@ ec@@ tion .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got comp@@ et@@ ition going on within gro@@ ups and across gro@@ ups .
So here &apos;s a group of gu@@ ys on a college cre@@ w te@@ am .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in this te@@ am there &apos;s comp@@ et@@ ition .
There are gu@@ ys comp@@ et@@ ing with each other .
"The s@@ low@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get c@@ ut from the te@@ am ."
And only a few of these gu@@ ys are going to go on in the s@@ port .
"So within the te@@ am , their interes@@ ts are actually p@@ it@@ ted against each other ."
And sometimes it would be adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ e@@ ous for one of these gu@@ ys to try to sab@@ ot@@ age the other gu@@ ys .
Ma@@ ybe he &apos;ll b@@ ad@@ mo@@ uth his ch@@ i@@ ef riv@@ al to the co@@ ach .
"But while that comp@@ et@@ ition is going on within the bo@@ at , this comp@@ et@@ ition is going on across bo@@ at@@ s ."
They can only w@@ in if they all pul@@ l together as a te@@ am .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep evolu@@ tion@@ ary tr@@ u@@ ths ."
Let me ill@@ ust@@ rate this for you .
"S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;ve got a group of little organ@@ is@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be h@@ am@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s sup@@ pose that this little group here , they evol@@ ved to be co@@ oper@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this sim@@ ul@@ ation , as they inter@@ act they ga@@ in poin@@ ts , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed in size , you &apos;ll see them s@@ pl@@ it , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produc@@ e and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it ga@@ ins we@@ al@@ th or poin@@ ts or food ."
"And in shor@@ t order , the co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ r@@ id@@ ers have taken over .
If a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ r@@ id@@ er problem then it cannot re@@ a@@ p the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation and group sel@@ ec@@ tion cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fav@@ or@@ ite solu@@ tion is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dr@@ ia in every c@@ ell has its own D@@ N@@ A , tot@@ ally se@@ par@@ ate from the D@@ N@@ A in the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ par@@ ate fre@@ e-@@ living bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and bec@@ ame a super@@ organ@@ ism .
A super@@ organ@@ ism can basically take what it wan@@ ts .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually com@@ posed of these new super@@ organ@@ is@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is sometimes called a maj@@ or trans@@ ition in evolu@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s laws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of pla@@ y@@ er on the field and things be@@ gin to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some sol@@ it@@ ary was@@ ps be@@ gan cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mit@@ ive n@@ es@@ ts , or h@@ iv@@ es ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ c@@ est@@ ors bec@@ ame cul@@ tu@@ ral cre@@ atures , they came together around a he@@ arth or a cam@@ p@@ fir@@ e , they d@@ ivid@@ ed lab@@ or , they be@@ gan pain@@ ting their bo@@ dies , they spo@@ ke their own di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts , and even@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own g@@ ods ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the ben@@ ef@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation loc@@ ked inside ."
"And they un@@ loc@@ ked the most power@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ oper@@ ation — a force for con@@ struc@@ tion and des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion ."
L@@ o@@ ok at the people in these ph@@ ot@@ os I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing commun@@ al inter@@ est , which requ@@ ir@@ es them to lo@@ se themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my Tal@@ k del@@ iver@@ ed in the stan@@ dar@@ d TE@@ D way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole Tal@@ k over again in three minutes in a more ful@@ l-@@ spec@@ tr@@ um sort of way .
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ a@@ id@@ t : We hum@@ ans have many vari@@ eties of relig@@ ious experience , as W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es expla@@ ined ."
One of the most common is c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the sec@@ ret st@@ air@@ case and lo@@ sing ourselves .
"The st@@ air@@ case takes us from the experience of life as prof@@ ane or ordin@@ ary up@@ wards to the experience of life as sa@@ cre@@ d , or de@@ ep@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted ."
"We are H@@ om@@ o du@@ pl@@ ex , as D@@ ur@@ khe@@ im expla@@ ined ."
"And we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ pl@@ ex because we evol@@ ved by mul@@ t@@ il@@ ev@@ el sel@@ ec@@ tion , as D@@ ar@@ w@@ in expla@@ ined ."
"If it is an ada@@ p@@ t@@ ation , then we evol@@ ved to be relig@@ ious ."
"I mean that we evol@@ ved to see sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ ams and cir@@ cle around sa@@ cre@@ d ob@@ jects , people and ideas ."
This is why polit@@ ics is so tri@@ b@@ al .
"P@@ ol@@ it@@ ics is par@@ tly prof@@ ane , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but polit@@ ics is also about sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ ining with others to pur@@ su@@ e moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the et@@ er@@ n@@ al st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle between good and ev@@ il , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good te@@ am ."
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , if the st@@ air@@ case is real , it expla@@ ins the per@@ s@@ ist@@ ent under@@ curr@@ ent of dis@@ sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion in moder@@ n life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ext@@ ent , h@@ iv@@ ish cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We bu@@ st@@ ed out of the h@@ ive d@@ uring the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions and b@@ rou@@ ght li@@ b@@ ert@@ y to the op@@ pres@@ sed .
N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys we f@@ ly around like individ@@ ual be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ ed@@ om .
But sometimes we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ pl@@ ex , but moder@@ n , sec@@ ul@@ ar society was built to sat@@ is@@ f@@ y our lower , prof@@ ane selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ for@@ table down here on the lower level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment center ."
One great challenge of moder@@ n life is to find the st@@ air@@ case ami@@ d all the cl@@ ut@@ ter and then to do something good and nob@@ le once you c@@ lim@@ b to the top .
I see this des@@ ire in my students at the Un@@ iver@@ sity of V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
They all want to find a cause or call@@ ing that they can th@@ row themselves into .
They &apos;re all se@@ arch@@ ing for their st@@ air@@ case .
M@@ o@@ st people long to over@@ come p@@ et@@ tin@@ ess and become part of something larg@@ er .
And this expla@@ ins the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary res@@ on@@ ance of this simple met@@ ap@@ h@@ or con@@ j@@ ured up ne@@ arly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land enti@@ re of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the ma@@ in . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the pl@@ eas@@ ures of every@@ day life .
But I want to be@@ gin with a story of an un@@ us@@ ual and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ man@@ n G@@ o@@ ering .
"@@ G@@ o@@ ering was H@@ it@@ l@@ er &apos;s second in com@@ m@@ and in W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I , his des@@ ign@@ ated success@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ l@@ er , G@@ o@@ ering f@@ an@@ ci@@ ed h@@ im@@ self a col@@ lec@@ tor of art ."
"H@@ it@@ l@@ er had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fav@@ or@@ ite art@@ work ever .
"W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I came to an end , and G@@ o@@ ering was cap@@ tu@@ red , tri@@ ed at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely s@@ ent@@ en@@ ced to death ."
Th@@ en the A@@ l@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his col@@ lec@@ tions and found the pain@@ tin@@ gs and went after the people who s@@ old it to him .
"@@ V@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en was ch@@ arg@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself p@@ un@@ ish@@ able by death ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks into his pris@@ on s@@ ent@@ ence , v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not s@@ ell a great ma@@ ster@@ piece to that N@@ az@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it my@@ self ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now nob@@ ody beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ r@@ ing me a can@@ v@@ as and some pain@@ t , and I will pain@@ t a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I s@@ old that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ az@@ i ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the ch@@ arg@@ es of tre@@ as@@ on were dro@@ pped .
"He had a l@@ ess@@ er ch@@ arg@@ e of for@@ ger@@ y , got a year s@@ ent@@ ence and died a her@@ o to the D@@ ut@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an M@@ e@@ e@@ ger@@ en , but I want to turn now to G@@ o@@ ering , who &apos;s pic@@ tu@@ red here being inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ ted at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now G@@ o@@ ering was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ tors descri@@ bed him as an am@@ ic@@ able psych@@ op@@ ath .
He had discover@@ ed after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sh@@ oc@@ k .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The S@@ up@@ per at E@@ m@@ ma@@ us &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ ster@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ ger@@ y ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was discover@@ ed , it lo@@ st all its value and was taken away from the mus@@ e@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psych@@ olog@@ ists — why do or@@ ig@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we res@@ po@@ nd so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ olog@@ ists like V@@ ebl@@ en and W@@ ol@@ fe would arg@@ ue that the reason why we take or@@ ig@@ ins so ser@@ i@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ n@@ obs , because we &apos;re foc@@ used on stat@@ us ."
"A@@ mon@@ g other things , if you want to show off how r@@ ich you are , how power@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al than a for@@ ger@@ y because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer or@@ ig@@ in@@ als than for@@ ger@@ ies ."
"@@ that hum@@ ans are , to some ext@@ ent , natural born essenti@@ al@@ ists ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just res@@ po@@ nd to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is con@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed on our beli@@ ef@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their h@@ id@@ den nature is ."
"I want to su@@ g@@ gest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to su@@ g@@ gest that pl@@ eas@@ ure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level pl@@ eas@@ ures like art , but even the most se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly simple pl@@ eas@@ ures are af@@ fec@@ ted by our beli@@ ef@@ s about h@@ id@@ den es@@ sen@@ ces ."
So take food .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It de@@ pen@@ ds . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ ef ."
F@@ ew of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a rat or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a str@@ ang@@ ely col@@ ored piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so sur@@ pris@@ ing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it t@@ as@@ t@@ es to you will de@@ p@@ end c@@ rit@@ ically on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one demon@@ stra@@ tion of this was done with young children .
"@@ How do you make children not just be more likely to e@@ at car@@ ro@@ ts and dr@@ ink mil@@ k , but to get more pl@@ eas@@ ure from e@@ ating car@@ ro@@ ts and dr@@ in@@ king mil@@ k — to think they t@@ as@@ te better ?"
How do you get ad@@ ults to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
This was rec@@ ently done with a neuro@@ scientific tw@@ ist .
I@@ n front of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body , of course , dr@@ in@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re dr@@ in@@ king exp@@ en@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with pl@@ eas@@ ure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas t@@ ree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pl@@ eas@@ ura@@ ble , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take sex .
These are s@@ tim@@ uli I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fa@@ ir@@ ly at@@ trac@@ tive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is mal@@ e , the one on the right is f@@ em@@ ale ."
"If that beli@@ ef turns out to be mis@@ taken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disc@@ over that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ ised ver@@ sion of your son or dau@@ ghter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why spo@@ uses in happy marri@@ ages t@@ end to think that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and or wi@@ fe looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particul@@ arly dra@@ ma@@ tic example of this comes from a neuro@@ log@@ ical dis@@ order known as C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
So C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is a dis@@ order where you get a spec@@ if@@ ic del@@ us@@ ion .
"Now often , a res@@ ult of C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is tra@@ g@@ ic ."
But there &apos;s at le@@ ast one case where C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me had a happy en@@ ding .
This was rec@@ or@@ ded in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The gol@@ f cl@@ ub@@ s were ow@@ ned by J@@ o@@ h@@ n F@@ . K@@ en@@ ne@@ d@@ y and s@@ old for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a million dollars at auc@@ tion .
The b@@ ub@@ ble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars and s@@ old for s@@ ever@@ al hund@@ re@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ riv@@ ing market in the par@@ ti@@ ally e@@ at@@ en food of bel@@ ov@@ ed people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are perhaps the most val@@ u@@ able of all .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to an un@@ con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed re@@ port , a S@@ au@@ di mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e of@@ fer@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones th@@ ro@@ wn at G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h at an I@@ ra@@ q@@ i pres@@ s con@@ fer@@ ence s@@ ever@@ al years ago .
"W@@ ith my colle@@ ag@@ ues G@@ e@@ or@@ ge N@@ e@@ w@@ man and G@@ il D@@ i@@ es@@ en@@ dr@@ uc@@ k , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the ob@@ jects that people like ."
"So in one of our experim@@ ents , we asked people to name a f@@ amo@@ us person who they ad@@ ored , a living person they ad@@ ored ."
So one answer was G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you pa@@ y for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s s@@ we@@ ater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fa@@ ir amount — more than you would pa@@ y for a br@@ and new s@@ we@@ ater or a s@@ we@@ ater ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other gro@@ ups of sub@@ jects — we gave them different re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions and different con@@ dit@@ ions .
"So for inst@@ ance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , you can buy the s@@ we@@ ater , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t res@@ ell it . &quot; &quot; That dro@@ ps the value of it , su@@ g@@ ges@@ ting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really ca@@ uses an ef@@ fect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , you could res@@ ell it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly wa@@ shed . &quot; &quot; That ca@@ uses a huge dro@@ p in the value ."
"As my wi@@ fe put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve wa@@ shed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ ot@@ ies . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ plic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ nob and want to bo@@ ast about having an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ."
Wh@@ o here lik@@ es the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ loc@@ k ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then re@@ port@@ ed that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on tel@@ ev@@ ision , the value of her art dro@@ pped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physic@@ ally , but the history had changed ."
So he got J@@ o@@ shu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million doll@@ ar viol@@ in down to a W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ ef cli@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ ol@@ in mus@@ ic ) A@@ f@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"@@ Ap@@ par@@ ently to really en@@ jo@@ y the mus@@ ic of J@@ o@@ shu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re list@@ en@@ ing to J@@ o@@ shu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s st@@ anding in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s struc@@ k with p@@ ity .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and hands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from mus@@ ic is from J@@ o@@ h@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ n@@ ist com@@ position , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iT@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a doll@@ ar 9@@ 9 , you can list@@ en to that sil@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of sil@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about pl@@ eas@@ ure , but what I want to su@@ g@@ gest is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ li@@ es as well to pa@@ in ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experien@@ cing , your beli@@ ef@@ s about the ess@@ ence of it , af@@ fect how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lo@@ vely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ ra@@ y and D@@ an W@@ e@@ gn@@ er .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful elec@@ tri@@ c sh@@ oc@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sh@@ oc@@ ks .
"The second sh@@ oc@@ k fe@@ els less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The third dro@@ ps , the f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pa@@ in gets less .
"In the other con@@ d@@ ition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sh@@ oc@@ king them on pur@@ pose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sh@@ oc@@ king them ."
The first sh@@ oc@@ k h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sh@@ oc@@ k h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the third and the f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some cas@@ es , pa@@ in under the right cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces can trans@@ form into pl@@ eas@@ ure ."
"The point was n@@ ic@@ ely sum@@ mar@@ ized by the po@@ et J@@ o@@ h@@ n M@@ il@@ ton who w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ aven of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ aven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause ) ( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause ) ( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) H@@ er@@ bi@@ e H@@ an@@ co@@ c@@ k : Thank you .
Mar@@ c@@ us M@@ ill@@ er . ( Applause ) H@@ ar@@ v@@ ey M@@ as@@ on . ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
"S@@ ome@@ one once said that polit@@ ics is , of course , &quot; &quot; sho@@ w@@ bi@@ z for u@@ g@@ ly people . &quot; &quot; So , on that bas@@ is , I feel like I &apos;ve really ar@@ riv@@ ed ."
"The other thing to think of is what an h@@ on@@ or it is , as a polit@@ ician , to give a TE@@ D talk , particul@@ arly here in the U.@@ K@@ . , where the re@@ put@@ ation of polit@@ ics , with the exp@@ en@@ ses sc@@ an@@ da@@ l , has sun@@ k so low ."
There was even a story rec@@ ently that scient@@ ists had thought about actually re@@ plac@@ ing ra@@ ts in their experim@@ ents with polit@@ ici@@ ans .
"And someone asked , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s no shor@@ t@@ age of polit@@ ici@@ ans , no one really min@@ ds what happens to them and , after all , there are some things that ra@@ ts just won &apos;t do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I know you all love data , so I &apos;m starting with a da@@ ta@@ -@@ r@@ ich sl@@ ide ."
"This , I think , is the most important fact to be@@ ar in mind in Brit@@ ish polit@@ ics or American polit@@ ics , and that is : We have run out of money ."
We have v@@ ast b@@ ud@@ get de@@ fic@@ its .
"This is my global public d@@ ebt c@@ loc@@ k , and , as you can see , it &apos;s 3@@ 2 tr@@ il@@ lion and coun@@ ting ."
"And I think what this lead@@ s to is a very simple reco@@ gn@@ ition , that there &apos;s one question in polit@@ ics at the moment ab@@ ove all other , and it &apos;s this one : How do we make things better without sp@@ en@@ ding more money ?"
"Because there isn &apos;t going to be a lot of money to impro@@ ve public ser@@ vic@@ es , or to impro@@ ve government , or to impro@@ ve so many of the things that polit@@ ici@@ ans talk about ."
"So what fol@@ lo@@ ws from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money — you can only measure success in public ser@@ vic@@ es in health care and education and pol@@ ic@@ ing by sp@@ en@@ ding more money , you can only measure progress by sp@@ en@@ ding money — you &apos;re going to have a pretty mis@@ er@@ able time ."
"But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that le@@ ad up to well being — things like your family relation@@ shi@@ ps , fri@@ end@@ ship , commun@@ ity , val@@ ues — then , actually , this is an incredi@@ bly exc@@ iting time to be in polit@@ ics ."
"And the really simple argum@@ ent I want to make t@@ on@@ ight , the really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward argum@@ ent is this : That if we com@@ b@@ ine the right political philosoph@@ y , the right political thinking , with the incredi@@ ble information revolu@@ tion that has taken place , and that all of you know so much more about than I do , I think there &apos;s an incredi@@ ble opportun@@ ity to actually re@@ make polit@@ ics , re@@ make government , re@@ make public ser@@ vic@@ es , and achi@@ eve what &apos;s up on that sl@@ ide , which is a big increase in our well-@@ being ."
That &apos;s the argum@@ ent I want to make t@@ on@@ ight .
"So , starting with the political philosoph@@ y ."
Now I &apos;m not saying for a min@@ ute that Brit@@ ish Con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves have all the ans@@ w@@ ers .
O@@ f course we don &apos;t .
But there are two things at heart that I think dr@@ ive a con@@ serv@@ ative philosoph@@ y that are really rel@@ ev@@ ant to this whole deb@@ ate .
"The first is this : We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives , if you give people more cho@@ ice , if you put them in the driv@@ ing se@@ at , then actually , you can create a st@@ ron@@ ger and better society ."
"And if you mar@@ ry this fact with the incredi@@ ble ab@@ und@@ ance of information that we have in our world today , I think you can completely , as I &apos;ve said , re@@ make polit@@ ics , re@@ make government , re@@ make your public ser@@ vic@@ es ."
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the gra@@ in of human nature .
"P@@ ol@@ it@@ ics and polit@@ ici@@ ans will only suc@@ ce@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be ."
"Now , if you com@@ b@@ ine this very simple , very con@@ serv@@ ative thought — go with the gra@@ in of human nature — with all the adv@@ an@@ ces in behav@@ io@@ ral econom@@ ics , some of which we were just he@@ aring about , again , I think we can achi@@ eve a real increase in well-@@ being , in happiness , in a st@@ ron@@ ger society without nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily having to sp@@ end a whole lot more money ."
"Now , why do I think now is the moment to make this argum@@ ent ?"
"Well , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re going to suf@@ fer a shor@@ t , con@@ den@@ sed history les@@ son about what I would say are the three pas@@ sa@@ g@@ es of history : the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age , the bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age and what we now live in , which I think is a pos@@ t-@@ bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age ."
"A sim@@ pl@@ er way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of loc@@ al control , then we went to a world of cent@@ ral control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control ."
"@@ L@@ oc@@ al power , cent@@ ral power , now , people power ."
"Now , here is K@@ ing C@@ n@@ ut , king a thou@@ s@@ and years ago ."
Th@@ ou@@ ght he could turn back the w@@ aves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the w@@ aves .
"C@@ ouldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thou@@ s@@ and years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to tr@@ aver@@ se your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in ch@@ arg@@ e of ."
"You wer@@ en &apos;t in ch@@ arg@@ e of pol@@ ic@@ ing , j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , education , health , wel@@ f@@ are ."
You could just about go to war and that was about it .
"This was the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age , an age in which everything had to be loc@@ al ."
You had to have loc@@ al control because there was no na@@ tion@@ all@@ y-@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able information because tr@@ av@@ el was so re@@ str@@ ic@@ ted .
So this was the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age .
"@@ N@@ ex@@ t part of the c@@ old history les@@ son , the lo@@ vely picture of the Brit@@ ish In@@ d@@ ust@@ ri@@ al R@@ evolution ."
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , all sor@@ ts of trans@@ port , tr@@ av@@ el information were possible , and this gave bir@@ th to , what I like to call , the bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age ."
And h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly this sl@@ ide is going to mor@@ p@@ h beauti@@ fully . There we are .
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly , you have the big , st@@ rong , cent@@ ral state ."
"It was able — but only it was able — to organ@@ ize health care , education , pol@@ ic@@ ing , j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce ."
"And it was a world of , as I say , not loc@@ al power , but now cent@@ ral power ."
It had suc@@ ked all that power up from the loc@@ alit@@ ies .
It was able to do that itself .
"The next great stage , which all of you are so famil@@ i@@ ar with : the massive information revolu@@ tion ."
"@@ Just consid@@ er this one fact : One hundred years ago , sen@@ ding these 10 words cost 50 dollars ."
"R@@ ight now , here we are lin@@ ked up to L@@ ong B@@ each and every@@ where else , and all these sec@@ ret loc@@ ations for a fra@@ c@@ tion of that cost , and we can sen@@ d and re@@ ce@@ ive huge quan@@ tit@@ ies of information without it co@@ st@@ ing anything ."
"So we &apos;re now living in a pos@@ t-@@ bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic age , where gen@@ u@@ ine people power is possible ."
"Now , what does this mean for our polit@@ ics , for our public ser@@ vic@@ es , for our government ?"
"Well I can &apos;t , in the time I &apos;ve got , give huge numbers of exam@@ pl@@ es , but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change ."
"And this is so ob@@ vi@@ ous , in a way , because you think about how all of you have changed the way we sho@@ p , the way we tr@@ av@@ el , the way that business is done ."
"That is already happened ; the information and In@@ tern@@ et revolu@@ tion has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t , in every way , yet tou@@ ched our government ."
"So , how could this happen ?"
"Well , I think there are three ch@@ i@@ ef ways that it should make an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us difference : in trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , in gre@@ ater cho@@ ice and in ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability , in giving us that gen@@ u@@ ine people power ."
"If we take trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , here is one of my fav@@ or@@ ite w@@ eb@@ sit@@ es , the M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ ri A@@ c@@ coun@@ t@@ ability P@@ or@@ t@@ al ."
"In the old days , only the government could hold the information , and only a few elec@@ ted people could try and gra@@ b that information and question it and challenge it ."
"Now here , on one w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite , one state in America , every single doll@@ ar sp@@ ent by that government is se@@ arch@@ able , is anal@@ y@@ z@@ able , is ch@@ ec@@ k@@ able ."
Th@@ ink of the huge change that means : An@@ y business that wan@@ ts to b@@ id for a government con@@ trac@@ t can see what curr@@ ently is being sp@@ ent .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one thinking , &quot; &quot; I could do that ser@@ vic@@ e better , I could del@@ iv@@ er it che@@ aper , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all av@@ a@@ il@@ able there ."
"We have only , in government and in polit@@ ics , started to sc@@ rat@@ ch the sur@@ face of what people are doing in the com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al world with the information revolu@@ tion ."
"So , complet@@ e trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy will make a huge difference ."
"In this country , if we w@@ in the elec@@ tion , we are going to make all government sp@@ en@@ ding over 2@@ 5@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds trans@@ par@@ ent and av@@ a@@ il@@ able on@@ line , se@@ arch@@ able for any@@ one to see ."
"We &apos;re going to make every con@@ trac@@ t — we &apos;re an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing this today — av@@ a@@ il@@ able on the In@@ tern@@ et so any@@ one can see what the terms are , what the con@@ dit@@ ions are , driv@@ ing huge value for money , but also huge increas@@ es , I believe , in well-@@ being as well ."
"C@@ ho@@ ice . Now you all sho@@ p on@@ line , comp@@ are on@@ line , do everything on@@ line , and yet this revolu@@ tion has har@@ d@@ ly tou@@ ched the sur@@ face of public ser@@ vic@@ es like education , or health care or pol@@ ic@@ ing , and you &apos;re going to see this change mas@@ si@@ vely ."
"We should be making this change with the information revolu@@ tion in our country , with se@@ arch@@ able health sit@@ es , so you can see what oper@@ ations work out pro@@ per@@ ly , what rec@@ or@@ ds doc@@ tors have , the c@@ le@@ an@@ l@@ iness of ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , who does best at in@@ fec@@ tion control — all of the information that would once be loc@@ ked in the D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of H@@ e@@ al@@ th is now av@@ a@@ il@@ able for all of us to see ."
And the third of these big changes : ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability .
"This , I think , is a huge change ."
It is a cri@@ me map . This is a cri@@ me map from Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
"So , instead of having a sit@@ u@@ ation where only the pol@@ ice have the information about which cri@@ m@@ es are com@@ mit@@ ted where , and we have to emp@@ lo@@ y people in government to try and hold the pol@@ ice to ac@@ coun@@ t , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , we &apos;ve got this v@@ ast opportun@@ ity for people power , where we , as c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , can see what cri@@ m@@ es are being com@@ mit@@ ted — where , when and by wh@@ om — and we can hold the pol@@ ice to ac@@ coun@@ t ."
"And you can see this looks a bit like a che@@ f &apos;s h@@ at , but actually that &apos;s an as@@ sa@@ ult , the one in bl@@ ue ."
"You can see what cri@@ me is com@@ mit@@ ted where , and you have the opportun@@ ity to hold your pol@@ ice force to ac@@ coun@@ t ."
"So those three ways — trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy , ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability and cho@@ ice — will make a huge difference ."
"Now I also said the other princi@@ ple that I think we should work on is understanding of people , is reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing that going with the gra@@ in of human nature you can achi@@ eve so much more ."
"Now , we &apos;re got a huge revolu@@ tion in understanding of why people be@@ have in the way that they do , and a great opportun@@ ity to put that knowledge and information to gre@@ ater use ."
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
"We &apos;re being ad@@ vis@@ ed by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book ."
"@@ Let me just give you one example that I think is incredi@@ bly simple , and I love ."
We want to get people to be more energy ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent .
"Wh@@ y ? It c@@ ut@@ s fu@@ el pov@@ ert@@ y , it c@@ ut@@ s their bil@@ ls , and it c@@ ut@@ s car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions at the same time ."
How do you do it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve had government information cam@@ pa@@ ign@@ s over the years when they tell you to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch off the ligh@@ ts when you leave the home ."
We even had — one government min@@ is@@ ter once told us to br@@ us@@ h our te@@ et@@ h in the dark .
I don &apos;t think they las@@ ted very long .
L@@ o@@ ok at what this does . This is a simple piece of behav@@ io@@ ral econom@@ ics .
"The best way to get someone to c@@ ut their elec@@ tric@@ ity b@@ ill is to show them their own sp@@ en@@ ding , to show them what their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors are sp@@ en@@ ding , and then show what an energy consci@@ ous ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or is sp@@ en@@ ding ."
That sort of behav@@ io@@ ral econom@@ ics can trans@@ form people &apos;s behavior in a way that all the b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying and all the information and all the b@@ adg@@ ering from a government cannot possi@@ bly achi@@ eve .
O@@ ther exam@@ pl@@ es are rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
We all know we need to rec@@ y@@ cle more .
How do we make it happen ?
"A@@ ll the pro@@ of from America is that actually , if you pa@@ y people to rec@@ y@@ cle , if you give them a car@@ rot rather than a s@@ tic@@ k , you can trans@@ form their behavior ."
So what does all this ad@@ d up to ?
Here are my two fav@@ or@@ ite U.@@ S@@ . spe@@ e@@ ch@@ es of the last 50 years .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , here we have J@@ F@@ K with that incredi@@ bly simple and power@@ ful form@@ ul@@ ation , &quot; A@@ s@@ k not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredi@@ bly nob@@ le senti@@ ment ."
"But when he made that spe@@ ec@@ h , what could you do to build the st@@ ron@@ ger , better society ?"
"You could fi@@ ght for your country , you could die for your country , you could ser@@ ve in your country &apos;s civ@@ il ser@@ vic@@ e , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the st@@ ron@@ ger society in the way that you do now ."
"And I think an even more wonderful spe@@ ec@@ h , which I &apos;m going to read a big ch@@ un@@ k of , which su@@ ms up what I said at the beginning about beli@@ ev@@ ing there is more to life than money , and more that we should try and measure than money ."
"And it is R@@ ob@@ ert K@@ en@@ ne@@ d@@ y &apos;s beautiful descri@@ p@@ tion of why gro@@ ss national produc@@ t cap@@ tures so little : It &quot; &quot; does not al@@ low for the health of our children , the qu@@ ality of their education , or the jo@@ y of their play ."
"It does not incl@@ u@@ de the be@@ aut@@ y of our po@@ et@@ ry or the str@@ eng@@ th of our marri@@ ages , the intelligence of our public deb@@ ate ."
"It meas@@ ures nei@@ ther our w@@ it n@@ or our cou@@ ra@@ ge , nei@@ ther our w@@ is@@ dom n@@ or our learning , nei@@ ther our com@@ passion n@@ or our dev@@ ot@@ ion to our country ."
"It meas@@ ures everything , in shor@@ t , ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; A@@ ga@@ in , a senti@@ ment that was so nob@@ le and beauti@@ fully put 40 years ago , and a beautiful dre@@ am 40 years ago , but now with the huge adv@@ an@@ ces in information technology , with the massive changes in behav@@ io@@ ral econom@@ ics , with all that we know about how you adv@@ ance well-@@ being , that if we com@@ b@@ ine those in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts of giving power to people , and using information to make that possible , and using the in@@ sight of going with the gra@@ in of human nature , while at the same time , understanding why people be@@ have in the way they do ,"
it is a dre@@ am more easy to real@@ ize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful spe@@ ec@@ h 40 years ago .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
It &apos;s an In@@ dian story about an In@@ dian woman and her j@@ our@@ ney .
Let me be@@ gin with my parents .
I &apos;m a produc@@ t of this vis@@ ion@@ ary mother and father .
"M@@ any years ago , when I was born in the &apos; 5@@ 0s — &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s didn &apos;t bel@@ ong to girls in India ."
They bel@@ on@@ g@@ ed to bo@@ ys .
"They bel@@ on@@ g@@ ed to bo@@ ys who would jo@@ in business and in@@ her@@ it business from parents , and girls would be dol@@ led up to get marri@@ ed ."
"M@@ y family , in my c@@ ity , and almost in the country , was un@@ i@@ qu@@ e ."
"We were four of us , not one , and for@@ tun@@ ately no bo@@ ys ."
We were four girls and no bo@@ ys .
And my parents were part of a l@@ and@@ ed pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y family .
"M@@ y father de@@ fied his own grand@@ father , almost to the point of dis@@ in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , because he decided to educ@@ ate all four of us ."
He s@@ ent us to one of the best scho@@ ols in the c@@ ity and gave us the best education .
"As I &apos;ve said , when we &apos;re born , we don &apos;t cho@@ ose our parents , and when we go to school , we don &apos;t cho@@ ose our school ."
Ch@@ il@@ dren don &apos;t cho@@ ose a school .
They just get the school which parents cho@@ ose for them .
So this is the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion time which I got .
"I gre@@ w up like this , and so did my other three sis@@ ters ."
"And my father used to say at that time , &quot; I &apos;m going to sp@@ read all my four dau@@ gh@@ ters in four cor@@ n@@ ers of the world . &quot;"
"I don &apos;t know if he really me@@ ant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened ."
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
"One is a Brit@@ ish , another is an American and the third is a C@@ an@@ a@@ dian ."
So we are four of us in four cor@@ n@@ ers of the world .
"And since I said they &apos;re my ro@@ le mod@@ els , I fol@@ lowed two things which my father and mother gave me ."
"One , they said , &quot; &quot; L@@ i@@ fe is on an incl@@ ine ."
"You ei@@ ther go up , or you come down . &quot; &quot; And the second thing , which has st@@ ay@@ ed with me , which bec@@ ame my philosoph@@ y of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad ."
"O@@ ut of 100 , 90 are your cre@@ ation ."
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your cre@@ ation . En@@ jo@@ y it .
"If they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your cre@@ ation . L@@ ear@@ n from it ."
T@@ en are nat@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ s@@ ent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
"It &apos;s like a death of a rel@@ ative , or a c@@ y@@ cl@@ one , or a h@@ ur@@ ric@@ ane , or an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just res@@ po@@ nd to the sit@@ u@@ ation .
But that respon@@ se comes out of those 90 poin@@ ts .
"S@@ in@@ ce I &apos;m a produc@@ t of this philosoph@@ y , of 90 / 10 , and secon@@ d@@ ly , &quot; &quot; life on an incl@@ ine , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the way I gre@@ w up to be val@@ u@@ ing what I got ."
"I &apos;m a produc@@ t of opportun@@ ities , r@@ are opportun@@ ities in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and the &apos; 6@@ 0s , which girls didn &apos;t get , and I was consci@@ ous of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something un@@ i@@ qu@@ e ."
"Because all of my best school friends were getting dol@@ led up to get marri@@ ed with a lot of do@@ w@@ ry , and here I was with a ten@@ nis ra@@ c@@ k@@ et and going to school and doing all kinds of ex@@ tra@@ cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ ar acti@@ vit@@ ies ."
I thought I must tell you this .
"Wh@@ y I said this , is the bac@@ k@@ ground ."
This is what comes next .
"I jo@@ ined the In@@ dian P@@ ol@@ ice S@@ er@@ vic@@ e as a t@@ ough woman , a woman with inde@@ f@@ ati@@ ga@@ ble st@@ am@@ ina , because I used to run for my ten@@ nis tit@@ les , et@@ c ."
"But I jo@@ ined the In@@ dian P@@ ol@@ ice S@@ er@@ vic@@ e , and then it was a new pat@@ tern of pol@@ ic@@ ing ."
"For me the pol@@ ic@@ ing st@@ ood for power to cor@@ rec@@ t , power to pre@@ v@@ ent and power to det@@ ect ."
This is something like a new defin@@ ition ever given in pol@@ ic@@ ing in India — the power to pre@@ v@@ ent .
"Because nor@@ m@@ ally it was always said , power to det@@ ect , and that &apos;s it , or power to p@@ un@@ ish ."
"But I decided no , it &apos;s a power to pre@@ v@@ ent , because that &apos;s what I learned when I was gro@@ wing up ."
How do I pre@@ v@@ ent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
"So this was how it came into my ser@@ vic@@ e , and it was different from the men ."
"I didn &apos;t want to make it different from the men , but it was different , because this was the way I was different ."
And I re@@ defin@@ ed pol@@ ic@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts in India .
"I &apos;m going to take you on two j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys , my pol@@ ic@@ ing j@@ our@@ ney and my pris@@ on j@@ our@@ ney ."
"What you see , if you see the tit@@ le called &quot; &quot; P@@ M &apos;s c@@ ar hel@@ d . &quot; &quot; This was the first time a pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter of India was given a par@@ king tic@@ k@@ et ."
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time in India , and I can tell you , that &apos;s the last time you &apos;re he@@ aring about it ."
"It &apos;ll never happen again in India , because now it was once and for@@ ever ."
"And the rul@@ e was , because I was sen@@ sit@@ ive , I was com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate , I was very sen@@ sit@@ ive to in@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , and I was very pro@@ -@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce ."
"That &apos;s the reason , as a woman , I jo@@ ined the In@@ dian P@@ ol@@ ice S@@ er@@ vic@@ e ."
"I had other op@@ tions , but I didn &apos;t cho@@ ose them ."
So I &apos;m going to move on .
"This is about t@@ ough pol@@ ic@@ ing , equ@@ al pol@@ ic@@ ing ."
"Now I was known as &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to list@@ en . &quot; &quot; So I was s@@ ent to all in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ate pos@@ tin@@ gs , pos@@ tin@@ gs which others would say no ."
I now went to a pris@@ on as@@ sign@@ ment as a pol@@ ice of@@ fic@@ er .
Nor@@ m@@ ally pol@@ ice of@@ fic@@ ers don &apos;t want to do pris@@ on .
"They s@@ ent me to pris@@ on to loc@@ k me up , thinking , &quot; &quot; Now there will be no c@@ ars and no V@@ I@@ P@@ s to be given tic@@ ket@@ s to ."
Let &apos;s loc@@ k her up . &quot; &quot; Here I got a pris@@ on as@@ sign@@ ment .
This was a pris@@ on as@@ sign@@ ment which was one big den of cri@@ min@@ als .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , it was ."
"But 1@@ 0,000 men , of which only 4@@ 00 were women — 1@@ 0,000 — 9@@ ,000 pl@@ us about 6@@ 00 were men ."
"@@ Ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ ts , ra@@ p@@ ists , bur@@ gl@@ ars , gan@@ g@@ st@@ ers — some of them I &apos;d s@@ ent to j@@ a@@ il as a pol@@ ice of@@ fic@@ er outside ."
And then how did I de@@ al with them ?
"The first day when I went in , I didn &apos;t know how to look at them ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I looked at the group , I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot; They saw me as a young , shor@@ t woman we@@ aring a pa@@ than su@@ it . I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot;"
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pra@@ y ? Do you want to pra@@ y ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; All right , let &apos;s pra@@ y . &quot; &quot; I pra@@ yed for them , and things started to change ."
This is a vis@@ ual of education inside the pris@@ on .
"F@@ ri@@ ends , this has never happened , where everybody in the pris@@ on studies ."
I started this with commun@@ ity sup@@ port .
G@@ over@@ n@@ ment had no b@@ ud@@ get .
"It was one of the fin@@ est , larg@@ est vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ism in any pris@@ on in the world ."
This was in@@ it@@ i@@ ated in D@@ el@@ h@@ i pris@@ on .
You see one sam@@ ple of a pris@@ on@@ er teach@@ ing a class .
These are hund@@ re@@ ds of clas@@ ses .
"@@ N@@ ine to el@@ even , every pris@@ on@@ er went into the education program — the same den in which they thought they would put me be@@ h@@ ind the b@@ ar and things would be for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten ."
We con@@ v@@ ert@@ ed this into an ash@@ ram — from a pris@@ on to an ash@@ ram through education .
I think that &apos;s the big@@ ger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
Te@@ ach@@ ers were pris@@ on@@ ers . Te@@ ach@@ ers were vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers .
B@@ o@@ o@@ ks came from don@@ ated scho@@ ol@@ bo@@ o@@ ks .
St@@ ation@@ er@@ y was don@@ ated .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing was don@@ ated , because there was no b@@ ud@@ get of education for the pris@@ on ."
"Now if I &apos;d not done that , it would have been a hel@@ l@@ hole ."
That &apos;s the second l@@ and@@ mar@@ k .
"I want to show you some mo@@ ments of history in my j@@ our@@ ney , which probably you would never ever get to see any@@ where in the world ."
"One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , this con@@ cept ."
"This was a me@@ dit@@ ation program inside the pris@@ on of over 1@@ ,000 pris@@ on@@ ers ."
One thou@@ s@@ and pris@@ on@@ ers who sa@@ t in me@@ dit@@ ation .
This was one of the most cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous ste@@ ps I took as a pris@@ on govern@@ or .
And this is what trans@@ form@@ ed .
"You want to know more about this , go and see this fil@@ m , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ing T@@ ime , D@@ o@@ ing V@@ i@@ pas@@ san@@ a . &quot; &quot; You will hear about it , and you will love it ."
"And write to me on K@@ ir@@ an@@ B@@ e@@ di@@ .@@ co@@ m , and I &apos;ll res@@ po@@ nd to you ."
Let me show you the next sl@@ ide .
"I took the same con@@ cept of min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , because , why did I bring me@@ dit@@ ation into the In@@ dian pris@@ on ?"
Because cri@@ me is a produc@@ t of a dis@@ t@@ or@@ ted mind .
It was dis@@ t@@ or@@ tion of mind which needed to be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed to control .
"@@ Not by pre@@ ach@@ ing , not by telling , not by read@@ ing , but by ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing your mind ."
"I took the same thing to the pol@@ ice , because pol@@ ice , equ@@ ally , were pris@@ on@@ ers of their min@@ ds , and they fel@@ t as if it was &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; they , &quot; &quot; and that the people don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate ."
This worked .
This is a fe@@ ed@@ back bo@@ x called a p@@ et@@ ition bo@@ x .
"This is a con@@ cept which I in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to list@@ en to com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts , list@@ en to g@@ ri@@ ev@@ an@@ ces ."
This was a mag@@ ic bo@@ x .
This was a sen@@ sit@@ ive bo@@ x .
This is how a pris@@ on@@ er dre@@ w how they fel@@ t about the pris@@ on .
"If you see somebody in the bl@@ ue — ye@@ ah , this guy — he was a pris@@ on@@ er , and he was a teacher ."
"And you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . There was no time to was@@ te ."
Let me w@@ ra@@ p it up .
"I &apos;m curr@@ ently into mov@@ em@@ ents , mov@@ em@@ ents of education of the under@@ -@@ serv@@ ed children , which is thousands — India is all about thousands ."
S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly is about the an@@ ti@@ -@@ cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion mov@@ ement in India .
"That &apos;s a big way we , as a small group of acti@@ vis@@ ts , have d@@ raf@@ ted an om@@ b@@ ud@@ s@@ man b@@ ill for the government of India ."
"F@@ ri@@ ends , you will hear a lot about it ."
"That &apos;s the mov@@ ement at the moment I &apos;m driv@@ ing , and that &apos;s the mov@@ ement and amb@@ ition of my life ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
R@@ ight now you have a movi@@ e pla@@ ying inside your head .
It &apos;s an amazing mul@@ ti@@ -@@ trac@@ k movi@@ e .
"It has 3@@ D vis@@ ion and sur@@ ro@@ und sound for what you &apos;re seeing and he@@ aring right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it ."
Y@@ our movi@@ e has sm@@ ell and t@@ as@@ te and tou@@ ch .
"It has a sense of your body , pa@@ in , h@@ un@@ ger , or@@ ga@@ s@@ ms ."
"It has emo@@ tions , an@@ ger and happiness ."
"It has me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es , like scen@@ es from your chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od pla@@ ying before you ."
And it has this con@@ st@@ ant vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over nar@@ ra@@ tive in your stre@@ am of consci@@ ous thinking .
A@@ t the heart of this movi@@ e is you experien@@ cing all this direc@@ tly .
"This movi@@ e is your stre@@ am of consciousness , the sub@@ ject of experience of the mind and the world ."
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is one of the fundamental fac@@ ts of human ex@@ ist@@ ence .
E@@ ach of us is consci@@ ous .
"We all have our own in@@ ner movi@@ e , you and you and you ."
There &apos;s nothing we know about more direc@@ tly .
"A@@ t le@@ ast , I know about my consciousness direc@@ tly ."
I can &apos;t be certain that you gu@@ ys are consci@@ ous .
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness also is what makes life wor@@ th living .
"If we wer@@ en &apos;t consci@@ ous , nothing in our lives would have mean@@ ing or value ."
"But at the same time , it &apos;s the most my@@ ster@@ ious ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on in the universe ."
Why are we consci@@ ous ?
Why do we have these in@@ ner movi@@ es ?
"Wh@@ y ar@@ en &apos;t we just rob@@ ots who process all this in@@ put , produc@@ e all that ou@@ t@@ put , without experien@@ cing the in@@ ner movi@@ e at all ?"
"R@@ ight now , nob@@ ody kno@@ ws the ans@@ w@@ ers to those questions ."
"I &apos;m going to su@@ g@@ gest that to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te consciousness into science , some rad@@ ical ideas may be needed ."
S@@ ome people say a science of consciousness is im@@ possible .
"S@@ ci@@ ence , by its nature , is ob@@ jec@@ tive ."
"C@@ on@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , by its nature , is sub@@ jec@@ tive ."
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
"For much of the 20@@ th century , that view hel@@ d s@@ way ."
"P@@ sych@@ olog@@ ists stu@@ died behavior ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , neuro@@ scient@@ ists stu@@ died the brain ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , and nob@@ ody even men@@ tion@@ ed consciousness ."
"E@@ ven 30 years ago , when TE@@ D got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness ."
"Now , about 20 years ago , all that be@@ gan to change ."
N@@ e@@ u@@ ro@@ scient@@ ists like F@@ ran@@ c@@ is C@@ ric@@ k and physic@@ ists like R@@ o@@ ger P@@ en@@ ro@@ se said now is the time for science to att@@ ack consciousness .
"And since then , there &apos;s been a real explo@@ sion , a f@@ low@@ ering of scientific work on consciousness ."
And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .
But it also has some fundamental li@@ mit@@ ations so far .
"The cen@@ ter@@ piece of the science of consciousness in rec@@ ent years has been the se@@ arch for cor@@ rel@@ ations , cor@@ rel@@ ations between certain are@@ as of the brain and certain st@@ ates of consciousness ."
We saw some of this kind of work from N@@ an@@ cy K@@ an@@ wi@@ sh@@ er and the wonderful work she pres@@ ented just a few minutes ago .
"Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain are@@ as that go along with the consci@@ ous experience of seeing fac@@ es or of feel@@ ing pa@@ in or of feel@@ ing happy ."
But this is still a science of cor@@ rel@@ ations .
It &apos;s not a science of ex@@ plan@@ ations .
"We know that these brain are@@ as go along with certain kinds of consci@@ ous experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do ."
"I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuro@@ science is ans@@ wer@@ ing some of the questions we want ans@@ wer@@ ed about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain are@@ as do and what they cor@@ rel@@ ate with ."
"But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems ."
No kno@@ c@@ k on the neuro@@ scient@@ ists .
There are no tr@@ ul@@ y easy problems with consciousness .
Why is there this in@@ ner sub@@ jec@@ tive movi@@ e ?
"R@@ ight now , we don &apos;t really have a be@@ ad on that ."
"And you might say , let &apos;s just give neuro@@ science a few years ."
"It &apos;ll turn out to be another em@@ er@@ gent ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on like tra@@ f@@ fic j@@ ams , like h@@ ur@@ ric@@ an@@ es , like life , and we &apos;ll figure it out ."
"Now , I &apos;m a scientific mater@@ i@@ al@@ ist at heart ."
"I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I ban@@ g@@ ed my head against the w@@ all looking for a theory of consciousness in pur@@ ely physical terms that would work ."
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of im@@ pas@@ se here .
"We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great cha@@ in of ex@@ plan@@ ation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics expla@@ ins chem@@ is@@ try , chem@@ is@@ try expla@@ ins bi@@ ology , bi@@ ology expla@@ ins parts of psych@@ ology ."
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to f@@ it into this picture .
"O@@ n the one hand , it &apos;s a da@@ tum that we &apos;re consci@@ ous ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ te it into our scientific view of the world ."
"So I think consciousness right now is a kind of an@@ om@@ al@@ y , one that we need to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te into our view of the world , but we don &apos;t yet see how ."
"F@@ ac@@ ed with an an@@ om@@ al@@ y like this , rad@@ ical ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that in@@ it@@ i@@ ally seem crazy before we can come to g@@ ri@@ ps with consciousness scienti@@ fic@@ ally ."
"Now , there are a few can@@ di@@ da@@ t@@ es for what those crazy ideas might be ."
"M@@ y fri@@ end D@@ an D@@ en@@ n@@ et@@ t , who &apos;s here today , has one ."
H@@ is crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
The whole idea of the in@@ ner sub@@ jec@@ tive movi@@ e inv@@ ol@@ ves a kind of ill@@ us@@ ion or con@@ f@@ us@@ ion .
"A@@ c@@ tually , all we &apos;ve got to do is explain the ob@@ jec@@ tive func@@ tions , the behav@@ i@@ ors of the brain , and then we &apos;ve expla@@ ined everything that needs to be expla@@ ined ."
"Well I say , more power to him ."
That &apos;s the kind of rad@@ ical idea that we need to ex@@ pl@@ ore if you want to have a pur@@ ely reduc@@ tion@@ ist bra@@ in@@ -@@ bas@@ ed theory of consciousness .
"A@@ t the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too clo@@ se to simply den@@ ying the da@@ tum of consciousness to be sat@@ is@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"In the time re@@ main@@ ing , I want to ex@@ pl@@ ore two crazy ideas that I think may have some prom@@ ise ."
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
P@@ h@@ ysic@@ ists sometimes take some as@@ pec@@ ts of the universe as fundamental building bloc@@ ks : space and time and mass .
"They pos@@ tul@@ ate fundamental laws gover@@ ning them , like the laws of grav@@ ity or of quan@@ tum me@@ chan@@ ics ."
These fundamental pro@@ per@@ ties and laws ar@@ en &apos;t expla@@ ined in terms of anything more bas@@ ic .
"R@@ a@@ ther , they &apos;re taken as pri@@ mit@@ ive , and you build up the world from there ."
"Now sometimes , the l@@ ist of fundam@@ ent@@ als ex@@ pan@@ ds ."
"In the 19@@ th century , M@@ ax@@ well fig@@ ured out that you can &apos;t explain elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena in terms of the ex@@ is@@ ting fundam@@ ent@@ als — space , time , mass , N@@ e@@ w@@ ton &apos;s laws — so he pos@@ tul@@ ated fundamental laws of elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism and pos@@ tul@@ ated elec@@ tri@@ c ch@@ arg@@ e as a fundamental el@@ ement that those laws gover@@ n ."
I think that &apos;s the sit@@ u@@ ation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
"If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the ex@@ is@@ ting fundam@@ ent@@ als — space , time , mass , ch@@ arg@@ e — then as a matter of log@@ ic , you need to exp@@ and the l@@ ist ."
"The natural thing to do is to pos@@ tul@@ ate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building bloc@@ k of nature ."
This doesn &apos;t mean you su@@ d@@ den@@ ly can &apos;t do science with it .
This op@@ ens up the way for you to do science with it .
"What we then need is to study the fundamental laws gover@@ ning consciousness , the laws that con@@ n@@ ect consciousness to other fundam@@ ent@@ als : space , time , mass , physical proc@@ ess@@ es ."
P@@ h@@ ysic@@ ists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t .
"We don &apos;t know what those laws are yet , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re after ."
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be univer@@ sal .
E@@ very system might have some de@@ gre@@ e of consciousness .
E@@ ven a ph@@ ot@@ on has some de@@ gre@@ e of consciousness .
The idea is not that ph@@ ot@@ ons are intelli@@ gent or thinking .
"It &apos;s not that a ph@@ ot@@ on is w@@ ra@@ c@@ ked with ang@@ st because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w@@ w , I &apos;m always bu@@ z@@ z@@ ing around ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"I never get to s@@ low down and sm@@ ell the ro@@ ses . &quot; &quot; No , not like that ."
"But the thought is maybe ph@@ ot@@ ons might have some el@@ ement of ra@@ w , sub@@ jec@@ tive feel@@ ing , some pri@@ mit@@ ive pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or to consciousness ."
This may sound a bit ko@@ o@@ k@@ y to you .
"I mean , why would any@@ one think such a crazy thing ?"
"S@@ ome mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental ."
"If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to sup@@ pose that it might be univer@@ sal too , the way they are ."
"It &apos;s also wor@@ th not@@ ing that al@@ though the idea seems coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ itive to us , it &apos;s much less coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ itive to people from different cul@@ tures , where the human mind is seen as much more contin@@ u@@ ous with nature ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there &apos;s information proc@@ ess@@ ing , there &apos;s consciousness ."
"C@@ om@@ pl@@ ex information proc@@ ess@@ ing , like in a human , compl@@ ex consciousness ."
"S@@ im@@ ple information proc@@ ess@@ ing , simple consciousness ."
"A really exc@@ iting thing is in rec@@ ent years a neuro@@ scient@@ ist , G@@ i@@ ul@@ i@@ o Ton@@ oni , has taken this kind of theory and develop@@ ed it ri@@ go@@ ro@@ us@@ ly with a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical theory ."
"He has a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical measure of information in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion which he call@@ s ph@@ i , meas@@ uring the amount of information in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted in a system ."
And he sup@@ pos@@ es that ph@@ i goes along with consciousness .
"In a mo@@ use , medi@@ um de@@ gre@@ e of information in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion , still pretty si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , pretty ser@@ ious amount of consciousness ."
"But as you go down to wor@@ ms , m@@ ic@@ rob@@ es , partic@@ les , the amount of ph@@ i f@@ all@@ s off ."
"The amount of information in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion f@@ all@@ s off , but it &apos;s still n@@ on@@ -@@ z@@ ero ."
"In ef@@ fect , he &apos;s pro@@ pos@@ ing a fundamental la@@ w of consciousness : high ph@@ i , high consciousness ."
A@@ no@@ ther fin@@ al mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation is that pan@@ psych@@ ism might help us to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te consciousness into the physical world .
P@@ h@@ ysic@@ ists and philosoph@@ ers have often observ@@ ed that physics is cur@@ i@@ ously ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t .
"It descri@@ b@@ es the structure of reality using a bun@@ ch of equ@@ ations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that under@@ li@@ es it ."
"As S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king put@@ s it , what put@@ s the fir@@ e into the equ@@ ations ?"
"Well , on the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , you can leave the equ@@ ations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be descri@@ b@@ ing the flu@@ x of consciousness ."
"That &apos;s what physics really is ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely doing , descri@@ b@@ ing the flu@@ x of consciousness ."
"O@@ n this view , it &apos;s consciousness that put@@ s the fir@@ e into the equ@@ ations ."
"O@@ n that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dan@@ gle outside the physical world as some kind of extra ."
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
S@@ ome of these may be coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ itive .
"I used to think I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t e@@ at anything which is consci@@ ous , so ther@@ e@@ fore I should be ve@@ g@@ et@@ arian ."
"Now , if you &apos;re a pan@@ psych@@ ist and you take that view , you &apos;re going to go very h@@ un@@ gr@@ y ."
"So I think when you think about it , this ten@@ ds to trans@@ figure your vie@@ ws , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as what mat@@ ters for e@@ th@@ ical pur@@ pos@@ es and moral consid@@ er@@ ations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the de@@ gre@@ e and the compl@@ ex@@ ity of consciousness ."
"What about the ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ i@@ ally intelli@@ gent system in the movi@@ e &quot; &quot; H@@ er , &quot; &quot; S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a ?"
I@@ s she consci@@ ous ?
"If that &apos;s right , it ra@@ is@@ es pretty ser@@ ious e@@ th@@ ical issu@@ es about both the e@@ th@@ ics of develop@@ ing intelli@@ gent computer syst@@ ems and the e@@ th@@ ics of turn@@ ing them off ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole gro@@ ups , the planet ."
D@@ o@@ es C@@ an@@ ada have its own consciousness ?
"I don &apos;t know the answer to that question , but I think it &apos;s at le@@ ast one wor@@ th taking ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ kay , so this pan@@ psych@@ ist vis@@ ion , it is a rad@@ ical one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s cor@@ rec@@ t ."
"I &apos;m actually more con@@ f@@ id@@ ent about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s univer@@ sal ."
"If not , well , this is the har@@ d@@ est problem perhaps in science and philosoph@@ y ."
We can &apos;t exp@@ ect to sol@@ ve it over@@ night .
But I do think we &apos;re going to figure it out even@@ tually .
"@@ Un@@ der@@ st@@ anding consciousness is a real k@@ ey , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves ."
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I bec@@ ame interes@@ ted in understanding what con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ed to a life that was wor@@ th living .
And finally I en@@ ded up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psych@@ ology by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a s@@ ki res@@ or@@ t in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y my@@ self , because the s@@ now had mel@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a movi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers that there was to be a pres@@ ent@@ ation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Z@@ ur@@ ich , and it was about fl@@ ying sa@@ uc@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
"And I thought , well , since I can &apos;t go to the movi@@ es , at le@@ ast I will go for f@@ ree to list@@ en to fl@@ ying sa@@ uc@@ ers ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that even@@ ing lec@@ ture was very interesting .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad of talking about little gre@@ en men , he tal@@ ked about how the psych@@ e of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans had been tra@@ u@@ ma@@ ti@@ z@@ ed by the war , and now they &apos;re pro@@ jec@@ ting fl@@ ying sa@@ uc@@ ers into the sk@@ y ."
He tal@@ ked about how the man@@ d@@ al@@ as of an@@ ci@@ ent H@@ ind@@ u relig@@ ion were kind of pro@@ jec@@ ted into the sk@@ y as an at@@ tem@@ pt to re@@ ga@@ in some sense of order after the cha@@ os of war .
And this se@@ em@@ ed very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his bo@@ o@@ ks after that lec@@ ture .
"And that was C@@ ar@@ l J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose name or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psych@@ ology and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a typ@@ ical res@@ ult that many people have pres@@ ented , and there are many vari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for inst@@ ance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people surv@@ ey@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that h@@ as@@ n &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the person@@ al income , on a sc@@ ale that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ te for in@@ fl@@ ation , has more than d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed , almost tri@@ pl@@ ed , in that peri@@ od ."
"But you find essenti@@ ally the same results , nam@@ ely , that after a certain bas@@ ic point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ ove the min@@ im@@ um pov@@ ert@@ y level — increas@@ es in material well-@@ being don &apos;t seem to af@@ fect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the l@@ ack of bas@@ ic resour@@ ces , material resour@@ ces , con@@ tri@@ b@@ utes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material resour@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been foc@@ used more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tri@@ ed to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our nor@@ mal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I be@@ gan to look at cre@@ ative people — first art@@ ists and scient@@ ists , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essenti@@ ally sp@@ en@@ ding their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t exp@@ ect ei@@ ther fa@@ me or for@@ tun@@ e , but which made their life mean@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the lead@@ ing com@@ pos@@ ers of American mus@@ ic back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 p@@ ages long .
But this little exc@@ er@@ pt is a very good sum@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying d@@ uring the inter@@ view .
And it descri@@ b@@ es how he fe@@ els when com@@ pos@@ ing is going well .
And he says by descri@@ b@@ ing it as an ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ec@@ st@@ as@@ y &quot; &quot; in Gre@@ e@@ k me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it bec@@ ame essenti@@ ally an anal@@ o@@ gy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordin@@ ary every@@ day ro@@ ut@@ ines .
So ec@@ st@@ as@@ y is essenti@@ ally a ste@@ p@@ ping into an al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civiliz@@ ations that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ nac@@ les of human achi@@ ev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , Gre@@ ece , the H@@ ind@@ u civiliz@@ ation , or the M@@ ay@@ as , or E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their ec@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the tem@@ pl@@ es they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the cir@@ c@@ uses , the ar@@ en@@ as , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"Th@@ ese are the re@@ ma@@ ins of civiliz@@ ations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted , more or@@ der@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ ena , which is built like a Gre@@ e@@ k am@@ ph@@ i@@ the@@ at@@ re , is a place for ec@@ st@@ as@@ y also ."
We are par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He needs just a piece of p@@ aper where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ oun@@ ds that had not ex@@ is@@ ted before in that particular com@@ bin@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer did in her impro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tion , a new reality — that is , a moment of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y — he en@@ ters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so in@@ ten@@ se an experience that it fe@@ els almost as if he didn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
And that s@@ oun@@ ds like a kind of a rom@@ an@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
"But actually , our nerv@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of proc@@ ess@@ ing more than about 1@@ 10 b@@ its of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 b@@ its per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ ol@@ ved in this completely en@@ gag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body fe@@ els , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s h@@ un@@ gr@@ y or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , his id@@ ent@@ ity disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that requ@@ ir@@ es a lot of con@@ cent@@ ration , and at the same time to feel that he ex@@ ists ."
So ex@@ ist@@ ence is tem@@ por@@ ar@@ ily s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seems to be mov@@ ing by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t com@@ pose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tic , s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s descri@@ b@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has develop@@ ed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tr@@ u@@ ism in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of te@@ chn@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ knowledge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular field .
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics or mus@@ ic , it takes that long to be able to be@@ gin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the mus@@ ic just f@@ lo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people descri@@ bed this as a s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous f@@ low that I called this typ@@ e of experience the &quot; &quot; f@@ low experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different real@@ ms .
"For inst@@ ance , a po@@ et descri@@ b@@ es it in this form ."
This is by a stud@@ ent of mine who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the lead@@ ing writ@@ ers and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it descri@@ b@@ es the same ef@@ for@@ t@@ less , s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this ec@@ st@@ ati@@ c state ."
"This po@@ et descri@@ b@@ es it as op@@ en@@ ing a do@@ or that f@@ lo@@ at@@ s in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mil@@ ar descri@@ p@@ tion to what A@@ l@@ b@@ ert E@@ inste@@ in gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of rel@@ ati@@ vity , when he was st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ vit@@ ies .
"For inst@@ ance , this is another stud@@ ent of mine , Su@@ sa@@ n J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from A@@ ust@@ ral@@ ia , who did work with some of the lead@@ ing a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic sk@@ ater , the same essenti@@ al descri@@ p@@ tion of the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ology of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the mus@@ ic , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most rec@@ ent book I w@@ ro@@ te , called &quot; &quot; G@@ ood B@@ us@@ iness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been no@@ min@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very success@@ ful and very e@@ th@@ ical , very soci@@ ally respon@@ si@@ ble ."
You see that these people defin@@ e success as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these success@@ ful and respon@@ si@@ ble C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be success@@ ful if you want a mean@@ ing@@ ful and success@@ ful job ."
An@@ it@@ a R@@ od@@ dic@@ k is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"She is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ ody S@@ ho@@ p , the natural co@@ s@@ me@@ tics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having f@@ low while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ b@@ uk@@ a , who was at that time starting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a produc@@ t — they didn &apos;t have a produc@@ t , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of technolo@@ g@@ ical in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , be aw@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s cont@@ ent ."
I couldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how f@@ low en@@ ters the work@@ place .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an mon@@ ks , to bl@@ ind n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an c@@ lim@@ bers , to N@@ av@@ a@@ j@@ o she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the culture , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of education or wh@@ at@@ ever , there are these seven con@@ dit@@ ions that seem to be there when a person is in f@@ low ."
"There &apos;s this foc@@ us that , once it becom@@ es in@@ ten@@ se , lead@@ s to a sense of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y , a sense of cl@@ ar@@ ity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get im@@ medi@@ ate fe@@ ed@@ back ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something larg@@ er ."
"And once the con@@ dit@@ ions are present , what you are doing becom@@ es wor@@ th doing for its own sa@@ ke ."
"In our studies , we re@@ present the every@@ day life of people in this simple s@@ che@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very prec@@ is@@ ely , actually , because we give people elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic p@@ ag@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish an average , which is the center of the diag@@ ram ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predic@@ t fa@@ ir@@ ly ac@@ cu@@ rat@@ ely when you will be in f@@ low , and it will be when your chall@@ eng@@ es are high@@ er than average and sk@@ il@@ ls are high@@ er than average ."
"And you may be doing things very differ@@ ently from other people , but for everyone that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l , that are@@ a there , will be when you are doing what you really like to do — play the pi@@ an@@ o , be with your best fri@@ end , perhaps work , if work is what pro@@ vid@@ es f@@ low for you ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less pos@@ itive .
A@@ rou@@ sal is still good because you are over@@ -@@ chall@@ eng@@ ed there .
"Y@@ our sk@@ il@@ ls are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move into f@@ low fa@@ ir@@ ly eas@@ ily by just develop@@ ing a little more sk@@ ill ."
"So , ar@@ ou@@ sal is the are@@ a where most people learn from , because that &apos;s where they &apos;re p@@ u@@ shed be@@ y@@ ond their com@@ for@@ t z@@ one and to en@@ ter that — going back to f@@ low — then they devel@@ op high@@ er sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ for@@ table , but not very exc@@ ited ."
It &apos;s not very chall@@ eng@@ ing any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter f@@ low from control , you have to increase the chall@@ eng@@ es ."
So those two are ide@@ al and compl@@ em@@ ent@@ ary are@@ as from which f@@ low is easy to go into .
The other com@@ bin@@ ations of challenge and sk@@ ill become progres@@ si@@ vely less op@@ ti@@ mal .
R@@ el@@ ax@@ ation is fin@@ e — you still feel O@@ K .
"B@@ or@@ ed@@ om begin@@ s to be very aver@@ sive and ap@@ a@@ thy becom@@ es very ne@@ ga@@ tive : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ il@@ ls , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in ap@@ a@@ thy ."
"The larg@@ est single con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to that experience is wat@@ ch@@ ing tel@@ ev@@ ision ; the next one is being in the ba@@ th@@ room , sit@@ ting ."
"E@@ ven though sometimes wat@@ ch@@ ing tel@@ ev@@ ision about seven to eight percent of the time is in f@@ low , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a program you really want to wat@@ ch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ d@@ ress — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously without any ad@@ vic@@ e , but un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our man@@ da@@ te is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : W@@ el@@ come to TE@@ D .
R@@ ich@@ ard B@@ r@@ ans@@ on : Thank you very much . The first TE@@ D has been great .
CA : H@@ ave you me@@ t any@@ one interesting ?
"RB : Well , the n@@ ice thing about TE@@ D is everybody &apos;s interesting ."
"I was very gl@@ ad to see G@@ ol@@ die H@@ a@@ wn , because I had an apo@@ lo@@ gy to make to her ."
I &apos;d had din@@ ner with her about two years ago and I &apos;d — she had this big w@@ ed@@ ding r@@ ing and I put it on my fin@@ ger and I couldn &apos;t get it off .
"And I went home to my wi@@ fe that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman &apos;s big , massive , big w@@ ed@@ ding r@@ ing on my fin@@ ger ."
"And , any@@ way , the next mor@@ ning we had to go along to the j@@ e@@ wel@@ er and get it c@@ ut off ."
So — ( Laughter ) — so apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ es to G@@ ol@@ die .
CA : That &apos;s pretty good .
"So , we &apos;re going to put up some sl@@ ides of some of your compan@@ ies here ."
You &apos;ve started one or two in your time .
"So , you know , V@@ ir@@ gin A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , V@@ ir@@ gin R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds — I gu@@ ess it all started with a ma@@ gaz@@ ine called S@@ tu@@ d@@ ent ."
"And then , y@@ es , all these other ones as well . I mean , how do you do this ?"
"RB : I read all these sort of TE@@ D in@@ struc@@ tions : you must not talk about your own business , and this , and now you ask me ."
"So I sup@@ pose you &apos;re not going to be able to k@@ ic@@ k me off the stage , since you asked the question ."
( Laughter ) CA : It de@@ pen@@ ds what the answer is though .
"RB : No , I mean , I think I learned early on that if you can run one compan@@ y , you can really run any compan@@ ies ."
"I mean , compan@@ ies are all about fin@@ ding the right people , insp@@ ir@@ ing those people , you know , dra@@ wing out the best in people ."
"And I just love learning and I &apos;m incredi@@ bly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive and I love taking on , you know , the stat@@ us qu@@ o and trying to turn it up@@ side down ."
So I &apos;ve seen life as one long learning process .
"And if I see — you know , if I f@@ ly on somebody else &apos;s air@@ line and find the experience is not a pl@@ eas@@ ant one , which it wasn &apos;t , 2@@ 1 years ago , then I &apos;d think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of air@@ line that I &apos;d like to f@@ ly on ."
"And so , you know , so got one secon@@ d@@ hand 7@@ 4@@ 7 from B@@ o@@ e@@ ing and gave it a go ."
"C@@ A : Well , that was a biz@@ ar@@ re thing , because you made this move that a lot of people ad@@ vis@@ ed you was crazy ."
"And in fact , in a way , it almost took down your em@@ pir@@ e at one point ."
"I had a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with one of the inv@@ est@@ ment ban@@ k@@ ers who , at the time when you basically s@@ old V@@ ir@@ gin R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and inv@@ es@@ ted he@@ av@@ ily in V@@ ir@@ gin A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , and his view was that you were t@@ rad@@ ing , you know , the world &apos;s f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h big@@ gest rec@@ or@@ d compan@@ y for the tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ fi@@ f@@ th big@@ gest air@@ line and that you were out of your mind ."
Why did you do that ?
"RB : Well , I think that there &apos;s a very th@@ in d@@ ivid@@ ing line between success and fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"And I think if you start a business without fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al bac@@ king , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that d@@ ivid@@ ing line ."
We had — we were being att@@ ac@@ ked by Brit@@ ish A@@ ir@@ ways .
"They were trying to put our air@@ line out of business , and they la@@ un@@ ched what &apos;s become known as the d@@ ir@@ ty tric@@ ks cam@@ pa@@ ign ."
And I real@@ ized that the whole em@@ pir@@ e was likely to come cra@@ sh@@ ing down un@@ less I ch@@ ip@@ ped in a ch@@ i@@ p .
"And in order to pro@@ t@@ ect the j@@ obs of the people who worked for the air@@ line , and pro@@ t@@ ect the j@@ obs of the people who worked for the rec@@ or@@ d compan@@ y , I had to s@@ ell the family j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry to pro@@ t@@ ect the air@@ line ."
"C@@ A : P@@ o@@ st@@ -@@ N@@ ap@@ st@@ er , you &apos;re looking like a bit of a gen@@ i@@ us , actually , for that as well ."
"RB : Y@@ eah , as it turned out , it pro@@ ved to be the right move ."
"But , ye@@ ah , it was sad at the time , but we mov@@ ed on ."
"C@@ A : Now , you use the V@@ ir@@ gin br@@ and a lot and it seems like you &apos;re getting sy@@ ner@@ gy from one thing to the other ."
What does the br@@ and st@@ and for in your head ?
"RB : Well , I like to think it stan@@ ds for qu@@ ality , that you know , if somebody comes across a V@@ ir@@ gin compan@@ y , they — CA : They are qu@@ ality , R@@ ich@@ ard . C@@ ome on now , everyone says qu@@ ality . S@@ pir@@ it ?"
"RB : No , but I was going to move on this ."
We have a lot of fu@@ n and I think the people who work for it en@@ jo@@ y it .
"As I say , we go in and sh@@ ake up other ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ es , and I think , you know , we do it differ@@ ently and I think that ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ es are not quite the same as a res@@ ult of V@@ ir@@ gin att@@ ac@@ king the market ."
"C@@ A : I mean , there are a few la@@ un@@ ch@@ es you &apos;ve done where the br@@ and maybe h@@ as@@ n &apos;t worked quite as well ."
"I mean , V@@ ir@@ gin B@@ r@@ ides — what happened there ?"
( Laughter ) R@@ B : We couldn &apos;t find any cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) CA : I was actually also cur@@ ious why — I think you mis@@ sed an opportun@@ ity with your con@@ dom@@ s la@@ un@@ ch . You called it M@@ ates .
"I mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the V@@ ir@@ gin br@@ and for that as well ?"
"A@@ in &apos;t vir@@ gin no longer , or something ."
"RB : A@@ ga@@ in , we may have had problems fin@@ ding cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
"I mean , we had — often , when you la@@ un@@ ch a compan@@ y and you get cu@@ st@@ om@@ er com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts , you know , you can de@@ al with them ."
"But about three months after the la@@ un@@ ch of the con@@ dom compan@@ y , I had a l@@ et@@ ter , a com@@ pla@@ in@@ t , and I sa@@ t down and w@@ ro@@ te a long l@@ et@@ ter back to this l@@ ad@@ y apo@@ log@@ iz@@ ing prof@@ us@@ ely ."
"But ob@@ vi@@ ously , there wasn &apos;t a lot I could do about it ."
"And then six months later , or n@@ ine months after the problem had taken , I got this del@@ igh@@ t@@ ful l@@ et@@ ter with a picture of the b@@ ab@@ y as@@ king if I &apos;d be g@@ od@@ father , which I bec@@ ame ."
"So , it all worked out well ."
CA : R@@ e@@ ally ? You should have b@@ rou@@ ght a picture . That &apos;s wonderful .
R@@ B : I should have .
"C@@ A : So , just help us with some of the numbers ."
"I mean , what are the numbers on this ?"
"I mean , how big is the group over@@ all ?"
How much — what &apos;s the tot@@ al re@@ ven@@ ue ?
"RB : It &apos;s about 25 billion dollars now , in tot@@ al ."
CA : And how many emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ?
"RB : A@@ b@@ out 5@@ 5@@ ,000 ."
"C@@ A : So , you &apos;ve been ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ ed in vari@@ ous ways at vari@@ ous times and never wor@@ r@@ ying about put@@ ting your di@@ gn@@ ity on the line or anything like that ."
What was that ? W@@ as that real ?
"RB : Y@@ eah . We were la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing a me@@ ga@@ stor@@ e in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , I think ."
"@@ No , I mean , I think — CA : But is that your ha@@ ir ?"
R@@ B : No .
CA : What was that one ?
R@@ B : D@@ rop@@ ping in for te@@ a .
CA : O@@ K .
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : A@@ h , that was quite fu@@ n . That was a wonderful car@@ -@@ bo@@ at in which — CA : O@@ h , that c@@ ar that we — actually we — it was a TE@@ D@@ st@@ er ev@@ ent there , I think ."
"I@@ s that — could you still p@@ ause on that one actually , for a min@@ ute ?"
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : It &apos;s a t@@ ough job , isn &apos;t it ?"
"C@@ A : I mean , it is a t@@ ough job ."
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en I first came to America , I used to try this with emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es as well and they kind of — they have these different rul@@ es over here , it &apos;s very stran@@ ge ."
"RB : I know , I have — the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers say you m@@ ust@@ n &apos;t do things like that , but — CA : I mean , speak@@ ing of which , tell us about — R@@ B : &quot; &quot; P@@ am@@ my &quot; &quot; we la@@ un@@ ched , you know — mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly thought we could take on C@@ oc@@ a@@ -@@ C@@ ol@@ a , and we la@@ un@@ ched a col@@ a bot@@ tle called &quot; &quot; The P@@ am@@ my &quot; &quot; and it was shap@@ ed a bit like P@@ am@@ el@@ a An@@ der@@ son ."
"But the tro@@ ub@@ le is , it ke@@ pt on ti@@ p@@ ping over , but — ( Laughter ) CA : D@@ es@@ ign@@ ed by P@@ h@@ il@@ ip@@ p@@ e St@@ arc@@ k perhaps ?"
R@@ B : O@@ f course .
"C@@ A : So , we &apos;ll just run a couple more pic@@ tures here . V@@ ir@@ gin B@@ r@@ ides . V@@ er@@ y n@@ ice ."
"And , O@@ K , so stop there . This was — you had some aw@@ ard I think ?"
"RB : Y@@ eah , well , 25 years ear@@ li@@ er , we &apos;d la@@ un@@ ched the S@@ ex P@@ ist@@ ols &apos; &quot; &quot; G@@ od S@@ ave The Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d certain@@ ly never expec@@ ted that 25 years later — that she &apos;d actually k@@ night us ."
"But some@@ how , she must have had a for@@ g@@ et@@ ful me@@ mor@@ y , I think ."
"C@@ A : Well , G@@ od sav@@ ed her and you got your just re@@ ward ."
"@@ Do you like to be called S@@ ir R@@ ich@@ ard , or how ?"
R@@ B : N@@ ob@@ ody &apos;s ever called me S@@ ir R@@ ich@@ ard .
"O@@ c@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally in America , I hear people saying S@@ ir R@@ ich@@ ard and think there &apos;s some S@@ h@@ ak@@ es@@ pe@@ are@@ an play taking place ."
But no@@ where else any@@ way .
CA : O@@ K . So can you use your k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood for anything or is it just ...
"RB : No . I sup@@ pose if you &apos;re having problems getting a bo@@ o@@ king in a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant or something , that might be wor@@ th using it ."
"C@@ A : You know , it &apos;s not R@@ ich@@ ard B@@ r@@ ans@@ on . It &apos;s S@@ ir R@@ ich@@ ard B@@ r@@ ans@@ on ."
R@@ B : I &apos;ll go get the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary to use it .
CA : O@@ K . So let &apos;s look at the space thing .
"I think , with us , we &apos;ve got a video that sho@@ ws what you &apos;re up to , and V@@ ir@@ gin G@@ al@@ ac@@ tic up in the air . ( V@@ ide@@ o ) So that &apos;s the B@@ ert R@@ ut@@ an des@@ ign@@ ed sp@@ ac@@ e@@ ship ?"
"RB : Y@@ eah , it &apos;ll be ready in — well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months ex@@ ten@@ sive tes@@ ting ."
"And then 2@@ 4 months from now , people will be able to take a r@@ ide into space ."
CA : So this inter@@ ior is P@@ h@@ il@@ ip@@ p@@ e St@@ arc@@ ke des@@ ign@@ ed ?
"RB : P@@ h@@ il@@ ip@@ p@@ e has done the — ye@@ ah , quite a bit of it : the lo@@ go@@ s and he &apos;s building the space st@@ ation in New M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o ."
"And basically , he &apos;s just taken an ey@@ e and the space st@@ ation will be one gi@@ ant ey@@ e , so when you &apos;re in space , you ou@@ ght to be able to see this massive ey@@ e looking up at you ."
"And when you land , you &apos;ll be able to go back into this gi@@ ant ey@@ e ."
But he &apos;s an ab@@ sol@@ ute gen@@ i@@ us when it comes to des@@ ign .
CA : But you didn &apos;t have him des@@ ign the eng@@ ine ?
"RB : P@@ h@@ il@@ ip@@ p@@ e is quite er@@ ra@@ tic , so I think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to des@@ ign the eng@@ ine , no ."
CA : He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago .
"RB : Y@@ eah ? No , he is a — CA : Well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely biz@@ ar@@ re ."
"But , I person@@ ally found it wonderful ."
"RB : He &apos;s a wonderful en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ ast , which is why I love him . But ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : So , now , you &apos;ve always had this explo@@ ration bu@@ g in you ."
H@@ ave you ever re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted that ?
R@@ B : M@@ any times .
"I mean , I think with the bal@@ lo@@ on@@ ing and bo@@ ating exp@@ ed@@ it@@ ions we &apos;ve done in the past ."
"Well , I got pul@@ led out of the se@@ a I think six times by hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters , so — and each time , I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect to come home to tell the tal@@ e ."
"So in those mo@@ ments , you certain@@ ly won@@ der what you &apos;re doing up there or — CA : What was the clo@@ s@@ est you got to — when did you think , this is it , I might be on my way out ?"
"RB : Well , I think the bal@@ lo@@ on adv@@ ent@@ ures were — each one was , each one , actually , I think we came clo@@ se ."
"And , I mean , first of all we — nob@@ ody had actually c@@ ro@@ s@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic in a h@@ ot air bal@@ lo@@ on before , so we had to build a h@@ ot air bal@@ lo@@ on that was cap@@ able of fl@@ ying in the j@@ et stre@@ am , and we wer@@ en &apos;t quite sure , when a bal@@ lo@@ on actually got into the j@@ et stre@@ am , whether it would actually surv@@ ive the 200 , 2@@ 20 mil@@ es an h@@ our w@@ in@@ ds that you can find up there ."
"And so , just the in@@ it@@ ial li@@ ft off from Su@@ gar@@ lo@@ a@@ f to c@@ ross the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , as we were p@@ ush@@ ing into the j@@ et stre@@ am , this en@@ or@@ mo@@ us bal@@ lo@@ on — the top of the bal@@ lo@@ on en@@ ded up going at a couple of hundred mil@@ es an h@@ our , the cap@@ sul@@ e that we were in at the bot@@ tom was going at maybe two mil@@ es an h@@ our , and it just took off ."
And it was like hol@@ ding on@@ to a thou@@ s@@ and hor@@ ses .
"And we were just c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing every fin@@ ger , pra@@ ying that the bal@@ lo@@ on would hold together , which , for@@ tun@@ ately , it did ."
"But the ends of all those bal@@ lo@@ on tri@@ ps were , you know — something se@@ em@@ ed to go wrong every time , and on that particular oc@@ cas@@ ion , the more experien@@ ced bal@@ lo@@ on@@ ist who was with me j@@ um@@ ped , and left me hol@@ ding on for de@@ ar life ."
"( Laughter ) CA : D@@ id he tell you to j@@ um@@ p , or he just said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m out of here ! &quot; &quot; and ..@@ ."
"RB : No , he told me j@@ um@@ p , but once his we@@ ight had gone , the bal@@ lo@@ on just sh@@ ot up to 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et and I ..@@ ."
CA : And you insp@@ i@@ red an I@@ an M@@ c@@ E@@ w@@ an no@@ vel I think with that .
"RB : Y@@ eah . No , I put on my oxy@@ g@@ en mas@@ k and st@@ ood on top of the bal@@ lo@@ on , with my par@@ ach@@ ute , looking at the s@@ w@@ ir@@ ling cl@@ ou@@ ds bel@@ ow , trying to pl@@ uc@@ k up my cou@@ ra@@ ge to j@@ um@@ p into the Nor@@ th S@@ ea , which — and it was a very , very , very lon@@ ely few mo@@ ments ."
"But , any@@ way , we man@@ ag@@ ed to surv@@ ive it ."
CA : D@@ id you j@@ um@@ p ? O@@ r it came down in the end ?
"RB : Well , I knew I had about half an h@@ our &apos;s fu@@ el left , and I also knew that the chan@@ ces were that if I j@@ um@@ ped , I would only have a couple of minutes of life left ."
So I c@@ lim@@ bed back into the cap@@ sul@@ e and just des@@ per@@ ately tri@@ ed to make sure that I was making the right dec@@ ision .
"And w@@ ro@@ te some not@@ es to my family . And then c@@ lim@@ bed back up again , looked down at those cl@@ ou@@ ds again , c@@ lim@@ bed back into the cap@@ sul@@ e again ."
"And then finally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way ."
"I &apos;ve got , you know , this en@@ or@@ mo@@ us bal@@ lo@@ on ab@@ ove me , it &apos;s the big@@ gest par@@ ach@@ ute ever , why not use it ?"
"And so I man@@ ag@@ ed to f@@ ly the bal@@ lo@@ on down through the cl@@ ou@@ ds , and about 50 fe@@ et , before I h@@ it the se@@ a , thre@@ w my@@ self over ."
"And the bal@@ lo@@ on h@@ it the se@@ a and went sho@@ ot@@ ing back up to 1@@ 0,000 fe@@ et without me ."
But it was a wonderful feel@@ ing being in that water and — CA : What did you write to your family ?
"RB : Just what you would do in a sit@@ u@@ ation like that : just I love you very much . And I &apos;d already writ@@ ten them a l@@ et@@ ter before going on this tri@@ p , which — just in case anything had happened ."
"But for@@ tun@@ ately , they never had to use it ."
CA : Y@@ our compan@@ ies have had incredi@@ ble P@@ R value out of these her@@ o@@ ics .
"The years — and until I st@@ op@@ ped looking at the pol@@ ls , you were sort of re@@ gar@@ ded as this great her@@ o in the U.@@ K@@ . and el@@ se@@ where ."
"And c@@ y@@ n@@ ics might say , you know , this is just a s@@ mart business guy doing what it takes to ex@@ ec@@ ute his particular st@@ y@@ le of mar@@ ket@@ ing ."
How much was the P@@ R value part of this ?
"RB : Well , of course , the P@@ R exp@@ erts said that as an air@@ line ow@@ ner , the last thing you should be doing is head@@ ing off in bal@@ lo@@ ons and bo@@ at@@ s , and cra@@ sh@@ ing into the se@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) CA : They have a point , R@@ ich@@ ard ."
"RB : I@@ n fact , I think our air@@ line took a ful@@ l p@@ age ad at the time saying , you know , come on , R@@ ich@@ ard , there are better ways of c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) CA : To do all this , you must have been a gen@@ i@@ us from the g@@ et@@ -@@ go , right ?"
"RB : Well , I won &apos;t cont@@ rad@@ ic@@ t that ."
"( Laughter ) CA : O@@ K , this isn &apos;t exactly har@@ d@@ b@@ all . O@@ K ."
D@@ id@@ n &apos;t — wer@@ en &apos;t you just ter@@ ri@@ ble at school ?
R@@ B : I was d@@ y@@ s@@ le@@ x@@ ic . I had no understanding of scho@@ ol@@ work wh@@ ats@@ o@@ ever .
I certain@@ ly would have fa@@ il@@ ed I@@ Q tes@@ ts .
And it was one of the reas@@ ons I left school when I was 15 years old .
"And if I — if I &apos;m not interes@@ ted in something , I don &apos;t gra@@ s@@ p it ."
"As somebody who &apos;s d@@ y@@ s@@ le@@ x@@ ic , you also have some quite biz@@ ar@@ re sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"I mean , for inst@@ ance , I &apos;ve had to — you know , I &apos;ve been run@@ ning the larg@@ est group of p@@ riv@@ ate compan@@ ies in Eu@@ rop@@ e , but hav@@ en &apos;t been able to know the difference between n@@ et and gro@@ ss ."
And so the bo@@ ard me@@ et@@ ings have been fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"( Laughter ) And so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?"
"And gener@@ ally , the people would say , oh , well that &apos;s bad news ."
"C@@ A : But just to cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y , the 25 billion dollars is gro@@ ss , right ? That &apos;s gro@@ ss ?"
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : Well , I hope it &apos;s n@@ et actually , having — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;ve got it right ."
"C@@ A : No , tr@@ ust me , it &apos;s gro@@ ss ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : So , when I turned 50 , somebody took me outside the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok R@@ ich@@ ard , here &apos;s a — let me dra@@ w on a diag@@ ram ."
"@@ Here &apos;s a n@@ et in the se@@ a , and the f@@ ish have been pul@@ led from the se@@ a into this n@@ et ."
"And that &apos;s the prof@@ its you &apos;ve got left over in this little n@@ et , everything else is e@@ at@@ en . &quot; &quot; And I finally worked it all out ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : But , I mean , at school — so as well as being , you know , doing pretty mis@@ er@@ ably ac@@ ade@@ m@@ ically , but you were also the cap@@ tain of the c@@ ric@@ k@@ et and fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all te@@ ams ."
"So you were kind of a — you were a natural lead@@ er , but just a bit of a ... W@@ ere you a reb@@ el then , or how would you ..@@ ."
"RB : Y@@ eah , I think I was a bit of a ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k and — but I ... And I was , ye@@ ah , I was for@@ tun@@ ately good at s@@ port , and so at le@@ ast I had something to exc@@ el at , at school ."
CA : And some biz@@ ar@@ re things happened just ear@@ li@@ er in your life .
"I mean , there &apos;s the story about your mother al@@ le@@ g@@ ed@@ ly d@@ um@@ ping you in a field , ag@@ ed four , and saying &quot; &quot; O@@ K , wal@@ k home . &quot; &quot; D@@ id this really happen ?"
"RB : She was , you know , she fel@@ t that we needed to st@@ and on our own two fe@@ et from an early age ."
"So she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for , such as p@@ ush@@ ing us out of the c@@ ar , and telling us to find our own way to G@@ ran@@ n@@ y &apos;s , about five mil@@ es before we actually got there ."
"And making us go on wonderful , long b@@ ik@@ e r@@ ides ."
And we were never al@@ lowed to wat@@ ch tel@@ ev@@ ision and the like .
CA : But is there a ris@@ k here ?
"I mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are we@@ al@@ thy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dil@@ em@@ ma about how you bring them up ."
"@@ Do you look at the curr@@ ent gener@@ ation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too cod@@ d@@ led , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to ra@@ ise a gener@@ ation of p@@ riv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed ..@@ ."
"RB : No , I think if you &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing up kids , you just want to s@@ mother them with love and pra@@ ise and en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m ."
So I don &apos;t think you can mo@@ l@@ l@@ y@@ cod@@ dle your kids too much really .
"C@@ A : You didn &apos;t turn out too bad , I have to say , I &apos;m ..@@ ."
"Y@@ our head@@ ma@@ st@@ er said to you — I mean he found you kind of an en@@ ig@@ ma at your school — he said , you &apos;re ei@@ ther going to be a mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e or go to pris@@ on , and I &apos;m not sure which ."
Wh@@ ich of those happened first ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : Well , I &apos;ve done both . I think I went to pris@@ on first ."
I was actually pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed under two quite an@@ ci@@ ent ac@@ ts in the U.@@ K@@ .
I was pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed under the 18@@ 8@@ 9 V@@ ener@@ e@@ al D@@ is@@ eas@@ es A@@ c@@ t and the 19@@ 1@@ 6 In@@ de@@ cent A@@ d@@ v@@ ert@@ is@@ em@@ ents A@@ c@@ t .
"O@@ n the first oc@@ cas@@ ion , for men@@ tion@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease in public , which — we had a center where we would help young people who had problems ."
And one of the problems young people have is v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease .
And there &apos;s an an@@ ci@@ ent la@@ w that says you can &apos;t actually men@@ tion the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease or prin@@ t it in public .
"So the pol@@ ice kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or , and told us they were going to ar@@ rest us if we car@@ ri@@ ed on men@@ tion@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease ."
"We changed it to social dis@@ eas@@ es and people came along with ac@@ ne and spo@@ ts , but nob@@ ody came with V@@ D any more ."
"So , we put it back to V@@ D and prom@@ p@@ tly got ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed ."
"And then sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever M@@ ind the B@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks , Here &apos;s the S@@ ex P@@ ist@@ ols , &quot; &quot; the word b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks , the pol@@ ice decided was a ru@@ de word and so we were ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for using the word b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks on the S@@ ex P@@ ist@@ ols &apos; al@@ bu@@ m ."
"And J@@ o@@ h@@ n M@@ or@@ tim@@ er , the pla@@ y@@ w@@ right , de@@ fen@@ ded us ."
And he asked if I could find a lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tics exper@@ t to come up with a different defin@@ ition of the word b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks .
"And so I ran@@ g up N@@ ot@@ tin@@ gh@@ am Un@@ iver@@ sity , and I asked to talk to the prof@@ ess@@ or of lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tics ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks is not a — has nothing to do with b@@ all@@ s wh@@ ats@@ o@@ ever ."
"It &apos;s actually a n@@ ic@@ k@@ name given to pri@@ es@@ ts in the e@@ igh@@ te@@ ent@@ h century . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he went , &quot; &quot; F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , I &apos;m a pri@@ est my@@ self . &quot; &quot; And so I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you mind coming to the cour@@ t ? &quot; &quot; And he said he &apos;d be del@@ igh@@ ted . And I said — and he said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you like me to we@@ ar my do@@ g coll@@ ar ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , defin@@ it@@ ely . P@@ le@@ ase . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) CA : That &apos;s great ."
"RB : So our k@@ ey w@@ it@@ ness arg@@ u@@ ed that it was actually &quot; N@@ ever M@@ ind the P@@ ri@@ est , Here &apos;s the S@@ ex P@@ ist@@ ols . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And the j@@ ud@@ ge found us — rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ tly found us not gu@@ il@@ ty , so ... ( Laughter )"
CA : That is ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous .
"( Applause ) So ser@@ i@@ ously , is there a dark side ?"
"A lot of people would say there &apos;s no way that someone could put together this incredi@@ ble col@@ lec@@ tion of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es without k@@ ni@@ f@@ ing a few people in the back , you know , doing some u@@ g@@ ly things ."
You &apos;ve been acc@@ used of being ru@@ th@@ less .
There was a n@@ as@@ ty bio@@ graph@@ y writ@@ ten about you by someone .
I@@ s any of it true ? I@@ s there an el@@ ement of tr@@ uth in it ?
"RB : I don &apos;t actually think that the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e of a bus@@ in@@ ess@@ person tre@@ ad@@ ing all over people to get to the top , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , works ."
"I think if you treat people well , people will come back and come back for more ."
And I think all you have in life is your re@@ put@@ ation and it &apos;s a very small world .
"And I actually think that the best way of becom@@ ing a success@@ ful business lead@@ er is de@@ al@@ ing with people fa@@ ir@@ ly and well , and I like to think that &apos;s how we run V@@ ir@@ gin ."
"C@@ A : And what about the people who love you and who see you sp@@ en@@ ding — you keep getting c@@ au@@ ght up in these new pro@@ jects , but it almost fe@@ els like you &apos;re ad@@ dic@@ ted to la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing new stuff ."
"You get exc@@ ited by an idea and , k@@ apo@@ w !@@ "
"I mean , do you think about life bal@@ ance ?"
How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?
"RB : I also believe that being a father &apos;s incredi@@ bly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on ho@@ li@@ day , I go on ho@@ li@@ day with them ."
And so we sp@@ end a very good sort of three months away together .
"Y@@ es , I &apos;ll , you know , be in tou@@ ch . We &apos;re very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , we have this tiny little is@@ land in the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an and we can — so I can take them there and we can bring friends , and we can play together , but I can also keep in tou@@ ch with what &apos;s going on ."
CA : You started talking in rec@@ ent years about this ter@@ m cap@@ it@@ al@@ ist ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ropy .
What is that ?
R@@ B : C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ ism has been pro@@ ven to be a system that works .
"You know , the al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive , commun@@ ism , has not worked ."
"But the problem with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism is extre@@ me we@@ al@@ th ends up in the hands of a few people , and ther@@ e@@ fore extre@@ me respon@@ si@@ bility , I think , goes with that we@@ al@@ th ."
"And I think it &apos;s important that the individ@@ ual@@ s , who are in that for@@ tun@@ ate position , do not end up comp@@ et@@ ing for big@@ ger and big@@ ger bo@@ at@@ s , and big@@ ger and big@@ ger c@@ ars , but , you know , use that money to ei@@ ther create new j@@ obs or to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le issu@@ es around the world ."
"C@@ A : And what are the issu@@ es that you wor@@ ry about most , care most about , want to turn your resour@@ ces to@@ ward ?"
"RB : Well , there &apos;s — I mean there &apos;s a lot of issu@@ es ."
"I mean global war@@ m@@ ing certain@@ ly is a massive thre@@ at to man@@ kind and we are put@@ ting a lot of time and energy into , A , trying to come up with al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive fu@@ els and , B , you know , we just la@@ un@@ ched this pri@@ ze , which is really a pri@@ ze in case we don &apos;t get an answer on al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive fu@@ els , in case we don &apos;t actually man@@ age to get the car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions c@@ ut down qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , and in case we go through the ti@@ p@@ ping point ."
We need to try to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to come up with a way of ex@@ trac@@ ting car@@ b@@ on out of the Earth &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here .
"And we just — you know , there wer@@ en &apos;t really people working on that before , so we wanted people to try to — all the best bra@@ ins in the world to start thinking about that , and also to try to ex@@ trac@@ t the me@@ th@@ ane out of the Earth &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here as well ."
"And actually , we &apos;ve had about 1@@ 5@@ ,000 people f@@ ill in the for@@ ms saying they want to give it a go ."
"And so we only need one , so we &apos;re h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul ."
CA : And you &apos;re also working in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a on a couple of pro@@ jects ?
"RB : Y@@ es , I mean , we &apos;ve got — we &apos;re s@@ etting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word ."
"We &apos;re trying to — maybe we &apos;ll change it — but any@@ way , it &apos;s a war room to try to co@@ ordin@@ ate all the att@@ ack that &apos;s going on in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , all the different social problems in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and try to look at best prac@@ tic@@ es ."
"So , for inst@@ ance , there &apos;s a doc@@ tor in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a that &apos;s found that if you give a mother an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs at 2@@ 4 weeks , when she &apos;s pre@@ gn@@ ant , that the b@@ ab@@ y will not have H@@ I@@ V when it &apos;s born ."
And so dis@@ s@@ em@@ in@@ ating that information to around the rest of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a is important .
"C@@ A : The war room s@@ oun@@ ds , it s@@ oun@@ ds power@@ ful and dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"And is there a ris@@ k that the kind of the business her@@ o@@ es of the W@@ est get so exc@@ ited about — I mean , they &apos;re used to having an idea , getting stuff done , and they believe prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly in their ability to make a difference in the world ."
"I@@ s there a ris@@ k that we go to places like A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a and say , we &apos;ve got to fi@@ x this problem and we can do it , I &apos;ve got all these bil@@ lions of dollars , you know , da , da , da — here &apos;s the big idea . And kind of take a much more compl@@ ex sit@@ u@@ ation and actually end up making a m@@ ess of it . Do you wor@@ ry about that ?"
"RB : Well , first of all , on this particular sit@@ u@@ ation , we &apos;re actually — we &apos;re working with the government on it ."
"I mean , Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ ki &apos;s had his problems with ac@@ cep@@ ting H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S are rel@@ ated , but this is a way , I think , of him t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing this problem and instead of the world c@@ rit@@ ic@@ iz@@ ing him , it &apos;s a way of working with him , with his government ."
"It &apos;s important that if people do go to A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years ."
It &apos;s got to be con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent .
But I think business lead@@ ers can bring their ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ial know@@ -@@ how and help govern@@ ments appro@@ ach things s@@ ligh@@ tly differ@@ ently .
"For inst@@ ance , we &apos;re s@@ etting up cl@@ in@@ ics in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a where we &apos;re going to be giving f@@ ree an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs , f@@ ree T@@ B treat@@ ment and f@@ ree mal@@ aria treat@@ ment ."
"But we &apos;re also trying to make them self-@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ ing cl@@ in@@ ics , so that people pa@@ y for some other as@@ pec@@ ts ."
"C@@ A : I mean a lot of c@@ y@@ n@@ ics say about someone like yourself , or B@@ ill G@@ ates , or wh@@ at@@ ever , that this is really being — it &apos;s almost driv@@ en by some sort of des@@ ire again , you know , for the right imag@@ e , for gu@@ il@@ t av@@ o@@ id@@ ance and not like a real ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic inst@@ in@@ c@@ t ."
What would you say to them ?
"RB : Well , I think that everybody — people do things for a whole vari@@ ety of different reas@@ ons and I think that , you know , when I &apos;m on me de@@ a@@ th@@ bed , I will want to feel that I &apos;ve made a difference to other people &apos;s lives ."
"And that may be a sel@@ f@@ ish thing to think , but it &apos;s the way I &apos;ve been b@@ rou@@ ght up ."
"I think if I &apos;m in a position to rad@@ ically change other people &apos;s lives for the better , I should do so ."
CA : How old are you ?
R@@ B : I &apos;m 5@@ 6 .
"C@@ A : I mean , the psych@@ olog@@ ist E@@ ri@@ k E@@ rik@@ son says that — as I understand him and I &apos;m a tot@@ al ama@@ te@@ ur — but that d@@ uring 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s people are driv@@ en by this des@@ ire to grow and that &apos;s where they get their ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment ."
"@@ 5@@ 0s , 6@@ 0s , the mo@@ de of oper@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ts more to the qu@@ est for w@@ is@@ dom and a se@@ arch for le@@ ga@@ cy ."
"I mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth ph@@ as@@ es , you &apos;re still doing these incredi@@ ble new plan@@ s ."
"@@ How much do you think about le@@ ga@@ cy , and what would you like your le@@ ga@@ cy to be ?"
R@@ B : I don &apos;t think I think too much about le@@ ga@@ cy .
"I mean , I like to — you know , my grand@@ mother liv@@ ed to 1@@ 0@@ 1 , so h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly I &apos;ve got another 30 or 40 years to go ."
"@@ No , I just want to live life to its ful@@ l ."
"You know , if I can make a difference , I hope to be able to make a difference ."
"And I think one of the pos@@ itive things at the moment is you &apos;ve got S@@ er@@ g@@ ey and L@@ ar@@ ry from G@@ o@@ o@@ gle , for inst@@ ance , who are good friends ."
"And , th@@ ank G@@ od , you &apos;ve got two people who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely care about the world and with that kind of we@@ al@@ th ."
"If they had that kind of we@@ al@@ th and they didn &apos;t care about the world , it would be very wor@@ r@@ ying ."
And you know they &apos;re going to make a h@@ ell of a difference to the world .
And I think it &apos;s important that people in that kind of position do make a difference .
"C@@ A : Well , R@@ ich@@ ard , when I was starting off in business , I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of — I thought that business people were sup@@ posed to just be ru@@ th@@ less and that that was the only way you could have a chan@@ ce of suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing ."
"And you actually did insp@@ ire me . I looked at you , I thought , well , he &apos;s made it . Ma@@ ybe there is a different way ."
"So I would like to th@@ ank you for that insp@@ i@@ ration , and for coming to TE@@ D today . Thank you ."
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
So I want to take you on a tri@@ p to an ali@@ en world .
"And it &apos;s not a tri@@ p that requ@@ ir@@ es ligh@@ t-@@ years of tr@@ av@@ el , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defin@@ ed by light ."
So it &apos;s a lit@@ t@@ le@@ -@@ app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated fact that most of the an@@ im@@ als in our oc@@ e@@ an make light .
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my career stud@@ ying this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence .
I study it because I think understanding it is c@@ rit@@ ical to understanding life in the oc@@ e@@ an where most bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence oc@@ cur@@ s .
I also use it as a to@@ ol for vis@@ ual@@ iz@@ ing and trac@@ king pol@@ l@@ u@@ tion .
But mo@@ st@@ ly I &apos;m en@@ tr@@ an@@ ced by it .
"S@@ in@@ ce my my first d@@ ive in a de@@ ep@@ -@@ div@@ ing sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , when I went down and turned out the ligh@@ ts and saw the fi@@ re@@ works dis@@ pla@@ ys , I &apos;ve been a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence j@@ un@@ k@@ y ."
"But I would come back from those div@@ es and try to share the experience with words , and they were tot@@ ally in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate to the t@@ ask ."
I needed some way to share the experience direc@@ tly .
And the first time I fig@@ ured out that way was in this little sin@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ person sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble called D@@ e@@ ep R@@ over .
"This next video cli@@ p , you &apos;re going to see how we s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ated the bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence ."
And the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a trans@@ ect scre@@ en that is about a me@@ ter across .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : I@@ n front of the su@@ b , a m@@ ess scre@@ en will come into cont@@ act with the sof@@ t-@@ bo@@ died cre@@ atures of the de@@ ep se@@ a ."
"W@@ ith the su@@ b &apos;s ligh@@ ts s@@ w@@ it@@ ched off , it is possible to see their bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence — the light produc@@ ed when they coll@@ ide with the mes@@ h ."
This is the first time it has ever been rec@@ or@@ ded .
E@@ d@@ ith W@@ id@@ der : So I rec@@ or@@ ded that with an in@@ ten@@ si@@ fied video c@@ amer@@ a that has about the sen@@ sit@@ iv@@ ity of the fully dar@@ k@@ -@@ ada@@ p@@ ted human ey@@ e .
Wh@@ ich means that really is what you would see if you took a d@@ ive in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
"But just to try to pro@@ ve that fact to you , I &apos;ve b@@ rou@@ ght along some bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent plan@@ k@@ ton in what is und@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ed@@ ly a fo@@ ol@@ har@@ d@@ y at@@ tem@@ pt at a live demon@@ stra@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) So , if we could have the ligh@@ ts down and have it as dark in here as possible , I have a fl@@ ask that has bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent plan@@ k@@ ton in it ."
"And you &apos;ll not@@ e there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , ei@@ ther because they &apos;re de@@ ad — ( Laughter ) or because I need to s@@ ti@@ r them up in some way for you to see what bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence really looks like ."
( G@@ as@@ ps ) O@@ op@@ s . S@@ or@@ ry .
( Laughter ) I sp@@ end most of my time working in the dark ; I &apos;m used to that .
O@@ kay .
"So that light was made by a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent din@@ of@@ l@@ ag@@ el@@ l@@ ate , a sin@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led al@@ g@@ a ."
So why would a sin@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led al@@ g@@ a need to be able to produc@@ e light ?
"Well , it uses it to de@@ f@@ end itself from its pre@@ da@@ tors ."
The fl@@ as@@ h is like a scre@@ am for help .
"It &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m , and just like the al@@ ar@@ m on your c@@ ar or your h@@ ou@@ se , it &apos;s me@@ ant to c@@ ast un@@ wanted at@@ ten@@ tion on@@ to the in@@ tr@@ ud@@ er , ther@@ eb@@ y ei@@ ther lead@@ ing to his cap@@ ture or sc@@ aring him away ."
"There &apos;s a lot of an@@ im@@ als that use this tric@@ k , for example this black dra@@ gon@@ f@@ ish ."
It &apos;s got a light or@@ gan under its ey@@ e .
It &apos;s got a ch@@ in bar@@ be@@ l .
"It &apos;s got a lot of other light organs you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a min@@ ute ."
"So we had to ch@@ ase this in the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble for quite some@@ time , because the top spe@@ ed of this f@@ ish is one k@@ not , which was the top spe@@ ed of the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble ."
"But it was wor@@ th it , because we c@@ au@@ ght it in a spec@@ ial cap@@ ture dev@@ ice , b@@ rou@@ ght it up into the la@@ b on the ship , and then everything on this f@@ ish ligh@@ ts up ."
It &apos;s un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able .
The light organs under the ey@@ es are fl@@ ash@@ ing .
That ch@@ in bar@@ be@@ l is fl@@ ash@@ ing .
"It &apos;s got light organs on its bel@@ ly that are fl@@ ash@@ ing , f@@ in ligh@@ ts ."
It &apos;s a scre@@ am for help ; it &apos;s me@@ ant to at@@ trac@@ t at@@ ten@@ tion .
It &apos;s ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
And you nor@@ m@@ ally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed the l@@ um@@ in@@ esc@@ ence when we bring them up in n@@ ets .
There &apos;s other ways you can de@@ f@@ end yourself with light .
"For example , this sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p rel@@ eas@@ es its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent chem@@ ic@@ als into the water just the way a s@@ qu@@ id or an oc@@ t@@ op@@ us would rel@@ ease an ink cl@@ ou@@ d ."
This bl@@ in@@ ds or dis@@ trac@@ ts the pre@@ da@@ tor .
This little s@@ qu@@ id is called the fir@@ e sho@@ ot@@ er because of its ability to do this .
"Now it may look like a t@@ as@@ ty mor@@ se@@ l , or a pi@@ g &apos;s head with w@@ ings — ( Laughter ) but if it &apos;s att@@ ac@@ ked , it put@@ s out a bar@@ ra@@ ge of light — in fact , a bar@@ ra@@ ge of ph@@ ot@@ on t@@ or@@ p@@ ed@@ o@@ es ."
I just bar@@ ely got the ligh@@ ts out in time for you to be able to see those g@@ obs of light h@@ it@@ ting the trans@@ ect scre@@ en and then just g@@ lowing .
It &apos;s ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
So there &apos;s a lot of an@@ im@@ als in the open oc@@ e@@ an — most of them that make light .
"And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why ."
"They use it for fin@@ ding food , for at@@ trac@@ ting mat@@ es , for de@@ fen@@ ding against pre@@ da@@ tors ."
"But when you get down to the bot@@ tom of the oc@@ e@@ an , that &apos;s where things get really stran@@ ge ."
"And some of these an@@ im@@ als are probably insp@@ i@@ ration for the things you saw in &quot; &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; &quot; but you don &apos;t have to tr@@ av@@ el to P@@ and@@ or@@ a to see them ."
They &apos;re things like this .
"This is a gol@@ den co@@ ral , a bus@@ h ."
It gro@@ ws very s@@ low@@ ly .
"In fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3@@ ,000 years old , which is one reason that bot@@ tom tra@@ w@@ ling should not be al@@ lowed ."
The other reason is this amazing bus@@ h g@@ lo@@ ws .
"So if you br@@ us@@ h up against it , any place you br@@ u@@ shed against it , you get this tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing bl@@ u@@ e-@@ gre@@ en light that &apos;s just bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking ."
And you see things like this .
This looks like something out of a D@@ r@@ . S@@ e@@ us@@ s book — just all man@@ ner of cre@@ atures all over this thing .
And these are fl@@ y@@ tra@@ p an@@ e@@ mon@@ es .
"Now if you po@@ ke it , it pul@@ ls in its t@@ ent@@ ac@@ les ."
"But if you keep po@@ king it , it star@@ ts to produc@@ e light ."
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
"It produc@@ es these str@@ ings of light , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly as some form of de@@ fen@@ se ."
There are star@@ f@@ ish that can make light .
And there are br@@ it@@ tle stars that produc@@ e ban@@ ds of light that dan@@ ce along their ar@@ ms .
"This looks like a pl@@ ant , but it &apos;s actually an an@@ ima@@ l ."
And it an@@ ch@@ ors itself in the s@@ and by b@@ lowing up a bal@@ lo@@ on on the end of its st@@ oc@@ k .
"So it can actually hold itself in very st@@ rong curr@@ ents , as you see here ."
"But if we coll@@ ect it very gen@@ tly , and we bring it up into the la@@ b and just s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze it at the b@@ ase of the st@@ oc@@ k , it produc@@ es this light that pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ t@@ es from stem to the pl@@ u@@ me , chang@@ ing c@@ olo@@ r as it goes , from gre@@ en to bl@@ ue ."
C@@ ol@@ or@@ iz@@ ation and sound effec@@ ts ad@@ ded for you vie@@ wing pl@@ eas@@ ure .
( Laughter ) But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a se@@ a p@@ en .
It &apos;s got a br@@ it@@ tle star h@@ it@@ ch@@ ing a r@@ ide .
It &apos;s a gre@@ en sa@@ ber of light .
"And like the one you just saw , it can produc@@ e these as ban@@ ds of light ."
"So if I s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze the b@@ ase , the ban@@ ds go from b@@ ase to ti@@ p ."
"If I s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze the ti@@ p , they go from ti@@ p to b@@ ase ."
So what do you think happens if you s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze it in the middle ?
( G@@ as@@ ps ) I &apos;d be very interes@@ ted in your the@@ or@@ ies about what that &apos;s about .
"( Laughter ) So there &apos;s a language of light in the de@@ ep oc@@ e@@ an , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re im@@ it@@ ating a lot of these dis@@ pla@@ ys ."
This is an op@@ tical l@@ ure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic jel@@ l@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
It &apos;s just 1@@ 6 bl@@ ue L@@ E@@ D@@ s that we can program to do different typ@@ es of dis@@ pla@@ ys .
"And we view it with a c@@ amer@@ a system I develop@@ ed called E@@ ye@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ S@@ ea that uses far red light that &apos;s in@@ vis@@ ible to most an@@ im@@ als , so it &apos;s un@@ ob@@ tr@@ us@@ ive ."
So I just want to show you some of the respon@@ ses we &apos;ve el@@ ic@@ ited from an@@ im@@ als in the de@@ ep se@@ a .
So the c@@ amer@@ a &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high@@ -@@ res@@ olu@@ tion .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a ba@@ it bo@@ x with a bun@@ ch of — like the co@@ c@@ k@@ ro@@ ach@@ es of the oc@@ e@@ an — there are is@@ o@@ po@@ ds all over it .
And right in the front is the elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic jel@@ l@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
"And when it star@@ ts fl@@ ash@@ ing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the L@@ E@@ D@@ s that &apos;s fl@@ ash@@ ing very f@@ ast ."
"But as so@@ on as it star@@ ts to fl@@ as@@ h — and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blo@@ oms on the c@@ amer@@ a — I want you to look right here ."
There &apos;s something small there that respon@@ ds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
"It looks like a little of str@@ ing pe@@ ar@@ ls basically — in fact , three str@@ ings of pe@@ ar@@ ls ."
And this was very con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent .
"This was in the B@@ a@@ h@@ amas at about 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et ."
"We basically have a ch@@ at room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking ."
And I think this is actually a sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p that &apos;s rel@@ eas@@ ing its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent chem@@ ic@@ als into the water .
"But the co@@ ol thing is , we &apos;re talking to it ."
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s something s@@ ex@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) And then finally , I want to show you some respon@@ ses that we rec@@ or@@ ded with the world &apos;s first de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ a w@@ eb@@ c@@ am , which we had inst@@ all@@ ed in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey C@@ any@@ on last year ."
We &apos;ve only just be@@ gu@@ n to anal@@ y@@ ze all of this data .
"This is going to be a g@@ lowing s@@ our@@ ce first , which is like bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bac@@ ter@@ ia ."
And it is an op@@ tical c@@ ue that there &apos;s car@@ ri@@ on on the bot@@ tom of the oc@@ e@@ an .
"So this sc@@ av@@ en@@ ger comes in , which is a gi@@ ant si@@ x@@ g@@ ill shar@@ k ."
"And I can &apos;t cl@@ a@@ im for sure that the op@@ tical s@@ our@@ ce b@@ rou@@ ght it in , because there &apos;s ba@@ it right there ."
"But if it had been fol@@ lowing the od@@ or pl@@ u@@ me , it would have come in from the other direc@@ tion ."
And it does actually seem to be trying to e@@ at the elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic jel@@ l@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
That &apos;s a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ long gi@@ ant si@@ x@@ g@@ ill shar@@ k .
"O@@ kay , so this next one is from the w@@ eb@@ c@@ am , and it &apos;s going to be this p@@ in@@ whe@@ el dis@@ play ."
And this is a bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m .
"And that was a H@@ um@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t s@@ qu@@ id , a j@@ u@@ ven@@ ile H@@ um@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t s@@ qu@@ id , about three fe@@ et long ."
"This is at 3@@ ,000 fe@@ et in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey C@@ any@@ on ."
"But if it &apos;s a bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m , you wouldn &apos;t exp@@ ect it to att@@ ack the jel@@ l@@ y@@ f@@ ish direc@@ tly ."
It &apos;s sup@@ posed to be att@@ ac@@ king what &apos;s att@@ ac@@ king the jel@@ l@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
But we did see a bun@@ ch of respon@@ ses like this .
This guy is a little more con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ative .
"&quot; &quot; H@@ ey , wa@@ it a min@@ ute ."
There &apos;s sup@@ posed to be something else there . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s per@@ s@@ ist@@ ent .
He ke@@ e@@ ps coming back .
"And then he goes away for a few secon@@ ds to think about it some more , and thin@@ ks , &quot; Ma@@ ybe if I come in from a different an@@ gle . &quot;"
( Laughter ) N@@ ope .
"So we are starting to get a h@@ and@@ le on this , but only just the begin@@ n@@ ings ."
We need more ey@@ es on the process .
"So if any of you ever get a chan@@ ce to take a d@@ ive in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , by all means , c@@ lim@@ b in and take the pl@@ un@@ ge ."
"This is something that should be on everybody &apos;s b@@ uc@@ k@@ et l@@ ist , because we live on an oc@@ e@@ an planet ."
"M@@ ore than 90 percent , 9@@ 9 percent , of the living space on our planet is oc@@ e@@ an ."
"It &apos;s a mag@@ ical place fil@@ led with bre@@ a@@ th@@ taking light sho@@ ws and biz@@ ar@@ re and won@@ dro@@ us cre@@ atures , ali@@ en life for@@ ms that you don &apos;t have to tr@@ av@@ el to another planet to see ."
"But if you do take the pl@@ un@@ ge , pl@@ ease remember to turn out the ligh@@ ts ."
"But I war@@ n you , it &apos;s ad@@ dic@@ tive ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s been great , h@@ as@@ n &apos;t it ?"
I &apos;ve been blo@@ wn away by the whole thing .
"In fact , I &apos;m le@@ av@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) There have been three them@@ es run@@ ning through the con@@ fer@@ ence which are rel@@ ev@@ ant to what I want to talk about .
One is the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary evidence of human cre@@ ati@@ vity in all of the pres@@ ent@@ ations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here .
Just the vari@@ ety of it and the ran@@ ge of it .
I have an inter@@ est in education .
"A@@ c@@ tually , what I find is everybody has an inter@@ est in education ."
D@@ on &apos;t you ?
"If you &apos;re at a din@@ ner par@@ ty , and you say you work in education — A@@ c@@ tually , you &apos;re not often at din@@ ner par@@ ties , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly ."
"( Laughter ) If you work in education , you &apos;re not asked . ( Laughter )"
"And you &apos;re never asked back , cur@@ i@@ ously . That &apos;s stran@@ ge to me ."
"But if you ask about their education , they p@@ in you to the w@@ all ."
"Because it &apos;s one of those things that goes de@@ ep with people , am I right ?"
"So I have a big inter@@ est in education , and I think we all do ."
"I mean , S@@ ir@@ ena last night was a mar@@ vel , wasn &apos;t she ?"
What you have there is a person of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ dic@@ ation who found a tal@@ ent .
"And my con@@ ten@@ tion is , all kids have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous tal@@ ents ."
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about cre@@ ati@@ vity .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"That was it , by the way ."
"Well , I was born ... no . ( Laughter )"
The teacher was fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated .
"But J@@ am@@ es got the part of J@@ o@@ se@@ p@@ h , which we were th@@ r@@ il@@ led about ."
We consid@@ er@@ ed this to be one of the le@@ ad parts .
"We had the place c@@ ram@@ m@@ ed ful@@ l of ag@@ ents in T@@ -@@ shir@@ ts : &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es R@@ ob@@ in@@ son I@@ S J@@ o@@ se@@ p@@ h ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He didn &apos;t have to spe@@ ak , but you know the bit where the three kin@@ gs come in ?"
This really happened .
"If they don &apos;t know , they &apos;ll have a go ."
A@@ m I right ? They &apos;re not fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of being wrong .
I don &apos;t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being cre@@ ative .
"What we do know is , if you &apos;re not pre@@ par@@ ed to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything or@@ ig@@ in@@ al — if you &apos;re not pre@@ par@@ ed to be wrong ."
"And by the time they get to be ad@@ ults , most kids have lo@@ st that cap@@ ac@@ ity ."
They have become fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of being wrong .
And the res@@ ult is that we are educ@@ ating people out of their cre@@ ative cap@@ ac@@ ities .
"P@@ ic@@ as@@ so once said this , he said that all children are born art@@ ists ."
The problem is to re@@ ma@@ in an art@@ ist as we grow up .
"I believe this pas@@ sion@@ ately , that we don &apos;t grow into cre@@ ati@@ vity , we grow out of it ."
"O@@ r rather , we get educ@@ ated out of it ."
So why is this ?
I liv@@ ed in St@@ rat@@ for@@ d@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ A@@ v@@ on until about five years ago .
"In fact , we mov@@ ed from St@@ rat@@ for@@ d to L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es ."
A@@ re you struc@@ k by a new thought ? I was .
"You don &apos;t think of S@@ h@@ ak@@ es@@ pe@@ are having a father , do you ?"
"@@ Do you ? Because you don &apos;t think of S@@ h@@ ak@@ es@@ pe@@ are being a child , do you ?"
S@@ h@@ ak@@ es@@ pe@@ are being seven ?
I never thought of it .
"I mean , he was seven at some point ."
"He was in somebody &apos;s English class , wasn &apos;t he ?"
&quot; M@@ ust try har@@ der . &quot; ( Laughter )
&quot; It &apos;s con@@ f@@ using everybody . &quot; ( Laughter )
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we mov@@ ed from St@@ rat@@ for@@ d to L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , and I just want to say a word about the trans@@ ition ."
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my dau@@ ghter &apos;s 1@@ 6 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es .
"He lo@@ ved it , but he had a gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end in Engl@@ and ."
"This was the love of his life , S@@ ara@@ h ."
He &apos;d known her for a mon@@ th .
"( Laughter ) M@@ ind you , they &apos;d had their f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h an@@ n@@ iver@@ s@@ ary , because it &apos;s a long time when you &apos;re 1@@ 6 ."
E@@ very one . D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter where you go .
"You &apos;d think it would be o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , but it isn &apos;t ."
"A@@ t the top are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and langu@@ ages , then the hum@@ an@@ ities , and at the bot@@ tom are the ar@@ ts ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ where on Earth .
"And in pretty much every system too , there &apos;s a h@@ ier@@ arch@@ y within the ar@@ ts ."
There isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that teach@@ es dan@@ ce every@@ day to children the way we te@@ ach them ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics . Why ?
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
"We all have bo@@ dies , don &apos;t we ? D@@ id I mis@@ s a me@@ et@@ ing ?"
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it ?
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
"And I used to be one , so there ."
"( Laughter ) And I like univer@@ sity prof@@ ess@@ ors , but you know , we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high@@ -@@ water mar@@ k of all human achi@@ ev@@ ement ."
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
"But they &apos;re rather cur@@ ious , and I say this out of af@@ fec@@ tion for them ."
"There &apos;s something cur@@ ious about prof@@ ess@@ ors in my experience — not all of them , but t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , they live in their head@@ s ."
"They &apos;re dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died , you know , in a kind of liter@@ al way ."
They look u@@ po@@ n their body as a form of trans@@ port for their head@@ s .
It &apos;s a way of getting their head to me@@ et@@ ings .
"And there , you will see it ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wn men and women w@@ ri@@ thing un@@ contro@@ l@@ l@@ ably , off the be@@ at ."
O@@ ur education system is predic@@ ated on the idea of ac@@ ade@@ mic ability .
"A@@ ro@@ und the world , there were no public syst@@ ems of education , really , before the 19@@ th century ."
They all came into being to me@@ et the needs of ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al@@ ism .
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one , that the most us@@ ef@@ ul sub@@ jects for work are at the top ."
"D@@ on &apos;t do mus@@ ic , you &apos;re not going to be a mus@@ ician ; don &apos;t do art , you won &apos;t be an art@@ ist ."
The whole world is en@@ gul@@ f@@ ed in a revolu@@ tion .
"And the second is ac@@ ade@@ mic ability , which has really come to domin@@ ate our view of intelligence , because the univer@@ s@@ ities des@@ ign@@ ed the system in their imag@@ e ."
"If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a pro@@ trac@@ ted process of univer@@ sity en@@ tr@@ ance ."
"In the next 30 years , ac@@ cor@@ ding to U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O , more people wor@@ ld@@ w@@ ide will be grad@@ u@@ ating through education than since the beginning of history ."
"M@@ ore people , and it &apos;s the com@@ bin@@ ation of all the things we &apos;ve tal@@ ked about — technology and its trans@@ forma@@ tion ef@@ fect on work , and demo@@ graph@@ y and the huge explo@@ sion in population ."
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t that true ?
"If you didn &apos;t have a job , it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one ."
We need to rad@@ ically re@@ think our view of intelligence .
"We think in ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t terms , we think in mov@@ ement ."
"If you look at the inter@@ ac@@ tions of a human brain , as we heard y@@ es@@ ter@@ day from a number of pres@@ ent@@ ations , intelligence is wonder@@ fully inter@@ ac@@ tive ."
The brain isn &apos;t d@@ ivid@@ ed into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments .
"In fact , cre@@ ati@@ vity — which I defin@@ e as the process of having or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ideas that have value — more often than not comes about through the inter@@ action of different dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary ways of seeing things ."
"B@@ y the way , there &apos;s a sh@@ af@@ t of ner@@ ves that jo@@ ins the two hal@@ ves of the brain called the cor@@ p@@ us cal@@ lo@@ su@@ m ."
"F@@ ol@@ lowing off from H@@ el@@ en y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , this is probably why women are better at mul@@ ti@@ -@@ t@@ as@@ king ."
"Because you are , ar@@ en &apos;t you ?"
"There &apos;s a ra@@ ft of research , but I know it from my person@@ al life ."
"If my wi@@ fe is co@@ o@@ king a me@@ al at home — which is not often , th@@ an@@ k@@ fully ."
"If I &apos;m co@@ o@@ king , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ yed ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; Ter@@ ry , pl@@ ease , I &apos;m trying to fr@@ y an eg@@ g in here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; G@@ ive me a bre@@ ak . &quot; ( Laughter )"
"A@@ c@@ tually , do you know that old philosoph@@ ical thing , if a t@@ ree f@@ all@@ s in a for@@ est and nob@@ ody he@@ ars it , did it happen ?"
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber that old ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut ?
"I saw a great t-@@ shir@@ t rec@@ ently , which said , &quot; &quot; If a man speak@@ s his mind in a for@@ est , and no woman he@@ ars him , is he still wrong ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the third thing about intelligence is , it &apos;s dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ."
"I used to be on the bo@@ ard of The R@@ o@@ y@@ al B@@ all@@ et , as you can see ."
It wasn &apos;t an av@@ a@@ il@@ able con@@ d@@ ition .
( Laughter ) P@@ eople wer@@ en &apos;t aw@@ are they could have that . ( Laughter )
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , she went to see this speci@@ al@@ ist ."
"So , this o@@ ak@@ -@@ pan@@ el@@ ed room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sa@@ t on this cha@@ ir at the end , and she sa@@ t on her hands for 20 minutes while this man tal@@ ked to her mother about the problems G@@ il@@ lian was having at school ."
"Because she was dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing people ; her ho@@ me@@ work was always l@@ ate ; and so on , little k@@ id of eight ."
"In the end , the doc@@ tor went and sa@@ t next to G@@ il@@ lian , and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve list@@ en@@ ed to all these things your mother &apos;s told me , I need to spe@@ ak to her p@@ riv@@ ately ."
"But as they went out of the room , he turned on the radi@@ o that was sit@@ ting on his des@@ k ."
"And when they got out , he said to her mother , &quot; &quot; Just st@@ and and wat@@ ch her . &quot; &quot; And the min@@ ute they left the room , she was on her fe@@ et , mov@@ ing to the mus@@ ic ."
"And they wat@@ ched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r@@ s@@ . L@@ y@@ n@@ ne , G@@ il@@ lian isn &apos;t sic@@ k ; she &apos;s a dan@@ cer ."
"@@ T@@ ake her to a dan@@ ce school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was ful@@ l of people like me .
P@@ eople who couldn &apos;t s@@ it still .
P@@ eople who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"They did b@@ all@@ et , they did ta@@ p , j@@ az@@ z ; they did moder@@ n ; they did con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary ."
She was even@@ tually au@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed for the R@@ o@@ y@@ al B@@ all@@ et S@@ cho@@ ol ; she bec@@ ame a so@@ lo@@ ist ; she had a wonderful career at the R@@ o@@ y@@ al B@@ all@@ et .
S@@ omebody else might have put her on medic@@ ation and told her to cal@@ m down .
( Applause ) What I think it comes to is this : A@@ l G@@ ore spo@@ ke the other night about ec@@ ology and the revolu@@ tion that was tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed by R@@ ach@@ el C@@ ars@@ on .
O@@ ur education system has min@@ ed our min@@ ds in the way that we st@@ ri@@ p@@ -@@ mine the e@@ arth : for a particular com@@ mod@@ ity .
"And for the future , it won &apos;t ser@@ ve us ."
"There was a wonderful quot@@ e by J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k , who said , &quot; &quot; If all the in@@ sec@@ ts were to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar from the Earth , within 50 years all life on Earth would end ."
"If all human be@@ ings disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed from the Earth , within 50 years all for@@ ms of life would fl@@ our@@ ish . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s right ."
What TE@@ D cel@@ eb@@ rat@@ es is the gi@@ ft of the human imag@@ in@@ ation .
We have to be care@@ ful now that we use this gi@@ ft w@@ is@@ ely and that we av@@ ert some of the scen@@ ari@@ os that we &apos;ve tal@@ ked about .
And the only way we &apos;ll do it is by seeing our cre@@ ative cap@@ ac@@ ities for the ri@@ ch@@ ness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are .
And our job is to help them make something of it .
Thank you very much .

There are a few things that all of us need .

"( Laughter ) And I know what some of you are thinking , and you &apos;re mo@@ st@@ ly right ."
I can and do just use the men &apos;s room most of the time these days .
"But that doesn &apos;t sol@@ ve my change room dil@@ em@@ mas , does it ?"
And I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to use the men &apos;s room because I &apos;m not a man .
I &apos;m a tr@@ ans person .
And now we &apos;ve got these fe@@ ar@@ mon@@ ger@@ ing polit@@ ici@@ ans that keep trying to pas@@ s these ba@@ th@@ room bil@@ ls .
H@@ ave you heard about these ?
They try to le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ate to try and force people like my@@ self to use the ba@@ th@@ room that they de@@ e@@ m most appro@@ pri@@ ate ac@@ cor@@ ding to the gen@@ der I was as@@ sign@@ ed at bir@@ th .

"And every time one of these polit@@ ici@@ ans br@@ ings one of these bil@@ ls to the table , I can &apos;t help but won@@ der , you know , just who will and exactly how would we go about en@@ for@@ cing laws like these . R@@ ight ?"
P@@ an@@ ty ch@@ ec@@ ks ?
R@@ e@@ ally .
G@@ en@@ ital in@@ spec@@ tions outside of b@@ ath change ro@@ oms at public po@@ ols ?
There &apos;s no le@@ ga@@ l or e@@ th@@ ical or pla@@ us@@ ible way to en@@ force laws like these any@@ way .
They ex@@ ist only to fo@@ st@@ er fear and pro@@ mo@@ te tr@@ an@@ sp@@ h@@ ob@@ ia .
They don &apos;t make any@@ one saf@@ er .
But they do for sure make the world more dan@@ ger@@ ous for some of us .
"And mean@@ while , our tr@@ ans children suf@@ fer ."
"They dro@@ p out of school , or they op@@ t out of life al@@ together ."
"@@ Tr@@ ans people , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally tr@@ ans and gen@@ der@@ -@@ n@@ on@@ con@@ form@@ ing y@@ ou@@ th face ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al chall@@ eng@@ es when acc@@ ess@@ ing po@@ ols and g@@ y@@ ms , but also univer@@ s@@ ities , ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies ."
D@@ on &apos;t even get me started on how they treat us in air@@ por@@ ts .
"If we don &apos;t move now to make sure that these places are tr@@ ul@@ y open and acc@@ es@@ si@@ ble to everyone , then we just need to get h@@ on@@ est and qu@@ it call@@ ing them public places ."
"We need to just ad@@ mit that they are really only open for people who f@@ it ne@@ at@@ ly into one of two gen@@ der bo@@ x@@ es , which I do not ."
I never have .
And this star@@ ts very early .
I know a little gir@@ l . She &apos;s the dau@@ ghter of a fri@@ end of mine .
She &apos;s a self-@@ id@@ enti@@ fied t@@ om@@ bo@@ y .
"I &apos;m talking about co@@ w@@ bo@@ y bo@@ ots and C@@ at@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ar y@@ el@@ low to@@ y tr@@ uc@@ ks and bu@@ g j@@ ars , the whole n@@ ine yar@@ ds ."
One time I asked her what her fav@@ or@@ ite c@@ olo@@ r was .
"She told me , &quot; &quot; C@@ amo@@ uf@@ l@@ age . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that aw@@ es@@ ome little k@@ id , she came home from school last O@@ c@@ t@@ ob@@ er from her half day of pres@@ cho@@ ol with so@@ g@@ gy pan@@ ts on because the other kids at school were h@@ aras@@ sing her when she tri@@ ed to use the girls &apos; ba@@ th@@ room ."
And the teacher had already in@@ struc@@ ted her to st@@ ay out of the bo@@ ys &apos; ba@@ th@@ room .
"And she had dr@@ ank two gl@@ as@@ ses of that red j@@ u@@ ice at the H@@ al@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ty , and I mean , who can res@@ ist that red j@@ u@@ ice , right ? It &apos;s so good ."
And she couldn &apos;t hold her pe@@ e any longer .
H@@ er and her clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es were four years old .
They already fel@@ t em@@ power@@ ed enough to pol@@ ice her use of the so@@ -@@ called public ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms .
She was four years old .
She had already been t@@ au@@ ght the br@@ ut@@ al les@@ son that there was no ba@@ th@@ room do@@ or at pres@@ cho@@ ol with a si@@ g@@ n on it that wel@@ com@@ ed people like her .
"She &apos;d already learned that ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms were going to be a problem , and that problem started with her and was h@@ ers al@@ one ."
"So my fri@@ end asked me to talk to her little dau@@ ghter , and I did ."
"I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got ol@@ der , but I couldn &apos;t ."
"So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened , asked her to tell me how it made her feel ."
"So I told her that she wasn &apos;t al@@ one and that it wasn &apos;t right what had happened to her , and then she asked me if I had ever pe@@ ed in my pan@@ ts before ."
"I said y@@ es , I had , but not for a really long time ."
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich of course was a li@@ e , because you know how you h@@ it , like , 4@@ 2 or 4@@ 3 , and sometimes you just , I don &apos;t know , you pe@@ e a little bit when you cou@@ gh or s@@ ne@@ eze , when you &apos;re run@@ ning up@@ st@@ air@@ s , or you &apos;re stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ing ."
D@@ on &apos;t li@@ e .
It happens . R@@ ight ?
"She doesn &apos;t need to know that , I figure ."
"( Laughter ) I told her , when you get ol@@ der , your bl@@ ad@@ der is going to grow big@@ ger , too ."
"When you get old like me , you &apos;re going to be able to hold your pe@@ e for way longer , I prom@@ ised her ."
&quot; Un@@ til you can get home ? &quot;
she asked me .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , until you can get home . &quot; &quot; She se@@ em@@ ed to take some com@@ for@@ t in that ."
"So let &apos;s just build some single st@@ all , gen@@ der@@ -@@ ne@@ ut@@ ral ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms with a little ben@@ ch for getting changed into your g@@ y@@ m clo@@ th@@ es ."
This we can do .
So let &apos;s just do it .
"If you can &apos;t bring yourself to care enough about people like me , then what about women and girls with body imag@@ e issu@@ es ?"
What about any@@ one with body imag@@ e stuff going on ?
"What about that bo@@ y at school who is a fo@@ ot shor@@ ter than his clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es , wh@@ ose vo@@ ice still h@@ as@@ n &apos;t dro@@ pped yet ? H@@ ey ?"
"O@@ h , gra@@ de eight , what a c@@ ru@@ el ma@@ st@@ er you can be ."
R@@ ight ?
What about people with an@@ x@@ i@@ ety issu@@ es ?
What about people with disa@@ bil@@ ities or who need as@@ sis@@ tan@@ ce in there ?
"What about fol@@ ks with bo@@ dies who , for wh@@ at@@ ever reason , don &apos;t f@@ it into the main@@ stre@@ am idea of what a body should look like ?"
"@@ How many of us still feel sh@@ y or af@@ ra@@ id to dis@@ ro@@ be in front of our pe@@ ers , and how many of us al@@ low that fear to keep us from something as important as physical ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ?"
W@@ ould all those people not ben@@ ef@@ it from these single st@@ all fac@@ il@@ ities ?
"We can &apos;t change tr@@ an@@ sp@@ h@@ ob@@ ic min@@ ds over@@ night , but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world saf@@ er for all of us ."
Thank you for list@@ en@@ ing .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ bed@@ ded in a very large co@@ smo@@ s , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at ei@@ ther of those sc@@ al@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins hav@@ en &apos;t evol@@ ved to understand the world at that sc@@ ale ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we &apos;re tra@@ pped on this very th@@ in sl@@ ice of per@@ cep@@ tion right in the middle ."
"But it gets stran@@ ge , because even at that sl@@ ice of reality that we call home , we &apos;re not seeing most of the action that &apos;s going on ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
"This is light w@@ aves , elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation that b@@ oun@@ ces off ob@@ jects and it h@@ its speci@@ aliz@@ ed re@@ cep@@ tors in the back of our ey@@ es ."
But we &apos;re not seeing all the w@@ aves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tr@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"So you have radi@@ o w@@ aves and m@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ aves and X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys and gam@@ ma ra@@ ys pas@@ sing through your body right now and you &apos;re completely un@@ aw@@ are of it , because you don &apos;t come with the pro@@ per bi@@ ological re@@ cep@@ tors for pic@@ king it up ."
"There are thousands of c@@ ell ph@@ one con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions pas@@ sing through you right now , and you &apos;re ut@@ ter@@ ly bl@@ ind to it ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ her@@ ently un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ nak@@ es incl@@ u@@ de some in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed in their reality , and h@@ on@@ ey@@ be@@ es incl@@ u@@ de ul@@ tr@@ av@@ i@@ ol@@ et in their view of the world , and of course we build ma@@ chin@@ es in the da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our c@@ ars to pic@@ k up on sign@@ als in the radi@@ o f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy ran@@ ge , and we built ma@@ chin@@ es in ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als to pic@@ k up on the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ran@@ ge ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at le@@ ast not yet , because you don &apos;t come equ@@ ip@@ ped with the pro@@ per sen@@ s@@ ors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ stra@@ ined by our bi@@ ology , and that goes against the common sense not@@ ion that our ey@@ es and our e@@ ars and our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ jec@@ tive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , our bra@@ ins are sam@@ pl@@ ing just a little bit of the world ."
"Now , across the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , different an@@ im@@ als pic@@ k up on different parts of reality ."
"So in the bl@@ ind and de@@ a@@ f world of the tic@@ k , the important sign@@ als are tem@@ per@@ ature and b@@ ut@@ y@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ o@@ st k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish , its sen@@ s@@ ory world is l@@ av@@ ish@@ ly col@@ ored by elec@@ tr@@ ical fiel@@ ds ; and for the e@@ ch@@ olo@@ c@@ ating b@@ at , its reality is con@@ struc@@ ted out of air com@@ pres@@ sion w@@ aves ."
"That &apos;s the sl@@ ice of their ec@@ o@@ system that they can pic@@ k up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"It &apos;s called the um@@ wel@@ t , which is the G@@ er@@ man word for the sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing world ."
"Now , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , every an@@ ima@@ l as@@ sum@@ es that its um@@ wel@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ jec@@ tive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ y@@ ond what we can sense ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , what we all do is we ac@@ cept reality as it &apos;s pres@@ ented to us ."
Let &apos;s do a conscious@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ mag@@ ine that you are a blo@@ od@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about sm@@ el@@ ling .
"You &apos;ve got a long s@@ n@@ out that has 200 million sc@@ ent re@@ cep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et no@@ str@@ ils that at@@ trac@@ t and tra@@ p sc@@ ent mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es , and your no@@ str@@ ils even have s@@ lit@@ s so you can take big no@@ se@@ ful@@ s of air ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is about sm@@ ell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your trac@@ ks with a re@@ vel@@ ation ."
"You look at your human ow@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the p@@ it@@ i@@ ful , im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed no@@ se of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ eb@@ le little no@@ se@@ ful of air ?
"@@ How can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 yar@@ ds away , or that your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or was on this very spo@@ t six hours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re hum@@ ans , we &apos;ve never experien@@ ced that world of sm@@ ell , so we don &apos;t mis@@ s it , because we are fir@@ m@@ ly s@@ et@@ t@@ led into our um@@ wel@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be st@@ uc@@ k there ?"
"So as a neuro@@ scient@@ ist , I &apos;m interes@@ ted in the way that technology might exp@@ and our um@@ wel@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So we already know that we can mar@@ ry our technology to our bi@@ ology , because there are hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of people wal@@ king around with ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial he@@ aring and ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial vis@@ ion ."
"So the way this works is , you take a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one and you dig@@ it@@ ize the sign@@ al , and you put an elec@@ tro@@ de st@@ ri@@ p direc@@ tly into the in@@ ner e@@ ar ."
"O@@ r , with the re@@ tin@@ al im@@ pl@@ ant , you take a c@@ amer@@ a and you dig@@ it@@ ize the sign@@ al , and then you pl@@ u@@ g an elec@@ tro@@ de g@@ ri@@ d direc@@ tly into the op@@ tic ner@@ ve ."
"And as rec@@ ently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scient@@ ists who thought these tech@@ nologi@@ es wouldn &apos;t work ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these tech@@ nologi@@ es spe@@ ak the language of S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , and it &apos;s not exactly the same di@@ al@@ ect as our natural bi@@ ological sense organs ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain fig@@ ures out how to use the sign@@ als just fin@@ e .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big sec@@ ret : Y@@ our brain is not he@@ aring or seeing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is loc@@ ked in a va@@ ult of sil@@ ence and dar@@ k@@ ness inside your sk@@ ul@@ l .
"A@@ ll it ever se@@ es are elec@@ tro@@ chem@@ ical sign@@ als that come in along different data c@@ ab@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
"Now , amaz@@ ing@@ ly , the brain is really good at taking in these sign@@ als and ex@@ trac@@ ting patterns and as@@ si@@ g@@ ning mean@@ ing , so that it takes this in@@ ner co@@ smo@@ s and put@@ s together a story of this , your sub@@ jec@@ tive world ."
"But here &apos;s the k@@ ey point : Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know , and it doesn &apos;t care , where it gets the data from ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever information comes in , it just fig@@ ures out what to do with it ."
And this is a very ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally a gener@@ al pur@@ pose comput@@ ing dev@@ ice , and it just takes in everything and fig@@ ures out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , fre@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to tin@@ k@@ er around with different sor@@ ts of in@@ put chan@@ nel@@ s ."
"So I call this the P@@ .@@ H@@ . mo@@ del of evolution , and I don &apos;t want to get too te@@ chn@@ ical here , but P@@ .@@ H@@ . stan@@ ds for P@@ ot@@ a@@ to H@@ e@@ ad , and I use this name to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that all these sen@@ s@@ ors that we know and love , like our ey@@ es and our e@@ ars and our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps , these are mer@@ ely peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al pl@@ u@@ g@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ play dev@@ ices : You s@@ tic@@ k them in , and you &apos;re good to go ."
The brain fig@@ ures out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , you find lots of peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"So s@@ nak@@ es have he@@ at p@@ its with which to det@@ ect in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed , and the gh@@ o@@ st k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish has elec@@ tro@@ re@@ cep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ no@@ sed mo@@ le has this app@@ en@@ da@@ ge with 2@@ 2 fin@@ g@@ ers on it with which it fe@@ els around and con@@ struc@@ ts a 3@@ D mo@@ del of the world , and many bir@@ ds have mag@@ n@@ et@@ ite so they can ori@@ ent to the mag@@ ne@@ tic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to contin@@ u@@ ally re@@ des@@ ign the brain .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , with the princi@@ pl@@ es of brain oper@@ ation est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is des@@ ig@@ ning new peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The les@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really spec@@ ial or fundamental about the bi@@ ology that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ her@@ ited from a compl@@ ex ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to s@@ tic@@ k with , and our best pro@@ of of princi@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion ."
"And that re@@ fer@@ s to fe@@ ed@@ ing information into the brain v@@ ia un@@ us@@ ual sen@@ s@@ ory chan@@ nel@@ s , and the brain just fig@@ ures out what to do with it ."
"Now , that might sound spec@@ ul@@ ative , but the first p@@ aper demon@@ stra@@ ting this was published in the j@@ our@@ n@@ al N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
"So if you w@@ ig@@ gle a co@@ f@@ fe@@ e c@@ up in front of the c@@ amer@@ a , you &apos;re feel@@ ing that in your back , and amaz@@ ing@@ ly , bl@@ ind people got pretty good at being able to de@@ ter@@ mine what was in front of the c@@ amer@@ a just by feel@@ ing it in the small of their back ."
"Now , there have been many moder@@ n in@@ car@@ na@@ tions of this ."
"And it doesn &apos;t have to be through the e@@ ars : this system uses an elec@@ tro@@ t@@ ac@@ t@@ ile g@@ ri@@ d on the for@@ e@@ head , so wh@@ at@@ ever &apos;s in front of the video fe@@ ed , you &apos;re feel@@ ing it on your for@@ e@@ head ."
Why the for@@ e@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most moder@@ n in@@ car@@ na@@ tion is called the bra@@ in@@ port , and this is a little elec@@ t@@ rog@@ ri@@ d that s@@ its on your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e , and the video fe@@ ed gets turned into these little elec@@ tro@@ t@@ ac@@ t@@ ile sign@@ als , and bl@@ ind people get so good at using this that they can th@@ row a b@@ all into a bas@@ k@@ et , or they can nav@@ i@@ ga@@ te compl@@ ex ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds completely in@@ san@@ e , right ?"
"But remember , all vis@@ ion ever is is elec@@ tro@@ chem@@ ical sign@@ als cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the sign@@ als come from .
It just fig@@ ures out what to do with them .
And here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets con@@ v@@ ert@@ ed in some way so that a de@@ a@@ f person can understand what is being said .
"And we wanted to do this , given the power and ub@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of port@@ able comput@@ ing , we wanted to make sure that this would run on c@@ ell ph@@ ones and t@@ ab@@ l@@ ets , and also we wanted to make this a we@@ ar@@ able , something that you could we@@ ar under your clo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing , my sound is getting cap@@ tu@@ red by the t@@ ab@@ let , and then it &apos;s getting ma@@ pped on@@ to a v@@ est that &apos;s c@@ over@@ ed in vi@@ b@@ rat@@ ory mo@@ tors , just like the mo@@ tors in your c@@ ell ph@@ one . So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing ,"
the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated to a pat@@ tern of vibra@@ tion on the v@@ est .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tual : this t@@ ab@@ let is trans@@ mit@@ ting B@@ l@@ u@@ et@@ o@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m we@@ aring the v@@ est right now ."
So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated into d@@ y@@ na@@ mic patterns of vibra@@ tion .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the son@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been tes@@ ting this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start understanding the language of the v@@ est ."
So this is J@@ on@@ a@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a ma@@ st@@ er &apos;s de@@ gre@@ e .
"He was born prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ wel@@ t that &apos;s un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to him ."
"So we had J@@ on@@ a@@ than tra@@ in with the v@@ est for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t N@@ ov@@ ich : You .
"D@@ av@@ id E@@ ag@@ le@@ man : So S@@ c@@ ot@@ t says a word , J@@ on@@ a@@ than fe@@ els it on the v@@ est , and he writ@@ es it on the bo@@ ard ."
S@@ N : Wh@@ ere . Wh@@ ere .
D@@ E : J@@ on@@ a@@ than is able to trans@@ l@@ ate this compl@@ ic@@ ated pat@@ tern of vibra@@ tions into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"D@@ E : Now , he &apos;s not doing this — ( Applause ) — J@@ on@@ a@@ than is not doing this conscious@@ ly , because the patterns are too compl@@ ic@@ ated , but his brain is starting to un@@ loc@@ k the pat@@ tern that al@@ lo@@ ws it to figure out what the data mean , and our expec@@ t@@ ation is that , after we@@ aring this for about three months , he will have a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience of he@@ aring in the same way that when a bl@@ ind person pas@@ ses a fin@@ ger over bra@@ il@@ le , the mean@@ ing comes direc@@ tly off the p@@ age without any consci@@ ous inter@@ ven@@ tion at all ."
"Now , this technology has the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to be a game@@ -@@ chan@@ ger , because the only other solu@@ tion for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ pl@@ ant , and that requ@@ ir@@ es an inv@@ as@@ ive sur@@ ger@@ y ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ aper than a co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ pl@@ ant , which op@@ ens up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the po@@ or@@ est countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed by our results with sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ d@@ ition ."
"@@ How could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a completely new kind of sense , to exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed real@@ -@@ time data from the In@@ tern@@ et direc@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they devel@@ op a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
A sub@@ ject is feel@@ ing a real@@ -@@ time stre@@ am@@ ing fe@@ ed from the N@@ et of data for five secon@@ ds .
"Th@@ en , two b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons ap@@ pe@@ ar , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He makes a cho@@ ice , and he gets fe@@ ed@@ back after one second ."
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ ing is real@@ -@@ time data from the st@@ oc@@ k market , and he &apos;s making buy and s@@ ell dec@@ is@@ ions ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re seeing is , can we exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t so that he comes to have , after s@@ ever@@ al weeks , a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience of the economic mov@@ em@@ ents of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll re@@ port on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ uring the tal@@ ks this mor@@ ning , we &apos;ve been aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically sc@@ ra@@ ping T@@ w@@ it@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an aut@@ o@@ mat@@ ed senti@@ ment anal@@ y@@ sis , which means , are people using pos@@ itive words or ne@@ ga@@ tive words or ne@@ ut@@ ral ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am pl@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te emo@@ tion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lo@@ v@@ ing this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a big@@ ger experience than a human can nor@@ m@@ ally have .
We &apos;re also exp@@ anding the um@@ vel@@ t of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the v@@ est is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different meas@@ ures from this qu@@ ad@@ c@@ op@@ ter , so p@@ it@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w and ro@@ ll and ori@@ ent@@ ation and head@@ ing , and that impro@@ ves this p@@ il@@ ot &apos;s ability to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally like he &apos;s ex@@ ten@@ ding his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vis@@ ion@@ ing is taking a moder@@ n co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it ful@@ l of gau@@ g@@ es and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between acc@@ ess@@ ing big data and experien@@ cing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possi@@ bil@@ ities on the hor@@ iz@@ on for human ex@@ pan@@ sion .
"@@ Just imagine an astro@@ na@@ ut being able to feel the over@@ all health of the In@@ ter@@ national S@@ p@@ ace St@@ ation , or , for that matter , having you feel the in@@ vis@@ ible st@@ ates of your own health , like your blo@@ od su@@ ga@@ r and the state of your m@@ ic@@ rob@@ i@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0-@@ de@@ gre@@ e vis@@ ion or seeing in in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed or ul@@ tr@@ av@@ i@@ ol@@ et ."
"So the k@@ ey is this : A@@ s we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increas@@ ing@@ ly be able to cho@@ ose our own peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"We no longer have to wa@@ it for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ s@@ ory gi@@ f@@ ts on her tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es , but instead , like any good par@@ ent , she &apos;s given us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and defin@@ e our own tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : C@@ an you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ eah .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I fel@@ t ap@@ plause on the v@@ est ."
It &apos;s n@@ ice . It &apos;s like a mas@@ sa@@ ge . ( Laughter ) CA : T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &apos;s going crazy . T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &apos;s going mad .
So that st@@ oc@@ k market experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to write to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
"C@@ A : Well look , just to be sk@@ ep@@ tical for a min@@ ute , I mean , this is amazing , but isn &apos;t most of the evidence so far that sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion works , not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily that sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ d@@ ition works ?"
"I mean , isn &apos;t it possible that the bl@@ ind person can see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e because the vis@@ ual cor@@ te@@ x is still there , ready to process , and that that is needed as part of it ?"
D@@ E : That &apos;s a great question . We actually have no idea what the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical lim@@ its are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
"The gener@@ al story , though , is that it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily f@@ le@@ x@@ ible ."
"So when a person goes bl@@ ind , what we used to call their vis@@ ual cor@@ te@@ x gets taken over by other things , by tou@@ ch , by he@@ aring , by v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary ."
So what that tel@@ ls us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tric@@ k pon@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of comput@@ ations on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through b@@ um@@ ps on their fin@@ g@@ ers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a the@@ or@@ e@@ tical li@@ mit that we know the edge of .
"C@@ A : If this ch@@ ec@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be del@@ u@@ g@@ ed ."
There are so many possible ap@@ plic@@ ations for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exc@@ ited about , the direc@@ tion it might go ?"
"D@@ E : I mean , I think there &apos;s a lot of ap@@ plic@@ ations here ."
"The k@@ ey is this : O@@ ur vis@@ ual syst@@ ems are good at det@@ ec@@ ting bl@@ obs and ed@@ g@@ es , but they &apos;re really bad at what our world has become , which is scre@@ ens with lots and lots of data ."
We have to cra@@ w@@ l that with our at@@ ten@@ tional syst@@ ems .
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re st@@ anding around ."
"So I think he@@ av@@ y ma@@ chin@@ er@@ y , saf@@ ety , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ t@@ ory , of your equ@@ ip@@ ment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ av@@ id E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ lowing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m going to talk about a fa@@ il@@ ure of in@@ tu@@ ition that many of us suf@@ fer from .
It &apos;s really a fa@@ il@@ ure to det@@ ect a certain kind of dan@@ ger .
"I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a scen@@ ari@@ o that I think is both ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying and likely to oc@@ c@@ ur , and that &apos;s not a good com@@ bin@@ ation , as it turns out ."
"And yet rather than be sc@@ ar@@ ed , most of you will feel that what I &apos;m talking about is kind of co@@ ol ."
I &apos;m going to descri@@ be how the ga@@ ins we make in ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence could ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely des@@ tro@@ y us .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
O@@ K ? That respon@@ se should wor@@ ry you .
"And if I were to con@@ vin@@ ce you in this talk that we were likely to suf@@ fer a global fam@@ ine , ei@@ ther because of cli@@ mate change or some other c@@ atas@@ tro@@ p@@ he , and that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are very likely to live like this , you wouldn &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; In@@ ter@@ es@@ ting ."
I like this TE@@ D Tal@@ k . &quot; &quot; F@@ am@@ ine isn &apos;t fu@@ n .
"I am un@@ able to mar@@ sh@@ al this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
"B@@ e@@ h@@ ind do@@ or number one , we stop making progress in building intelli@@ gent ma@@ chin@@ es ."
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ w@@ are and sof@@ tw@@ are just st@@ op@@ s getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to consid@@ er why this might happen .
"I mean , given how val@@ u@@ able intelligence and aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tion are , we will contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our technology if we are at all able to ."
What could stop us from doing this ?
A ful@@ l-@@ sc@@ ale n@@ uc@@ lear war ?
A global pan@@ de@@ mic ?
A@@ n as@@ ter@@ o@@ id im@@ p@@ act ?
J@@ us@@ ti@@ n B@@ i@@ eb@@ er becom@@ ing pres@@ id@@ ent of the United States ?
"( Laughter ) The point is , something would have to des@@ tro@@ y civiliz@@ ation as we know it ."
"You have to imagine how bad it would have to be to pre@@ v@@ ent us from making impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in our technology per@@ man@@ ently , gener@@ ation after gener@@ ation ."
"Now , this is often car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured , as I have here , as a fear that ar@@ mi@@ es of mal@@ ici@@ ous rob@@ ots will att@@ ack us ."
But that isn &apos;t the most likely scen@@ ari@@ o .
It &apos;s not that our ma@@ chin@@ es will become s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously mal@@ evol@@ ent .
Just think about how we rel@@ ate to an@@ ts .
We don &apos;t h@@ ate them .
We don &apos;t go out of our way to har@@ m them .
"In fact , sometimes we take pa@@ ins not to har@@ m them ."
We step over them on the s@@ ide@@ wal@@ k .
"But wh@@ en@@ ever their pres@@ ence ser@@ i@@ ously con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts with one of our go@@ als , let &apos;s say when con@@ struc@@ ting a building like this one , we an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ate them without a qu@@ al@@ m ."
"The con@@ cer@@ n is that we will one day build ma@@ chin@@ es that , whether they &apos;re consci@@ ous or not , could treat us with si@@ mil@@ ar dis@@ re@@ gar@@ d ."
"Now , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect this seems far@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched to many of you ."
But then you must find something wrong with one of the fol@@ lowing as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
And there are only three of them .
In@@ tel@@ li@@ gence is a matter of information proc@@ ess@@ ing in physical syst@@ ems .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this is a little bit more than an as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion ."
"We have already built nar@@ row intelligence into our ma@@ chin@@ es , and many of these ma@@ chin@@ es per@@ form at a level of super@@ human intelligence already ."
"And we know that mere matter can give r@@ ise to what is called &quot; &quot; gener@@ al intelligence , &quot; &quot; an ability to think f@@ le@@ x@@ ib@@ ly across mul@@ ti@@ ple do@@ ma@@ ins , because our bra@@ ins have man@@ ag@@ ed it . R@@ ight ?"
"I mean , there &apos;s just at@@ oms in here , and as long as we contin@@ ue to build syst@@ ems of at@@ oms that dis@@ play more and more intelli@@ gent behavior , we will even@@ tually , un@@ less we are inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted , we will even@@ tually build gener@@ al intelligence into our ma@@ chin@@ es ."
"It &apos;s c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al to real@@ ize that the rate of progress doesn &apos;t matter , because any progress is enough to get us into the end z@@ one ."
We don &apos;t need M@@ o@@ ore &apos;s la@@ w to contin@@ ue . We don &apos;t need ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al progress .
We just need to keep going .
The second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our intelli@@ gent ma@@ chin@@ es .
It is our most val@@ u@@ able resour@@ ce .
So we want to do this .
We have problems that we des@@ per@@ ately need to sol@@ ve .
We want to c@@ ure dis@@ eas@@ es like A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and cancer .
We want to understand economic syst@@ ems . We want to impro@@ ve our cli@@ mate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"The tra@@ in is already out of the st@@ ation , and there &apos;s no bra@@ ke to pul@@ l ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , we don &apos;t st@@ and on a pe@@ ak of intelligence , or any@@ where ne@@ ar it , likely ."
And this really is the c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al in@@ sight .
"This is what makes our sit@@ u@@ ation so prec@@ ari@@ ous , and this is what makes our in@@ tu@@ it@@ ions about ris@@ k so un@@ rel@@ i@@ able ."
"Now , just consid@@ er the s@@ mart@@ est person who has ever liv@@ ed ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s shor@@ t@@ l@@ ist here is J@@ o@@ h@@ n v@@ on N@@ e@@ um@@ an@@ n .
"I mean , the im@@ pres@@ sion that v@@ on N@@ e@@ um@@ an@@ n made on the people around him , and this incl@@ ud@@ ed the gre@@ at@@ est ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and physic@@ ists of his time , is fa@@ ir@@ ly well-@@ doc@@ um@@ ented ."
"If only half the stories about him are half true , there &apos;s no question he &apos;s one of the s@@ mart@@ est people who has ever liv@@ ed ."
So consid@@ er the spec@@ tr@@ um of intelligence .
Here we have J@@ o@@ h@@ n v@@ on N@@ e@@ um@@ an@@ n .
And then we have you and me .
"( Laughter ) S@@ or@@ ry , a ch@@ ic@@ ken . ( Laughter )"
There &apos;s no reason for me to make this talk more depres@@ sing than it needs to be . ( Laughter )
And it &apos;s important to reco@@ gni@@ ze that this is true by vir@@ tu@@ e of spe@@ ed al@@ one .
R@@ ight ? So imagine if we just built a super@@ intelli@@ gent A@@ I that was no s@@ mar@@ ter than your average te@@ am of rese@@ arch@@ ers at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d or M@@ I@@ T .
"So you set it run@@ ning for a week , and it will per@@ form 20@@ ,000 years of hum@@ an@@ -@@ level intel@@ lec@@ tual work , week after week after week ."
"The other thing that &apos;s wor@@ r@@ ying , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , is that , imagine the best case scen@@ ari@@ o ."
It &apos;s as though we &apos;ve been h@@ and@@ ed an o@@ ra@@ cle that behav@@ es exactly as in@@ ten@@ ded .
"Well , this machine would be the per@@ fect lab@@ or@@ -@@ sav@@ ing dev@@ ice ."
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dr@@ ud@@ ger@@ y .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intel@@ lec@@ tual work .
So what would ap@@ es like ourselves do in this cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to play F@@ ris@@ be@@ e and give each other mas@@ sa@@ g@@ es ."
"A@@ d@@ d some L@@ S@@ D and some ques@@ tion@@ able war@@ dro@@ be cho@@ ices , and the whole world could be like B@@ urn@@ ing M@@ an ."
It seems likely that we would w@@ it@@ ness a level of we@@ al@@ th in@@ equality and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment that we have never seen before .
And what would the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans or the Ch@@ in@@ ese do if they heard that some compan@@ y in S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y was about to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y a super@@ intelli@@ gent A@@ I ?
"This machine would be cap@@ able of w@@ ag@@ ing war , whether ter@@ re@@ st@@ ri@@ al or c@@ y@@ ber , with un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented power ."
This is a w@@ in@@ ner@@ -@@ tak@@ e-@@ all scen@@ ari@@ o .
So it seems that even mere ru@@ mor@@ s of this kind of bre@@ ak@@ through could cause our spec@@ ies to go ber@@ ser@@ k .
"Now , one of the most fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things , in my view , at this moment , are the kinds of things that A@@ I rese@@ arch@@ ers say when they want to be reas@@ sur@@ ing ."
And the most common reason we &apos;re told not to wor@@ ry is time .
"This is all a long way off , don &apos;t you know ."
This is probably 50 or 100 years away .
"If intelligence is just a matter of information proc@@ ess@@ ing , and we contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our ma@@ chin@@ es , we will produc@@ e some form of super@@ intelligence ."
And we have no idea how long it will take us to create the con@@ dit@@ ions to do that saf@@ ely .
We have no idea how long it will take us to create the con@@ dit@@ ions to do that saf@@ ely .
"And if you hav@@ en &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is 50 years in months .
This is how long we &apos;ve had the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on tel@@ ev@@ ision .
F@@ if@@ ty years is not that much time to me@@ et one of the gre@@ at@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es our spec@@ ies will ever face .
"O@@ n@@ ce again , we seem to be fa@@ il@@ ing to have an appro@@ pri@@ ate emo@@ tional respon@@ se to what we have every reason to believe is coming ."
The computer scient@@ ist S@@ tu@@ art R@@ us@@ s@@ ell has a n@@ ice anal@@ o@@ gy here .
"He said , imagine that we re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed a mes@@ sa@@ ge from an ali@@ en civiliz@@ ation , which read : &quot; &quot; P@@ eople of Earth , we will ar@@ r@@ ive on your planet in 50 years ."
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just coun@@ ting down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship lan@@ ds ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ gen@@ cy than we do .
"They &apos;ll be graf@@ ted on@@ to our bra@@ ins , and we &apos;ll essenti@@ ally become their lim@@ b@@ ic syst@@ ems ."
"Now , this may in fact be the saf@@ est and only pr@@ ud@@ ent pat@@ h for@@ ward , but us@@ u@@ ally one &apos;s saf@@ ety con@@ cer@@ n@@ s about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you s@@ tic@@ k it inside your head ."
"And given that the compan@@ ies and govern@@ ments doing this work are likely to per@@ ce@@ ive themselves as being in a ra@@ ce against all others , given that to w@@ in this ra@@ ce is to w@@ in the world , pro@@ vid@@ ed you don &apos;t des@@ tro@@ y it in the next moment , then it seems likely that wh@@ at@@ ever is eas@@ ier to do will get done first ."
"Now , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I don &apos;t have a solu@@ tion to this problem , ap@@ art from re@@ com@@ men@@ ding that more of us think about it ."
"But the moment we ad@@ mit that information proc@@ ess@@ ing is the s@@ our@@ ce of intelligence , that some appro@@ pri@@ ate comput@@ ational system is what the bas@@ is of intelligence is , and we ad@@ mit that we will impro@@ ve these syst@@ ems contin@@ u@@ ously , and we ad@@ mit that the hor@@ iz@@ on of co@@ gn@@ ition very likely far ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ s what we curr@@ ently know , then we have to ad@@ mit that we are in the process of building some sort of go@@ d ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )

"We were driv@@ ing with friends down a dark ro@@ ad at night , when a pol@@ ice c@@ ar st@@ op@@ ped us ."
Why ? Because of po@@ or emo@@ tional hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
To r@@ um@@ in@@ ate means to ch@@ ew over .

( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experim@@ ents in behav@@ io@@ ral science .
I bring you into a room .
"He ga@@ ther@@ ed his par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ cen@@ ti@@ vi@@ ze them .
It d@@ ul@@ ls thinking and bloc@@ ks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even clo@@ se ."
"R@@ e@@ wards , by their very nature , nar@@ row our foc@@ us , con@@ cent@@ rate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many cas@@ es ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who s@@ pon@@ s@@ ored this research ?
The good news is that the scient@@ ists who &apos;ve been stud@@ ying mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation have given us this new appro@@ ach .
A@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y : the ur@@ ge to direc@@ t our own lives .
M@@ as@@ ter@@ y : the des@@ ire to get better and better at something that mat@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about aut@@ on@@ om@@ y .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ ag@@ ement ."
M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement did not em@@ an@@ ate from nature .
S@@ omebody inv@@ ented it .
"But if you want en@@ gag@@ ement , self-@@ direc@@ tion works better ."
How many of you have heard of the compan@@ y A@@ t@@ las@@ si@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ bly co@@ ol .
"A@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y , ma@@ ster@@ y and pur@@ pose , the building bloc@@ ks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another en@@ c@@ y@@ clo@@ p@@ ed@@ ia got started ."
The dr@@ ive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
J@@ o@@ e K@@ ow@@ an : I have stage f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had stage f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
"That &apos;s when I started writ@@ ing son@@ gs , and even then I only pla@@ yed them for my@@ self ."
Just kno@@ wing my ro@@ om@@ mat@@ es were in the same h@@ ou@@ se made me un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
"But after a couple of years , just writ@@ ing son@@ gs wasn &apos;t enough ."
"I had all these stories and ideas , and I wanted to share them with people , but ph@@ y@@ si@@ olog@@ ically , I couldn &apos;t do it ."
I had this ir@@ ra@@ tional fear .
"But the more I w@@ ro@@ te , and the more I prac@@ tic@@ ed , the more I wanted to per@@ form ."
"So on the week of my 3@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , I decided I was going to go to this loc@@ al open mic , and put this fear be@@ h@@ ind me ."
"Well , when I got there , it was p@@ ac@@ ked ."
There were like 20 people there .
( Laughter ) And they all looked an@@ gr@@ y .
"But I took a de@@ ep bre@@ ath , and I sign@@ ed up to play , and I fel@@ t pretty good ."
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good , until about 10 minutes before my turn , when my whole body reb@@ el@@ led , and this w@@ ave of an@@ x@@ i@@ ety just wa@@ shed over me ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic nerv@@ ous system k@@ ic@@ ks in ."
"So you have a r@@ us@@ h of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , your heart rate increas@@ es , your bre@@ a@@ thing gets fas@@ ter ."
"@@ N@@ ex@@ t your n@@ on@@ -@@ essenti@@ al syst@@ ems start to sh@@ ut down , like dig@@ es@@ tion . ( Laughter ) So your mo@@ uth gets d@@ ry , and blo@@ od is ro@@ ut@@ ed away from your extre@@ mit@@ ies , so your fin@@ g@@ ers don &apos;t work any@@ more ."
"Y@@ our p@@ up@@ ils dil@@ ate , your mus@@ cl@@ es con@@ trac@@ t , your S@@ p@@ ide@@ y sense tin@@ gl@@ es , basically your whole body is tri@@ g@@ ger@@ -@@ happy . ( Laughter ) That con@@ d@@ ition is not conduc@@ ive to per@@ form@@ ing fol@@ k mus@@ ic . ( Laughter )"
"I mean , your nerv@@ ous system is an id@@ iot ."
"R@@ e@@ ally ? T@@ w@@ o hundred thou@@ s@@ and years of human evolution , and it still can &apos;t tell the difference between a sa@@ ber to@@ ot@@ h ti@@ ger and 20 fol@@ k@@ sin@@ g@@ ers on a Tu@@ es@@ day night open mic ?"
( Laughter ) I have never been more ter@@ ri@@ fied — until now .
"( Laughter and che@@ ers ) So then it was my turn , and some@@ how , I get my@@ self on@@ to the stage , I start my son@@ g , I open my mo@@ uth to sing the first line , and this completely hor@@ ri@@ ble vibra@@ to — you know , when your vo@@ ice w@@ av@@ ers — comes stre@@ am@@ ing out ."
"And this is not the good kind of vibra@@ to , like an oper@@ a sin@@ ger has , this is my whole body just con@@ v@@ ul@@ sing with fear ."
"I mean , it &apos;s a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are ."
"I &apos;m em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sed , the audi@@ ence is c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ com@@ for@@ table , they &apos;re foc@@ used on my dis@@ com@@ for@@ t ."
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a sol@@ o sin@@ ger@@ -@@ son@@ g@@ writ@@ er .
And something good did happen — I had the tin@@ i@@ est little g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of that audi@@ ence connec@@ tion that I was h@@ op@@ ing for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this nerv@@ ous@@ ness .
That night I prom@@ ised my@@ self : I would go back every week until I wasn &apos;t nerv@@ ous any@@ more .
"And I did . I went back every single week , and sure enough , week after week , it didn &apos;t get any better . The same thing happened every week . ( Laughter ) I couldn &apos;t sh@@ ake it ."
And that &apos;s when I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any .
"And I remember it really well , because I don &apos;t have a lot of e@@ pi@@ ph@@ an@@ ies . ( Laughter ) All I had to do was write a son@@ g that explo@@ its my nerv@@ ous@@ ness ."
"That only seems au@@ th@@ en@@ tic when I have stage f@@ right , and the more nerv@@ ous I was , the better the son@@ g would be . E@@ as@@ y ."
So I started writ@@ ing a son@@ g about having stage f@@ right .
"F@@ ir@@ st , f@@ ess@@ ing up to the problem , the physical man@@ if@@ est@@ ations , how I would feel , how the list@@ en@@ er might feel ."
"And then ac@@ coun@@ ting for things like my sh@@ ak@@ y vo@@ ice , and I knew I would be sin@@ ging about a hal@@ f-@@ oc@@ t@@ ave high@@ er than nor@@ mal , because I was nerv@@ ous ."
"B@@ y having a son@@ g that expla@@ ined what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the audi@@ ence per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"They didn &apos;t have to feel bad for me because I was nerv@@ ous , they could experience that with me , and we were all one big happy , nerv@@ ous , un@@ com@@ for@@ table family . ( Laughter ) B@@ y thinking about my audi@@ ence , by em@@ bra@@ cing and explo@@ iting my problem , I was able to take something that was bloc@@ king my progress , and turn it into something that was essenti@@ al for my success ."
And having the stage f@@ right son@@ g let me get past that big@@ gest issue right in the beginning of a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
"And then I could move on , and play the rest of my son@@ gs with just a little bit more ease ."
"And even@@ tually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to play the stage f@@ right son@@ g at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really nerv@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be o@@ kay if I pla@@ yed the stage f@@ right son@@ g for you ?"
( Applause ) C@@ an I have a si@@ p of water ?

This is actually a pain@@ ting that han@@ gs at the C@@ oun@@ t@@ way L@@ i@@ br@@ ary at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ cho@@ ol .
And it sho@@ ws the first time an or@@ gan was ever trans@@ plan@@ ted .
"In the front , you see , actually , J@@ o@@ e M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y getting the pati@@ ent ready for the trans@@ pl@@ ant , while in the back room you see H@@ ar@@ tw@@ ell H@@ ar@@ ris@@ on , the Ch@@ i@@ ef of U@@ ro@@ lo@@ gy at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , actually har@@ v@@ es@@ ting the kid@@ ney ."
The kid@@ ney was inde@@ ed the first or@@ gan ever to be trans@@ plan@@ ted to the human .
"That was back in 19@@ 5@@ 4 , 5@@ 5 years ago ."
Y@@ et we &apos;re still de@@ al@@ ing with a lot of the same chall@@ eng@@ es as many dec@@ ades ago .
"C@@ ert@@ ain@@ ly many adv@@ an@@ ces , many lives sav@@ ed ."
But we have a maj@@ or shor@@ t@@ age of organs .
I@@ n the last dec@@ ade the number of patients wa@@ iting for a trans@@ pl@@ ant has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
"Wh@@ ile , at the same time , the ac@@ tual number of trans@@ plan@@ ts has re@@ main@@ ed almost enti@@ rel@@ y fl@@ at ."
That really has to do with our ag@@ ing population .
We &apos;re just getting ol@@ der .
M@@ ed@@ ic@@ ine is doing a better job of ke@@ ep@@ ing us al@@ ive .
"But as we age , our organs t@@ end to fa@@ il more ."
"So , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for t@@ issu@@ es ."
"@@ Tr@@ ying to re@@ place pan@@ cre@@ as , trying to re@@ place ner@@ ves that can help us with P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s ."
These are maj@@ or issu@@ es .
This is actually a very st@@ un@@ ning stat@@ is@@ tic .
E@@ very 30 secon@@ ds a pati@@ ent dies from dis@@ eas@@ es that could be tre@@ ated with t@@ issue regener@@ ation or re@@ plac@@ ement .
"So , what can we do about it ?"
We &apos;ve tal@@ ked about stem cells t@@ on@@ ight .
That &apos;s a way to do it .
"But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients , in terms of ac@@ tual ther@@ ap@@ ies for organs ."
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if our bo@@ dies could regener@@ ate ?
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if we could actually har@@ ness the power of our bo@@ dies , to actually he@@ al ourselves ?"
"It &apos;s not really that for@@ e@@ ign of a con@@ cept , actually ; it happens on the Earth every day ."
This is actually a picture of a sal@@ am@@ and@@ er .
S@@ al@@ am@@ and@@ ers have this amazing cap@@ ac@@ ity to regener@@ ate .
You see here a little video .
This is actually a lim@@ b in@@ j@@ ury in this sal@@ am@@ and@@ er .
"And this is actually real ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ y , tim@@ ed ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ y , sho@@ wing how that lim@@ b regener@@ ates in a peri@@ od of days ."
You see the sc@@ ar form .
And that sc@@ ar actually gro@@ ws out a new lim@@ b .
"So , sal@@ am@@ and@@ ers can do it ."
Why can &apos;t we ? Why can &apos;t hum@@ ans regener@@ ate ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , we can regener@@ ate ."
Y@@ our body has many organs and every single or@@ gan in your body has a c@@ ell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of in@@ j@@ ury . It happens every day .
"As you age , as you get ol@@ der ."
Y@@ our b@@ ones regener@@ ate every 10 years .
Y@@ our sk@@ in regener@@ ates every two weeks .
"So , your body is con@@ stan@@ tly regener@@ ating ."
The challenge oc@@ cur@@ s when there is an in@@ j@@ ury .
"A@@ t the time of in@@ j@@ ury or disease , the body &apos;s first re@@ action is to se@@ al itself off from the rest of the body ."
"It basically wan@@ ts to fi@@ ght off in@@ fec@@ tion , and se@@ al itself , whether it &apos;s organs inside your body , or your sk@@ in , the first re@@ action is for sc@@ ar t@@ issue to move in , to se@@ al itself off from the outside ."
"So , how can we har@@ ness that power ?"
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using s@@ mart bio@@ mater@@ i@@ als .
"@@ How does this work ? Well , on the left side here you see a u@@ re@@ th@@ ra which was in@@ j@@ ured ."
This is the chan@@ ne@@ l that connec@@ ts the bl@@ ad@@ der to the outside of the body .
And you see that it is in@@ j@@ ured .
We basically found out that you can use these s@@ mart bio@@ mater@@ i@@ als that you can actually use as a br@@ id@@ ge .
"If you build that br@@ id@@ ge , and you clo@@ se off from the outside environ@@ ment , then you can create that br@@ id@@ ge , and cells that regener@@ ate in your body , can then c@@ ross that br@@ id@@ ge , and take that pat@@ h ."
That &apos;s exactly what you see here .
"It &apos;s actually a s@@ mart bio@@ material that we used , to actually treat this pati@@ ent ."
This was an in@@ j@@ ured u@@ re@@ th@@ ra on the left side .
We used that bio@@ material in the middle .
"And then , six months later on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side you see this re@@ engine@@ er@@ ed u@@ re@@ th@@ ra ."
"@@ T@@ urn@@ s out your body can regener@@ ate , but only for small dis@@ tan@@ ces ."
The ma@@ x@@ im@@ um ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent dis@@ tan@@ ce for regener@@ ation is only about one cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter .
"So , we can use these s@@ mart bio@@ mater@@ i@@ als but only for about one cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter to br@@ id@@ ge those ga@@ ps ."
"So , we do regener@@ ate , but for li@@ mit@@ ed dis@@ tan@@ ces ."
"What do we do now , if you have in@@ j@@ ury for larg@@ er organs ?"
What do we do when we have in@@ j@@ ur@@ ies for struc@@ tures which are much larg@@ er than one cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter ?
Th@@ en we can start to use cells .
"The stra@@ te@@ gy here , is if a pati@@ ent comes in to us with a dis@@ eas@@ ed or in@@ j@@ ured or@@ gan , you can take a very small piece of t@@ issue from that or@@ gan , less than half the size of a pos@@ t@@ age st@@ am@@ p , you can then te@@ ase that t@@ issue ap@@ art , and look at its bas@@ ic com@@ pon@@ ents , the pati@@ ent &apos;s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and exp@@ and those cells outside the body in large quan@@ tit@@ ies , and then we then use sc@@ af@@ f@@ old mater@@ i@@ als ."
"@@ To the nak@@ ed ey@@ e they look like a piece of your bl@@ ou@@ se , or your shir@@ t , but actually these mater@@ i@@ als are fa@@ ir@@ ly compl@@ ex and they are des@@ ign@@ ed to de@@ gra@@ de once inside the body ."
It dis@@ in@@ te@@ gra@@ t@@ es a few months later .
It &apos;s ac@@ ting only as a c@@ ell del@@ iver@@ y ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
"It &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the cells into the body . It &apos;s al@@ lowing the cells to regener@@ ate new t@@ issue , and once the t@@ issue is regener@@ ated the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old goes away ."
And that &apos;s what we did for this piece of mus@@ cle .
This is actually sho@@ wing a piece of mus@@ cle and how we go through the struc@@ tures to actually engine@@ er the mus@@ cle .
"We take the cells , we exp@@ and them , we place the cells on the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old , and we then place the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old back into the pati@@ ent ."
"But actually , before plac@@ ing the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old into the pati@@ ent , we actually ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise it ."
"We want to make sure that we con@@ d@@ ition this mus@@ cle , so that it kno@@ ws what to do once we put it into the pati@@ ent ."
That &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here . You &apos;re seeing this mus@@ cle bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor actually ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ ing the mus@@ cle back and for@@ th .
"O@@ kay . These are fl@@ at struc@@ tures that we see here , the mus@@ cle ."
What about other struc@@ tures ?
This is actually an engine@@ er@@ ed blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
"@@ V@@ er@@ y si@@ mil@@ ar to what we just did , but a little bit more compl@@ ex ."
"@@ Here we take a sc@@ af@@ f@@ old , and we basically — sc@@ af@@ f@@ old can be like a piece of p@@ aper here ."
And we can then t@@ ub@@ ul@@ ari@@ ze this sc@@ af@@ f@@ old .
"And what we do is we , to make a blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l , same stra@@ te@@ gy ."
A blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l is made up of two different c@@ ell typ@@ es .
"We take mus@@ cle cells , we pas@@ te , or co@@ at the outside with these mus@@ cle cells , very much like b@@ ak@@ ing a la@@ y@@ er c@@ ake , if you will ."
You place the mus@@ cle cells on the outside .
You place the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l lin@@ ing cells on the inside .
You now have your fully se@@ ed@@ ed sc@@ af@@ f@@ old .
You &apos;re going to place this in an ov@@ en@@ -@@ like dev@@ ice .
"It has the same con@@ dit@@ ions as a human body , 3@@ 7 de@@ gre@@ es cen@@ ti@@ gra@@ de , 9@@ 5 percent oxy@@ g@@ en ."
"You then ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise it , as what you saw on that t@@ ap@@ e ."
And on the right you actually see a car@@ ot@@ id ar@@ ter@@ y that was engine@@ er@@ ed .
This is actually the ar@@ ter@@ y that goes from your nec@@ k to your brain .
"And this is an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y sho@@ wing you the pat@@ ent , func@@ tional blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l ."
"M@@ ore compl@@ ex struc@@ tures such as blo@@ od v@@ ess@@ els , u@@ re@@ th@@ ras , which I sho@@ wed you , they &apos;re defin@@ it@@ ely more compl@@ ex because you &apos;re in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing two different c@@ ell typ@@ es ."
But they are really ac@@ ting mo@@ st@@ ly as con@@ du@@ its .
You &apos;re al@@ lowing flu@@ id or air to go through at ste@@ ad@@ y st@@ ates .
They are not ne@@ arly as compl@@ ex as hol@@ low organs .
"H@@ ol@@ low organs have a much high@@ er de@@ gre@@ e of compl@@ ex@@ ity , because you &apos;re as@@ king these organs to act on de@@ m@@ and ."
"So , the bl@@ ad@@ der is one such or@@ gan ."
"S@@ ame stra@@ te@@ gy , we take a very small piece of the bl@@ ad@@ der , less than half the size of a pos@@ t@@ age st@@ am@@ p ."
"We then te@@ ase the t@@ issue ap@@ art into its two individ@@ ual c@@ ell com@@ pon@@ ents , mus@@ cle , and these bl@@ ad@@ der speci@@ aliz@@ ed cells ."
We grow the cells outside the body in large quan@@ tit@@ ies .
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the or@@ gan .
We then take a sc@@ af@@ f@@ old that we shap@@ e like a bl@@ ad@@ der .
We co@@ at the inside with these bl@@ ad@@ der lin@@ ing cells .
We co@@ at the outside with these mus@@ cle cells .
We place it back into this ov@@ en@@ -@@ like dev@@ ice .
"F@@ rom the time you take that piece of t@@ issue , six to eight weeks later you can put the or@@ gan right back into the pati@@ ent ."
This actually sho@@ ws the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old .
The material is actually being co@@ ated with the cells .
Wh@@ en we did the first cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ al for these patients we actually created the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old speci@@ fic@@ ally for each pati@@ ent .
"We b@@ rou@@ ght patients in , six to eight weeks pri@@ or to their s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed sur@@ ger@@ y , did X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , and we then com@@ posed a sc@@ af@@ f@@ old speci@@ fic@@ ally for that pati@@ ent &apos;s size p@@ el@@ vi@@ c c@@ av@@ ity ."
"For the second ph@@ ase of the tri@@ als we just had different si@@ z@@ es , small , medi@@ um , large and ex@@ tra@@ -@@ large ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
And I &apos;m sure everyone here wanted an ex@@ tra@@ -@@ large . R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) So , bl@@ ad@@ d@@ ers are defin@@ it@@ ely a little bit more compl@@ ex than the other struc@@ tures ."
But there are other hol@@ low organs that have ad@@ ded compl@@ ex@@ ity to it .
"This is actually a heart val@@ ve , which we engine@@ er@@ ed ."
And the way you engine@@ er this heart val@@ ve is the same stra@@ te@@ gy .
"We take the sc@@ af@@ f@@ old , we se@@ ed it with cells , and you can now see here , the val@@ ve le@@ af@@ l@@ ets op@@ en@@ ing and clo@@ sing ."
We ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise these pri@@ or to im@@ plan@@ t@@ ation .
S@@ ame stra@@ te@@ gy .
And then the most compl@@ ex are the so@@ li@@ d organs .
"For so@@ li@@ d organs , they &apos;re more compl@@ ex because you &apos;re using a lot more cells per cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter ."
This is actually a simple so@@ li@@ d or@@ gan like the e@@ ar .
It &apos;s now being se@@ ed@@ ed with car@@ t@@ il@@ age .
That &apos;s the ov@@ en@@ -@@ like dev@@ ice ; once it &apos;s co@@ ated it gets plac@@ ed there .
And then a few weeks later we can take out the car@@ t@@ il@@ age sc@@ af@@ f@@ old .
This is actually dig@@ its that we &apos;re engine@@ ering .
"Th@@ ese are being la@@ y@@ er@@ ed , one la@@ y@@ er at a time , first the b@@ one , we f@@ ill in the ga@@ ps with car@@ t@@ il@@ age ."
We then start ad@@ ding the mus@@ cle on top .
And you start la@@ y@@ ering these so@@ li@@ d struc@@ tures .
"A@@ ga@@ in , fa@@ ir@@ ly more compl@@ ex organs , but by far , the most compl@@ ex so@@ li@@ d organs are actually the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ ized , high@@ ly v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ ized , a lot of blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l sup@@ p@@ ly , organs such as the heart , the li@@ ver , the kid@@ ne@@ ys ."
This is actually an example — s@@ ever@@ al stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es to engine@@ er so@@ li@@ d organs .
This is actually one of the stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es . We use a prin@@ ter .
"And instead of using ink , we use — you just saw an in@@ k@@ j@@ et car@@ tr@@ id@@ ge — we just use cells ."
This is actually your typ@@ ical des@@ k@@ top prin@@ ter .
"It &apos;s actually prin@@ ting this two ch@@ amb@@ er heart , one la@@ y@@ er at a time ."
"You see the heart coming out there . It takes about 40 minutes to prin@@ t , and about four to six hours later you see the mus@@ cle cells con@@ trac@@ t ."
"( Applause ) This technology was develop@@ ed by T@@ a@@ o J@@ u , who worked at our inst@@ it@@ ute ."
"And this is actually still , of course , experim@@ ental , not for use in patients ."
A@@ no@@ ther stra@@ te@@ gy that we have fol@@ lowed is actually to use de@@ cel@@ l@@ ul@@ ar@@ ized organs .
"We actually take don@@ or organs , organs that are dis@@ car@@ ded , and we then can use very mil@@ d de@@ ter@@ gen@@ ts to take all the c@@ ell el@@ em@@ ents out of these organs ."
"So , for example on the left pan@@ el , top pan@@ el , you see a li@@ ver ."
"We actually take the don@@ or li@@ ver , we use very mil@@ d de@@ ter@@ gen@@ ts , and we , by using these mil@@ d de@@ ter@@ gen@@ ts , we take all the cells out of the li@@ ver ."
"@@ T@@ w@@ o weeks later , we basically can li@@ ft this or@@ gan up , it fe@@ els like a li@@ ver , we can hold it like a li@@ ver , it looks like a li@@ ver , but it has no cells ."
"A@@ ll we are left with is the sk@@ el@@ et@@ on , if you will , of the li@@ ver , all made up of coll@@ ag@@ en , a material that &apos;s in our bo@@ dies , that will not re@@ ject ."
We can use it from one pati@@ ent to the next .
We then take this v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar structure and we can pro@@ ve that we re@@ tain the blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l sup@@ p@@ ly .
"You can see , actually that &apos;s a flu@@ o@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ y ."
We &apos;re actually in@@ jec@@ ting con@@ tra@@ st into the or@@ gan .
Now you can see it start . We &apos;re in@@ jec@@ ting the con@@ tra@@ st into the or@@ gan into this de@@ cel@@ l@@ ul@@ ar@@ ized li@@ ver .
And you can see the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar t@@ ree that re@@ ma@@ ins in@@ t@@ act .
"We then take the cells , the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar cells , blo@@ od v@@ es@@ se@@ l cells , we per@@ f@@ use the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar t@@ ree with the pati@@ ent &apos;s own cells ."
We per@@ f@@ use the outside of the li@@ ver with the pati@@ ent &apos;s own li@@ ver cells .
And we can then create func@@ tional li@@ ver@@ s .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
"This is still experim@@ ental . But we are able to actually re@@ produc@@ e the func@@ tion@@ ality of the li@@ ver structure , experim@@ ent@@ ally ."
"For the kid@@ ney , as I tal@@ ked to you about the first pain@@ ting that you saw , the first sl@@ ide I sho@@ wed you , 90 percent of the patients on the trans@@ pl@@ ant wa@@ it l@@ ist are wa@@ iting for a kid@@ ney , 90 percent ."
"So , another stra@@ te@@ gy we &apos;re fol@@ lowing is actually to create wa@@ fer@@ s that we st@@ ack together , like an ac@@ cor@@ di@@ on , if you will ."
"So , we st@@ ack these wa@@ fer@@ s together , using the kid@@ ney cells ."
And then you can see these min@@ i@@ ature kid@@ ne@@ ys that we &apos;ve engine@@ er@@ ed .
They are actually making ur@@ ine .
"A@@ ga@@ in , small struc@@ tures , our challenge is how to make them larg@@ er , and that is something we &apos;re working on right now at the inst@@ it@@ ute ."
One of the things that I wanted to sum@@ mar@@ ize for you then is what is a stra@@ te@@ gy that we &apos;re going for in regener@@ ative medic@@ ine .
"If at all possible , we really would like to use s@@ mart bio@@ mater@@ i@@ als that we can just take off the sh@@ elf and regener@@ ate your organs ."
"We are li@@ mit@@ ed with dis@@ tan@@ ces right now , but our go@@ al is actually to increase those dis@@ tan@@ ces over time ."
"If we cannot use s@@ mart bio@@ mater@@ i@@ als , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells ."
Why ? Because they will not re@@ ject .
"We can take cells from you , create the structure , put it right back into you , they will not re@@ ject ."
"And if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very spec@@ if@@ ic or@@ gan ."
If you present with a dis@@ eas@@ ed w@@ ind pi@@ p@@ e we &apos;d like to take cells from your w@@ ind@@ pi@@ p@@ e .
If you present with a dis@@ eas@@ ed pan@@ cre@@ as we &apos;d like to take cells from that or@@ gan .
Why ? Because we &apos;d rather take those cells which already know that those are the c@@ ell typ@@ es you want .
A w@@ ind@@ pi@@ p@@ e c@@ ell already kno@@ ws it &apos;s a w@@ ind@@ pi@@ p@@ e c@@ ell .
We don &apos;t need to te@@ ach it to become another c@@ ell typ@@ e .
"So , we pre@@ fer organ@@ -@@ spec@@ if@@ ic cells ."
"And today we can ob@@ tain cells from most every or@@ gan in your body , ex@@ cept for s@@ ever@@ al which we still need stem cells for , like heart , li@@ ver , ner@@ ve and pan@@ cre@@ as ."
And for those we still need stem cells .
If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we &apos;d like to use don@@ or stem cells .
And we pre@@ fer cells that will not re@@ ject and will not form tu@@ mor@@ s .
"And we &apos;re working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago , stem cells from the am@@ ni@@ ot@@ ic flu@@ id , and the plac@@ ent@@ a , which have those pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"So , at this point , I do want to tell you that some of the maj@@ or chall@@ eng@@ es we have ."
"You know , I just sho@@ wed you this pres@@ ent@@ ation , everything looks so good , everything works . A@@ c@@ tually no , these tech@@ nologi@@ es really are not that easy ."
S@@ ome of the work you saw today was per@@ form@@ ed by over 7@@ 00 rese@@ arch@@ ers at our inst@@ it@@ ute across a 20@@ -@@ year time sp@@ an .
"So , these are very t@@ ough tech@@ nologi@@ es ."
O@@ n@@ ce you get the form@@ ul@@ a right you can re@@ plic@@ ate it .
But it takes a lot to get there .
"So , I always like to show this car@@ to@@ on ."
This is how to stop a run@@ away stage .
"And there you see the st@@ ag@@ ec@@ o@@ ach driv@@ er , and he goes , on the top pan@@ el , He goes A , B , C , D , E , F@@ ."
He finally st@@ op@@ s the run@@ away stage .
"And those are us@@ u@@ ally the bas@@ ic scient@@ ists , The bot@@ tom is us@@ u@@ ally the sur@@ ge@@ ons ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m a sur@@ ge@@ on so that &apos;s not that fun@@ n@@ y . ( Laughter )
But actually me@@ th@@ od A is the cor@@ rec@@ t appro@@ ach .
"And what I mean by that is that any@@ time we &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched one of these tech@@ nologi@@ es to the cl@@ in@@ ic , we &apos;ve made ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that we do everything we can in the labo@@ rat@@ ory before we ever la@@ un@@ ch these tech@@ nologi@@ es to patients ."
And when we la@@ un@@ ch these tech@@ nologi@@ es to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very t@@ ough question .
"A@@ re you ready to place this in your own lo@@ ved one , your own child , your own family mem@@ ber , and then we pro@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Because our ma@@ in go@@ al , of course , is first , to do no har@@ m ."
"I &apos;m going to show you now , a very shor@@ t cli@@ p , It &apos;s a five second cli@@ p of a pati@@ ent who re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed one of the engine@@ er@@ ed organs ."
We started im@@ plan@@ ting some of these struc@@ tures over 1@@ 4 years ago .
"So , we have patients now wal@@ king around with organs , engine@@ er@@ ed organs , for over 10 years , as well ."
I &apos;m going to show a cli@@ p of one young l@@ ad@@ y .
"She had a sp@@ ina bi@@ fi@@ da de@@ fect , a sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d ab@@ nor@@ mal@@ ity ."
She did not have a nor@@ mal bl@@ ad@@ der . This is a se@@ g@@ ment from C@@ N@@ N .
We are just taking five secon@@ ds .
This is a se@@ g@@ ment that S@@ an@@ j@@ ay G@@ up@@ ta actually took care of .
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : K@@ a@@ it@@ l@@ y@@ n M : I &apos;m happy . I was always af@@ ra@@ id that I was going to have like , an acc@@ id@@ ent or something ."
"And now I can just go and go out with my friends , go do wh@@ at@@ ever I want ."
"A@@ n@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ tal@@ a : S@@ e@@ e , at the end of the day , the prom@@ ise of regener@@ ative medic@@ ine is a single prom@@ ise ."
"And that is really very simple , to make our patients better ."
Thank you for your at@@ ten@@ tion .
( Applause )
"I@@ mag@@ ine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the size of a gol@@ f b@@ all .
So en@@ vis@@ ion what it looks like all w@@ ra@@ pped up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredi@@ ble things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel lo@@ ved and app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated like never before and re@@ con@@ n@@ ect with friends and ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces you hav@@ en &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ do@@ ration and ad@@ mi@@ ration will over@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will rec@@ alib@@ rate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ defin@@ e your sense of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual@@ ity and fa@@ ith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and tr@@ ust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ pas@@ sed vit@@ ality and energy .
"You &apos;ll exp@@ and your v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , me@@ et new people , and you &apos;ll have a heal@@ th@@ ier lif@@ est@@ y@@ le ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation of doing ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely nothing .
You &apos;ll e@@ at coun@@ t@@ less g@@ our@@ me@@ t me@@ als .
F@@ low@@ ers will ar@@ r@@ ive by the tr@@ uc@@ k@@ lo@@ ad .
"P@@ eople will say to you , &quot; You look great . H@@ ave you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a li@@ fe@@ time sup@@ p@@ ly of good dru@@ gs .
"You &apos;ll be chall@@ eng@@ ed , insp@@ i@@ red , mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated and hum@@ bl@@ ed ."
Y@@ our life will have new mean@@ ing .
"P@@ e@@ ace , health , ser@@ en@@ ity , happiness , n@@ ir@@ v@@ ana ."
The pr@@ ice ?
"@@ $ 5@@ 5@@ ,000 , and that &apos;s an incredi@@ ble de@@ al ."
B@@ y now I know you &apos;re d@@ ying to know what it is and where you can get one .
D@@ o@@ es A@@ maz@@ on car@@ ry it ?
D@@ o@@ es it have the Ap@@ ple lo@@ go on it ?
I@@ s there a wa@@ iting l@@ ist ?
Not likely .
This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all w@@ ra@@ pped up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a r@@ are ge@@ m — a brain tu@@ mo@@ r , h@@ em@@ an@@ gi@@ ob@@ las@@ t@@ om@@ a — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ e@@ ps on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m o@@ kay now , I wouldn &apos;t w@@ ish this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly al@@ ter@@ ed my life in ways I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect in all the ways I just shar@@ ed with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s un@@ expec@@ ted , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , consid@@ er that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
"S@@ ome 1@@ 7 years ago , I bec@@ ame all@@ er@@ g@@ ic to D@@ el@@ h@@ i &apos;s air ."
"M@@ y doc@@ tors told me that my l@@ un@@ g cap@@ ac@@ ity had gone down to 7@@ 0 percent , and it was k@@ il@@ ling me ."
"W@@ ith the help of I@@ I@@ T , TE@@ R@@ I , and lear@@ n@@ ings from N@@ A@@ S@@ A , we discover@@ ed that there are three bas@@ ic gre@@ en plan@@ ts , common gre@@ en plan@@ ts , with which we can grow all the f@@ res@@ h air we need indo@@ ors to keep us heal@@ thy ."
"We &apos;ve also found that you can reduc@@ e the f@@ res@@ h air requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments into the building , while main@@ ta@@ ining ind@@ u@@ str@@ y indo@@ or air@@ -@@ qu@@ ality stan@@ dar@@ ds ."
"The three plan@@ ts are A@@ re@@ ca p@@ al@@ m , M@@ o@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ L@@ a@@ w &apos;s Ton@@ gu@@ e and money pl@@ ant ."
The bot@@ an@@ ical nam@@ es are in front of you .
A@@ re@@ ca p@@ al@@ m is a pl@@ ant which re@@ mov@@ es C@@ O@@ 2 and con@@ v@@ erts it into oxy@@ g@@ en .
"We need four sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ -@@ high plan@@ ts per person , and in terms of pl@@ ant care , we need to wi@@ p@@ e the le@@ aves every day in D@@ el@@ h@@ i , and perhaps once a week in c@@ le@@ an@@ er@@ -@@ air c@@ ities ."
"We had to grow them in ver@@ mi man@@ ure , which is ster@@ ile , or hy@@ dro@@ pon@@ ics , and take them ou@@ t@@ do@@ ors every three to four months ."
"The second pl@@ ant is M@@ o@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w &apos;s Ton@@ gu@@ e , which is again a very common pl@@ ant , and we call it a bed@@ room pl@@ ant , because it con@@ v@@ erts C@@ O@@ 2 into oxy@@ g@@ en at night ."
And we need six to eight wa@@ ist@@ -@@ high plan@@ ts per person .
"The third pl@@ ant is money pl@@ ant , and this is again a very common pl@@ ant ; pre@@ fer@@ ably gro@@ ws in hy@@ dro@@ pon@@ ics ."
And this particular pl@@ ant re@@ mov@@ es for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ des and other vol@@ at@@ ile chem@@ ic@@ als .
"W@@ ith these three plan@@ ts , you can grow all the f@@ res@@ h air you need ."
"In fact , you could be in a bot@@ tle with a ca@@ p on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any f@@ res@@ h air ."
"We have tri@@ ed these plan@@ ts at our own building in D@@ el@@ h@@ i , which is a 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ s@@ qu@@ are@@ -@@ fe@@ et , 20@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old building ."
"And it has clo@@ se to 1@@ ,@@ 200 such plan@@ ts for 3@@ 00 oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ ts ."
O@@ ur studies have found that there is a 4@@ 2 percent prob@@ ability of one &apos;s blo@@ od oxy@@ g@@ en going up by one percent if one st@@ a@@ ys indo@@ ors in this building for 10 hours .
The government of India has discover@@ ed or published a study to show that this is the heal@@ th@@ i@@ est building in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i .
"And the study sho@@ wed that , com@@ par@@ ed to other buil@@ din@@ gs , there is a reduc@@ ed in@@ c@@ idence of ey@@ e ir@@ rit@@ ation by 5@@ 2 percent , res@@ pi@@ rat@@ ory syst@@ ems by 3@@ 4 percent , he@@ ada@@ ch@@ es by 2@@ 4 percent , l@@ un@@ g im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment by 12 percent and as@@ th@@ ma by n@@ ine percent ."
"And this study has been published on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 8 , and it &apos;s av@@ a@@ il@@ able on the government of India w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite ."
O@@ ur experience poin@@ ts to an amazing increase in human produc@@ ti@@ vity by over 20 percent by using these plan@@ ts .
"And also a reduc@@ tion in energy requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments in buil@@ din@@ gs by an outs@@ tan@@ ding 15 percent , because you need less f@@ res@@ h air ."
"We are now re@@ plic@@ ating this in a 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 5@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ are@@ -@@ fe@@ et building , which will have 6@@ 0,000 indo@@ or plan@@ ts ."
Why is this important ?
"It is also important for the environ@@ ment , because the world &apos;s energy requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments are expec@@ ted to grow by 30 percent in the next dec@@ ade ."
"@@ 40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buil@@ din@@ gs curr@@ ently , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buil@@ din@@ gs in c@@ ities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years ."
And there is a gro@@ wing pre@@ fer@@ ence for living and working in air@@ -@@ con@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed places .
"&quot; B@@ e the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i ."
And th@@ ank you for list@@ en@@ ing .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ ra@@ id of w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od .
"@@ Not that I &apos;m not af@@ ra@@ id now , but I &apos;ve learned to pret@@ end ."
I &apos;ve learned to be f@@ le@@ x@@ ible .
"In fact , I &apos;ve develop@@ ed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ack in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were sup@@ posed to be kind and thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful and pretty and gen@@ tle and sof@@ t , and we were sup@@ posed to f@@ it into ro@@ les that were sort of sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y — really not quite c@@ lear what we were sup@@ posed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were pl@@ ent@@ y of ro@@ le mod@@ els all around us .
"We had our mo@@ thers , our a@@ un@@ ts , our cou@@ sin@@ s , our sis@@ ters , and of course , the ever@@ -@@ present me@@ dia bom@@ bar@@ ding us with imag@@ es and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a ho@@ me@@ mak@@ er , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ li@@ e things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me p@@ ink ou@@ t@@ f@@ its ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ou@@ ght me a book of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that hu@@ mo@@ r was ac@@ cep@@ table in my family , I could dra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to spe@@ ak — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ v@@ al ."
I was la@@ un@@ ched as a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are rul@@ es out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t per@@ form them right , even though we are im@@ prin@@ ted at bir@@ th with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important c@@ olo@@ r in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shap@@ e we &apos;re sup@@ posed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to we@@ ar — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our ha@@ ir — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the rul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ stan@@ tly being mon@@ it@@ ored by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ rec@@ ted , and the pri@@ mar@@ y pol@@ ic@@ em@@ en are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the t@@ rad@@ ition ."
We pas@@ s it down from gener@@ ation to gener@@ ation .
Not only that — we always have this v@@ ag@@ ue not@@ ion that something &apos;s expec@@ ted of us .
"And on top of all off these rul@@ es , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it put@@ s us in a very ten@@ u@@ ous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these rul@@ es , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite aw@@ are that I &apos;m fol@@ lowing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hu@@ mo@@ r ?"
H@@ u@@ mo@@ r rel@@ ies on the t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it tw@@ ists it ."
"It takes the cod@@ es of behavior and the cod@@ es of d@@ ress , and it makes it un@@ expec@@ ted , and that &apos;s what el@@ ic@@ its a l@@ au@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and hu@@ mo@@ r ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground f@@ lo@@ or , and we know the t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions so well , we can bring a different vo@@ ice to the table ."
Now I started dra@@ wing in the middle of a lot of cha@@ os .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ d@@ uring the C@@ iv@@ il R@@ igh@@ ts mov@@ ement , the as@@ sas@@ sin@@ ations , the W@@ at@@ er@@ ga@@ te he@@ ar@@ ings and then the f@@ em@@ in@@ ist mov@@ ement , and I think I was dra@@ wing , trying to figure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in cha@@ os , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with l@@ au@@ ghter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y parents got div@@ or@@ ced , and my sis@@ ter was ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar high he@@ els , I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar p@@ ink , and I could feel like I f@@ it in ."
"Now when I was a little ol@@ der , in my 20@@ s , I real@@ ized there are not many women in car@@ to@@ on@@ ing ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can bre@@ ak the little gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing of car@@ to@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I bec@@ ame a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always lo@@ ved political car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the cont@@ ent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the st@@ up@@ id rul@@ es that we &apos;re fol@@ lowing as well as l@@ au@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particul@@ arly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particul@@ arly American per@@ spec@@ tive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ ven though I &apos;ve tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the rul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are univer@@ sal , of course — that each culture has its different cod@@ es of behavior and d@@ ress and t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , we have ."
"W@@ omen , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the t@@ rad@@ ition ."
We have amazing an@@ ten@@ na@@ e .
"Now my work l@@ ately has been to col@@ labo@@ rate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ on@@ ists , which I so en@@ jo@@ y , and it &apos;s given me a gre@@ ater app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tr@@ uth , to get at the issu@@ es qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly and succ@@ in@@ c@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the intel@@ l@@ ect , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has al@@ lowed me to col@@ labo@@ rate with women car@@ to@@ on@@ ists from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ di A@@ ra@@ b@@ ia , I@@ ra@@ n , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , A@@ r@@ gen@@ t@@ ina , F@@ ran@@ ce — and we have sa@@ t together and l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed and tal@@ ked and shar@@ ed our diffic@@ ul@@ ties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their vo@@ ices heard in some very difficult cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces .
But I feel bl@@ ess@@ ed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such st@@ rong per@@ cep@@ tions , because of our ten@@ u@@ ous position and our ro@@ le as t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to be chan@@ ge@@ -@@ ag@@ ents ."
"And I think , I tr@@ ul@@ y believe , that we can change this thing one l@@ au@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the history of comput@@ ers we &apos;ve been st@@ riv@@ ing to shor@@ ten the ga@@ p between us and dig@@ ital information , the ga@@ p between our physical world and the world in the scre@@ en where our imag@@ in@@ ation can go w@@ il@@ d ."
"But I wonder@@ ed , what if there could be no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y at all ?"
I started to imagine what this would look like .
"F@@ ir@@ st , I created this to@@ ol which pen@@ et@@ rat@@ es into the dig@@ ital space , so when you pres@@ s it hard on the scre@@ en , it trans@@ fer@@ s its physical body into pi@@ x@@ els ."
"D@@ es@@ ign@@ ers can mater@@ i@@ ali@@ ze their ideas direc@@ tly in 3@@ D , and sur@@ ge@@ ons can prac@@ ti@@ ce on vir@@ tual organs under@@ ne@@ ath the scre@@ en ."
"So with this to@@ ol , this b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y has been bro@@ ken ."
But our two hands still re@@ ma@@ in outside the scre@@ en .
How can you re@@ ach inside and inter@@ act with the dig@@ ital information using the ful@@ l de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity of our hands ?
"A@@ t M@@ ic@@ ro@@ sof@@ t Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed S@@ ci@@ ences , along with my m@@ ent@@ or C@@ ati B@@ ou@@ lan@@ ger , I re@@ des@@ ign@@ ed the computer and turned a little space ab@@ ove the k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ard into a dig@@ ital work@@ space ."
"( Applause ) Because w@@ indo@@ ws and fil@@ es have a position in the real space , sel@@ ec@@ ting them is as easy as gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing a book off your sh@@ elf ."
"Th@@ en you can f@@ li@@ p through this book while high@@ ligh@@ ting the lin@@ es , words on the vir@@ tual tou@@ ch p@@ ad bel@@ ow each f@@ lo@@ ating w@@ ind@@ ow ."
A@@ rch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts can stre@@ t@@ ch or ro@@ t@@ ate the mod@@ els with their two hands direc@@ tly .
"So in these exam@@ pl@@ es , we are re@@ ach@@ ing into the dig@@ ital world ."
But how about re@@ ver@@ sing its ro@@ le and having the dig@@ ital information re@@ ach us instead ?
But now you don &apos;t have to wor@@ ry about it .
This is a view that you get from head@@ -@@ mo@@ un@@ ted or see@@ -@@ through dis@@ play when the system underst@@ an@@ ds the ge@@ ome@@ try of your body .
"@@ T@@ ak@@ ing this idea fur@@ ther , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pi@@ x@@ els in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can tou@@ ch and feel it ?"
What would such a future look like ?
"A@@ t M@@ I@@ T M@@ ed@@ ia L@@ a@@ b , along with my ad@@ vis@@ or H@@ iro@@ shi I@@ shi@@ i and my col@@ labo@@ rat@@ or R@@ e@@ h@@ mi P@@ o@@ st , we created this one physical pi@@ x@@ el ."
"Well , in this case , this sp@@ her@@ ical mag@@ n@@ et ac@@ ts like a 3@@ D pi@@ x@@ el in our space , which means that both comput@@ ers and people can move this object to any@@ where within this little 3@@ D space ."
What we did was essenti@@ ally can@@ cel@@ ing grav@@ ity and contro@@ l@@ ling the mov@@ ement by com@@ bin@@ ing mag@@ ne@@ tic lev@@ it@@ ation and me@@ chan@@ ical ac@@ tu@@ ation and sen@@ sing tech@@ nologi@@ es .
"And by dig@@ it@@ ally program@@ m@@ ing the object , we are liber@@ ating the object from con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of time and space , which means that now , human mo@@ tions can be rec@@ or@@ ded and pla@@ yed back and left per@@ man@@ ently in the physical world ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents can use this as a to@@ ol to learn about the compl@@ ex con@@ cep@@ ts such as plan@@ et@@ ary mo@@ tion , physics , and un@@ like computer scre@@ ens or t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , this is a real , tan@@ gi@@ ble experience that you can tou@@ ch and feel , and it &apos;s very power@@ ful ."
And what &apos;s more exc@@ iting than just turn@@ ing what &apos;s curr@@ ently in the computer physical is to start imag@@ ining how program@@ m@@ ing the world will al@@ ter even our da@@ ily physical acti@@ vit@@ ies .
"@@ To@@ day , we started by talking about the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y , but if we re@@ move this b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y , the only b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y left is our imag@@ in@@ ation ."
Thank you .

So what I want to talk about today is beli@@ ef .
"I want to believe , and you do too ."
"And in fact , I think my th@@ esis here is that beli@@ ef is the natural state of things ."
It is the de@@ fa@@ ult op@@ tion . We just believe .
We believe all sor@@ ts of things .
"B@@ eli@@ ef is natural ; dis@@ beli@@ ef , sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism , science , is not natural ."
It &apos;s un@@ com@@ for@@ table to not believe things .
"So like F@@ o@@ x M@@ ul@@ der on &quot; &quot; X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , &quot; &quot; who wan@@ ts to believe in U@@ F@@ O@@ s ? Well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a beli@@ ef eng@@ ine in our bra@@ ins ."
"E@@ s@@ senti@@ ally , we are pattern@@ -@@ see@@ king pri@@ mat@@ es ."
We con@@ n@@ ect the d@@ ots : A is connec@@ ted to B ; B is connec@@ ted to C@@ .
"And sometimes A really is connec@@ ted to B , and that &apos;s called as@@ soci@@ ation learning ."
"We find patterns , we make those connec@@ tions , whether it &apos;s P@@ av@@ lo@@ v &apos;s do@@ g here as@@ soci@@ ating the sound of the b@@ ell with the food , and then he sa@@ liv@@ ates to the sound of the b@@ ell , or whether it &apos;s a S@@ kin@@ ner@@ ian rat , in which he &apos;s having an as@@ soci@@ ation between his behavior and a re@@ ward for it , and ther@@ e@@ fore he re@@ pe@@ at@@ s the behavior ."
"S@@ ome@@ times it was even sp@@ in@@ ning around tw@@ ice coun@@ ter@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise , once c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise and pec@@ k the k@@ ey tw@@ ice ."
"And that &apos;s called super@@ st@@ ition , and that , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , we will always have with us ."
"When we do this process , we make two typ@@ es of er@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
O@@ ur second typ@@ e of er@@ ro@@ r is a f@@ al@@ se ne@@ ga@@ tive .
A Ty@@ p@@ e I@@ I er@@ ro@@ r is not beli@@ ev@@ ing a pat@@ tern is real when it is .
So let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
"Y@@ our name is L@@ uc@@ y , o@@ kay ?"
And you hear a ru@@ st@@ le in the gra@@ ss .
"I@@ s it a dan@@ ger@@ ous pre@@ da@@ tor , or is it just the w@@ ind ?"
Y@@ our next dec@@ ision could be the most important one of your life .
But no har@@ m . You just move away .
You &apos;ve just won a D@@ ar@@ w@@ in aw@@ ard .
You &apos;ve been taken out of the gen@@ e po@@ ol .
Now the problem here is that pattern@@ ic@@ ities will oc@@ c@@ ur wh@@ en@@ ever the cost of making a Ty@@ p@@ e I er@@ ro@@ r is less than the cost of making a Ty@@ p@@ e I@@ I er@@ ro@@ r .
This is the only equ@@ ation in the talk by the way .
So the de@@ fa@@ ult position is just : B@@ eli@@ eve all patterns are real — All ru@@ st@@ les in the gra@@ ss are dan@@ ger@@ ous pre@@ da@@ tors and not just the w@@ ind .
And so I think that we evol@@ ved ...
"So for example , what do you see here ?"
"It &apos;s a hor@@ se head , that &apos;s right ."
It looks like a hor@@ se . It must be a hor@@ se .
That &apos;s a pat@@ tern .
And is it really a hor@@ se ?
O@@ r is it more like a f@@ ro@@ g ?
"Y@@ es , of course , it &apos;s a c@@ ow ."
S@@ ome people see a D@@ al@@ ma@@ ti@@ an do@@ g .
"Y@@ es , there it is . And there &apos;s the pri@@ me ."
What do you see here ?
"P@@ lan@@ et S@@ at@@ ur@@ n . Y@@ es , that &apos;s good ."
How about here ?
Just sh@@ out out anything you see .
"That &apos;s a good audi@@ ence , Ch@@ ris ."
"Because there &apos;s nothing in this . Well , al@@ le@@ g@@ ed@@ ly there &apos;s nothing ."
This is an experiment done by J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Wh@@ its@@ on at U.@@ T@@ . A@@ us@@ ti@@ n on cor@@ po@@ rate environ@@ ments and whether feel@@ ings of un@@ certain@@ ty and out of control makes people see ill@@ us@@ ory patterns .
"P@@ eople that are put in a con@@ d@@ ition of feel@@ ing out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is al@@ le@@ g@@ ed@@ ly pattern@@ less ."
"In other words , the pro@@ pen@@ sity to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a l@@ ack of control ."
Because fiel@@ d@@ ers are success@@ ful 90 to 9@@ 5 percent of the time .
The best b@@ at@@ ters fa@@ il seven out of 10 times .
"So their super@@ st@@ it@@ ions , their pattern@@ ic@@ ities , are all as@@ soci@@ ated with feel@@ ings of l@@ ack of control and so for@@ th ."
"What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?"
An@@ y@@ body see an object there ?
"There actually is something here , but it &apos;s de@@ grad@@ ed ."
"And those who sc@@ ored high on the E@@ S@@ P sc@@ ale , ten@@ ded to not only see more patterns in the de@@ grad@@ ed imag@@ es but in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t patterns ."
Here is what you show sub@@ jects .
"A si@@ mil@@ ar experiment was done by another &#91; S@@ w@@ is@@ s &#93; psych@@ olog@@ ist n@@ amed P@@ et@@ er B@@ ru@@ g@@ ger , who found si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly more mean@@ ing@@ ful patterns were per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed on the right h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere , v@@ ia the left vis@@ ual field , than the left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere ."
"B@@ ru@@ g@@ ger and his colle@@ ag@@ ue , Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ ine M@@ o@@ h@@ r , gave sub@@ jects L@@ -@@ D@@ O@@ P@@ A ."
"@@ L@@ -@@ D@@ O@@ P@@ A &apos;s a dru@@ g , as you know , given for tre@@ ating P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease , which is rel@@ ated to a de@@ cre@@ ase in d@@ op@@ am@@ ine ."
L@@ -@@ D@@ O@@ P@@ A increas@@ es d@@ op@@ am@@ ine .
A@@ n increase of d@@ op@@ am@@ ine ca@@ used sub@@ jects to see more patterns than those that did not re@@ ce@@ ive the d@@ op@@ am@@ ine .
So d@@ op@@ am@@ ine ap@@ pe@@ ars to be the dru@@ g as@@ soci@@ ated with pattern@@ ic@@ ity .
"In fact , neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic dru@@ gs that are used to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate psych@@ ot@@ ic behavior , things like par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , del@@ us@@ ions and h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ations , these are pattern@@ ic@@ ities ."
They &apos;re in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t patterns . They &apos;re f@@ al@@ se pos@@ it@@ iv@@ es . They &apos;re Ty@@ p@@ e I er@@ ro@@ r@@ s .
"That is , you de@@ cre@@ ase the amount of d@@ op@@ am@@ ine , and their ten@@ den@@ cy to see patterns like that de@@ cre@@ as@@ es ."
"O@@ n the other hand , am@@ ph@@ et@@ am@@ ines like co@@ ca@@ ine are d@@ op@@ am@@ ine agon@@ ists ."
They increase the amount of d@@ op@@ am@@ ine .
"So you &apos;re more likely to feel in a e@@ u@@ ph@@ or@@ ic state , cre@@ ati@@ vity , find more patterns ."
"In fact , I saw R@@ ob@@ in W@@ il@@ li@@ ams rec@@ ently talk about how he thought he was much fun@@ ni@@ er when he was doing co@@ ca@@ ine , when he had that issue , than now ."
So perhaps more d@@ op@@ am@@ ine is rel@@ ated to more cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"D@@ op@@ am@@ ine , I think , changes our sign@@ al@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ no@@ ise ra@@ ti@@ o ."
"That is , how ac@@ cu@@ rate we are in fin@@ ding patterns ."
You think people are talking about you .
"And if you go too far on that , that &apos;s just simply lab@@ el@@ ed as mad@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s a dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion perhaps we might make between two N@@ ob@@ el l@@ au@@ re@@ ates , R@@ ich@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man and J@@ o@@ h@@ n N@@ as@@ h ."
One se@@ es maybe just the right number of patterns to w@@ in a N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze .
"The other one also , but maybe too many patterns ."
And we then call that s@@ ch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
So the sign@@ al@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ no@@ ise ra@@ ti@@ o then pres@@ ents us with a pattern@@ -@@ det@@ ec@@ tion problem .
"And of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?"
And what pat@@ tern do you see here ?
"A@@ ga@@ in , I &apos;m put@@ ting your an@@ ter@@ ior c@@ in@@ gul@@ ate cor@@ te@@ x to the test here , ca@@ using you con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ting pat@@ tern det@@ ec@@ tions ."
"You know , of course , this is V@@ ia U@@ no sho@@ es ."
These are san@@ d@@ als .
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty s@@ ex@@ y fe@@ et , I must say ."
Ma@@ ybe a little P@@ h@@ ot@@ o@@ sh@@ op@@ ped .
"And of course , the amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous fig@@ ures that seem to f@@ li@@ p@@ -@@ f@@ lo@@ p back and for@@ th ."
It turns out what you &apos;re thinking about a lot in@@ flu@@ ences what you t@@ end to see .
"And you see the l@@ am@@ p here , I know ."
Because the ligh@@ ts on here .
"You see a dol@@ ph@@ in here , and there &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in , and there &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in ."
"That &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in ta@@ il there , gu@@ ys ."
"( Laughter ) If we can give you con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ting data , again , your A@@ C@@ C is going to be going into hy@@ per@@ dr@@ ive ."
"If you look down here , it &apos;s fin@@ e . If you look up here , then you get con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ting data ."
The im@@ possible c@@ rate ill@@ us@@ ion .
It &apos;s easy to fo@@ ol the brain in 2@@ D .
"So you say , &quot; &quot; A@@ w , come on S@@ her@@ m@@ er , any@@ body can do that in a P@@ sy@@ ch 1@@ 0@@ 1 t@@ ex@@ t with an ill@@ us@@ ion like that . &quot; &quot; Well here &apos;s the l@@ ate , great J@@ er@@ ry An@@ dr@@ us &apos; &quot; &quot; im@@ possible c@@ rate &quot; &quot; ill@@ us@@ ion in 3@@ D , in which J@@ er@@ ry is st@@ anding inside the im@@ possible c@@ rate ."
And he was kind enough to pos@@ t this and give us the re@@ ve@@ al .
This is a fa@@ ir@@ ly new one that th@@ ro@@ ws us off because of the con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ting patterns of com@@ par@@ ing this an@@ gle with that an@@ gle .
"In fact , it &apos;s the ex@@ act same picture side by side ."
"So what you &apos;re doing is com@@ par@@ ing that an@@ gle instead of with this one , but with that one ."
And so your brain is fo@@ ol@@ ed .
Here &apos;s some fac@@ es on the side of a roc@@ k .
I &apos;m actually not even sure if this is — this might be P@@ h@@ ot@@ o@@ sh@@ op@@ ped .
"But any@@ way , the point is still made ."
"In a qu@@ ic@@ k re@@ action , which one looks od@@ d ?"
The one on the left . O@@ kay . So I &apos;ll ro@@ t@@ ate it so it &apos;ll be the one on the right .
And you are cor@@ rec@@ t .
A fa@@ ir@@ ly f@@ amo@@ us ill@@ us@@ ion — it was first done with Mar@@ garet Th@@ at@@ ch@@ er .
"Now , they tra@@ de up the polit@@ ici@@ ans every time ."
"Well , why is this happening ?"
"Well , we know exactly where it happens , in the tem@@ po@@ ral lob@@ e , right across , sort of ab@@ ove your e@@ ar there , in a little structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And there &apos;s two typ@@ es of cells that do this , that rec@@ or@@ d f@@ aci@@ al fe@@ atures ei@@ ther glob@@ ally , or speci@@ fic@@ ally these large , ra@@ p@@ id@@ -@@ fir@@ ing cells , first look at the gener@@ al face ."
And then you not@@ ice something quite a little bit od@@ d about the ey@@ es and the mo@@ uth .
"E@@ speci@@ ally when they &apos;re up@@ side down , you &apos;re en@@ gag@@ ing that gener@@ al f@@ aci@@ al reco@@ gn@@ ition sof@@ tw@@ are there ."
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
"Well , the w@@ ind is in@@ an@@ i@@ mate ; the dan@@ ger@@ ous pre@@ da@@ tor is an in@@ ten@@ tional ag@@ ent ."
"That is the ten@@ den@@ cy to in@@ f@@ use patterns with mean@@ ing , in@@ ten@@ tion and ag@@ en@@ cy , often in@@ vis@@ ible be@@ ings from the top down ."
"This is an idea that we got from a fel@@ low TE@@ D@@ st@@ er here , D@@ an D@@ en@@ n@@ et@@ t , who tal@@ ked about taking the in@@ ten@@ tional st@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s the beli@@ ef that ali@@ ens are some@@ how more adv@@ an@@ ced than us , more moral than us , and the nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves always are that they &apos;re coming here to sa@@ ve us and res@@ c@@ ue us from on high ."
"The intelli@@ gent des@@ ign@@ er &apos;s always port@@ ra@@ yed as this sup@@ er intelli@@ gent , moral being that comes down to des@@ ign life ."
"And this is also , I think , the bas@@ is of con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy the@@ or@@ ies ."
"But this is a pat@@ tern det@@ ec@@ tion problem , isn &apos;t it ?"
S@@ ome patterns are real and some are not .
W@@ as J@@ F@@ K as@@ sas@@ sin@@ ated by a con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy or by a l@@ one as@@ sas@@ s@@ in ?
"Well , if you go there — there &apos;s people there on any given day — like when I went there , here — sho@@ wing me where the different sho@@ ot@@ ers were ."
My fav@@ or@@ ite one was he was in the man@@ hole .
"And he po@@ pped out at the last second , took that sh@@ ot ."
"Because , let &apos;s face it , some patterns are real ."
"E@@ x@@ pla@@ ins a lot , maybe ."
And 9 / 11 has a con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy theory . It is a con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy .
Because it worked .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we are nat@@ ur@@ al@@ -@@ born d@@ ual@@ ists .
O@@ ur ag@@ en@@ tic@@ ity process comes from the fact that we can en@@ jo@@ y movi@@ es like these .
"Because we can imagine , in ess@@ ence , contin@@ u@@ ing on ."
"O@@ r you can do it through lo@@ ss of consciousness , by ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating in a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge ."
"You get a hy@@ po@@ x@@ ia , or a lower oxy@@ g@@ en ."
And the brain then sen@@ ses that there &apos;s an ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ body experience .
So I &apos;m going to end here with a shor@@ t video cli@@ p that sort of br@@ ings all this together .
It &apos;s just a min@@ ute and a half .
It ties together all this into the power of expec@@ t@@ ation and the power of beli@@ ef .
G@@ o a@@ head and ro@@ ll it .
"W@@ o@@ man : We &apos;re h@@ op@@ ing we can use part of this in a national com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al , right ?"
And this is test on some li@@ p bal@@ ms that we have over here .
"And these are our mod@@ els who are going to help us , R@@ o@@ ger and M@@ at@@ t ."
"And we have our own li@@ p bal@@ m , and we have a lead@@ ing br@@ and ."
W@@ ould you have any problem k@@ is@@ sing our mod@@ els to test it ?
G@@ ir@@ l : No .
I &apos;m going to ask you to go a@@ head and put a bl@@ ind@@ f@@ old on .
"@@ G@@ ir@@ l : Y@@ es . ( W@@ o@@ man : O@@ kay . ) Now , what I &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ts your li@@ ps , the t@@ ex@@ ture , right , and maybe if you can disc@@ er@@ n any fl@@ av@@ or or not ."
G@@ ir@@ l : O@@ kay . ( W@@ o@@ man : H@@ ave you ever done a k@@ is@@ sing test before ? ) G@@ ir@@ l : No .
W@@ o@@ man : T@@ ake a step here .
"O@@ kay , now I &apos;m going to ask you to p@@ uc@@ k@@ er up ."
"P@@ uc@@ k@@ er up big and le@@ an in just a little bit , o@@ kay ?"
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) W@@ o@@ man : O@@ kay .
"And , J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer , how did that feel ?"
J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer : G@@ ood .
( Laughter ) G@@ ir@@ l : O@@ h my G@@ od ! ( Laughter )
M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ her@@ m@@ er : Thank you very much . Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks .
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We st@@ um@@ bl@@ ed on your video on de@@ ci@@ m@@ als , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ mit@@ ive .
And the K@@ h@@ an A@@ c@@ ade@@ my vide@@ os are there .
Gre@@ en means the stud@@ ent &apos;s already pro@@ fic@@ i@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
in a grad@@ u@@ ate school of education who is wat@@ ch@@ ing a prof@@ ess@@ or b@@ ab@@ ble on and on about en@@ gag@@ ement in the most dis@@ en@@ gag@@ ing way possible . R@@ ight now
"@@ there &apos;s a fir@@ st@@ -@@ year teacher at home who is po@@ uring through les@@ son plan@@ s trying to make sense of stan@@ dar@@ ds , who is trying to make sense of how to gra@@ de students appro@@ pri@@ ately , while at the same time saying to her@@ self over and over again , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t s@@ mil@@ e t@@ ill N@@ ov@@ em@@ ber , &quot; because that &apos;s what she was t@@ au@@ ght in her teacher education program ."
"R@@ ight now there &apos;s a stud@@ ent who is coming up with a way to con@@ vin@@ ce his mo@@ m or dad that he &apos;s very , very sic@@ k and can &apos;t make it to school to@@ mor@@ row ."
"R@@ ight now there is also a person who has an enti@@ re audi@@ ence ra@@ pt with at@@ ten@@ tion , a person that is we@@ av@@ ing a power@@ ful nar@@ ra@@ tive about a world that the people who are list@@ en@@ ing have never imag@@ ined or seen before , but if they clo@@ se their ey@@ es ti@@ gh@@ tly enough , they can en@@ vis@@ ion that world because the stor@@ y@@ telling is so comp@@ el@@ ling ."
R@@ ight now .
"So people will then say , &quot; &quot; Well , Ch@@ ris , you descri@@ be the guy who is going through some aw@@ ful tra@@ ining but you &apos;re also descri@@ b@@ ing these power@@ ful educ@@ at@@ ors ."
"If you &apos;re thinking about the world of education or ur@@ b@@ an education in particular , these gu@@ ys will probably can@@ c@@ el each other out , and then we &apos;ll be o@@ kay . &quot; &quot; The reality is , the fol@@ ks I descri@@ bed as the ma@@ st@@ er teachers , the ma@@ st@@ er nar@@ ra@@ tive buil@@ d@@ ers , the ma@@ st@@ er stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ers are far re@@ mov@@ ed from clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms ."
The fol@@ ks who know the sk@@ il@@ ls about how to te@@ ach and en@@ ga@@ ge an audi@@ ence don &apos;t even know what teacher c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ation means .
They may not even have the de@@ gre@@ es to be able to have anything to call an education .
And that to me is sad .
"It &apos;s sad because the people who I descri@@ bed , they were very dis@@ interes@@ ted in the learning process , want to be effec@@ tive teachers , but they have no mod@@ els ."
I &apos;m going to par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se Mar@@ k T@@ wa@@ in .
"M@@ ar@@ k T@@ wa@@ in says that pro@@ per pre@@ par@@ ation , or teach@@ ing , is so power@@ ful that it can turn bad moral@@ s to good , it can turn aw@@ ful prac@@ tic@@ es into power@@ ful ones , it can change men and trans@@ form them into ang@@ els ."
"The fol@@ ks who I descri@@ bed ear@@ li@@ er got pro@@ per pre@@ par@@ ation in teach@@ ing , not in any college or univer@@ sity , but by vir@@ tu@@ e of just being in the same sp@@ ac@@ es of those who en@@ ga@@ ge ."
"B@@ ar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , ra@@ p con@@ cert@@ s , and most import@@ an@@ tly , in the black ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
And I &apos;ve been f@@ ram@@ ing this idea called P@@ ent@@ ec@@ o@@ st@@ al pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
We got a couple of hands .
"You go to a black ch@@ ur@@ ch , their pre@@ ach@@ er star@@ ts off and he real@@ iz@@ es that he has to en@@ ga@@ ge the audi@@ ence , so he star@@ ts off with this sort of wor@@ d@@ play in the beginning of@@ ten@@ times , and then he takes a p@@ ause , and he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my go@@ s@@ h , they &apos;re not quite pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion . &quot; &quot; So he says , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I get an am@@ en ? &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ men ."
Ch@@ ris E@@ m@@ d@@ in : So I can I get an am@@ en ? A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ men .
"C@@ E : And all of a su@@ d@@ den , everybody &apos;s re@@ a@@ wo@@ ken ."
That pre@@ ach@@ er ban@@ gs on the pul@@ p@@ it for at@@ ten@@ tion .
"He dro@@ ps his vo@@ ice at a very , very low v@@ olu@@ me when he wan@@ ts people to k@@ ey into him , and those things are the sk@@ il@@ ls that we need for the most en@@ gag@@ ing teachers ."
"So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about stan@@ dar@@ ds and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the bas@@ ic sk@@ il@@ ls , that mag@@ ic that you need to en@@ ga@@ ge an audi@@ ence , to en@@ ga@@ ge a stud@@ ent ?"
"So I make the argum@@ ent that we re@@ fra@@ me teacher education , that we could foc@@ us on cont@@ ent , and that &apos;s fin@@ e , and we could foc@@ us on the@@ or@@ ies , and that &apos;s fin@@ e , but cont@@ ent and the@@ or@@ ies with the ab@@ s@@ ence of the mag@@ ic of teach@@ ing and learning means nothing ."
"And when they try to descri@@ be what that is , they just say , &quot; &quot; He has that mag@@ ic . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m here to tell you that mag@@ ic can be t@@ au@@ ght ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ es@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , I asked this question when I was a little k@@ id ."
"S@@ ome got k@@ il@@ led , and some did it without dru@@ g as@@ sis@@ tan@@ ce ."
And then the next step is another 15 vol@@ ts .
They said only one percent .
M@@ il@@ g@@ ram did more than 1@@ 6 studies .
And it happens when you &apos;re in a new or un@@ famil@@ i@@ ar sit@@ u@@ ation .
A white guy f@@ all@@ s on the trac@@ ks .
"@@ T@@ ake pat@@ h one , you &apos;re going to be a per@@ p@@ et@@ rat@@ or of ev@@ il ."
"You &apos;re going to che@@ at , or you &apos;re going to al@@ low b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary cl@@ a@@ im@@ s requ@@ ire ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary evidence , and it is my job , my respon@@ si@@ bility , as an astro@@ nom@@ er to re@@ mind people that ali@@ en hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es should always be a last res@@ or@@ t ."
"It inv@@ ol@@ ves data from a N@@ A@@ S@@ A mis@@ sion , ordin@@ ary people and one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary stars in our galaxy ."
It be@@ gan in 200@@ 9 with the la@@ un@@ ch of N@@ A@@ S@@ A &apos;s K@@ e@@ pl@@ er mis@@ sion .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er &apos;s ma@@ in scientific ob@@ jec@@ tive was to find plan@@ ets outside of our sol@@ ar system .
"It did this by star@@ ing at a single field in the sk@@ y , this one , with all the tiny bo@@ x@@ es ."
"And in this one field , it mon@@ it@@ ored the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars contin@@ u@@ ously for four years , taking a data point every 30 minutes ."
It was looking for what astro@@ nom@@ ers call a trans@@ it .
"This is when the planet &apos;s or@@ bit is al@@ ign@@ ed in our line of sight , just so that the planet c@@ ro@@ s@@ ses in front of a star ."
"And when this happens , it bloc@@ ks out a tiny bit of star@@ light , which you can see as a di@@ p in this cur@@ ve ."
And so the te@@ am at N@@ A@@ S@@ A had develop@@ ed very soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated comput@@ ers to se@@ arch for trans@@ its in all the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er data .
"A@@ t the same time of the first data rel@@ ease , astro@@ nom@@ ers at Y@@ ale were wonder@@ ing an interesting thing : What if comput@@ ers mis@@ sed something ?"
And so we la@@ un@@ ched the c@@ it@@ iz@@ en science pro@@ ject called P@@ lan@@ et H@@ un@@ ters to have people look at the same data .
"The human brain has an amazing ability for pat@@ tern reco@@ gn@@ ition , sometimes even better than a computer ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there was a lot of sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism around this ."
"M@@ y colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ eb@@ ra F@@ is@@ ch@@ er , f@@ oun@@ der of the P@@ lan@@ et H@@ un@@ ters pro@@ ject , said that people at the time were saying , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . There &apos;s no way that a computer will mis@@ s a sign@@ al . &quot;"
"And so it was on , the clas@@ si@@ c human ver@@ su@@ s machine gam@@ ble ."
"And if we found one planet , we would be th@@ r@@ il@@ led ."
"When I jo@@ ined the te@@ am four years ago , we had already found a couple ."
"And today , with the help of over 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 science en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ ts , we have found do@@ z@@ ens , and we &apos;ve also found one of the most my@@ ster@@ ious stars in our galaxy ."
"So to understand this , let me show you what a nor@@ mal trans@@ it in K@@ e@@ pl@@ er data looks like ."
"O@@ n this gra@@ p@@ h on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side you have the amount of light , and on the bot@@ tom is time ."
"The white line is light just from the star , what astro@@ nom@@ ers call a light cur@@ ve ."
"And so , for example , let &apos;s take J@@ up@@ it@@ er ."
P@@ lan@@ ets don &apos;t get much big@@ ger than J@@ up@@ it@@ er .
J@@ up@@ it@@ er will make a one percent dro@@ p in a star &apos;s bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
"@@ Earth , on the other hand , is 11 times sm@@ all@@ er than J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and the sign@@ al is bar@@ ely vis@@ ible in the data ."
So back to our my@@ ster@@ y .
"A few years ago , P@@ lan@@ et H@@ un@@ ters were si@@ f@@ ting through data looking for trans@@ its , and they spo@@ t@@ ted a my@@ ster@@ ious sign@@ al coming from the star K@@ I@@ C 8@@ 4@@ 6@@ 2@@ 8@@ 5@@ 2 ."
"The observ@@ ations in M@@ ay of 200@@ 9 were the first they spo@@ t@@ ted , and they started talking about this in the disc@@ us@@ sion for@@ um@@ s ."
"You see , trans@@ its nor@@ m@@ ally only last for a few hours , and this one las@@ ted for almost a week ."
"They were also saying that it looks as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c , mean@@ ing that instead of the c@@ le@@ an , U@@ -@@ shap@@ ed di@@ p that we saw with J@@ up@@ it@@ er , it had this stran@@ ge s@@ lo@@ p@@ e that you can see on the left side ."
This se@@ em@@ ed to ind@@ ic@@ ate that wh@@ at@@ ever was getting in the way and bloc@@ king the star@@ light was not cir@@ cul@@ ar like a planet .
"There are few more di@@ ps that happened , but for a couple of years , it was pretty qu@@ iet ."
"And then in M@@ arch of 20@@ 11 , we see this ."
We descri@@ bed this fe@@ ature as both smo@@ ot@@ h and c@@ le@@ an .
"It also is as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c , having a grad@@ ual di@@ m@@ m@@ ing that las@@ ts almost a week , and then it s@@ n@@ aps right back up to nor@@ mal in just a matter of days ."
"And again , after this , not much happens until F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 20@@ 1@@ 3 ."
Th@@ ings start to get really crazy .
"There is a huge compl@@ ex of di@@ ps in the light cur@@ ve that ap@@ pe@@ ar , and they last for like a hundred days , all the way up into the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er mis@@ sion &apos;s end ."
These di@@ ps have vari@@ able shap@@ es .
"S@@ ome are very shar@@ p , and some are bro@@ ad , and they also have vari@@ able d@@ ura@@ tions ."
"S@@ ome last just for a day or two , and some for more than a week ."
"And there &apos;s also up and down tr@@ ends within some of these di@@ ps , almost like s@@ ever@@ al inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ent ev@@ ents were super@@ im@@ posed on top of each other ."
"And at this time , this star dro@@ ps in its bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness over 20 percent ."
This is tr@@ ul@@ y re@@ mark@@ able .
"And so the c@@ it@@ iz@@ en scient@@ ists , when they saw this , they not@@ i@@ fied the science te@@ am that they found something we@@ ir@@ d enough that it might be wor@@ th fol@@ lowing up ."
"And so when the science te@@ am looked at it , we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , there &apos;s probably just something wrong with the data . &quot; &quot; But we looked really , really , really hard , and the data were good ."
"And so what was happening had to be astro@@ physical , mean@@ ing that something in space was getting in the way and bloc@@ king star@@ light ."
"And the c@@ it@@ iz@@ en scient@@ ists who hel@@ ped us in this discover@@ y , they jo@@ ined along for the r@@ ide wat@@ ch@@ ing science in action fir@@ s@@ th@@ and ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , somebody said , you know , what if this star was very young and it still had the cl@@ ou@@ d of material it was born from sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing it ."
"And then somebody else said , well , what if the star had already form@@ ed plan@@ ets , and two of these plan@@ ets had coll@@ ided , si@@ mil@@ ar to the E@@ ar@@ th@@ -@@ M@@ o@@ on form@@ ing ev@@ ent ."
"Well , both of these the@@ or@@ ies could explain part of the data , but the diffic@@ ul@@ ties were that the star sho@@ wed no sign@@ s of being young , and there was no g@@ low from any of the material that was he@@ ated up by the star &apos;s light , and you would exp@@ ect this if the star was young or if there was a coll@@ ision and a lot of d@@ ust was produc@@ ed ."
"And so somebody else said , well , how about a huge s@@ war@@ m of co@@ me@@ ts that are pas@@ sing by this star in a very el@@ li@@ p@@ tical or@@ bit ?"
"Well , it ends up that this is actually con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent with our observ@@ ations ."
"But I ag@@ ree , it does feel a little con@@ tr@@ iv@@ ed ."
"You see , it would take hund@@ re@@ ds of co@@ me@@ ts to re@@ produc@@ e what we &apos;re observ@@ ing ."
And these are only the co@@ me@@ ts that happen to pas@@ s between us and the star .
"And so in reality , we &apos;re talking thousands to ten@@ s of thousands of co@@ me@@ ts ."
"But of all the bad ideas we had , this one was the best ."
And so we went a@@ head and published our fin@@ din@@ gs .
"Now , let me tell you , this was one of the har@@ d@@ est p@@ ap@@ ers I ever w@@ ro@@ te ."
"S@@ ci@@ ent@@ ists are me@@ ant to pub@@ l@@ ish results , and this sit@@ u@@ ation was far from that ."
( Laughter ) So this isn &apos;t the end of the story .
"A@@ ro@@ und the same time I was writ@@ ing this p@@ aper , I me@@ t with a colle@@ ag@@ ue of mine , J@@ as@@ on W@@ right , and he was also writ@@ ing a p@@ aper on K@@ e@@ pl@@ er data ."
"And he was saying that with K@@ e@@ pl@@ er &apos;s extre@@ me prec@@ ision , it could actually det@@ ect ali@@ en me@@ ga@@ struc@@ tures around stars , but it didn &apos;t ."
"And then I sho@@ wed him this we@@ ir@@ d data that our c@@ it@@ iz@@ en scient@@ ists had found , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; A@@ w cra@@ p , T@@ ab@@ by ."
So we had to find a way to rul@@ e out ali@@ ens .
"So together , we con@@ vin@@ ced a colle@@ ag@@ ue of ours who works on S@@ E@@ T@@ I , the S@@ e@@ arch for E@@ x@@ tra@@ ter@@ re@@ st@@ ri@@ al In@@ tel@@ li@@ gence , that this would be an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary t@@ arg@@ et to pur@@ su@@ e ."
We w@@ ro@@ te a pro@@ po@@ sal to ob@@ ser@@ ve the star with the world &apos;s larg@@ est radi@@ o tel@@ esc@@ ope at the Gre@@ en B@@ ank O@@ b@@ serv@@ at@@ ory .
"A couple months later , news of this pro@@ po@@ sal got le@@ ak@@ ed to the pres@@ s and now there are thousands of ar@@ tic@@ les , over 1@@ 0,000 ar@@ tic@@ les , on this star al@@ one ."
"And if you se@@ arch G@@ o@@ o@@ gle I@@ mag@@ es , this is what you &apos;ll find ."
"Now , you may be wonder@@ ing , O@@ K , T@@ ab@@ by , well , how do ali@@ ens actually explain this light cur@@ ve ?"
"O@@ K , well , imagine a civiliz@@ ation that &apos;s much more adv@@ an@@ ced than our own ."
"In this hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance , this civiliz@@ ation would have ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed the energy sup@@ p@@ ly of their home planet , so where could they get more energy ?"
"Well , they have a ho@@ st star just like we have a su@@ n , and so if they were able to cap@@ ture more energy from this star , then that would sol@@ ve their energy needs ."
So they would go and build huge struc@@ tures .
"Th@@ ese gi@@ ant me@@ ga@@ struc@@ tures , like gin@@ or@@ mo@@ us sol@@ ar pan@@ els , are called D@@ y@@ son sp@@ her@@ es ."
This imag@@ e ab@@ ove are lots of art@@ ists &apos; im@@ pres@@ sions of D@@ y@@ son sp@@ her@@ es .
"It &apos;s really hard to pro@@ v@@ ide per@@ spec@@ tive on the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness of these things , but you can think of it this way ."
And now imagine one of these struc@@ tures in mo@@ tion around a star .
"You can see how it would produc@@ e an@@ om@@ al@@ ies in the data such as un@@ even , un@@ natural looking di@@ ps ."
But it re@@ ma@@ ins that even ali@@ en me@@ ga@@ struc@@ tures cannot de@@ f@@ y the laws of physics .
A@@ no@@ ther idea that &apos;s one of my person@@ al fav@@ or@@ it@@ es is that we had just w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed an inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary space b@@ at@@ tle and the c@@ atas@@ tro@@ ph@@ ic des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion of a planet .
"Now , I ad@@ mit that this would produc@@ e a lot of d@@ ust that we don &apos;t ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
"But if we &apos;re already inv@@ o@@ king ali@@ ens in this ex@@ plan@@ ation , then who is to say they didn &apos;t ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ently c@@ le@@ an up all this m@@ ess for rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing pur@@ pos@@ es ?"
( Laughter ) You can see how this qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly cap@@ tures your imag@@ in@@ ation .
"Well , there you have it ."
We &apos;re in a sit@@ u@@ ation that could un@@ f@@ old to be a natural ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on we don &apos;t understand or an ali@@ en technology we don &apos;t understand .
"P@@ er@@ son@@ ally , as a scient@@ ist , my money is on the natural ex@@ plan@@ ation ."
"But don &apos;t get me wrong , I do think it would be aw@@ es@@ ome to find ali@@ ens ."
"E@@ i@@ ther way , there is something new and really interesting to disc@@ over ."
So what happens next ?
We need to contin@@ ue to ob@@ ser@@ ve this star to learn more about what &apos;s happening .
"But profes@@ sion@@ al astro@@ nom@@ ers , like me , we have li@@ mit@@ ed resour@@ ces for this kind of thing , and K@@ e@@ pl@@ er is on to a different mis@@ sion ."
"You see , this time , ama@@ te@@ ur astro@@ nom@@ ers with their bac@@ k@@ yar@@ d tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es ste@@ pped up im@@ medi@@ ately and started observ@@ ing this star ni@@ gh@@ tly at their own fac@@ il@@ ities , and I am so exc@@ ited to see what they find ."
What &apos;s amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by comput@@ ers because we just wer@@ en &apos;t looking for something like this .
There are new mis@@ sions that are coming up that are observ@@ ing mil@@ lions more stars all over the sk@@ y .
And just think : What will it mean when we find another star like this ?
And what will it mean if we don &apos;t find another star like this ?
Thank you .

What are the mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this class together .
W@@ omen do not ne@@ g@@ ot@@ i@@ ate for themselves in the work@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even as@@ king ? &quot; &quot; If you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ o@@ y , it mat@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two gro@@ ups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone li@@ ked H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the compl@@ ic@@ ation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ l@@ lis R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consid@@ er an un@@ us@@ ual fri@@ end@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it fe@@ els natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the W@@ or@@ ld Tra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the mor@@ ning of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had peri@@ shed yet until 3@@ 6 hours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were af@@ ra@@ id of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my h@@ us@@ b@@ and , O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sh@@ oc@@ k , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sh@@ oc@@ k , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble explo@@ sion in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not ven@@ ge@@ ful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was ind@@ ic@@ ted on six coun@@ ts of con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy to com@@ mit ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , and the U.@@ S@@ . government called for a death pen@@ al@@ ty for him , if con@@ vic@@ ted , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and I spo@@ ke out in op@@ position to that , pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ly ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh that and through human ri@@ gh@@ ts gro@@ ups , we were b@@ rou@@ ght together with s@@ ever@@ al other vic@@ tim@@ s &apos; famil@@ ies ."
"When I saw A@@ ich@@ a in the me@@ dia , coming over when her son was ind@@ ic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a br@@ ave woman ."
S@@ ome@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m st@@ ron@@ ger . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep g@@ ri@@ ef ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the str@@ eng@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a vic@@ ti@@ m , I got im@@ medi@@ ate sym@@ pa@@ thy ."
"But when people learned what her son was acc@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ pa@@ thy ."
But her suf@@ fer@@ ing is equ@@ al to mine .
"So we me@@ t in N@@ ov@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ ich@@ a will now tell you how that came about ."
"( Trans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ ich@@ a el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : G@@ ood af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ dies and gen@@ t@@ l@@ em@@ en ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation of H@@ u@@ man R@@ igh@@ ts to put me in tou@@ ch with the parents of the vic@@ tim@@ s .
So they in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed me to five famil@@ ies .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ l@@ lis , and I wat@@ ched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , sis@@ ters ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suf@@ fer@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was marri@@ ed when I was 1@@ 4 .
"I lo@@ st a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 1@@ 6 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
"And I still suf@@ fer , because my son is like he &apos;s bur@@ i@@ ed al@@ ive ."
I know she really cri@@ ed for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s al@@ ive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s t@@ or@@ tu@@ red .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suf@@ fer@@ ing is something pos@@ itive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mo@@ thers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be h@@ and@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m ."
"I go to scho@@ ols to talk to young , M@@ us@@ li@@ m girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be marri@@ ed against their will very young ."
"So if I can sa@@ ve one of the young girls , and av@@ o@@ id that they get marri@@ ed and suf@@ fer as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
"P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ ich@@ a , starting with that day we had our very first me@@ et@@ ing with other family mem@@ bers — which was a very p@@ riv@@ ate me@@ et@@ ing with sec@@ ur@@ ity , because it was N@@ ov@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , we were af@@ ra@@ id of the super@@ -@@ pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ism of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ bers ."
But we were all so nerv@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was nerv@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"B@@ e@@ fore we knew each others &apos; nam@@ es , or anything , we had em@@ bra@@ ced and we@@ pt ."
"Th@@ en we sa@@ t in a cir@@ cle with sup@@ port , with help , from people experien@@ ced in this kind of re@@ con@@ cil@@ i@@ ation ."
"And A@@ ich@@ a started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ no@@ cent , but I want to tell you how sor@@ ry I am for what happened to your famil@@ ies ."
"I know what it is to suf@@ fer , and I feel that if there is a cri@@ me , a person should be tri@@ ed fa@@ ir@@ ly and p@@ un@@ i@@ shed . &quot; &quot; But she re@@ ach@@ ed out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ ak@@ er ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connec@@ ted as human be@@ ings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three hours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d fel@@ t as if we &apos;d known each other for@@ ever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these present cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had me@@ t someone with such a hard life , from such a tot@@ ally different culture and environ@@ ment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a spec@@ ial connec@@ tion , which I value very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ ra@@ id of the other , but making that step and then real@@ iz@@ ing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ ich@@ a , do you have a couple of words for con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( Trans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your he@@ ar@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."
You must be t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant .
You have to fi@@ ght against violence .
And I hope that some@@ day we &apos;ll all live together in pe@@ ace and res@@ pec@@ ting each other .

"In 200@@ 8 , C@@ y@@ cl@@ one N@@ arg@@ is dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r ."
M@@ il@@ lions of people were in s@@ ev@@ ere need of help .
The U.@@ N@@ . wanted to r@@ us@@ h people and sup@@ p@@ li@@ es to the are@@ a .
"But there were no ma@@ ps , no ma@@ ps of ro@@ ad@@ s , no ma@@ ps sho@@ wing ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , no way for help to re@@ ach the c@@ y@@ cl@@ one vic@@ tim@@ s ."
"When we look at a map of L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es or L@@ on@@ don , it is hard to believe that as of 200@@ 5 , only 15 percent of the world was ma@@ pped to a ge@@ o@@ -@@ co@@ da@@ ble level of deta@@ il ."
The U.@@ N@@ . ra@@ n head@@ first into a problem that the maj@@ or@@ ity of the world &apos;s popul@@ ous fac@@ es : not having deta@@ il@@ ed ma@@ ps .
But help was coming .
"A@@ t G@@ o@@ o@@ gle , 40 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers used a new sof@@ tw@@ are to map 1@@ 20@@ ,000 kilo@@ me@@ ters of ro@@ ad@@ s , 3@@ ,000 ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als , log@@ is@@ tics and rel@@ i@@ ef poin@@ ts ."
And it took them four days .
The new sof@@ tw@@ are they used ? G@@ o@@ o@@ gle M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er .
G@@ o@@ o@@ gle M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er is a technology that em@@ po@@ w@@ ers each of us to map what we know loc@@ ally .
"P@@ eople have used this sof@@ tw@@ are to map everything from ro@@ ad@@ s to riv@@ ers , from scho@@ ols to loc@@ al bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , and video stor@@ es to the cor@@ ner stor@@ e ."

"So , I was in the ho@@ sp@@ ital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the cha@@ ir@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exc@@ ited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic new treat@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exc@@ ited . I wal@@ ked with him to his off@@ ice ."
"And he expla@@ ined to me that , when I sh@@ ave , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the ha@@ ir is , but on the right side of my face I was b@@ ad@@ ly b@@ urn@@ ed so I have no ha@@ ir , and this cre@@ ates l@@ ack of sym@@ me@@ try ."
And what &apos;s the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to t@@ at@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c .
It s@@ oun@@ ded interesting . He asked me to go and sh@@ ave .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a stran@@ ge way to sh@@ ave , because I thought about it and I real@@ ized that the way I was shav@@ ing then would be the way I would sh@@ ave for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the w@@ id@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his off@@ ice , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he sho@@ wed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ e@@ ks with little black d@@ ots — not very informa@@ tive ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow ol@@ der and my ha@@ ir becom@@ es white ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have las@@ ers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ cer@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the big@@ gest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ jo@@ y looking n@@ on@@ -@@ sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ v@@ ert@@ ed pl@@ eas@@ ure from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have sex with you more f@@ requ@@ ently ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very sur@@ pris@@ ing to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treat@@ ments — there were many treat@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ext@@ ent ."
But I decided not to have this treat@@ ment .
"And I went to his de@@ put@@ y and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Wh@@ ere was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he expla@@ ined that they have done this proc@@ ed@@ ure on two patients already , and they need the third pati@@ ent for a p@@ aper they were writ@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a s@@ ch@@ m@@ uc@@ k .
"R@@ ight , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experim@@ ents in the la@@ b ."
"And when we run experim@@ ents , we us@@ u@@ ally hope that one group will be@@ have differ@@ ently than another ."
"So we had one group that I h@@ op@@ ed their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce would be very high , another group that I thought their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — as@@ ide from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was sup@@ posed to have very high per@@ for@@ man@@ ce that was actually per@@ form@@ ing ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , des@@ tro@@ ying my stat@@ is@@ tical si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of the test ."
So I looked care@@ fully at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years ol@@ der than any@@ body else in the sam@@ ple .
And I remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and d@@ run@@ ken guy came one day to the la@@ b wan@@ ting to make some easy cas@@ h and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s th@@ row him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever incl@@ u@@ de a d@@ run@@ ken guy in a sam@@ ple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this d@@ run@@ ken guy was not in that con@@ d@@ ition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"W@@ ould we have th@@ ro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ! What a s@@ mart guy who is per@@ form@@ ing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lower , giving us even st@@ ron@@ ger stat@@ is@@ tical results than we could ."
So we decided not to th@@ row the guy out and to r@@ er@@ u@@ n the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experim@@ ents that we &apos;ve done on con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est , basically kind of bring two poin@@ ts to the for@@ e@@ ground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to t@@ at@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves that get them to be bl@@ ind@@ ed to reality and give us ad@@ vic@@ e that is in@@ her@@ ently bi@@ as@@ ed .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all reco@@ gni@@ ze , and we see that it happens ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe we don &apos;t reco@@ gni@@ ze it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to reco@@ gni@@ ze that sometimes we too are bl@@ ind@@ ed by our own in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult les@@ son to take into ac@@ coun@@ t ."
Because we don &apos;t see how con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experim@@ ents , in my mind , I was hel@@ ping science ."
I was el@@ im@@ in@@ ating the data to get the true pat@@ tern of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a k@@ night trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ fer@@ ing with the process with lots of good in@@ ten@@ tions .
"And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cas@@ es in our lives where con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to tr@@ ust our own in@@ tu@@ ition to over@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ all@@ ing pre@@ y to these behav@@ i@@ ors , because we can create lots of und@@ es@@ i@@ ra@@ ble cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces ."
I do want to leave you with one pos@@ itive thought .
"I mean , this is all very depres@@ sing , right — people have con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The pos@@ itive per@@ spec@@ tive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms of why we fa@@ il and where we fa@@ il , we can actually hope to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tr@@ uth of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ ition that in@@ equality is div@@ is@@ ive and soci@@ ally cor@@ ro@@ sive has been around since before the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equ@@ al societies , and see what in@@ equality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the lin@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you ex@@ ist .
"But first , see what a mis@@ er@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life expec@@ tan@@ cy against gro@@ ss national income — how r@@ ich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like Nor@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as r@@ ich as I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , Gre@@ ece , P@@ or@@ tu@@ ga@@ l on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expec@@ tan@@ cy at all .
There &apos;s no su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life expec@@ tan@@ cy ."
"Th@@ ese are small are@@ as of Engl@@ and and W@@ al@@ es — the po@@ or@@ est on the right , the ri@@ ch@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the po@@ or and the rest of us .
E@@ ven the people just bel@@ ow the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that par@@ ad@@ o@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at rel@@ ative income or social position , social stat@@ us — where we are in rel@@ ation to each other and the size of the ga@@ ps between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ medi@@ ately won@@ der : what happens if we w@@ id@@ en the differ@@ ences , or com@@ pres@@ s them , make the income differ@@ ences big@@ ger or sm@@ all@@ er ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical data .
I &apos;m taking data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank has — on the sc@@ ale of income differ@@ ences in these r@@ ich develop@@ ed market democra@@ ci@@ es .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much ri@@ ch@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equ@@ al countries on the left — Jap@@ an , F@@ in@@ land , Nor@@ way , S@@ w@@ ed@@ en — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as r@@ ich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more un@@ equ@@ al end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ ga@@ l , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ in@@ ga@@ po@@ re — the differ@@ ences are tw@@ ice as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are tw@@ ice as un@@ equ@@ al as some of the other success@@ ful market democra@@ ci@@ es ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We col@@ lec@@ ted data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social l@@ ad@@ der ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally com@@ par@@ able data on life expec@@ tan@@ cy , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ ac@@ y sc@@ or@@ es , on in@@ f@@ ant mo@@ rt@@ ality rat@@ es , h@@ om@@ ic@@ ide rat@@ es , pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pris@@ on , te@@ en@@ age bir@@ th@@ rat@@ es , lev@@ els of tr@@ ust , ob@@ es@@ ity , mental ill@@ ness — which in stan@@ dar@@ d diagno@@ s@@ tic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation incl@@ ud@@ es dru@@ g and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mo@@ bility ."
We put them all in one inde@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ igh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
Wh@@ ere a country is is a sort of average sc@@ ore on these things .
"And there , you see it in rel@@ ation to the measure of in@@ equality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sh@@ all use over and over again in the data ."
The more un@@ equ@@ al countries are doing wor@@ se on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily clo@@ se cor@@ rel@@ ation .
"But if you look at that same inde@@ x of health and social problems in rel@@ ation to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a , gro@@ ss national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ rel@@ ation any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our argum@@ ent and just man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tu@@ red this evidence , so we also did a p@@ aper in the Brit@@ ish M@@ ed@@ ical J@@ our@@ n@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F inde@@ x of child well-@@ being ."
It has 40 different com@@ pon@@ ents put together by other people .
"It con@@ ta@@ ins whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have bo@@ o@@ ks at home , what im@@ mun@@ iz@@ ation rat@@ es are like , whether there &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying at school ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in rel@@ ation to that same measure of in@@ equality .
K@@ id@@ s do wor@@ se in the more un@@ equ@@ al societies .
H@@ igh@@ ly si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-@@ being , in rel@@ ation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-@@ being of our societies is not de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in po@@ or@@ er countries , but not in the r@@ ich develop@@ ed world ."
But the differ@@ ences between us and where we are in rel@@ ation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the se@@ par@@ ate b@@ its of our inde@@ x .
"@@ Here , for inst@@ ance , is tr@@ ust ."
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tr@@ ust@@ ed .
It comes from the W@@ or@@ ld V@@ al@@ ues S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more un@@ equ@@ al end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can tr@@ ust others ."
"But in the more equ@@ al societies , it ris@@ es to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at meas@@ ures of inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in commun@@ ity life or social cap@@ ital , very si@@ mil@@ ar relation@@ shi@@ ps clo@@ s@@ ely rel@@ ated to in@@ equality ."
"I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice ."
"We did it first on these r@@ ich , develop@@ ed countries , and then as a se@@ par@@ ate test bed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American st@@ ates — as@@ king just the same question : do the more un@@ equ@@ al st@@ ates do wor@@ se on all these kinds of meas@@ ures ?"
So here is tr@@ ust from a gener@@ al social surv@@ ey of the f@@ ed@@ er@@ al government rel@@ ated to in@@ equality .
V@@ er@@ y si@@ mil@@ ar sc@@ at@@ ter over a si@@ mil@@ ar ran@@ ge of lev@@ els of tr@@ ust .
S@@ ame thing is going on .
B@@ as@@ ically we found that almost anything that &apos;s rel@@ ated to tr@@ ust inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally is rel@@ ated to tr@@ ust amo@@ n@@ g@@ st the 50 st@@ ates in that se@@ par@@ ate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a flu@@ ke .
This is mental ill@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together fig@@ ures using the same diagno@@ s@@ tic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom sam@@ pl@@ es of the population to al@@ low us to comp@@ are rat@@ es of mental ill@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental ill@@ ness in the prec@@ ed@@ ing year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental ill@@ ness of others .
"And again , clo@@ s@@ ely rel@@ ated to in@@ equality ."
This is violence .
"Th@@ ese red d@@ ots are American st@@ ates , and the bl@@ ue tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es are C@@ an@@ a@@ dian pro@@ vin@@ ces ."
But look at the sc@@ ale of the differ@@ ences .
It goes from 15 h@@ om@@ ic@@ ides per million up to 1@@ 50 .
This is the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pris@@ on .
"There &apos;s a about a ten@@ f@@ old difference there , lo@@ g sc@@ ale up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pris@@ on .
That relation@@ ship is not main@@ ly driv@@ en by more cri@@ me .
"In some places , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ un@@ itive s@@ ent@@ en@@ cing , har@@ sh@@ er s@@ ent@@ en@@ cing ."
And the more un@@ equ@@ al societies are more likely also to re@@ tain the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
Here we have children dro@@ p@@ ping out of high school .
"A@@ ga@@ in , quite big differ@@ ences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily da@@ mag@@ ing , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mo@@ bility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mo@@ bility bas@@ ed on income .
"B@@ as@@ ically , it &apos;s as@@ king : do r@@ ich fa@@ thers have r@@ ich s@@ ons and po@@ or fa@@ thers have po@@ or s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more un@@ equ@@ al end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ av@@ ian countries , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the audi@@ ence here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ics here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that t@@ end to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are end@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are wor@@ se in more un@@ equ@@ al countries — not just a little bit wor@@ se , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the exp@@ en@@ se , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this gra@@ p@@ h that I sho@@ wed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two poin@@ ts .
"One is that , in gra@@ p@@ h after gra@@ p@@ h , we find the countries that do wor@@ se , wh@@ at@@ ever the ou@@ t@@ come , seem to be the more un@@ equ@@ al ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nor@@ di@@ c countries and Jap@@ an ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ func@@ tion rel@@ ated to in@@ equality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this gra@@ p@@ h is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , S@@ w@@ ed@@ en and Jap@@ an , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways ."
"The position of women , how clo@@ s@@ ely they keep to the n@@ uc@@ lear family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the po@@ les in terms of the r@@ ich develop@@ ed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their gre@@ ater equality .
"S@@ w@@ ed@@ en has huge differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it nar@@ ro@@ ws the ga@@ p through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al wel@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous ben@@ ef@@ its and so on ."
Jap@@ an is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much sm@@ all@@ er differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lower ta@@ x@@ es .
It has a sm@@ all@@ er wel@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our anal@@ y@@ sis of the American st@@ ates , we find rather the same con@@ tra@@ st ."
"There are some st@@ ates that do well through re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion , some st@@ ates that do well because they have sm@@ all@@ er income differ@@ ences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your gre@@ ater equality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about per@@ fect equality , I &apos;m talking about what ex@@ ists in r@@ ich develop@@ ed market democra@@ ci@@ es ."
A@@ no@@ ther really sur@@ pris@@ ing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the po@@ or who are af@@ fec@@ ted by in@@ equality .
There seems to be some tr@@ uth in J@@ o@@ h@@ n D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ land . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to comp@@ are how people do in more and less equ@@ al countries at each level in the social h@@ ier@@ arch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s in@@ f@@ ant mo@@ rt@@ ality .
S@@ ome S@@ w@@ ed@@ es very kin@@ d@@ ly clas@@ si@@ fied a lot of their in@@ f@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Brit@@ ish re@@ g@@ is@@ ter of gener@@ al soci@@ o@@ economic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation .
"And so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ ron@@ is@@ tically a clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation by fa@@ thers &apos; oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations , so single parents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social class , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ il@@ led man@@ ual oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the sk@@ il@@ led man@@ ual oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations in the middle , then the j@@ un@@ ior n@@ on@@ -@@ man@@ ual , going up high to the profes@@ sion@@ al oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of larg@@ er compan@@ ies ."
You see there that S@@ w@@ ed@@ en does better than Brit@@ ain all the way across the social h@@ ier@@ arch@@ y .
The big@@ gest differ@@ ences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small ben@@ ef@@ it to being in a more equ@@ al society ."
We show that on about five different s@@ ets of data c@@ over@@ ing educ@@ ational ou@@ t@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ally .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that gre@@ ater equality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some ben@@ ef@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ social effec@@ ts of in@@ equality .
"M@@ ore to do with feel@@ ings of super@@ i@@ or@@ ity and in@@ fer@@ i@@ or@@ ity , of being val@@ u@@ ed and dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed , res@@ pec@@ ted and dis@@ res@@ pec@@ ted ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the stat@@ us comp@@ et@@ ition that comes out of that driv@@ es the con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism in our society ."
It also lead@@ s to stat@@ us in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re j@@ ud@@ g@@ ed and seen by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ gar@@ ded as at@@ trac@@ tive , cl@@ ever , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ es@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , some par@@ al@@ le@@ l work going on in social psych@@ ology : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different studies in which vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been in@@ vit@@ ed into a psych@@ ological labo@@ rat@@ ory and had their stress hor@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing st@@ res@@ s@@ ful t@@ as@@ ks , meas@@ ured ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interes@@ ted in seeing is what kind of st@@ res@@ ses most rel@@ i@@ ably ra@@ ise lev@@ els of cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol , the cent@@ ral stress hor@@ mon@@ e ."
And the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion was it was t@@ as@@ ks that incl@@ ud@@ ed soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ at@@ s to self-@@ es@@ te@@ e@@ m or social stat@@ us in which others can ne@@ ga@@ ti@@ vely j@@ ud@@ ge your per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
Th@@ ose kind of st@@ res@@ ses have a very particular ef@@ fect on the ph@@ y@@ si@@ ology of stress .
Now we have been c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ized .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"I should tell you though that when people c@@ rit@@ ici@@ ze us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pic@@ k and cho@@ ose data ."
"We have an ab@@ sol@@ ute rul@@ e that if our data s@@ our@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ y@@ sis ."
"O@@ ur data s@@ our@@ ce dec@@ ides whether it &apos;s rel@@ i@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise that would in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in rel@@ ation to income and equality in the ac@@ ade@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed j@@ our@@ n@@ als .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , h@@ id@@ ing a very simple demon@@ stra@@ tion ."
"The same countries , the same measure of in@@ equality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we control for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated me@@ th@@ ods in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for pov@@ ert@@ y and education and so on ."
What about c@@ au@@ sal@@ ity ?
C@@ or@@ rel@@ ation in itself doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve c@@ au@@ sal@@ ity .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And inde@@ ed , people know the c@@ au@@ sal lin@@ ks quite well in some of these ou@@ t@@ comes ."
"The big change in our understanding of driv@@ ers of ch@@ ron@@ ic health in the r@@ ich develop@@ ed world is how important ch@@ ron@@ ic stress from social s@@ our@@ ces is af@@ fec@@ ting the im@@ mun@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar system ."
"O@@ r for inst@@ ance , the reason why violence becom@@ es more common in more un@@ equ@@ al societies is because people are sen@@ sit@@ ive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the pos@@ t-@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ stra@@ in income , the b@@ on@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our bo@@ s@@ ses ac@@ coun@@ table to their emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in any way we can .
I think the tak@@ e-@@ home mes@@ sa@@ ge though is that we can impro@@ ve the real qu@@ ality of human life by reduc@@ ing the differ@@ ences in in@@ comes between us .
"S@@ ud@@ den@@ ly we have a h@@ and@@ le on the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ social well-@@ being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exc@@ iting ."
Thank you .

"The most amazing thing about this ima@@ m is that he didn &apos;t ask me anything — nei@@ ther a sk@@ et@@ ch , or what I was going to write ."
"In every work that I create , I write mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es with my st@@ y@@ le of cal@@ li@@ graf@@ f@@ iti — a mi@@ x of cal@@ li@@ graph@@ y and graf@@ f@@ iti ."
I use quot@@ es or po@@ et@@ ry .

You don &apos;t need to know the mean@@ ing to feel the piece .
I think that A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic sc@@ ri@@ pt tou@@ ch@@ es your s@@ ou@@ l before it re@@ ach@@ es your ey@@ es .

I &apos;d like you to imagine the world an@@ ew .
Here &apos;s an imag@@ e that you &apos;re very famil@@ i@@ ar with .
I &apos;m old enough that I was actually born before we saw this imag@@ e .
"It &apos;s only been a few cent@@ ur@@ ies since we &apos;ve actually , most of us , thought of our planet as sp@@ her@@ ical ."
"When we first saw these imag@@ es in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , the world was chang@@ ing at an incredi@@ ble rate ."
"It &apos;s a map in which we stre@@ t@@ ched places , so that those are@@ as which con@@ tain many people are dra@@ wn larg@@ er , and those are@@ as , like the S@@ a@@ h@@ ara and the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , in which there are few people , have been sh@@ run@@ k away ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body on the planet is given an equ@@ al amount of space .

I &apos;m here to rec@@ ru@@ it men to sup@@ port gen@@ der equality .
What do men have to do with gen@@ der equality ?
"@@ G@@ en@@ der equality is about women , right ?"
"A@@ c@@ tually , I &apos;m even here speak@@ ing as a middle class white man ."
"Now , I wasn &apos;t always a middle class white man ."
"It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in grad@@ u@@ ate school , and a bun@@ ch of us grad@@ u@@ ate students got together one day , and we said , you know , there &apos;s an explo@@ sion of writ@@ ing and thinking in f@@ em@@ in@@ ist theory , but there &apos;s no cour@@ ses yet ."
So we did what grad@@ u@@ ate students t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally do in a sit@@ u@@ ation like that .
"We &apos;ll read a t@@ ex@@ t , we &apos;ll talk about it , we &apos;ll have a po@@ t@@ l@@ uc@@ k din@@ ner ."
"( Laughter ) So every week , 11 women and me got together . ( Laughter )"
We would read some t@@ ex@@ t in f@@ em@@ in@@ ist theory and have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it .
"And d@@ uring one of our con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions , I w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed an inter@@ action that changed my life for@@ ever ."
It was a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion between two women .
"One of the women was white , and one was black ."
"And the white woman said — this is going to sound very an@@ ach@@ ron@@ is@@ tic now — the white woman said , &quot; &quot; All women face the same op@@ pres@@ sion as women ."
"A@@ ll women are si@@ mil@@ arly sit@@ u@@ ated in pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ y , and ther@@ e@@ fore all women have a kind of in@@ tu@@ itive sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity or sis@@ ter@@ ho@@ od . &quot; &quot; And the black woman said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not so sure ."
"@@ Let me ask you a question . &quot; &quot; So the black woman says to the white woman , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en you w@@ ake up in the mor@@ ning and you look in the mir@@ ro@@ r , what do you see ? &quot; &quot; And the white woman said , &quot; &quot; I see a woman . &quot; &quot; And the black woman said , &quot; &quot; You see , that &apos;s the problem for me ."
"Because when I w@@ ake up in the mor@@ ning and I look in the mir@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I see a black woman ."
"@@ To me , ra@@ ce is vis@@ ible . But to you , ra@@ ce is in@@ vis@@ ible . You don &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And then she said something really star@@ t@@ ling ."
"She said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s how p@@ riv@@ il@@ e@@ ge works ."
"P@@ riv@@ il@@ e@@ ge is in@@ vis@@ ible to those who have it . &quot; &quot; It is a l@@ u@@ x@@ ury , I will say to the white people sit@@ ting in this room , not to have to think about ra@@ ce every s@@ pl@@ it second of our lives . P@@ riv@@ il@@ e@@ ge is in@@ vis@@ ible to those who have it ."
"Now remember , I was the only man in this group ,"
"@@ so when I w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed this , I went , &quot; &quot; O@@ h no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And somebody said , &quot; &quot; Well what was that re@@ action ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , when I w@@ ake up in the mor@@ ning and I look in the mir@@ ro@@ r , I see a human being ."
I &apos;m kind of the gener@@ ic person .
"You know , I &apos;m a middle class white man . I have no ra@@ ce , no class , no gen@@ der ."
"I had to start thinking about them , and it had been p@@ riv@@ il@@ e@@ ge that had ke@@ pt it in@@ vis@@ ible to me for so long ."
"Now , I w@@ ish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago in that little disc@@ us@@ sion group , but I was re@@ min@@ ded of it quite rec@@ ently at my univer@@ sity where I te@@ ach ."
"I have a colle@@ ag@@ ue , and she and I both te@@ ach the soci@@ ology of gen@@ der course on al@@ tern@@ ate s@@ em@@ es@@ ters ."
So she giv@@ es a gu@@ est lec@@ ture for me when I te@@ ach .
"A@@ ll that s@@ em@@ es@@ ter , wh@@ en@@ ever my colle@@ ag@@ ue op@@ en@@ ed her mo@@ uth , what my students saw was a woman ."
"I mean , if you were to say to my students , &quot; There is struc@@ tu@@ ral in@@ equality bas@@ ed on gen@@ der in the United States , &quot; they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Well of course you &apos;d say that ."
"I@@ s that going to be on the test ? How do you sp@@ ell &apos; struc@@ tu@@ ral &apos; ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I hope you all can see , this is what ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity looks like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) D@@ is@@ em@@ bo@@ died W@@ es@@ tern ra@@ tion@@ ality . ( Laughter )
"And that , by the way , is why I think men so often we@@ ar ties . ( Laughter )"
"Because if you are going to em@@ body dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died W@@ es@@ tern ra@@ tion@@ ality , you need a si@@ gni@@ fi@@ er , and what could be a better si@@ gni@@ fi@@ er of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died W@@ es@@ tern ra@@ tion@@ ality than a gar@@ ment that at one end is a no@@ ose and the other end poin@@ ts to the gen@@ it@@ als ?"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That is min@@ d@@ -@@ body d@@ ual@@ ism right there .
So making gen@@ der vis@@ ible to men is the first step to en@@ gag@@ ing men to sup@@ port gen@@ der equality .
I was on a T@@ V talk show op@@ pos@@ ite four white men .
"It was a quot@@ e from one of the men , and the quot@@ e was , &quot; A B@@ l@@ ack W@@ o@@ man S@@ to@@ le My J@@ ob . &quot;"
I want to know about the word &apos; my . &apos; Wh@@ ere did you get the idea it was your job ?
"O@@ f course , it &apos;s fa@@ ir , it &apos;s right and it &apos;s just ."
"But more than that , gen@@ der equality is also in our inter@@ est as men ."
"If you list@@ en to what men say about what they want in their lives , gen@@ der equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live ."
G@@ en@@ der equality is good for countries .
"It turns out , ac@@ cor@@ ding to most studies , that those countries that are the most gen@@ der equ@@ al are also the countries that sc@@ ore high@@ est on the happiness sc@@ ale ."
And that &apos;s not just because they &apos;re all in Eu@@ rop@@ e .
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven within Eu@@ rop@@ e , those countries that are more gen@@ der equ@@ al also have the high@@ est lev@@ els of happiness ."
It is also good for compan@@ ies .
"R@@ es@@ e@@ arch by C@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st and others has sho@@ wn con@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely that the more gen@@ der@@ -@@ equ@@ al compan@@ ies are , the better it is for work@@ ers , the happ@@ ier their lab@@ or force is ."
They have lower job tur@@ no@@ ver . They have lower lev@@ els of at@@ tr@@ ition .
They have an eas@@ ier time rec@@ ru@@ iting .
"And I say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h no , in fact , what you have to start cal@@ cul@@ ating is how much gen@@ der in@@ equality is already co@@ st@@ ing you ."
It is extre@@ m@@ ely exp@@ en@@ sive . &quot; &quot; So it is good for business .
"And the other thing is , it &apos;s good for men ."
"It is good for the kind of lives we want to live , because young men es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally have changed en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly , and they want to have lives that are an@@ i@@ mat@@ ed by ter@@ ri@@ fic relation@@ shi@@ ps with their children ."
"They exp@@ ect their par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , their spo@@ uses , their w@@ iv@@ es , to work outside the home and be just as com@@ mit@@ ted to their care@@ ers as they are ."
"I was talking , to give you an ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion of this change — S@@ ome of you may remember this ."
"When I was a lot youn@@ ger , there was a r@@ id@@ dle that was posed to us ."
S@@ ome of you may w@@ in@@ ce to remember this r@@ id@@ dle .
This r@@ id@@ dle went something like this .
How is this possible ?
We were fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed by this .
We could not figure this out .
"( Laughter ) Well , I decided to do a little experiment with my 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old son ."
"So I decided I would pose this r@@ id@@ dle to them , just to see , to gau@@ ge the level of change ."
"Well , 1@@ 6@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old bo@@ ys , they im@@ medi@@ ately turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s his mo@@ m . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
No problem . Just like that .
"E@@ x@@ cept for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; Well , he could have two da@@ ds . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s an inde@@ x , an ind@@ ic@@ at@@ or of how things have changed ."
Y@@ oun@@ ger men today exp@@ ect to be able to bal@@ ance work and family .
"They want to be d@@ ual@@ -@@ career , d@@ ual@@ -@@ car@@ er cou@@ pl@@ es ."
They want to be able to bal@@ ance work and family with their par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
They want to be inv@@ ol@@ ved fa@@ thers .
"Now , it turns out that the more e@@ gal@@ it@@ arian our relation@@ shi@@ ps , the happ@@ ier both par@@ t@@ n@@ ers are ."
D@@ at@@ a from psych@@ olog@@ ists and soci@@ olog@@ ists are quite per@@ su@@ as@@ ive here .
"I think we have the per@@ su@@ as@@ ive numbers , the data , to pro@@ ve to men that gen@@ der equality is not a z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ su@@ m ga@@ me , but a w@@ in@@ -@@ w@@ in ."
Here &apos;s what the data show .
We p@@ it@@ ch in and we help out .
"Th@@ e@@ ir children have lower rat@@ es of ab@@ sen@@ te@@ e@@ ism , high@@ er rat@@ es of achi@@ ev@@ ement ."
They are less likely to be put on medic@@ ation .
"@@ Not only that , their w@@ iv@@ es are heal@@ th@@ ier ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir w@@ iv@@ es are less likely to see a ther@@ ap@@ ist , less likely to be diagno@@ sed with depres@@ sion , less likely to be put on medic@@ ation , more likely to go to the g@@ y@@ m , re@@ port high@@ er lev@@ els of mar@@ ital sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion ."
"They smo@@ ke less , dr@@ ink less , take re@@ cre@@ ational dru@@ gs less often ."
They are less likely to go to the E@@ R but more like to go to a doc@@ tor for ro@@ ut@@ ine scre@@ en@@ ings .
And who wouldn &apos;t want that ?
"( Laughter ) Now , of these four fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating fin@@ din@@ gs , which one do you think M@@ en &apos;s H@@ e@@ al@@ th ma@@ gaz@@ ine put on its c@@ over ? ( Laughter )"
&quot; &quot; H@@ ou@@ se@@ work M@@ ak@@ es H@@ er H@@ or@@ n@@ y .
These data were col@@ lec@@ ted over a really long peri@@ od of time .
It &apos;s not a w@@ in@@ -@@ lo@@ se .
It is a w@@ in@@ -@@ w@@ in for everyone .
And what we also know is we cannot fully em@@ power women and girls un@@ less we en@@ ga@@ ge bo@@ ys and men .
We know this .
And my position is that men need the very things that women have id@@ enti@@ fied that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
"In 19@@ 15 , on the eve of one of the great suf@@ fra@@ ge demon@@ stra@@ tions down F@@ if@@ th A@@ ven@@ ue in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity , a writ@@ er in New Y@@ or@@ k w@@ ro@@ te an ar@@ tic@@ le in a ma@@ gaz@@ ine , and the tit@@ le of the ar@@ tic@@ le was , &quot; F@@ em@@ in@@ ism for M@@ en . &quot;"
And this was the first line of that ar@@ tic@@ le : &quot; F@@ em@@ in@@ ism will make it possible for the first time for men to be f@@ ree . &quot;
Thank you .

This is another look at the t@@ ree of life .

"The human part of this br@@ an@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interes@@ ted in ."
We br@@ an@@ ch off of a common an@@ c@@ es@@ tor to moder@@ n ch@@ impanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .

But what will come in the future ?

"O@@ r , are we des@@ tin@@ ed to become something different — something , perhaps , even better ada@@ p@@ ted to the environ@@ ment ?"

"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the oc@@ e@@ an , bac@@ ter@@ ia that are ther@@ mo@@ ph@@ il@@ ic and can surv@@ ive at the ste@@ am v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise produc@@ e , if f@@ ish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ v@@ ide co@@ o@@ ked f@@ ish , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able environ@@ ment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of hum@@ ans in evolution , and particul@@ arly as we look a@@ head to the next ph@@ ase , I would say that there are a number of possi@@ bil@@ ities ."
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise .
"And the reas@@ on@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind that would be , first , we have , through medic@@ ine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ mov@@ ed from the population ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we as a spec@@ ies have so con@@ fig@@ ured our environ@@ ment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it ada@@ pt to us as well as we ada@@ pt to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gra@@ te and cir@@ cul@@ ate and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is nec@@ ess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possi@@ bility is that there will be evolution of the t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al kind , natural , im@@ posed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the argum@@ ent here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ low@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ o@@ ra@@ ble ."
"And as far as is@@ ol@@ ation goes , when we as a spec@@ ies do col@@ on@@ ize dis@@ t@@ ant plan@@ ets , there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environ@@ mental changes that could produc@@ e evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a third possi@@ bility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possi@@ bility ."
"I call it ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ ided and ch@@ os@@ en by us as individ@@ ual@@ s in the cho@@ ices that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ sid@@ er , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ ices about their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more mal@@ es than f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individ@@ ual and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to cho@@ ose , not simply to cho@@ ose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the gen@@ e@@ tic ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments that would c@@ ure or pre@@ v@@ ent dis@@ eas@@ es ."
What if you could make the gen@@ e@@ tic changes to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate diab@@ et@@ es or A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or reduc@@ e the ris@@ k of cancer or el@@ im@@ in@@ ate st@@ ro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject started in 19@@ 90 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ i@@ shed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"@@ To@@ day , you can have a complet@@ e se@@ qu@@ ence of the three billion b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ doll@@ ar human gen@@ ome , and it will be increas@@ ing@@ ly av@@ a@@ il@@ able for everyone ."
"@@ Just a week ago , the N@@ ational A@@ c@@ ade@@ my of En@@ gine@@ ering a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ ra@@ per P@@ ri@@ ze to F@@ ran@@ c@@ is A@@ r@@ no@@ ld and W@@ il@@ le@@ m S@@ tem@@ m@@ er , two scient@@ ists who inde@@ pen@@ den@@ tly develop@@ ed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work fas@@ ter and to le@@ ad to des@@ i@@ ra@@ ble pro@@ te@@ ins in a more ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent way — what F@@ ran@@ ces A@@ r@@ no@@ ld call@@ s &quot; &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the L@@ ask@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze was a@@ war@@ ded to the scient@@ ist S@@ h@@ in@@ y@@ a Y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an ad@@ ult sk@@ in c@@ ell , a fi@@ b@@ rob@@ last , and by man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating just four gen@@ es , he in@@ duc@@ ed that c@@ ell to re@@ ver@@ t to a pl@@ ur@@ i@@ po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al stem c@@ ell — a c@@ ell po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally cap@@ ab@@ le@@ "
of becom@@ ing any c@@ ell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in bac@@ ter@@ ia can make vir@@ uses that will not only pro@@ t@@ ect you against themselves , but in@@ duc@@ e im@@ mun@@ ity against other vir@@ uses ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ental tri@@ al going on with v@@ acc@@ ine against in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a that has been gro@@ wn in the cells of a t@@ ob@@ acc@@ o pl@@ ant ."
C@@ an you imagine something good coming out of t@@ ob@@ acc@@ o ?
"Th@@ ese are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible ."
I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the ov@@ a , or change the ne@@ w@@ ly f@@ ert@@ iliz@@ ed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing a better chan@@ ce at a heal@@ th@@ ier life — el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the diab@@ et@@ es , el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the he@@ mo@@ ph@@ ilia , reduc@@ e the ris@@ k of cancer ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want heal@@ th@@ ier children ?
"And then , that same anal@@ y@@ tic technology , that same eng@@ ine of science that can produc@@ e the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also en@@ able us to ad@@ op@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ ities — that better me@@ mor@@ y ."
"Wh@@ y not have the qu@@ ic@@ k w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next gener@@ ation of the W@@ ats@@ on machine ?"
Why not have the qu@@ ic@@ k tw@@ it@@ ch mus@@ cle that will en@@ able you to run fas@@ ter and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a position where we can pas@@ s it on to the next gener@@ ation , and we can ad@@ op@@ t the at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes we want , we will have con@@ v@@ ert@@ ed ol@@ d@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that nor@@ m@@ ally might requ@@ ire 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years , and we can com@@ pres@@ s it down to a thou@@ s@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"Th@@ ese are cho@@ ices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"W@@ ill we use these cho@@ ices to make a society that is better , that is more success@@ ful , that is kin@@ der ?"
"O@@ r , will we sel@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely cho@@ ose different at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more un@@ i@@ form , or more rob@@ ust and more ver@@ sat@@ ile ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to devel@@ op the w@@ is@@ dom , and to in@@ her@@ it the w@@ is@@ dom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ ices w@@ is@@ ely ?"
"For better or wor@@ se , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these cho@@ ices will be up to us ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"One thing the world needs , one thing this country des@@ per@@ ately needs is a better way of conduc@@ ting our political deb@@ ates ."
We need to re@@ disc@@ over the lo@@ st art of democra@@ tic argum@@ ent .
I have a su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion .
But we too r@@ ar@@ ely ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate and de@@ f@@ end and arg@@ ue about those big moral questions in our polit@@ ics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a disc@@ us@@ sion .
"F@@ ir@@ st , let me take a f@@ amo@@ us philosoph@@ er who w@@ ro@@ te about those questions of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce and moral@@ ity , give you a very shor@@ t lec@@ ture on A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s theory of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , and then have a disc@@ us@@ sion here to see whether A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and arg@@ ue about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?"
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le , j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce means giving people what they des@@ er@@ ve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lec@@ ture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions be@@ gin when it comes to arg@@ u@@ ing about who des@@ er@@ ves what and why .
T@@ ake the example of fl@@ utes .
S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;re dis@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ing fl@@ utes .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best fl@@ ute ?
You can just call it out .
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ an@@ del : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
O@@ r by the first person to r@@ us@@ h into the h@@ all to get them .
How many say the best fl@@ ute pla@@ y@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute pla@@ y@@ ers ?"
P@@ et@@ er : The gre@@ at@@ est ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
M@@ S : The gre@@ at@@ est ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
We &apos;ll hear better mus@@ ic if the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute pla@@ y@@ ers .
That &apos;s P@@ et@@ er ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : P@@ et@@ er . ) M@@ S : All right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good mus@@ ic is pla@@ yed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble mus@@ ic .
"But P@@ et@@ er , A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute pla@@ y@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes arg@@ ue about , the pur@@ pose of the thing , or the social acti@@ vity — in this case , mus@@ ical per@@ for@@ man@@ ce ."
"And the point , the essenti@@ al nature , of mus@@ ical per@@ for@@ man@@ ce is to produc@@ e ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent mus@@ ic ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ produc@@ t that we &apos;ll all ben@@ ef@@ it .
"But when we think about j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question and the qu@@ alit@@ ies that are wor@@ th h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ mir@@ ing and reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing ."
"Now , fl@@ utes may seem ... the dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of fl@@ utes may seem a tr@@ iv@@ ial case ."
Let &apos;s take a con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example of the dis@@ p@@ ute about j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce .
It had to do with gol@@ f .
"C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n — a few years ago , C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good gol@@ fer , but he had a disa@@ bility ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ri@@ ed ris@@ k of in@@ j@@ ury ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ sion@@ al G@@ ol@@ fer@@ s &apos; A@@ s@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a gol@@ f c@@ art in the P@@ G@@ A t@@ our@@ nam@@ ents ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age . &quot; &quot; He su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the gol@@ f c@@ art , because the la@@ w says that the disa@@ bl@@ ed must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ ted , pro@@ vid@@ ed the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ tion does not change the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great gol@@ fer ."
I want to comp@@ et@@ e .
But I need a gol@@ f c@@ art to get from one hole to the next . &quot; &quot; S@@ up@@ pose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
S@@ up@@ pose you were dec@@ id@@ ing the j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n does have a right to use a gol@@ f c@@ art ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a po@@ ll , show of hands ."
How many would rul@@ e in fav@@ or of C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"A@@ ll right , we have a good div@@ ision of op@@ in@@ ion here ."
"S@@ ome@@ one who would not gr@@ ant C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n the right to a gol@@ f c@@ art , what would be your reason ?"
"R@@ a@@ ise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one ."
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : It &apos;d be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age . ) M@@ S : It would be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age if he gets to r@@ ide in a gol@@ f c@@ art .
"A@@ ll right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the gol@@ f c@@ art wor@@ ry about an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age ."
How would you answer the ob@@ jec@@ tion ?
"Y@@ es , all right ."
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : The c@@ art &apos;s not part of the ga@@ me .
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : The c@@ art &apos;s not part of the ga@@ me .
M@@ S : But what about wal@@ king from hole to hole ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the ga@@ me .
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the ga@@ me of gol@@ f ?
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : All right . S@@ ta@@ y there , Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?
"A@@ ll right , who has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?"
What would you say ?
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : The end@@ ur@@ ance el@@ ement is a very important part of the ga@@ me , wal@@ king all those hol@@ es ."
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king all those hol@@ es ?
That &apos;s part of the ga@@ me of gol@@ f ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely . ) M@@ S : What &apos;s your name ? ( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n . ) M@@ S : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ re@@ n ?"
Ch@@ ar@@ le@@ y : I &apos;ll s@@ tic@@ k to my or@@ ig@@ in@@ al th@@ esis .
W@@ ar@@ re@@ n : I am not a gol@@ fer .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ le@@ y : And I am . ( M@@ S : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lower cour@@ t , they b@@ rou@@ ght in golf@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s to tes@@ ti@@ f@@ y on this very issue ."
I@@ s wal@@ king the course essenti@@ al to the ga@@ me ?
And they b@@ rou@@ ght in J@@ ack N@@ ic@@ kl@@ au@@ s and A@@ r@@ no@@ ld P@@ al@@ m@@ er .
And what do you sup@@ pose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"They said , y@@ es , wal@@ king the course is str@@ en@@ u@@ ous physical ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ."
The f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e fac@@ tor is an important part of gol@@ f .
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the ga@@ me to give him the gol@@ f c@@ art .
"Now , not@@ ice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you sup@@ pose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n must be pro@@ vid@@ ed a gol@@ f c@@ art ."
"S@@ even to two , they rul@@ ed ."
"What was interesting about their rul@@ ing and about the disc@@ us@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the disc@@ us@@ sion about the right , the j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , of the matter de@@ pen@@ ded on fig@@ uring out what is the essenti@@ al nature of gol@@ f ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce St@@ ev@@ ens , writ@@ ing for the maj@@ or@@ ity , said he had read all about the history of gol@@ f , and the essenti@@ al point of the ga@@ me is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a hole in as few st@@ ro@@ k@@ es as possible , and that wal@@ king was not essenti@@ al , but in@@ c@@ id@@ ental ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ sen@@ ters , one of wh@@ om was J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce S@@ cal@@ ia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gr@@ an@@ ted the c@@ art , and he had a very interesting dis@@ s@@ ent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ jec@@ ted the A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ ian pre@@ m@@ ise under@@ l@@ ying the maj@@ or@@ ity &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; To say that something is essenti@@ al is ordin@@ ar@@ ily to say that it is nec@@ ess@@ ary to the achi@@ ev@@ ement of a certain object .
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce S@@ cal@@ ia &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion is ques@@ tion@@ able for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ ir@@ st , no real s@@ por@@ ts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) If we had thought that the rul@@ es of the s@@ por@@ ts we care about are mer@@ ely ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary , rather than des@@ ign@@ ed to call for@@ th the vir@@ tu@@ es and the ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ences that we think are wor@@ thy of ad@@ mir@@ ing , we wouldn &apos;t care about the ou@@ t@@ come of the ga@@ me ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ jec@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it se@@ em@@ ed to be — this deb@@ ate about the gol@@ f c@@ art — an argum@@ ent about fa@@ ir@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ ant@@ age ."
"But if fa@@ ir@@ ness were the only thing at st@@ ake , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous solu@@ tion ."
"But l@@ etting everyone r@@ ide in a c@@ art would have been , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , more an@@ a@@ the@@ ma to the golf@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as del@@ ic@@ ately as possible : G@@ ol@@ fer@@ s are a little sen@@ sit@@ ive about the a@@ th@@ le@@ tic stat@@ us of their ga@@ me .
"( Laughter ) A@@ f@@ ter all , there &apos;s no run@@ ning or j@@ um@@ ping , and the b@@ all stan@@ ds still . ( Laughter )"
"So if golf@@ ing is the kind of ga@@ me that can be pla@@ yed while r@@ id@@ ing around in a gol@@ f c@@ art , it would be hard to con@@ fer on the golf@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s the stat@@ us that we con@@ fer , the h@@ on@@ or and reco@@ gn@@ ition that goes to tr@@ ul@@ y great a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es ."
"That ill@@ ust@@ rat@@ es that with gol@@ f , as with fl@@ utes , it &apos;s hard to dec@@ ide the question of what j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce requ@@ ir@@ es , without gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question , and what qu@@ alit@@ ies , what ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ences connec@@ ted with that acti@@ vity , are wor@@ thy of h@@ on@@ or and reco@@ gn@@ ition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fin@@ al example that &apos;s prom@@ in@@ ent in con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary political deb@@ ate : sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
"There are those who fav@@ or state reco@@ gn@@ ition only of t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al marri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fav@@ or state reco@@ gn@@ ition of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
How many here fav@@ or the first pol@@ ic@@ y : the state should reco@@ gni@@ ze t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al marri@@ age only ?
"And how many fav@@ or the second , sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ pon@@ ents of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age say that the pur@@ pose of marri@@ age , fundam@@ ent@@ ally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ thy of h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging ."
"So with fl@@ utes , with gol@@ f car@@ ts , and even with a f@@ ier@@ c@@ ely cont@@ es@@ ted question like sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age , A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le has a point ."
V@@ er@@ y hard to arg@@ ue about j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce without first arg@@ u@@ ing about the pur@@ pose of social inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions and about what qu@@ alit@@ ies are wor@@ thy of h@@ on@@ or and reco@@ gn@@ ition .
"So let &apos;s step back from these cas@@ es and see how they shed light on the way we might impro@@ ve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a ten@@ den@@ cy to think that if we en@@ ga@@ ge too direc@@ tly with moral questions in polit@@ ics , that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for disa@@ gre@@ ement , and for that matter , a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on ."
"So better to sh@@ y away from , to ign@@ ore , the moral and the relig@@ ious con@@ vic@@ tions that people bring to civ@@ ic life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to be@@ gin to re@@ stor@@ e the art of democra@@ tic argum@@ ent ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Th@@ ank you very much . Th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you . Ch@@ ris . Th@@ an@@ ks , Ch@@ ris . Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : F@@ rom fl@@ utes to gol@@ f cour@@ s@@ es@@ "
to sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age — that was a gen@@ i@@ us lin@@ k .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of open education ."
Y@@ our lec@@ ture ser@@ ies was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vis@@ ion for the next ph@@ ase of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , in@@ vit@@ ing questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ ining in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ ight . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong B@@ each , and we do it in a clas@@ s@@ room at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arg@@ u@@ ing , en@@ gag@@ ing ser@@ i@@ ously with big moral questions , ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing cul@@ tu@@ ral differ@@ ences and con@@ n@@ ect through a live video ho@@ o@@ k@@ up , students in B@@ e@@ ij@@ ing and M@@ um@@ b@@ ai and in C@@ am@@ br@@ id@@ ge , M@@ as@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts and create a global clas@@ s@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"I want to talk today about — I &apos;ve been asked to take the long view , and I &apos;m going to tell you what I think are the three big@@ gest problems for hum@@ an@@ ity from this long point of view ."
"S@@ ome of these have already been tou@@ ched u@@ po@@ n by other speak@@ ers , which is en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging ."
It seems that there &apos;s not just one person who thin@@ ks that these problems are important .
The first is — death is a big problem .
"If you look at the stat@@ is@@ tics , the od@@ ds are not very fav@@ o@@ ra@@ ble to us ."
"So far , most people who have liv@@ ed have also died ."
R@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 90 percent of everybody who has been al@@ ive has died by now .
"So the an@@ n@@ ual death rate ad@@ ds up to 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 — sor@@ ry , the da@@ ily death rate — 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people per day , which is a huge number by any stan@@ dar@@ d ."
"The an@@ n@@ ual death rate , then , becom@@ es 5@@ 6 million ."
"If we just look at the single , big@@ gest cause of death — ag@@ ing — it ac@@ coun@@ ts for rou@@ gh@@ ly tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds of all human people who die ."
That ad@@ ds up to an an@@ n@@ ual death t@@ ol@@ l of gre@@ ater than the population of C@@ an@@ ada .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we don &apos;t see a problem because ei@@ ther it &apos;s too famil@@ i@@ ar or it &apos;s too big ."
C@@ an &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
"So that would be , rou@@ gh@@ ly , 3@@ 2@@ 4 people have died since I &apos;ve be@@ gu@@ n speak@@ ing ."
P@@ eople like — it &apos;s rou@@ gh@@ ly the population in this room has just died .
"Now , the human cost of that is ob@@ vi@@ ous , once you start to think about it — the suf@@ fer@@ ing , the lo@@ ss — it &apos;s also , econom@@ ically , en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly was@@ te@@ ful ."
"I just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lo@@ st d@@ ue to natural ca@@ uses of death in gener@@ al , and ag@@ ing , in particular ."
"Now , of course , this is an under@@ es@@ ti@@ ma@@ tion ."
A person &apos;s li@@ fe@@ time of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book .
But let &apos;s sup@@ pose we did this .
"@@ 5@@ 2 million people die of natural ca@@ uses each year cor@@ respon@@ ds , then , to 5@@ 2 million vol@@ um@@ es des@@ tro@@ yed ."
L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ g@@ ress hol@@ ds 18 million vol@@ um@@ es .
We are up@@ set about the b@@ urn@@ ing of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ r@@ ia .
"It &apos;s one of the great cul@@ tu@@ ral tra@@ ge@@ dies that we remember , even today ."
"But this is the equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of three L@@ i@@ br@@ ar@@ ies of Con@@ g@@ ress — b@@ urn@@ t down , for@@ ever lo@@ st — each year ."
So that &apos;s the first big problem .
"And I w@@ ish G@@ od@@ spe@@ ed to A@@ ub@@ re@@ y de Gre@@ y , and other people like him , to try to do something about this as so@@ on as possible ."
E@@ x@@ ist@@ enti@@ al ris@@ k — the second big problem .
"E@@ x@@ ist@@ enti@@ al ris@@ k is a thre@@ at to human surviv@@ al , or to the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al of our spec@@ ies ."
"You would think that it would be of some inter@@ est to try to find out more about this given that the st@@ ak@@ es are so big , but it &apos;s a very ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ted are@@ a ."
"But there have been four studies — one by J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ es@@ le@@ y , w@@ ro@@ te a book on this ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the A@@ st@@ ro@@ nom@@ er R@@ o@@ y@@ al , wh@@ om we heard spe@@ ak y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , also has a 50 percent prob@@ ability es@@ ti@@ mate ."
"A@@ no@@ ther au@@ th@@ or doesn &apos;t give any num@@ er@@ ical es@@ ti@@ mate , but says the prob@@ ability is si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant that it will fa@@ il ."
I w@@ ro@@ te a long p@@ aper on this .
I said as@@ si@@ g@@ ning a less than 20 percent prob@@ ability would be a mis@@ take in light of the curr@@ ent evidence we have .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body who has looked at this and stu@@ died it ag@@ re@@ es .
Now one percent of six billion people is equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to 60 million .
So that &apos;s a large number .
"If we were to take into ac@@ coun@@ t future gener@@ ations that will never come into ex@@ ist@@ ence if we b@@ low ourselves up , then the figure becom@@ es astro@@ nom@@ ical ."
"Th@@ en , even a one per@@ cent@@ age point reduc@@ tion in the ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion ris@@ k could be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to this astro@@ nom@@ ical number — 10 to the power of 3@@ 2 ."
"So if you take into ac@@ coun@@ t future gener@@ ations as much as our own , every other moral im@@ per@@ ative of ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic cost just becom@@ es ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant ."
"Now , let me sp@@ end the rest of my time on the third big problem , because it &apos;s more sub@@ tle and perhaps difficult to gra@@ s@@ p ."
"Th@@ ink about some time in your life — some people might never have experien@@ ced it — but some people , there are just those mo@@ ments that you have experien@@ ced where life was f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ."
"It might have been at the moment of some great , cre@@ ative insp@@ i@@ ration you might have had when you just en@@ ter@@ ed this f@@ low stage ."
O@@ r when you underst@@ ood something you had never done before .
O@@ r an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience — a sun@@ set or a great piece of art .
"And you won@@ der , why can &apos;t it be like that all the time ?"
You just want to cl@@ ing on@@ to this .
"And then , of course , it d@@ ri@@ f@@ ts back into ordin@@ ary life and the me@@ mor@@ y f@@ ades ."
"And it &apos;s really difficult to rec@@ all , in a nor@@ mal fra@@ me of mind , just how good life can be at its best ."
O@@ r how bad it can be at its wor@@ st .
The third big problem is that life isn &apos;t us@@ u@@ ally as wonderful as it could be .
It &apos;s easy to say what we don &apos;t want .
"@@ Here are a number of things that we don &apos;t want — ill@@ ness , inv@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary death , un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary suf@@ fer@@ ing , c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty , st@@ un@@ ted growth , me@@ mor@@ y lo@@ ss , ign@@ or@@ ance , ab@@ s@@ ence of cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
S@@ up@@ pose we fi@@ x@@ ed these things — we did something about all of these .
We were very success@@ ful .
We got ri@@ d of all of these things .
"We might end up with something like this , which is — I mean , it &apos;s a h@@ ec@@ k of a lot better than that ."
But is this really the best we can dre@@ am of ?
I@@ s this the best we can do ?
O@@ r is it possible to find something a little bit more insp@@ ir@@ ing to work to@@ wards ?
"And if we think about this , I think it &apos;s very c@@ lear that there are ways in which we could change things , not just by el@@ im@@ in@@ ating ne@@ ga@@ ti@@ ves , but ad@@ ding pos@@ it@@ iv@@ es ."
"O@@ n my w@@ ish l@@ ist , at le@@ ast , would be : much longer , heal@@ th@@ ier lives , gre@@ ater sub@@ jec@@ tive well-@@ being , en@@ han@@ ced co@@ gn@@ itive cap@@ ac@@ ities , more knowledge and understanding , un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed opportun@@ ity for person@@ al growth be@@ y@@ ond our curr@@ ent bi@@ ological lim@@ its , better relation@@ shi@@ ps , an un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al for sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual , moral and intel@@ lec@@ tual develop@@ ment ."
"If we want to achi@@ eve this , what , in the world , would have to change ?"
And this is the answer — we would have to change .
"@@ Not just the world around us , but we , ourselves ."
"@@ Not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are — our very bi@@ ology ."
H@@ u@@ man nature would have to change .
It &apos;s a pretty pa@@ the@@ tic l@@ ist .
"They do great things for a few people who suf@@ fer from some spec@@ if@@ ic con@@ d@@ ition , but for most people , they don &apos;t really trans@@ form what it is to be human ."
It &apos;s wor@@ th rec@@ all@@ ing that there are a lot of other mo@@ dif@@ ic@@ ation tech@@ nologi@@ es and en@@ han@@ c@@ ement tech@@ nologi@@ es that we use .
"We have sk@@ in en@@ han@@ cem@@ ents , clo@@ thing ."
"As far as I can see , all of you are us@@ ers of this en@@ han@@ c@@ ement technology in this room , so that &apos;s a great thing ."
"M@@ ood mo@@ dif@@ i@@ ers have been used from time im@@ me@@ mo@@ ri@@ al — c@@ af@@ fe@@ ine , al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , n@@ ic@@ ot@@ ine , im@@ mun@@ e system en@@ han@@ c@@ ement , vis@@ ion en@@ han@@ c@@ ement , an@@ es@@ the@@ tics — we take that very much for gr@@ an@@ ted , but just think about how great progress that is — like , having an oper@@ ation before an@@ es@@ the@@ tics was not fu@@ n ."
"C@@ on@@ tra@@ cep@@ ti@@ ves , co@@ s@@ me@@ tics and brain re@@ program@@ m@@ ing tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es — that s@@ oun@@ ds om@@ in@@ ous , but the dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between what is a technology — a gad@@ get would be the arch@@ et@@ yp@@ e — and other ways of chang@@ ing and re@@ writ@@ ing human nature is quite sub@@ tle ."
You &apos;re chang@@ ing the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ structure of your brain as you go along .
"So in a bro@@ ad sense , we don &apos;t need to think about technology as only little ga@@ dg@@ ets , like these things here , but even inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions and tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , psych@@ ological me@@ th@@ ods and so for@@ th ."
F@@ or@@ ms of organiz@@ ation can have a prof@@ ound im@@ p@@ act on human nature .
"It &apos;s possible to as@@ su@@ me , s@@ etting as@@ ide a possi@@ bility of c@@ atas@@ tro@@ p@@ he , that so@@ on@@ er or later we will devel@@ op all of these ."
And even just a couple of these would be enough to trans@@ form the human con@@ d@@ ition .
So let &apos;s look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for impro@@ v@@ ement .
These are really great things .
P@@ art of the reason why we value these tra@@ its is that they make us better at comp@@ et@@ ing with other people — they &apos;re pos@@ it@@ ion@@ al go@@ ods .
But part of the reason — and that &apos;s the reason why we have e@@ th@@ ical ground for pur@@ su@@ ing these — is that they &apos;re also in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally val@@ u@@ able .
"It &apos;s just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are commun@@ ic@@ ating with , and to remember what you have learned ."
M@@ od@@ alit@@ ies and spec@@ ial fac@@ ul@@ ties .
"Now , the human mind is not a single un@@ it@@ ary information proc@@ ess@@ or , but it has a lot of different , spec@@ ial , evol@@ ved mod@@ ul@@ es that do spec@@ if@@ ic things for us ."
"A@@ ll of these would en@@ able , in princi@@ ple — be am@@ en@@ able to en@@ han@@ c@@ ement ."
S@@ ome people have a better mus@@ ical ability and ability to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate mus@@ ic than others have .
"It &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are — so if these all en@@ ab@@ led great val@@ ues , why should we think that evolution has happened to pro@@ v@@ ide us with all the mod@@ alit@@ ies we would need to en@@ ga@@ ge with other val@@ ues that there might be ?"
"But maybe they have another fac@@ ul@@ ty , something else that would seem equ@@ ally ir@@ ra@@ tional to us , but they actually ta@@ p into some great possible value there ."
B@@ od@@ ily func@@ tion@@ ality and mor@@ ph@@ ology and af@@ fec@@ tive self-@@ control .
Gre@@ ater sub@@ jec@@ tive well-@@ being .
"B@@ e able to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch between rel@@ ax@@ ation and acti@@ vity — being able to go s@@ low when you need to do that , and to spe@@ ed up ."
Con@@ scienti@@ ous@@ ness and sym@@ pa@@ thy .
"The ability to — it &apos;s another interesting ap@@ plic@@ ation that would have large social ra@@ mi@@ fic@@ ation , perhaps ."
"If you could actually cho@@ ose to pres@@ er@@ ve your rom@@ an@@ tic att@@ ach@@ ments to one person , un@@ di@@ min@@ i@@ shed through time , so that wouldn &apos;t have to — love would never have to f@@ ade if you didn &apos;t want it to ."
That &apos;s probably not all that difficult .
It might just be a simple hor@@ mon@@ e or something that could do this .
It &apos;s been done in vol@@ es .
You can engine@@ er a pra@@ ir@@ i@@ e v@@ ole to become mo@@ no@@ gamo@@ us when it &apos;s nat@@ ur@@ ally pol@@ y@@ gamo@@ us .
It &apos;s just a single gen@@ e .
"A possible mo@@ de of being here would be a way of life — a way of being , experien@@ cing , thinking , seeing , inter@@ ac@@ ting with the world ."
"D@@ own here in this little cor@@ ner , here , we have the little sub@@ -@@ space of this larg@@ er space that is acc@@ es@@ si@@ ble to human be@@ ings — be@@ ings with our bi@@ ological cap@@ ac@@ ities ."
"It &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s acc@@ es@@ si@@ ble to an@@ im@@ als ; since we are an@@ im@@ als , we are a sub@@ set of that ."
And then you can imagine some en@@ han@@ cem@@ ents of human cap@@ ac@@ ities .
"There would be different mo@@ des of being you could experience if you were able to st@@ ay al@@ ive for , say , 200 years ."
Th@@ en you could live sor@@ ts of lives and acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate w@@ is@@ dom@@ s that are just not possible for hum@@ ans as we curr@@ ently are .
"So then , you move off to this larg@@ er sp@@ here of &quot; &quot; human + , &quot; &quot; and you could contin@@ ue that process and even@@ tually ex@@ pl@@ ore a lot of this larg@@ er space of possible mo@@ des of being ."
"Now , why is that a good thing to do ?"
"Well , we know already that in this little human cir@@ cle there , there are these en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly wonderful and wor@@ th@@ while mo@@ des of being — human life at its best is wonderful ."
"We have no reason to believe that within this much , much larg@@ er space there would not also be extre@@ m@@ ely wor@@ th@@ while mo@@ des of being , perhaps ones that would be way be@@ y@@ ond our w@@ il@@ d@@ est ability even to imagine or dre@@ am about ."
Th@@ an@@ ks .
What you have here is an elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te .
"It &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was inv@@ ented a year or two ago , has given me un@@ told happiness ."
"( Laughter ) A little bit of it , I think , is the n@@ ic@@ ot@@ ine , but there &apos;s something much big@@ ger than that ."
"Wh@@ ich is ever since , in the U.@@ K@@ . , they ban@@ ned smo@@ king in public places , I &apos;ve never en@@ jo@@ yed a dr@@ in@@ ks par@@ ty ever again ."
"( Laughter ) And the reason , I only worked out just the other day , which is when you go to a dr@@ in@@ ks par@@ ty and you st@@ and up and you hold a gl@@ as@@ s of red w@@ ine and you talk end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly to people , you don &apos;t actually want to sp@@ end all the time talking ."
"It &apos;s really , really ti@@ r@@ ing ."
"S@@ ome@@ times you just want to st@@ and there sil@@ ently , al@@ one with your thou@@ gh@@ ts ."
S@@ ome@@ times you just want to st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and st@@ are out of the w@@ ind@@ ow .
"Now the problem is , when you can &apos;t smo@@ ke , if you st@@ and and st@@ are out of the w@@ ind@@ ow on your own , you &apos;re an ant@@ is@@ o@@ ci@@ al , fri@@ end@@ less id@@ iot ."
"( Laughter ) If you st@@ and and st@@ are out of the w@@ ind@@ ow on your own with a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te , you &apos;re a f@@ uc@@ king philosoph@@ er . ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So the power of re@@ f@@ ram@@ ing things cannot be over@@ st@@ ated .
"What we have is exactly the same thing , the same acti@@ vity , but one of them makes you feel great and the other one , with just a small change of pos@@ ture , makes you feel ter@@ ri@@ ble ."
And I think one of the problems with clas@@ sic@@ al econom@@ ics is it &apos;s ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed with reality .
And reality isn &apos;t a particul@@ arly good gu@@ ide to human happiness .
"Wh@@ y , for example , are pen@@ sion@@ ers much happ@@ ier than the young un@@ emp@@ lo@@ yed ?"
"B@@ ot@@ h of them , after all , are in exactly the same stage of life ."
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money .
"But pen@@ sion@@ ers are re@@ port@@ ed@@ ly very , very happy , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the un@@ emp@@ lo@@ yed are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily un@@ happy and depres@@ sed ."
"The reason , I think , is that the pen@@ sion@@ ers believe they &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en to be pen@@ sion@@ ers , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the young un@@ emp@@ lo@@ yed feel it &apos;s been th@@ r@@ ust u@@ po@@ n them ."
"In Engl@@ and the up@@ per middle clas@@ ses have actually sol@@ ved this problem per@@ fec@@ tly , because they &apos;ve re@@ -@@ br@@ and@@ ed un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
"If you &apos;re an up@@ per@@ -@@ mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ class English person , you call un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment &quot; &quot; a year off . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s because having a son who &apos;s un@@ emp@@ lo@@ yed in M@@ an@@ ch@@ es@@ ter is really quite em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing , but having a son who &apos;s un@@ emp@@ lo@@ yed in Th@@ a@@ il@@ and is really vie@@ wed as quite an ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment . ( Laughter )"
"But actually the power to re@@ -@@ br@@ and things — to understand that actually our experi@@ ences , co@@ st@@ s , things don &apos;t actually much de@@ p@@ end on what they really are , but on how we view them — I gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely think can &apos;t be over@@ st@@ ated ."
There &apos;s an experiment I think D@@ an@@ i@@ el P@@ ink re@@ fer@@ s to where you put two do@@ gs in a bo@@ x and the bo@@ x has an elec@@ tri@@ c f@@ lo@@ or .
"E@@ very now and then an elec@@ tri@@ c sh@@ oc@@ k is app@@ li@@ ed to the f@@ lo@@ or , which pa@@ ins the do@@ gs ."
The only difference is one of the do@@ gs has a small b@@ ut@@ ton in its half of the bo@@ x .
"And when it n@@ uz@@ z@@ les the b@@ ut@@ ton , the elec@@ tri@@ c sh@@ oc@@ k st@@ op@@ s ."
The other do@@ g doesn &apos;t have the b@@ ut@@ ton .
"It &apos;s ex@@ posed to exactly the same level of pa@@ in as the do@@ g in the first bo@@ x , but it has no control over the cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces ."
G@@ ener@@ ally the first do@@ g can be rel@@ ati@@ vely cont@@ ent .
The second do@@ g l@@ ap@@ ses into complet@@ e depres@@ sion .
The cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
We ask the question — the whole deb@@ ate in the W@@ es@@ tern world is about the level of ta@@ x@@ ation .
"But I think there &apos;s another deb@@ ate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our ta@@ x money ."
That what co@@ st@@ s us 10 po@@ un@@ ds in one cont@@ ex@@ t can be a cur@@ se .
What co@@ st@@ s us 10 po@@ un@@ ds in a different cont@@ ex@@ t we may actually wel@@ come .
"You know , pa@@ y 20@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds in ta@@ x to@@ ward health and you &apos;re mer@@ ely feel@@ ing a m@@ u@@ g ."
"P@@ ay 20@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds to end@@ ow a ho@@ sp@@ ital ward and you &apos;re called a ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ist ."
I &apos;m probably in the wrong country to talk about w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to pa@@ y ta@@ x .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;ll give you one in re@@ turn . How you fra@@ me things really mat@@ ters .
Do you call it the ba@@ il@@ out of Gre@@ ece or the ba@@ il@@ out of a lo@@ ad of st@@ up@@ id ban@@ ks which l@@ ent to Gre@@ ece ?
Because they are actually the same thing .
"What you call them actually af@@ fec@@ ts how you re@@ act to them , vis@@ cer@@ ally and mor@@ ally ."
I think psych@@ ological value is great to be ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely h@@ on@@ est .
"One of my great friends , a prof@@ ess@@ or called N@@ ic@@ k Ch@@ ater , who &apos;s the P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or of D@@ ec@@ ision S@@ ci@@ ences in L@@ on@@ don , beli@@ ev@@ es that we should sp@@ end far less time looking into hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s h@@ id@@ den de@@ p@@ ths and sp@@ end much more time ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the h@@ id@@ den sh@@ al@@ lo@@ ws ."
I think that &apos;s true actually .
I think im@@ pres@@ sions have an in@@ san@@ e ef@@ fect on what we think and what we do .
But what we don &apos;t have is a really good mo@@ del of human psych@@ ology .
"A@@ t le@@ ast pre@@ -@@ K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man perhaps , we didn &apos;t have a really good mo@@ del of human psych@@ ology to put al@@ on@@ g@@ side mod@@ els of engine@@ ering , of ne@@ oc@@ las@@ sic@@ al econom@@ ics ."
So people who beli@@ ev@@ ed in psych@@ ological solu@@ tions didn &apos;t have a mo@@ del .
We didn &apos;t have a fra@@ me@@ work .
This is what W@@ ar@@ re@@ n B@@ uf@@ f@@ et@@ t &apos;s business par@@ t@@ ner Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e M@@ un@@ ger call@@ s &quot; a l@@ at@@ tic@@ e@@ work on which to han@@ g your ideas . &quot;
"@@ En@@ gine@@ ers , econom@@ ists , clas@@ sic@@ al econom@@ ists all had a very , very rob@@ ust ex@@ is@@ ting l@@ at@@ tic@@ e@@ work on which prac@@ tically every idea could be h@@ un@@ g ."
We mer@@ ely have a col@@ lec@@ tion of ran@@ dom individ@@ ual in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts without an over@@ all mo@@ del .
"And what that means is that in looking at solu@@ tions , we &apos;ve probably given too much pri@@ or@@ ity to what I call te@@ chn@@ ical engine@@ ering solu@@ tions , N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on@@ ian solu@@ tions , and not ne@@ arly enough to the psych@@ ological ones ."
You know my example of the Eu@@ ro@@ star .
S@@ i@@ x million po@@ un@@ ds sp@@ ent to reduc@@ e the j@@ our@@ ney time between P@@ aris and L@@ on@@ don by about 40 minutes .
"For 0@@ .@@ 0@@ 1 percent of this money you could have put W@@ i@@ F@@ i on the tra@@ ins , which wouldn &apos;t have reduc@@ ed the d@@ ura@@ tion of the j@@ our@@ ney , but would have impro@@ ved its en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment and its us@@ ef@@ ul@@ l@@ ness far more ."
"For maybe 10 percent of the money , you could have pa@@ id all of the world &apos;s top mal@@ e and f@@ em@@ ale super@@ mod@@ els to wal@@ k up and down the tra@@ in h@@ anding out f@@ ree Ch@@ at@@ e@@ a@@ u P@@ et@@ r@@ us to all the pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers ."
"You &apos;d still have five &#91; million &#93; po@@ un@@ ds in change , and people would ask for the tra@@ ins to be s@@ lowed down ."
( Laughter ) Why were we not given the chan@@ ce to sol@@ ve that problem psych@@ olog@@ ically ?
"I think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an im@@ bal@@ ance , an as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ try , in the way we treat cre@@ ative , emo@@ tion@@ all@@ y-@@ driv@@ en psych@@ ological ideas ver@@ su@@ s the way we treat ra@@ tional , num@@ er@@ ical , sp@@ read@@ she@@ et@@ -@@ driv@@ en ideas ."
"If you &apos;re a cre@@ ative person , I think quite ri@@ gh@@ tly , you have to share all your ideas for appro@@ v@@ al with people much more ra@@ tional than you ."
"You have to go in and you have to have a co@@ st@@ -@@ ben@@ ef@@ it anal@@ y@@ sis , a fe@@ asi@@ bility study , an R@@ O@@ I study and so for@@ th ."
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not app@@ ly the other way around .
"P@@ eople who have an ex@@ is@@ ting fra@@ me@@ work , an economic fra@@ me@@ work , an engine@@ ering fra@@ me@@ work , feel that actually log@@ ic is its own answer ."
"What they don &apos;t say is , &quot; &quot; Well the numbers all seem to ad@@ d up , but before I present this idea , I &apos;ll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better . &quot; &quot; And so we , ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ i@@ ally I think , pri@@ or@@ it@@ ize what I &apos;d call me@@ chan@@ is@@ tic ideas over psych@@ ological ideas ."
"A@@ n example of a great psych@@ ological idea : The single best impro@@ v@@ ement in pas@@ sen@@ ger sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion on the L@@ on@@ don Un@@ der@@ ground per po@@ und sp@@ ent came when they didn &apos;t ad@@ d any extra tra@@ ins n@@ or change the f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy of the tra@@ ins , they put dot mat@@ ri@@ x dis@@ play bo@@ ard on the pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms ."
"Because the nature of a wa@@ it is not just de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on its num@@ er@@ ical qu@@ ality , its d@@ ura@@ tion , but on the level of un@@ certain@@ ty you experience d@@ uring that wa@@ it ."
"W@@ a@@ iting seven minutes for a tra@@ in with a coun@@ t@@ down c@@ loc@@ k is less f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ting and ir@@ rit@@ ating than wa@@ iting four minutes , k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ iting going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en &apos;s this tra@@ in going to dam@@ n well ar@@ r@@ ive ? &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a beautiful example of a psych@@ ological solu@@ tion de@@ p@@ lo@@ yed in K@@ or@@ ea ."
R@@ ed tra@@ f@@ fic ligh@@ ts have a coun@@ t@@ down del@@ ay .
It &apos;s pro@@ ven to reduc@@ e the acc@@ id@@ ent rate in experim@@ ents .
"Wh@@ y ? Because ro@@ ad ra@@ ge , im@@ pati@@ ence and gener@@ al ir@@ rit@@ ation are mas@@ si@@ vely reduc@@ ed when you can actually see the time you have to wa@@ it ."
"In China , not really understanding the princi@@ ple be@@ h@@ ind this , they app@@ li@@ ed the same princi@@ ple to gre@@ en tra@@ f@@ fic ligh@@ ts ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich isn &apos;t a great idea .
"You &apos;re 200 yar@@ ds away , you real@@ ize you &apos;ve got five secon@@ ds to go , you f@@ lo@@ or it ."
"( Laughter ) The K@@ or@@ e@@ ans , very as@@ sid@@ u@@ ously , did test both ."
The acc@@ id@@ ent rate goes down when you app@@ ly this to red tra@@ f@@ fic ligh@@ ts ; it goes up when you app@@ ly it to gre@@ en tra@@ f@@ fic ligh@@ ts .
"This is all I &apos;m as@@ king for really in human dec@@ ision making , is the consid@@ er@@ ation of these three things ."
I &apos;m not as@@ king for the complet@@ e pri@@ ma@@ cy of one over the other .
"I &apos;m mer@@ ely saying that when you sol@@ ve problems , you should look at all three of these equ@@ ally and you should see@@ k as far as possible to find solu@@ tions which s@@ it in the s@@ we@@ et spo@@ t in the middle ."
"If you actually look at a great business , you &apos;ll ne@@ arly always see all of these three things coming into play ."
"R@@ e@@ ally , really success@@ ful bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es — G@@ o@@ o@@ gle is great , great technolo@@ g@@ ical success , but it &apos;s also bas@@ ed on a very good psych@@ ological in@@ sight : P@@ eople believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else ."
It &apos;s an in@@ n@@ ate thing called go@@ al dil@@ u@@ tion .
A@@ y@@ el@@ et F@@ ish@@ b@@ ach has writ@@ ten a p@@ aper about this .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body else at the time of G@@ o@@ o@@ gle , more or less , was trying to be a port@@ al ."
"Y@@ es , there &apos;s a se@@ arch func@@ tion , but you also have we@@ a@@ ther , s@@ por@@ ts sc@@ or@@ es , b@@ its of news ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ o@@ gle underst@@ ood that if you &apos;re just a se@@ arch eng@@ ine , people as@@ su@@ me you &apos;re a very , very good se@@ arch eng@@ ine ."
All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a tel@@ ev@@ ision .
And in the sh@@ ab@@ bi@@ er end of the row of fl@@ at scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s you can see are these rather des@@ p@@ ised things called com@@ b@@ ined T@@ V and D@@ V@@ D pla@@ y@@ ers .
"And we have no knowledge wh@@ ats@@ o@@ ever of the qu@@ ality of those things , but we look at a com@@ b@@ ined T@@ V and D@@ V@@ D pla@@ y@@ er and we go , &quot; &quot; U@@ c@@ k ."
It &apos;s probably a bit of a cra@@ p tel@@ ly and a bit r@@ ub@@ b@@ ish as a D@@ V@@ D pla@@ y@@ er . &quot; &quot; So we wal@@ k out of the sh@@ op@@ s with one of each .
G@@ o@@ o@@ gle is as much a psych@@ ological success as it is a technolo@@ g@@ ical one .
I pro@@ pose that we can use psych@@ ology to sol@@ ve problems that we didn &apos;t even real@@ ize were problems at all .
This is my su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion for getting people to fin@@ ish their course of an@@ ti@@ bi@@ ot@@ ics .
D@@ on &apos;t give them 2@@ 4 white p@@ il@@ ls .
G@@ ive them 18 white p@@ il@@ ls and six bl@@ ue ones and tell them to take the white p@@ il@@ ls first and then take the bl@@ ue ones .
It &apos;s called ch@@ un@@ king .
The lik@@ eli@@ ho@@ od that people will get to the end is much gre@@ ater when there is a mil@@ est@@ one some@@ where in the middle .
"One of the great mis@@ takes , I think , of econom@@ ics is it fa@@ ils to understand that what something is , whether it &apos;s re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , cost , is a func@@ tion , not only of its amount , but also its mean@@ ing ."
This is a t@@ ol@@ l c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing in Brit@@ ain .
Q@@ u@@ ite often qu@@ e@@ ues happen at the t@@ ol@@ ls .
"S@@ ome@@ times you get very , very s@@ ev@@ ere qu@@ e@@ ues ."
"You could app@@ ly the same princi@@ ple actually , if you like , to the sec@@ ur@@ ity lan@@ es in air@@ por@@ ts ."
"What would happen if you could actually pa@@ y tw@@ ice as much money to c@@ ross the br@@ id@@ ge , but go through a lan@@ e that &apos;s an ex@@ pres@@ s lan@@ e ?"
It &apos;s not an un@@ reas@@ on@@ able thing to do . It &apos;s an econom@@ ically ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent thing to do .
T@@ ime means more to some people than others .
"If you &apos;re wa@@ iting trying to get to a job inter@@ view , you &apos;d pat@@ ently pa@@ y a couple of po@@ un@@ ds more to go through the f@@ ast lan@@ e ."
"If you &apos;re on the way to vis@@ it your mother in@@ -@@ la@@ w , you &apos;d probably pre@@ fer to st@@ ay on the left ."
"The only problem is if you in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e this econom@@ ically ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent solu@@ tion , people h@@ ate it ."
"Because they think you &apos;re d@@ eli@@ ber@@ ately cre@@ ating del@@ a@@ ys at the br@@ id@@ ge in order to ma@@ x@@ imi@@ ze your re@@ ven@@ ue , and &quot; &quot; Why on e@@ arth should I pa@@ y to sub@@ sid@@ ize your im@@ comp@@ et@@ ence ? &quot; &quot; O@@ n the other hand , change the fra@@ me s@@ ligh@@ tly and create char@@ it@@ able y@@ i@@ el@@ d man@@ ag@@ ement , so the extra money you get goes not to the br@@ id@@ ge compan@@ y , it goes to char@@ ity , and the mental w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to pa@@ y completely changes ."
"You have a rel@@ ati@@ vely econom@@ ically ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent solu@@ tion , but one that actually me@@ ets with public appro@@ v@@ al and even a small de@@ gre@@ e of af@@ fec@@ tion , rather than being seen as bas@@ t@@ ar@@ d@@ y ."
So where econom@@ ists make the fundamental mis@@ take is they think that money is money .
"A@@ c@@ tually my pa@@ in experien@@ ced in pa@@ ying five po@@ un@@ ds is not just pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate to the amount , but where I think that money is going ."
And I think understanding that could revolu@@ tion@@ ize ta@@ x pol@@ ic@@ y .
It could revolu@@ tion@@ ize the public ser@@ vic@@ es .
It could really change things quite si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
He &apos;s an A@@ ust@@ ri@@ an school econom@@ ist who was first ac@@ tive in the first half of the 20@@ th century in V@@ i@@ en@@ na .
What was interesting about the A@@ ust@@ ri@@ an school is they actually gre@@ w up al@@ on@@ g@@ side F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
And so they &apos;re pre@@ domin@@ an@@ tly interes@@ ted in psych@@ ology .
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that there was a dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine called pra@@ x@@ e@@ ology , which is a pri@@ or dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine to the study of econom@@ ics ."
"P@@ ra@@ x@@ e@@ ology is the study of human cho@@ ice , action and dec@@ ision making ."
I think they &apos;re right .
I think the dan@@ ger we have in today &apos;s world is we have the study of econom@@ ics consid@@ ers itself to be a pri@@ or dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine to the study of human psych@@ ology .
"But as Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e M@@ un@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; If econom@@ ics isn &apos;t behav@@ io@@ ral , I don &apos;t know what the h@@ ell is . &quot; &quot; V@@ on M@@ is@@ es , interes@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , beli@@ ev@@ es econom@@ ics is just a sub@@ set of psych@@ ology ."
I think he just re@@ fer@@ s to econom@@ ics as &quot; the study of human pra@@ x@@ e@@ ology under con@@ dit@@ ions of sc@@ arc@@ ity . &quot;
"But v@@ on M@@ is@@ es , amo@@ n@@ g many other things , I think uses an anal@@ o@@ gy which is probably the best j@@ us@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation and ex@@ plan@@ ation for the value of mar@@ ket@@ ing , the value of per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to any other kind of value ."
"We t@@ end to , all of us — even those of us who work in mar@@ ket@@ ing — to think of value in two ways ."
"There &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a fac@@ t@@ ory and pro@@ v@@ ide a ser@@ vic@@ e , and then there &apos;s a kind of d@@ ub@@ ious value , which you create by chang@@ ing the way people look at things ."
V@@ on M@@ is@@ es completely re@@ jec@@ ted this dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion .
And he used this fol@@ lowing anal@@ o@@ gy .
"He re@@ fer@@ red actually to stran@@ ge econom@@ ists called the F@@ ren@@ ch P@@ hy@@ si@@ oc@@ ra@@ ts , who beli@@ ev@@ ed that the only true value was what you ex@@ trac@@ ted from the land ."
"So if you &apos;re a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d or a qu@@ ar@@ r@@ y@@ man or a far@@ m@@ er , you created true value ."
"If ho@@ w@@ ever , you b@@ ou@@ ght some wo@@ ol from the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and ch@@ arg@@ ed a pre@@ miu@@ m for con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing it into a h@@ at , you wer@@ en &apos;t actually cre@@ ating value , you were explo@@ iting the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d ."
Now v@@ on M@@ is@@ es said that moder@@ n econom@@ ists make exactly the same mis@@ take with re@@ gar@@ d to adv@@ ert@@ is@@ ing and mar@@ ket@@ ing .
"He says , if you run a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant , there is no heal@@ thy dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion to be made between the value you create by co@@ o@@ king the food and the value you create by s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"One of them cre@@ ates , perhaps , the pri@@ mar@@ y produc@@ t — the thing we think we &apos;re pa@@ ying for — the other one cre@@ ates a cont@@ ex@@ t within which we can en@@ jo@@ y and app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate that produc@@ t ."
And the idea that one of them should actually have pri@@ or@@ ity over the other is fundam@@ ent@@ ally wrong .
T@@ ry this qu@@ ic@@ k thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant that ser@@ ves M@@ ich@@ el@@ in@@ -@@ star@@ red food , but actually where the re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant sm@@ el@@ ls of se@@ w@@ age and there &apos;s human fec@@ es on the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to impro@@ ve the food still fur@@ ther , it &apos;s to get ri@@ d of the sm@@ ell and c@@ le@@ an up the f@@ lo@@ or ."
And it &apos;s vit@@ al we understand this .
"If that seems like some stran@@ ge , ab@@ str@@ use thing , in the U.@@ K@@ . , the pos@@ t off@@ ice had a 9@@ 8 percent success rate at del@@ iver@@ ing fir@@ st@@ -@@ class ma@@ il the next day ."
They decided this wasn &apos;t good enough and they wanted to get it up to 9@@ 9 .
The ef@@ for@@ t to do that almost bro@@ ke the organiz@@ ation .
"If at the same time you &apos;d gone and asked people , &quot; What per@@ cent@@ age of fir@@ st@@ -@@ class ma@@ il ar@@ riv@@ es the next day ? &quot;"
"@@ the average answer , or the mo@@ da@@ l answer would have been 50 to 60 percent ."
"Now if your per@@ cep@@ tion is much wor@@ se than your reality , what on e@@ arth are you doing trying to change the reality ?"
That &apos;s like trying to impro@@ ve the food in a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant that st@@ in@@ ks .
"What you need to do is first of all tell people that 9@@ 8 percent of ma@@ il gets there the next day , fir@@ st@@ -@@ class ma@@ il ."
That &apos;s pretty good .
"I would arg@@ ue , in Brit@@ ain there &apos;s a much better fra@@ me of re@@ fer@@ ence , which is to tell people that more fir@@ st@@ -@@ class ma@@ il ar@@ riv@@ es the next day in the U.@@ K@@ . than in G@@ er@@ many ."
"Because gener@@ ally in Brit@@ ain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the G@@ er@@ man@@ s ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ ho@@ ose your fra@@ me of re@@ fer@@ ence and the per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed value and ther@@ e@@ fore the ac@@ tual value is completely tr@@ an@@ form@@ ed .
It has to be said of the G@@ er@@ man@@ s that the G@@ er@@ man@@ s and the F@@ ren@@ ch are doing a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant job of cre@@ ating a un@@ ited Eu@@ rop@@ e .
The only thing they don &apos;t exp@@ ect is they &apos;re un@@ iting Eu@@ rop@@ e through a shar@@ ed mil@@ d h@@ at@@ red of the F@@ ren@@ ch and G@@ er@@ man@@ s .
"But I &apos;m Brit@@ ish , that &apos;s the way we like it ."
What you also not@@ ice is that in any case our per@@ cep@@ tion is le@@ ak@@ y .
We can &apos;t tell the difference between the qu@@ ality of the food and the environ@@ ment in which we con@@ su@@ me it .
All of you will have seen this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on if you have your c@@ ar wa@@ shed or val@@ et@@ ed .
"When you dr@@ ive away , your c@@ ar fe@@ els as if it driv@@ es better ."
"And the reason for this , un@@ less my c@@ ar val@@ et my@@ ster@@ i@@ ously is chang@@ ing the o@@ il and per@@ form@@ ing work which I &apos;m not pa@@ ying him for and I &apos;m un@@ aw@@ are of , is because per@@ cep@@ tion is in any case le@@ ak@@ y ."
An@@ al@@ ges@@ ics that are br@@ and@@ ed are more effec@@ tive at reduc@@ ing pa@@ in than anal@@ ges@@ ics that are not br@@ and@@ ed .
"I don &apos;t just mean through re@@ port@@ ed pa@@ in reduc@@ tion , ac@@ tual meas@@ ured pa@@ in reduc@@ tion ."
And so per@@ cep@@ tion actually is le@@ ak@@ y in any case .
"So if you do something that &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tually bad in one res@@ p@@ ect , you can da@@ mag@@ e the other ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I work in mar@@ ket@@ ing , which I love , but my first passion was physics , a passion b@@ rou@@ ght to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gra@@ y ha@@ ir ."
So he t@@ au@@ ght me that physics is co@@ ol because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So qu@@ ic@@ k show of hands — who stu@@ died some mar@@ ket@@ ing in univer@@ sity ?
Wh@@ o stu@@ died some physics in univer@@ sity ?
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly this will bring back some happy , or possi@@ bly some s@@ ligh@@ tly dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es ."
"So , physics and mar@@ ket@@ ing ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — N@@ e@@ w@@ ton &apos;s L@@ a@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als mass times ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es should have stu@@ died a bit more care@@ fully before they ra@@ n this cam@@ pa@@ ign .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge this form@@ ul@@ a qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , we can get to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation equ@@ als force over mass , which means that for a larg@@ er partic@@ le — a larg@@ er mass — it requ@@ ir@@ es more force to change its direc@@ tion ."
"It &apos;s the same with br@@ an@@ ds : the more massive a br@@ and , the more b@@ ag@@ ga@@ ge it has , the more force is needed to change its pos@@ it@@ ion@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why A@@ r@@ th@@ ur An@@ der@@ s@@ en ch@@ ose to la@@ un@@ ch A@@ c@@ cent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ ade the world that An@@ der@@ s@@ en &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ coun@@ tan@@ cy .
"It expla@@ ins why H@@ o@@ over found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ ade the world that it was more than v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and why compan@@ ies like Un@@ il@@ ever and P &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; G keep br@@ an@@ ds se@@ par@@ ate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ r@@ ingl@@ es and D@@ ove rather than having one gi@@ ant par@@ ent br@@ and ."
"The mar@@ ket@@ ing is , the big@@ ger a br@@ and , the more difficult it is to re@@ position it ."
So think about a port@@ fo@@ li@@ o of br@@ an@@ ds or maybe new br@@ an@@ ds for new v@@ ent@@ ures .
"Now , who remem@@ bers H@@ e@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ certain@@ ty princi@@ ple ?"
G@@ etting a little more te@@ chn@@ ical now .
"So this says that it &apos;s im@@ possible , by defin@@ ition , to measure exactly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the position — and the mo@@ men@@ tum of a partic@@ le , because the act of meas@@ uring it , by defin@@ ition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the ph@@ ot@@ on of light has mo@@ men@@ tum , which kno@@ c@@ ks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y meas@@ uring it , the act of meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of observ@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in mar@@ ket@@ ing .
"So with the act of observ@@ ing con@@ sum@@ ers , changes their behavior ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mo@@ ms who are talking about their wonderful children in a foc@@ us group , and almost n@@ one of them buy lots of j@@ un@@ k food ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s sel@@ ls hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ lions of bur@@ g@@ ers every year ."
"Y@@ et , at G@@ o@@ o@@ gle , we know it &apos;s the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one se@@ arch@@ ed for cat@@ eg@@ ory ."
"So l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , the science — no , sor@@ ry — the mar@@ ket@@ ing is getting eas@@ ier ."
"@@ L@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , with now better poin@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ sa@@ le trac@@ king , more dig@@ ital me@@ dia con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , you can measure more what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never ac@@ cu@@ rat@@ ely and exactly measure a partic@@ le , because the observ@@ ation changes it ."
"The mar@@ ket@@ ing is — the mes@@ sa@@ ge for mar@@ ket@@ ing is — that try to measure what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can ga@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis or a pos@@ it@@ ion@@ ing , and it will str@@ eng@@ then it , but it will not con@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely pro@@ ve it ."
And only one con@@ tr@@ ary data point can b@@ low your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ t@@ ol@@ em@@ y had do@@ z@@ ens of data poin@@ ts to sup@@ port his theory that the plan@@ ets would ro@@ t@@ ate around the Earth .
It only took one rob@@ ust observ@@ ation from C@@ oper@@ n@@ ic@@ us to b@@ low that idea out of the water .
"@@ T@@ ake B@@ P — they sp@@ ent mil@@ lions of po@@ un@@ ds over many years building up its cre@@ den@@ ti@@ als as an environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ end@@ ly br@@ and , but then one little acc@@ id@@ ent ."
Th@@ ink about To@@ y@@ ot@@ a .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ ver@@ ed as the most rel@@ i@@ able of c@@ ars , and then they had the big rec@@ all in@@ c@@ id@@ ent ."
"And T@@ ig@@ er W@@ o@@ ods , for a long time , the per@@ fect br@@ and amb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot pro@@ ve a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ pro@@ ve it — any hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis is sh@@ ak@@ y ."
"And the mar@@ ket@@ ing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve inv@@ es@@ ted in your br@@ and , one bad week can under@@ mine dec@@ ades of good work ."
So be really care@@ ful to try and av@@ o@@ id the scre@@ w@@ -@@ ups that can under@@ mine your br@@ and .
"And las@@ tly , to the s@@ ligh@@ tly ob@@ sc@@ ure world of entropy — the second la@@ w of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of mar@@ ket@@ ing .
"If we go back 20 years , the one mes@@ sa@@ ge pretty much contro@@ l@@ led by one mar@@ ket@@ ing man@@ ag@@ er could pretty much defin@@ e a br@@ and ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a st@@ rong br@@ and imag@@ e or a mes@@ sa@@ ge and put it out there like the Con@@ serv@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you lo@@ se control of it .
"W@@ ith the kind of dig@@ ital com@@ ment cre@@ ation and dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to@@ ols that are av@@ a@@ il@@ able now to every con@@ sum@@ er , it &apos;s im@@ possible to control where it goes ."
"Y@@ our br@@ and star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more cha@@ ot@@ ic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your control . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him spe@@ ak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ s@@ et@@ t@@ ling for mar@@ ket@@ ers , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of br@@ and energy gets your br@@ and clo@@ s@@ er to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of energy a democra@@ ti@@ z@@ ing force , which is ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely good for your br@@ and ."
"So , the les@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental la@@ w ."
The mes@@ sa@@ ge for mar@@ ket@@ ing is that your br@@ and is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ bra@@ ce it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .

"We are going to take a qu@@ ic@@ k vo@@ y@@ age over the co@@ gn@@ itive history of the 20@@ th century , because d@@ uring that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
"As you all know , the c@@ ars that people dro@@ ve in 19@@ 00 have al@@ ter@@ ed because the ro@@ ad@@ s are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed , too ."
"And these incl@@ u@@ de things like clo@@ thing that con@@ cre@@ te world with clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation , in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions that we try to make log@@ ically con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent , and also taking the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , that is , wonder@@ ing about what might have been rather than what is ."
"Now , this dra@@ ma@@ tic change was dra@@ wn to my at@@ ten@@ tion through massive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . ga@@ ins over time , and these have been tr@@ ul@@ y massive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . tes@@ ts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . tes@@ ts than each suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing gener@@ ation back to the time that they were inv@@ ented .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , if you sc@@ ore the people a century ago against moder@@ n nor@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 7@@ 0 ."
"If you sc@@ ore us against their nor@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ ised all sor@@ ts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ medi@@ ate an@@ c@@ est@@ ors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ da@@ tion ?
Because 7@@ 0 is nor@@ m@@ ally the sc@@ ore for mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ da@@ tion .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the c@@ ut@@ ting line for gi@@ f@@ t@@ ed@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and arg@@ ue for a third al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive that &apos;s much more ill@@ um@@ in@@ ating than ei@@ ther of those , and to put this into per@@ spec@@ tive , let &apos;s imagine that a Mar@@ ti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined civiliz@@ ation ."
"And this Mar@@ ti@@ an was an arch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ ist , and they found sc@@ or@@ es , t@@ arg@@ et sc@@ or@@ es , that people had used for sho@@ ot@@ ing ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a min@@ ute , people had only put one b@@ ul@@ let in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five b@@ ul@@ l@@ ets in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e in a min@@ ute ."
And then about 19@@ 18 they put a hundred b@@ ul@@ l@@ ets in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e .
"And in@@ it@@ i@@ ally , that arch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ ist would be b@@ af@@ fl@@ ed ."
"They would say , look , these tes@@ ts were des@@ ign@@ ed to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their ey@@ es@@ ight was , whether they had control of their we@@ apo@@ n ."
How could these per@@ for@@ man@@ ces have es@@ cal@@ ated to this en@@ or@@ mo@@ us de@@ gre@@ e ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equ@@ ip@@ ment that was in the hands of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was respon@@ si@@ ble , not gre@@ ater ke@@ en@@ ness of ey@@ e or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental art@@ ill@@ er@@ y that we have pic@@ ked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ k@@ er will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ uria ."
"@@ L@@ uria looked at people just before they en@@ ter@@ ed the scientific age , and he found that these people were res@@ ist@@ ant to clas@@ si@@ f@@ ying the con@@ cre@@ te world ."
They wanted to bre@@ ak it up into little b@@ its that they could use .
"He found that they were res@@ ist@@ ant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to spec@@ ul@@ ating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions or using log@@ ic on those ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions ."
Now let me give you a sam@@ ple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He tal@@ ked to the head man of a person in ru@@ ral R@@ us@@ sia .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 19@@ 00 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do c@@ ro@@ ws and f@@ ish have in common ?"
"And the fel@@ low said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a f@@ ish . I can &apos;t e@@ at a c@@ row ."
A c@@ row can pec@@ k at a f@@ ish .
"The other is a bir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interes@@ ted , effec@@ ti@@ vely , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And then L@@ uria went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
H@@ amb@@ ur@@ g is a c@@ ity in G@@ er@@ many .
"A@@ re there cam@@ els in H@@ amb@@ ur@@ g ? &quot; &quot; And the fel@@ low said , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s large enough , there ou@@ ght to be cam@@ els there . &quot;"
"And L@@ uria said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words im@@ p@@ ly ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for cam@@ els . &quot; &quot; I@@ n other words , he was un@@ w@@ il@@ ling to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to cam@@ els being in vill@@ ages , and he was quite un@@ able to use the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to ask h@@ im@@ self what if there were no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
A third inter@@ view was conduc@@ ted with someone about the Nor@@ th P@@ ole .
"And L@@ uria said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the Nor@@ th P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ars are white ."
"What c@@ olo@@ r are the be@@ ars at the Nor@@ th P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; S@@ uch a thing is to be s@@ et@@ t@@ led by tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ y ."
"If a w@@ ise person came from the Nor@@ th P@@ ole and told me the be@@ ars were white , I might believe him , but every be@@ ar that I have seen is a bro@@ wn be@@ ar . &quot; &quot; Now you see again , this person has re@@ jec@@ ted going be@@ y@@ ond the con@@ cre@@ te world and anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing it through every@@ day experience , and it was important to that person what c@@ olo@@ r be@@ ars were — that is , they had to h@@ un@@ t be@@ ars ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ il@@ ling to en@@ ga@@ ge in this .
"One of them said to L@@ uria , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that ar@@ en &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tions .
"F@@ ir@@ st , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma ."
"That is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of forma@@ l education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experien@@ ced some typ@@ e of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
"Now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scientific , and you can &apos;t do science without clas@@ si@@ f@@ ying the world ."
You can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es .
You can &apos;t do science without making it log@@ ically con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent .
"And even down in gra@@ de school , things have changed ."
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 4@@ 5 st@@ ates that ex@@ is@@ ted at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exam@@ s that the state of O@@ hi@@ o gave in 19@@ 90 , they were all about ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions ."
"They were things like , why is the larg@@ est c@@ ity of a state r@@ ar@@ ely the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in H@@ ar@@ ris@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia .
So the ten@@ or of education has changed .
"We are educ@@ ating people to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , to use ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions , and to lin@@ k them log@@ ically ."
What about emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ?
"Well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of Americ@@ ans prac@@ tic@@ ed profes@@ sions that were co@@ gn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely de@@ man@@ ding ."
O@@ n@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or doc@@ tors or teachers .
"@@ To@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans prac@@ ti@@ ce co@@ gn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions , not only to the profes@@ sions pro@@ per like la@@ w@@ y@@ er or doc@@ tor or scient@@ ist or lec@@ tu@@ re@@ r , but many , many sub@@ -@@ profes@@ sions having to do with being a te@@ chn@@ ician , a computer program@@ m@@ er ."
A whole ran@@ ge of profes@@ sions now make co@@ gn@@ itive de@@ man@@ ds .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in co@@ gn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions .
The profes@@ sions have been up@@ grad@@ ed .
"C@@ om@@ p@@ are the doc@@ tor in 19@@ 00 , who really had only a few tric@@ ks up his s@@ le@@ eve , with the moder@@ n gener@@ al prac@@ tit@@ ion@@ er or speci@@ al@@ ist , with years of scientific tra@@ ining ."
They went far be@@ y@@ ond that 19@@ 00 ban@@ k@@ er .
They had to look at computer pro@@ jec@@ tions for the h@@ ous@@ ing market .
They had to get compl@@ ic@@ ated C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ ar@@ ed in order to b@@ und@@ le d@@ ebt together and make d@@ ebt look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a far@@ m@@ er today .
I take the far@@ m man@@ ag@@ er of today as very different from the far@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 00 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ grad@@ ing of t@@ as@@ ks like la@@ w@@ y@@ er and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ man@@ ds on our co@@ gn@@ itive fac@@ ul@@ ties .
But I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about education and emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ ily a moral philosoph@@ er .
"Now over the last century , in develop@@ ed na@@ tions like America , moral deb@@ ate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , and we also take univer@@ sa@@ ls ser@@ i@@ ously and look for log@@ ical connec@@ tions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univer@@ sity at the time of Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having argum@@ ents with their parents and grand@@ parents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ d@@ ly raci@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were in@@ fer@@ ior .
"And when we said to our parents and grand@@ parents , &quot; How would you feel if to@@ mor@@ row mor@@ ning you wo@@ ke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the d@@ um@@ best thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mor@@ es and at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es they had in@@ her@@ ited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the ol@@ der gener@@ ation says , well , our government takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ il@@ ling to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an I@@ s@@ la@@ mic father wh@@ ose dau@@ ghter has been ra@@ ped , and he fe@@ els he &apos;s h@@ on@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ her@@ ited mor@@ es .
"@@ To@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were kno@@ c@@ ked un@@ consci@@ ous and so@@ do@@ miz@@ ed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the K@@ o@@ ra@@ n ."
That &apos;s not one of the princi@@ pl@@ es I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univer@@ sa@@ li@@ ze your princi@@ pl@@ es ."
You state them as ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions and you use log@@ ic on them .
"You have to say , well , bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of sk@@ in , you couldn &apos;t suf@@ fer just for that ."
It must be that bl@@ ac@@ ks are some@@ how ta@@ in@@ ted .
"And then we can bring em@@ pir@@ ical evidence to be@@ ar , can &apos;t we , and say , well how can you consid@@ er all bl@@ ac@@ ks ta@@ in@@ ted when St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine was black and Th@@ o@@ mas S@@ o@@ well is black ."
"And you can get moral argum@@ ent off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral princi@@ pl@@ es as con@@ cre@@ te ent@@ ities ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univer@@ sa@@ ls , to be ren@@ der@@ ed con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent by log@@ ic ."
That &apos;s what in@@ it@@ i@@ ally got me going on co@@ gn@@ itive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the ga@@ ins have been gre@@ at@@ est in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ at@@ ter@@ y that are about using log@@ ic on ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tions .
"And in 19@@ 00 , people could do simple anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es ."
"That is , if you said to them , cat@@ s are like w@@ il@@ d@@ cat@@ s ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 19@@ 60 , people could att@@ ack R@@ aven &apos;s on a much more soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two s@@ qu@@ ar@@ es fol@@ lowed by a tri@@ an@@ gle , what fol@@ lo@@ ws two cir@@ cl@@ es ?"
They could say a s@@ em@@ ic@@ ir@@ cle .
"@@ Just as a tri@@ an@@ gle is half of a s@@ qu@@ are , a s@@ em@@ ic@@ ir@@ cle is half of a cir@@ cle ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , college grad@@ u@@ ates , if you said two cir@@ cl@@ es fol@@ lowed by a s@@ em@@ ic@@ ir@@ cle , two si@@ x@@ te@@ ens fol@@ lowed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 1@@ 6 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very di@@ she@@ ar@@ ten@@ ing ."
We hav@@ en &apos;t made progress on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve not@@ ic@@ ed , in a tr@@ end amo@@ n@@ g young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about for@@ e@@ ign lan@@ ds , and they &apos;re essenti@@ ally a@@ hist@@ or@@ ical ."
They live in the b@@ ub@@ ble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the K@@ or@@ e@@ an W@@ ar from the war in V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time W@@ es@@ tern ar@@ mi@@ es have gone to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan to put its h@@ ou@@ se in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous oc@@ cas@@ ions ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had bar@@ ely left , and there wasn &apos;t a tra@@ ce in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six w@@ ars .
"You know , the S@@ pan@@ ish didn &apos;t sin@@ k the b@@ att@@ le@@ ship Ma@@ ine , the L@@ us@@ it@@ ania was not an in@@ no@@ cent v@@ es@@ se@@ l but was lo@@ ad@@ ed with mun@@ it@@ ions , the Nor@@ th V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese did not att@@ ack the S@@ ev@@ ent@@ h F@@ le@@ et , and , of course , S@@ ad@@ da@@ m H@@ us@@ se@@ in h@@ ated al Q@@ a@@ e@@ da and had nothing to do with it , and yet the ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ration con@@ vin@@ ced 4@@ 5 percent of the people that they were bro@@ thers in ar@@ ms , when he would han@@ g one from the ne@@ ar@@ est l@@ am@@ p@@ pos@@ t ."
But I don &apos;t want to end on a p@@ es@@ sim@@ is@@ tic not@@ e .
"@@ L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people ba@@ thing in the Nor@@ th S@@ ea , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what white bo@@ dies the lower or@@ d@@ ers have ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s if they were a re@@ p@@ t@@ ile ."
"A@@ n imag@@ e is wor@@ th more than a thou@@ s@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few imag@@ es that I rec@@ ently cap@@ tu@@ red ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ er , as an art@@ ist , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it is an imag@@ e of a so@@ a@@ p b@@ ub@@ ble cap@@ tu@@ red at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ st@@ ing , as you can see in this imag@@ e , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little be@@ ad@@ s of o@@ il pain@@ t , stran@@ ge li@@ qu@@ id@@ s that be@@ have in very pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar ways , or pain@@ t that is mod@@ el@@ ed by cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ga@@ l for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to lin@@ k those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me demon@@ st@@ rate this bas@@ ed on three pro@@ jects .
The first one has to do with making sound vis@@ ible .
"Now as you may know , sound tr@@ av@@ els in w@@ aves , so if you have a speak@@ er , a speak@@ er actually does nothing else than taking the audi@@ o sign@@ al , trans@@ form it into a vibra@@ tion , which is then trans@@ port@@ ed through the air , is cap@@ tu@@ red by our e@@ ar , and trans@@ form@@ ed into an audi@@ o sign@@ al again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound w@@ aves vis@@ ible ?"
So I came up with the fol@@ lowing s@@ et@@ up .
"I took a speak@@ er , I plac@@ ed a th@@ in fo@@ il of pl@@ as@@ tic on top of that speak@@ er , and then I ad@@ ded tiny little c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als on top of that speak@@ er ."
"And now , if I would play a sound through that speak@@ er , it would cause the c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very f@@ ast , in the bl@@ ink of an ey@@ e , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tu@@ red this mo@@ tion with a c@@ amer@@ a that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 f@@ rames per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ us@@ ic : &quot; &quot; Te@@ ar@@ dro@@ p &quot; &quot; by M@@ as@@ sive A@@ t@@ t@@ ack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty amazing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ n@@ y story .
I got an indo@@ or sun@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ ot@@ ing in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es .
"Now in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , you could get a de@@ cent sun@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ ach@@ es , but I got mine indo@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at 3@@ ,000 f@@ rames per second , you need to have a sil@@ ly amount of light , lots of ligh@@ ts ."
"What was so fun@@ n@@ y about it was that the speak@@ er was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the P@@ han@@ tom of the O@@ per@@ a for the rest of the week ."
Let me now turn to another pro@@ ject which inv@@ ol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ stan@@ ces .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I sk@@ i@@ p that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very stran@@ ge behavior .
It &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an o@@ ily con@@ s@@ ist@@ en@@ cy .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little partic@@ les of met@@ al in it , which makes it mag@@ ne@@ tic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a mag@@ ne@@ tic field , it would change its ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live demon@@ stra@@ tion over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a c@@ amer@@ a poin@@ ting down at this pl@@ ate , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pl@@ ate , there is a mag@@ n@@ et ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that mag@@ n@@ et .
Let &apos;s just s@@ ligh@@ tly move it to the right and maybe foc@@ us it a little bit more . E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has form@@ ed sp@@ ik@@ es .
Th@@ ose are just stan@@ dar@@ d wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors that you would pain@@ t with .
"So what happened now is , when the wat@@ er@@ c@@ olo@@ r was f@@ lowing into the structure , the wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ ob@@ ic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second pro@@ ject .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
D@@ id he dr@@ ink half a bot@@ tle of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey and then dra@@ w the h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation he got from being d@@ run@@ k on@@ to p@@ aper ?
"M@@ a@@ ybe you have experien@@ ced some of those pro@@ per@@ ties before , but I am talking about the physical pro@@ per@@ ties , not the other ones ."
"So when I open the bot@@ tle , the al@@ co@@ ho@@ l mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es would sp@@ read in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ ho@@ l is a very vol@@ at@@ ile sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ ho@@ l is high@@ ly fl@@ am@@ ma@@ ble ."
And it was with those two pro@@ per@@ ties that I was able to create the imag@@ es that you &apos;re seeing right now .
Let me demon@@ st@@ rate this over here .
And what I have here is an emp@@ ty gl@@ as@@ s v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ g@@ en and wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wa@@ it for a few secon@@ ds for the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es to sp@@ read inside the bot@@ tle .
"It goes really f@@ ast , and it &apos;s not that im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"So the imag@@ es that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fl@@ ame st@@ op@@ ped in time while it is tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing through the bot@@ tle , and you have to imagine it was f@@ li@@ pped around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those imag@@ es were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now sho@@ wed you three pro@@ jects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea be@@ h@@ ind it ?
I@@ s it just a was@@ te of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jects , they &apos;re bas@@ ed on very simple scientific ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena , such as mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism , the sound w@@ aves , or over here , the physical pro@@ per@@ ties of a sub@@ st@@ ance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and ther@@ e@@ fore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to p@@ ause for a moment and think about all the be@@ aut@@ y that is con@@ stan@@ tly sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing us ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Now , have any of y &apos;@@ all ever looked up this word ?"
"You know , in a dic@@ tion@@ ary ? ( Laughter ) Y@@ eah , that &apos;s what I thought ."
How about this word ?
"@@ Here , I &apos;ll show it to you ."
L@@ ex@@ ic@@ o@@ graph@@ y : the prac@@ ti@@ ce of comp@@ il@@ ing dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies .
"Now , one of the n@@ on@@ -@@ per@@ ks of being a le@@ x@@ ic@@ o@@ graph@@ er is that people don &apos;t us@@ u@@ ally have a kind of war@@ m , f@@ uz@@ zy , s@@ n@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ly imag@@ e of the dic@@ tion@@ ary ."
"When a guy who looks like that , in that h@@ at , is the face of moder@@ n@@ ity , you have a problem ."
"And O@@ K , what about on@@ line dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies , right ?"
O@@ n@@ line dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies must be different .
"R@@ ight ? Th@@ ose little b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons , I had them all exp@@ and@@ ed ex@@ cept for the da@@ te ch@@ art ."
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of cl@@ ic@@ kin@@ ess .
"And in fact , on@@ line dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies re@@ plic@@ ate almost all the problems of prin@@ t , ex@@ cept for se@@ arch@@ ability ."
We have a p@@ an that &apos;s too small !
Why are you bl@@ am@@ ing the h@@ am for being too big for the p@@ an ?
"@@ How can this be ? I mean , I love bo@@ o@@ ks . I really love bo@@ o@@ ks ."
S@@ ome of my best friends are bo@@ o@@ ks .
But the book is not the best shap@@ e for the dic@@ tion@@ ary .
"Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; &quot; O@@ h , bo@@ y ."
"P@@ eople are going to take away my beautiful , p@@ aper dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; No . There will still be p@@ aper dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies ."
"When we had c@@ ars — when c@@ ars bec@@ ame the domin@@ ant mo@@ de of trans@@ port@@ ation , we didn &apos;t ro@@ und up all the hor@@ ses and sho@@ ot them ."
"You know , there &apos;re still going to be p@@ aper dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies , but it &apos;s not going to be the domin@@ ant dic@@ tion@@ ary ."
The bo@@ o@@ k@@ -@@ shap@@ ed dic@@ tion@@ ary is not going to be the only shap@@ e dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies come in . And it &apos;s not going to be the pro@@ tot@@ yp@@ e for the shap@@ es dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies come in .
"So , think about it this way : if you &apos;ve got an ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial con@@ stra@@ in@@ t , ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts le@@ ad to ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tions and a sk@@ e@@ wed wor@@ ld@@ view ."
"We &apos;d know a whole lot about char@@ is@@ ma@@ tic me@@ ga@@ fa@@ un@@ a , and not very much about much else ."
And I think this is a problem .
"I think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful ex@@ pres@@ sions from very hum@@ ble parts ."
L@@ ex@@ ic@@ o@@ graph@@ y is really more about material science .
"We are stud@@ ying the t@@ ol@@ er@@ an@@ ces of the mater@@ i@@ als that you use to build the structure of your ex@@ pres@@ sion : your spe@@ e@@ ch@@ es and your writ@@ ing . And then , often people say to me , &quot; Well , O@@ K , how do I know that this word is real ? &quot;"
"If you love a word , use it . That makes it real ."
B@@ e@@ ing in the dic@@ tion@@ ary is an ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion .
"So if we &apos;re not wor@@ r@@ ying about direc@@ ting tra@@ f@@ fic , if we &apos;ve trans@@ cen@@ ded p@@ aper , if we are wor@@ r@@ ying less about control and more about descri@@ p@@ tion , then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mo@@ bil@@ e ."
"You didn &apos;t bre@@ ak it . It &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful ."
"But if your go@@ al is no longer to direc@@ t the tra@@ f@@ fic , but maybe to coun@@ t the c@@ ars that go by , then more ey@@ eb@@ all@@ s are better ."
You can ask for help !
"If you ask for help , you get more done . And we really need help ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ g@@ ress : 1@@ 7 million bo@@ o@@ ks , of which half are in English ."
"@@ N@@ e@@ w@@ sp@@ aper arch@@ ive goes back to 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 , 5@@ 8@@ .@@ 1 million ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper p@@ ages . If only one in 100 of those p@@ ages had an un@@ -@@ dic@@ tion@@ ari@@ ed word on it , it would be an enti@@ re other O@@ E@@ D ."
"That &apos;s 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot ."
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
"S@@ e@@ e , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a vis@@ ual ex@@ plan@@ ation ."
"If we think of the dic@@ tion@@ ary as being the map of the English language , these b@@ right spo@@ ts are what we know about , and the dark spo@@ ts are where we are in the dark ."
"If that was the map of all the words in American English , we don &apos;t know very much ."
We &apos;re mis@@ sing C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia from American English .
"We just don &apos;t know enough , and we don &apos;t even know that we &apos;re mis@@ sing C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
"But even if it were , roc@@ k@@ et science is being done by de@@ dic@@ ated ama@@ te@@ urs these days . You know ?"
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a direc@@ tor of an elec@@ tro@@ pl@@ ating compan@@ y .
He &apos;s found more than 1@@ 40 co@@ me@@ ts .
"He do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed data from the N@@ A@@ S@@ A S@@ O@@ H@@ O sa@@ tel@@ lit@@ e , and that &apos;s how he found them ."
"If we can find co@@ me@@ ts without a tel@@ esc@@ ope , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t we be able to find words ?"
"Now , y &apos;@@ all know where I &apos;m going with this ."
"Because I &apos;m going to the In@@ tern@@ et , which is where everybody goes ."
Wh@@ ere did it come from ? Wh@@ o said it ?
What ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological ar@@ ti@@ fact .
It dies too f@@ ast .
"So , this whole time I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; The dic@@ tion@@ ary , the dic@@ tion@@ ary , the dic@@ tion@@ ary , the dic@@ tion@@ ary . &quot;"
"But the thing is , we could make the dic@@ tion@@ ary the whole language ."
"If we get a big@@ ger p@@ an , then we can put all the words in ."
We can put in all the mean@@ ings .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t everyone want more mean@@ ing in their lives ?
And we can make the dic@@ tion@@ ary not just be a sym@@ bo@@ l of the language — we can make it be the whole language .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
G@@ ood even@@ ing .
"You see , I &apos;m one of the 8@@ 4 million Americ@@ ans who are im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts or children of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts ."
"E@@ ach of us has a dre@@ am when we come here , a dre@@ am that us@@ u@@ ally has to be re@@ writ@@ ten and always has to be re@@ pur@@ posed ."
I was one of the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ones .
"But I don &apos;t want you to think it was a c@@ ak@@ e@@ wal@@ k , that America op@@ en@@ ed its ar@@ ms w@@ ide and wel@@ com@@ ed me ."
It &apos;s still not doing that .
I came because I wanted to study English liter@@ ature .
"You see , as a child , I bur@@ i@@ ed my no@@ se in bo@@ o@@ ks , and I thought , why not make a living doing that as an ad@@ ult ?"
Ma@@ ybe it was the op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m that I had about America that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change .
"The do@@ or that I thought was open was actually just s@@ ligh@@ tly a@@ j@@ ar — this do@@ or of America that would open w@@ ide if you had the right name , the right sk@@ in c@@ olo@@ r , the right n@@ et@@ works , but could just sl@@ am in your face if you had the wrong relig@@ ion , the wrong im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion stat@@ us , the wrong sk@@ in c@@ olo@@ r ."
And I just couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept that .
"So I started a career as a social ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur , starting an organiz@@ ation for young people like my@@ self — I was young at the time that I started it — who tra@@ ced their her@@ it@@ age to the In@@ dian sub@@ contin@@ ent ."
"In that work , I bec@@ ame and adv@@ oc@@ ate for S@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ ans and other im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts ."
I lob@@ bi@@ ed mem@@ bers of Con@@ g@@ ress on pol@@ ic@@ y issu@@ es .
I vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed on elec@@ tion day to do ex@@ it pol@@ ling .
"But I couldn &apos;t v@@ ot@@ e , and I couldn &apos;t run for off@@ ice ."
"So in 2@@ 000 , when it was an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that the c@@ it@@ iz@@ en@@ ship ap@@ plic@@ ation fe@@ e was going to more than d@@ ou@@ ble from 9@@ 5 dollars to 2@@ 25 dollars , I decided it was time to app@@ ly before I could no longer af@@ for@@ d it ."
"I fil@@ led out a long ap@@ plic@@ ation , ans@@ wer@@ ing questions about my curr@@ ent and my past af@@ fil@@ i@@ ations ."
You might call it extre@@ me v@@ etting .
"And then in D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber of 2@@ 000 , I jo@@ ined hund@@ re@@ ds of other im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts in a h@@ all in B@@ ro@@ o@@ kl@@ y@@ n where we pl@@ ed@@ g@@ ed our lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to a country that we had long consid@@ er@@ ed home ."
T@@ w@@ o things happened as we c@@ op@@ ed with lo@@ ss and rec@@ over@@ y in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
V@@ ot@@ ers elec@@ ted M@@ i@@ cha@@ el B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g ma@@ yo@@ r of New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
We also ad@@ op@@ ted by bal@@ lot re@@ fer@@ end@@ um the O@@ f@@ f@@ ice of I@@ m@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant A@@ f@@ fa@@ ir@@ s for the C@@ ity of New Y@@ or@@ k .
"F@@ ive months after that elec@@ tion , the ne@@ w@@ ly elec@@ ted ma@@ yo@@ r ap@@ poin@@ ted me the first C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ er of I@@ m@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant A@@ f@@ fa@@ ir@@ s for this ne@@ w@@ ly est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed off@@ ice ."
I want you to come back to that time .
I was a young im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant woman from B@@ eli@@ ze .
I had basically fl@@ oun@@ der@@ ed in vari@@ ous j@@ obs in America before I started a commun@@ it@@ y-@@ bas@@ ed organiz@@ ation in a ch@@ ur@@ ch bas@@ ement in Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens .
The att@@ ac@@ ks of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 11 s@@ ent sh@@ oc@@ k w@@ aves through my commun@@ ity .
No job fel@@ t more per@@ fect for me .
And here are two things I learned when I bec@@ ame C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ er .
"And most of us , when we see someone in un@@ i@@ form going through our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods feel cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , if not con@@ cer@@ n ."
"Because a ra@@ id at your work@@ place , a chan@@ ce en@@ coun@@ ter with loc@@ al pol@@ ice could change the course of your life for@@ ever ."
P@@ eople in my family were experien@@ cing it .
What I learned in 200@@ 1 was that my v@@ ot@@ e mat@@ ter@@ ed but that my vo@@ ice and v@@ ant@@ age point also mat@@ ter@@ ed .
"And it &apos;s these three things — im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts &apos; v@@ ot@@ es , vo@@ ices and v@@ ant@@ age poin@@ ts — that I think can help make our democra@@ cy st@@ ron@@ ger ."
"We actually have the power to change the ou@@ t@@ come of elec@@ tions , to in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e new issu@@ es into the pol@@ ic@@ y deb@@ ate and to change the face of the p@@ ale , mal@@ e , st@@ ale lead@@ er@@ ship that we have in our country today ."
"Well , let &apos;s talk first about v@@ ot@@ es ."
It will come as no sur@@ pr@@ ise to you that the maj@@ or@@ ity of v@@ ot@@ ers in America are white .
"But it might sur@@ pr@@ ise you to know that one in three v@@ ot@@ ers are black , L@@ at@@ ino or A@@ si@@ an ."
"So in 20@@ 12 , half of the L@@ at@@ ino and A@@ si@@ an@@ -@@ American v@@ ot@@ ers did not v@@ ot@@ e ."
And these v@@ ot@@ es matter not just in pres@@ id@@ enti@@ al elec@@ tions .
They matter in loc@@ al and state elec@@ tions .
"In 20@@ 15 , L@@ an D@@ i@@ ep , the el@@ d@@ est son of political re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es from V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am , ra@@ n for a se@@ at in the S@@ an J@@ ose C@@ ity C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l ."
He lo@@ st that elec@@ tion by 1@@ 3 v@@ ot@@ es .
"This year , he d@@ ust@@ ed off those cam@@ pa@@ ign sho@@ es and went back to run for that se@@ at , and this time he won , by 12 v@@ ot@@ es ."
E@@ very one of our v@@ ot@@ es mat@@ ters .
"And when people like L@@ an are sit@@ ting at the pol@@ ic@@ y table , they can make a difference ."
in part because American lead@@ er@@ ship does not look like America &apos;s res@@ id@@ ents .
"There are over 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 loc@@ al and state of@@ fic@@ es in America ."
"F@@ e@@ wer than 2 percent of those of@@ fic@@ es are hel@@ d by A@@ si@@ an@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans or L@@ at@@ in@@ os , the two larg@@ est im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant gro@@ ups in our country ."
"In the c@@ ity of Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , where 4@@ 9 percent of the population is L@@ at@@ ino , there has never been a L@@ at@@ ino on the c@@ ity coun@@ ci@@ l until this year ."
Th@@ ree ne@@ w@@ ly elec@@ ted L@@ at@@ in@@ as jo@@ ined the Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a C@@ ity C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l in 20@@ 1@@ 6 .
One of them is C@@ ar@@ men M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z .
She is a fir@@ st@@ -@@ gener@@ ation college stud@@ ent .
"She gre@@ w up par@@ tly in C@@ oli@@ ma , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , and par@@ tly in Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a , W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton ."
"She &apos;s a single mother , a commun@@ ity adv@@ oc@@ ate ."
H@@ er vo@@ ice on the Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a C@@ ity C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l is adv@@ oc@@ ating on be@@ half of the L@@ at@@ ino commun@@ ity and of all Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a res@@ id@@ ents .
And she &apos;s a ro@@ le mo@@ del for her dau@@ ghter and other L@@ at@@ in@@ as .
But the third most un@@ t@@ app@@ ed resour@@ ce in American democra@@ cy is the v@@ ant@@ age point that im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts bring .
We have f@@ ou@@ ght to be here .
We have come for economic and educ@@ ational opportun@@ ity .
We have come for political and relig@@ ious fre@@ ed@@ om .
We have come in the pur@@ su@@ it of love .
"That de@@ dic@@ ation , that com@@ mit@@ ment to America we also bring to public ser@@ vic@@ e ."
"P@@ eople like A@@ th@@ ena S@@ al@@ man , who just last week won the pri@@ mar@@ y for a se@@ at in the A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a St@@ ate H@@ ou@@ se ."
To@@ gether they mov@@ ed to A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a and built a life .
It &apos;s not just my work . It &apos;s also your@@ s .
And it &apos;s not going to be easy .
We never know what put@@ ting a new fac@@ tor into an equ@@ ation will do .
And it &apos;s a little sc@@ ary .
"You &apos;re sc@@ ar@@ ed that I &apos;m going to take away your place at the table , and I &apos;m sc@@ ar@@ ed that I &apos;m never going to get a place at the table ."
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok , it &apos;s been a rou@@ gh elec@@ tion year , a re@@ min@@ der that people with my im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion history could be re@@ mov@@ ed at the wh@@ im of a lead@@ er ."
But I have f@@ ou@@ ght to be in this country and I contin@@ ue to do so every day .
"So my op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m never w@@ av@@ ers , because I know that there are mil@@ lions of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts just like me , in front of me , be@@ h@@ ind me and all around me ."
"It &apos;s our country , too ."
Thank you .

"O@@ n@@ ce u@@ po@@ n a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a stud@@ ent at St@@ . J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore ."
I was a gu@@ est stud@@ ent d@@ uring one mon@@ th of a public health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set for@@ ever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course cont@@ ent in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the br@@ ut@@ al real@@ iz@@ ation , the first mor@@ ning , that the In@@ dian students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I lo@@ ved stat@@ is@@ tics from a young age .
And I stu@@ died very much in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en .
I used to be in the up@@ per qu@@ ar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I at@@ ten@@ ded .
"But in St@@ . J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s , I was in the lower qu@@ ar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that In@@ dian students stu@@ died har@@ der than we did in S@@ w@@ ed@@ en .
"They read the t@@ ext@@ book tw@@ ice , or three times or four times ."
I@@ n S@@ w@@ ed@@ en we read it once and then we went par@@ t@@ ying .
"( Lau@@ gh@@ er ) And that , to me , that person@@ al experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was changed ."
And I real@@ ized that perhaps the W@@ es@@ tern world will not contin@@ ue to domin@@ ate the world for@@ ever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of person@@ al experience .
It &apos;s that real@@ iz@@ ation of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the stat@@ is@@ tics , al@@ though I tri@@ ed to make it fun@@ n@@ y ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ stage , try to predic@@ t when that will happen — that A@@ sia will re@@ ga@@ in its domin@@ ant position as the lead@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predic@@ t prec@@ is@@ ely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will re@@ ach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econom@@ y , because to grow an econom@@ y of India to the size of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of c@@ ake , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average pa@@ y , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have re@@ ach@@ ed that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a hist@@ or@@ ical bac@@ k@@ ground .
And you can see my map if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 18@@ 5@@ 8 .
18@@ 5@@ 8 was a year of great technolo@@ g@@ ical adv@@ an@@ c@@ ement in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ u@@ e@@ en V@@ ic@@ t@@ oria was able , for the first time , to commun@@ ic@@ ate with P@@ res@@ id@@ ent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ ran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Tel@@ e@@ graph@@ ic C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &quot; &quot; tr@@ an@@ sat@@ lan@@ tically .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful G@@ o@@ o@@ gle and In@@ tern@@ et , to find the t@@ ex@@ t of the tel@@ eg@@ ram s@@ ent back from P@@ res@@ id@@ ent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ u@@ e@@ en V@@ ic@@ t@@ oria ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This tel@@ e@@ gra@@ p@@ h is a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic in@@ str@@ um@@ ent to dif@@ f@@ use relig@@ ion , civiliz@@ ation , li@@ b@@ ert@@ y and la@@ w throu@@ gh@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are n@@ ice words . But I got sort of cur@@ ious of what he me@@ ant with li@@ b@@ ert@@ y , and li@@ b@@ ert@@ y for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the w@@ id@@ er picture of the world in 18@@ 5@@ 8 .
Because 18@@ 5@@ 8 was also wat@@ er@@ shed year in the history of A@@ sia .
18@@ 5@@ 8 was the year when the cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous u@@ pris@@ ing against the for@@ e@@ ign oc@@ c@@ up@@ ation of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the Brit@@ ish for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation .
18@@ 5@@ 8 in China was the vic@@ t@@ ory in the O@@ pi@@ um W@@ ar by the Brit@@ ish for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that for@@ e@@ ign@@ ers , as it said in the treat@@ y , were al@@ lowed to tra@@ de fre@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant pa@@ ying with op@@ i@@ um for Ch@@ in@@ ese go@@ ods .
And 18@@ 5@@ 8 in Jap@@ an was the year when Jap@@ an had to si@@ g@@ n the H@@ ar@@ ris T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tra@@ de on fav@@ o@@ ra@@ ble con@@ d@@ ition for the U.@@ S@@ .
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in To@@ k@@ y@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Jap@@ an , in con@@ tra@@ st to India and China , main@@ ta@@ ined its national s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by br@@ ing@@ ing these b@@ ub@@ bl@@ es back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der gra@@ p@@ h here , where you can see each b@@ ub@@ ble is a country ."
The size of the b@@ ub@@ ble here is the population .
"O@@ n this ax@@ is , as I used to have income per person in com@@ par@@ able doll@@ ar ."
"And on that ax@@ is I have life expec@@ tan@@ cy , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ no@@ v@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ form@@ ed the las@@ er be@@ am into an ec@@ ological , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok here , 18@@ 5@@ 8 , India was here , China was here , Jap@@ an was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was ri@@ ch@@ er over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ or@@ d , there was a time hund@@ re@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even ab@@ ove that of Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation , and India had been de@@ -@@ ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econom@@ y was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting heal@@ thy , and Jap@@ an was starting to cat@@ ch up ."
India was trying down here .
C@@ an you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty was good for Jap@@ an ."
And Jap@@ an is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But care@@ ful now — we are appro@@ ach@@ ing the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .
"And the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ a@@ ths and econom@@ ical problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ pan@@ ish fl@@ u also .
"And then after the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , they contin@@ ue up ."
"S@@ t@@ ill under for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation , and without s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
Not much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Jap@@ an is going to a peri@@ od of war , with lower life expec@@ tan@@ cy ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also econom@@ ically for Jap@@ an ."
But they did rec@@ over quite f@@ ast af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are mov@@ ing into the new world .
I@@ n 19@@ 4@@ 7 India finally ga@@ ined its inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce .
"And they could ra@@ ise the In@@ dian fl@@ a@@ g and become a s@@ over@@ e@@ ign na@@ tion , but in very big diffic@@ ul@@ ties down there ."
( Applause ) I@@ n 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the em@@ er@@ gence of the moder@@ n China in a way which sur@@ pris@@ ed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce ?
You can see that the health started to impro@@ ve .
Ch@@ il@@ dren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th ser@@ vic@@ es were pro@@ vid@@ ed .
"This is the Gre@@ at L@@ e@@ a@@ p F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was cent@@ ral plan@@ ning by Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China rec@@ over@@ ed . Th@@ en they said , &quot; N@@ ever@@ more , st@@ up@@ id cent@@ ral plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were cat@@ ch@@ ing up inde@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econom@@ y ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g died , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was D@@ en@@ g X@@ ia@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is white or black , as long as it cat@@ ch@@ es m@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Because cat@@ ch@@ ing m@@ ice is what the two cat@@ s wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cat@@ s being here , China and India , wan@@ ting to cat@@ ch the m@@ ices over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their econom@@ y ."
And the market re@@ form@@ er was success@@ ful there .
I@@ n &apos; 9@@ 2 India fol@@ lo@@ ws with a market re@@ form .
"And they go quite clo@@ s@@ ely together , and you can see that the si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are gre@@ ater than the differ@@ ences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they cat@@ ch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the aver@@ ages there — this is the average of China .
"If I would s@@ pl@@ it China , look here , S@@ han@@ gh@@ ai has already cat@@ ched up ."
S@@ han@@ gh@@ ai is already there .
And it &apos;s heal@@ th@@ ier than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou , one of the po@@ or@@ est in@@ land pro@@ vin@@ ces of China , is there ."
"And if I s@@ pl@@ it G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and ru@@ ral , the ru@@ ral part of G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ or@@ mo@@ us in@@ equ@@ ity in China , in the mid@@ st of f@@ ast economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another typ@@ e of in@@ equ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ o@@ graph@@ ical , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ graph@@ ical difference is not so big ."
"@@ U@@ t@@ t@@ ar P@@ rad@@ esh , the big@@ gest of the st@@ ates here , is po@@ or@@ er and has a lower health than the rest of India ."
"@@ K@@ er@@ ala is fl@@ ying on top there , mat@@ ch@@ ing United States in health , but not in econom@@ y ."
"And here , Ma@@ har@@ ash@@ t@@ ra , with M@@ um@@ b@@ ai , is for@@ ging for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big in@@ equ@@ ities are within the state , rather than between the st@@ ates ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot in@@ equ@@ ity , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ graph@@ ical in@@ equ@@ ities can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a growth center rel@@ ati@@ vely clo@@ se to where po@@ or people are living ."
"@@ No , there is one more in@@ equ@@ ity . L@@ o@@ ok there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they bro@@ ke my fra@@ me ."
"W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
My friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new lead@@ er in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton who is really con@@ cer@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so r@@ ich over there but they are not as heal@@ thy as K@@ er@@ ala .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a business opportun@@ ity for K@@ er@@ ala , hel@@ ping fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ gen@@ d down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant cat@@ s here , p@@ ush@@ ing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole em@@ er@@ ging economi@@ es of the world , which Th@@ o@@ mas F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ at world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is put@@ ting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and other parts , as in ru@@ ral G@@ u@@ izh@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econom@@ y ."
We have an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us dis@@ par@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are p@@ ush@@ ing for@@ wards very f@@ ast .
"Now , back to my pro@@ jec@@ tions ."
Wh@@ en will it cat@@ ch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ ven@@ tional gra@@ p@@ h .
"I will show income per person on this ax@@ is instead , po@@ or down here , r@@ ich up there ."
"And then time here , from 18@@ 5@@ 8 I start the world ."
And we sh@@ all see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under for@@ e@@ ign domin@@ ation actually low@@ er@@ ed their income and came down to the In@@ dian level here ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting ri@@ ch@@ er and ri@@ ch@@ er .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , United States is ri@@ ch@@ er than U.@@ K@@ ."
But inde@@ pen@@ den@@ ce is coming here .
"@@ G@@ ro@@ w@@ th is starting , economic re@@ form ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ w@@ th is fas@@ ter , and with pro@@ jec@@ tion from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you exp@@ ect them to be in 20@@ 1@@ 4 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the cat@@ ch up take place ? &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok at , look at the United States ."
C@@ an you see the b@@ ub@@ ble ?
"The b@@ ub@@ bl@@ es , not my b@@ ub@@ bl@@ es , but the fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al b@@ ub@@ bl@@ es ."
That &apos;s the dot co@@ m b@@ ub@@ ble . This is the L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ step there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another roc@@ k coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more hum@@ ble growth way , you know ."
And people interes@@ ted in growth are turn@@ ing their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ sia .
I can comp@@ are to Jap@@ an . This is Jap@@ an coming up .
"You see , Jap@@ an did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Jap@@ an to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that f@@ ast cat@@ ch up can take place .
C@@ an you see here what Jap@@ an did ?
"@@ Jap@@ an did it like this , until ful@@ l cat@@ ch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income economi@@ es ."
"But the real pro@@ jec@@ tions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be wor@@ se , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predic@@ t , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a hist@@ or@@ ian tel@@ ls me it &apos;s even more difficult to predic@@ t about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ alit@@ ies in China and India I consid@@ er really the big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le because to bring the enti@@ re population into growth and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity is what will create a dom@@ es@@ tic market , what will av@@ o@@ id social inst@@ ability , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social inv@@ est@@ ments in health , education and in@@ fra@@ structure , and elec@@ tric@@ ity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the cli@@ mate . We have great inter@@ national exp@@ erts within India telling us that the cli@@ mate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise China and India would be the countries most to suf@@ fer from cli@@ mate change ."
And I consid@@ er India and China the best par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the world in a good global cli@@ mate pol@@ ic@@ y .
"But they ain &apos;t going to pa@@ y for what others , who have more money , have larg@@ ely created , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is war .
"W@@ ill the form@@ er r@@ ich countries really ac@@ cept a completely changed world econom@@ y , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 1@@ 50 years , back to A@@ sia ?"
"And will A@@ sia be able to h@@ and@@ le that new position of being in ch@@ arg@@ e of being the most migh@@ ty , and the govern@@ ors of the world ?"
"So , always av@@ o@@ id war , because that always p@@ ush@@ es human be@@ ings bac@@ k@@ ward ."
"Now if these in@@ equ@@ alit@@ ies , cli@@ mate and war can be av@@ o@@ ided , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vis@@ ion that I got as a young stud@@ ent , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that In@@ di@@ ans can be much better than S@@ w@@ ed@@ es , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen prec@@ is@@ ely the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the sum@@ m@@ er , in J@@ ul@@ y , more prec@@ is@@ ely , the 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ ul@@ y ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ ul@@ y , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I exp@@ ect to spe@@ ak in the first s@@ es@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TE@@ D India .
G@@ et your bo@@ o@@ kin@@ gs in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Now , M@@ an@@ dar@@ in Ch@@ in@@ ese is spo@@ ken by more people , but more Ch@@ in@@ ese people are learning English than English speak@@ ers are learning Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
"@@ L@@ ast I heard , there are two do@@ z@@ en univer@@ s@@ ities in China right now teach@@ ing all in English ."
English is taking over .
"And in ad@@ d@@ ition to that , it &apos;s been predic@@ ted that at the end of the century almost all of the langu@@ ages that ex@@ ist now — there are about 6@@ ,000 — will no longer be spo@@ ken ."
There will only be some hund@@ re@@ ds left .
"And that is the idea that a language chan@@ nel@@ s your thou@@ gh@@ ts , that the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary and the g@@ ram@@ ma@@ r of different langu@@ ages giv@@ es everybody a different kind of ac@@ id tri@@ p , so to spe@@ ak ."
So it &apos;s not that it &apos;s un@@ true completely .
"So for example , in F@@ ren@@ ch and S@@ pan@@ ish the word for table is , for some reason , mar@@ ked as f@@ em@@ in@@ ine ."
"So , &quot; &quot; la table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la mes@@ a , &quot; &quot; you just have to de@@ al with it ."
"So if you &apos;re F@@ ren@@ ch or S@@ pan@@ ish , to you , a table is kind of a gir@@ l , as op@@ posed to if you are an English speak@@ er ."
"It &apos;s hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there &apos;s a wor@@ ld@@ view that you have if you spe@@ ak one of those langu@@ ages ."
"But you have to wat@@ ch out , because imagine if somebody put us under the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ ope , the us being those of us who spe@@ ak English na@@ ti@@ vely ."
What is the wor@@ ld@@ view from English ?
"So for example , let &apos;s take an English speak@@ er ."
"@@ U@@ p on the scre@@ en , that is B@@ on@@ o ."
He speak@@ s English .
I pre@@ su@@ me he has a wor@@ ld@@ view .
"Now , that is D@@ on@@ al@@ d Tr@@ um@@ p ."
So here are three speak@@ ers of the English language .
What wor@@ ld@@ view do those three people have in common ?
What wor@@ ld@@ view is shap@@ ed through the English language that un@@ it@@ es them ?
It &apos;s a high@@ ly fra@@ u@@ ght con@@ cept .
"And so grad@@ ual con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is becom@@ ing that language can shap@@ e thought , but it ten@@ ds to be in rather dar@@ ling , ob@@ sc@@ ure psych@@ ological fl@@ ut@@ ters ."
It &apos;s not a matter of giving you a different pa@@ ir of gl@@ as@@ ses on the world .
"Now , if that &apos;s the case , then why learn langu@@ ages ?"
There are some .
"One of them is that if you want to im@@ bi@@ be a culture , if you want to dr@@ ink it in , if you want to become part of it , then whether or not the language chan@@ nel@@ s the culture — and that seems d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ful — if you want to im@@ bi@@ be the culture , you have to control to some de@@ gre@@ e the language that the culture happens to be conduc@@ ted in ."
There &apos;s no other way .
There &apos;s an interesting ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion of this .
"I have to go s@@ ligh@@ tly ob@@ sc@@ ure , but really you should see@@ k it out ."
"H@@ i . So , this cha@@ p here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is name is N@@ o@@ stra@@ dam@@ us , al@@ though here the Su@@ n have made him look a little bit like S@@ e@@ an Con@@ ner@@ y . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in pre@@ co@@ gn@@ ition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predic@@ t something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a flu@@ ke , and we only hear about the fl@@ uk@@ es and about the fre@@ ak@@ s ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we exp@@ ect that to happen with sil@@ ly stories about pre@@ co@@ gn@@ ition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in ac@@ ade@@ mia and in medic@@ ine , and in this environ@@ ment , it co@@ st@@ s lives ."
"So fir@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about pre@@ co@@ gn@@ ition , as it turns out , just last year a rese@@ arch@@ er called D@@ ar@@ y@@ l B@@ e@@ m conduc@@ ted a piece of research where he found evidence of pre@@ co@@ gn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic j@@ our@@ n@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fa@@ ir enough , but I think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a fre@@ ak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate students had pre@@ co@@ gn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a j@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because s@@ ever@@ al different gro@@ ups of research scient@@ ists tri@@ ed to re@@ plic@@ ate the fin@@ din@@ gs of this pre@@ co@@ gn@@ ition study , and when they sub@@ mit@@ ted it to the ex@@ act same j@@ our@@ n@@ al , the j@@ our@@ n@@ al said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interes@@ ted in publi@@ sh@@ ing re@@ plic@@ ation . We &apos;re not interes@@ ted in your ne@@ ga@@ tive data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ as@@ ed sam@@ ple of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conduc@@ ted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the d@@ ry ac@@ ade@@ mic field of psych@@ ology .
"It also happens in , for example , cancer research ."
"So in M@@ arch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some rese@@ arch@@ ers re@@ port@@ ed in the j@@ our@@ n@@ al N@@ ature how they had tri@@ ed to re@@ plic@@ ate 5@@ 3 different bas@@ ic science studies looking at po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al treat@@ ment t@@ arg@@ ets in cancer , and out of those 5@@ 3 studies , they were only able to success@@ fully re@@ plic@@ ate six ."
F@@ or@@ t@@ y-@@ seven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ re@@ plic@@ able .
And they say in their disc@@ us@@ sion that this is very likely because fre@@ ak@@ s get published .
"P@@ eople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the oc@@ cas@@ ions when it works they will pub@@ l@@ ish , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tion of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down bl@@ ind al@@ le@@ ys , their first re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tion of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it eas@@ ier to pub@@ l@@ ish ne@@ ga@@ tive results in science , and to change the in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves so that scient@@ ists are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to pos@@ t more of their ne@@ ga@@ tive results in public ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very d@@ ry world of pre@@ cl@@ in@@ ical bas@@ ic science cancer research .
"It also happens in the very real , fl@@ esh and blo@@ od of ac@@ ade@@ mic medic@@ ine . So in 19@@ 80 , some rese@@ arch@@ ers did a study on a dru@@ g called l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide , and this was an an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ g , a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart att@@ ack , they &apos;re quite likely to have ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them surviv@@ ing ."
"E@@ arly on its develop@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ if@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide , and of those patients , 10 died ."
"A@@ no@@ ther 50 patients got a d@@ um@@ my plac@@ eb@@ o su@@ ga@@ r p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them died ."
"So they ri@@ gh@@ tly re@@ gar@@ ded this dru@@ g as a fa@@ il@@ ure , and its com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , and because its com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other compan@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Th@@ ese dru@@ gs were b@@ rou@@ ght to market . They were pres@@ cri@@ bed very w@@ id@@ ely because heart att@@ ac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also ca@@ used an increas@@ ed rate of death that before we det@@ ec@@ ted that saf@@ ety sign@@ al , over 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people died un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily in America from the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the rese@@ arch@@ ers who did that 19@@ 80 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ p@@ a , an apo@@ lo@@ gy to the scientific commun@@ ity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ri@@ ed out our study in 19@@ 80 , we thought that the increas@@ ed death rate that oc@@ cur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide group was an ef@@ fect of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develop@@ ment of l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ ide was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed for com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as ."
"That &apos;s the te@@ chn@@ ical ter@@ m for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on where un@@ fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing data gets lo@@ st , gets un@@ published , is left mis@@ sing in action , and they say the results descri@@ bed here &quot; might have pro@@ vid@@ ed an early war@@ ning of tro@@ ub@@ le a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from bas@@ ic science .
"Th@@ ese are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The ac@@ ade@@ mic publi@@ sh@@ ing environ@@ ment is very different now .
"There are ac@@ ade@@ mic j@@ our@@ n@@ als like &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the open acc@@ ess j@@ our@@ n@@ al , which will pub@@ l@@ ish any tri@@ al conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a pos@@ itive or a ne@@ ga@@ tive res@@ ult ."
But this problem of ne@@ ga@@ tive results that go mis@@ sing in action is still very pre@@ val@@ ent . I@@ n fact it &apos;s so pre@@ val@@ ent that it c@@ ut@@ s to the cor@@ e of ev@@ id@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ bas@@ ed medic@@ ine .
"So this is a dru@@ g called reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , and this is a dru@@ g that I my@@ self have pres@@ cri@@ bed . It &apos;s an an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ d@@ y doc@@ tor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this dru@@ g . I read the one study that was published that sho@@ wed that reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was better than plac@@ eb@@ o , and I read the other three studies that were published that sho@@ wed that reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was just as good as any other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant , and because this pati@@ ent h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done well on those other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts , I thought , well , reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was mis@@ led . I@@ n fact , seven tri@@ als were conduc@@ ted com@@ par@@ ing reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine against a d@@ um@@ my plac@@ eb@@ o su@@ ga@@ r p@@ ill . One of them was pos@@ itive and that was published , but six of them were ne@@ ga@@ tive and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree tri@@ als were published com@@ par@@ ing reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine against other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts in which reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was col@@ lec@@ ted which sho@@ wed that reb@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was wor@@ se than those other treat@@ ments , and those tri@@ als were not published ."
I fel@@ t mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ m@@ ely un@@ us@@ ual example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of cher@@ r@@ y-@@ pic@@ king and sel@@ ec@@ tive re@@ fer@@ en@@ cing that I &apos;m acc@@ using other people of ."
"But it turns out that this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as has actually been very , very well stu@@ died ."
So here is one example of how you appro@@ ach it .
"The clas@@ si@@ c mo@@ del is , you get a bun@@ ch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conduc@@ ted and complet@@ ed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature . So this took all of the tri@@ als that had ever been conduc@@ ted on an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year peri@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the tri@@ als which were sub@@ mit@@ ted to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ v@@ al p@@ ac@@ k@@ age .
"So that &apos;s not all of the tri@@ als that were ever conduc@@ ted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conduc@@ ted in order to get the mar@@ ket@@ ing au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ation ."
And then they went to see if these tri@@ als had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0-@@ 50 s@@ pl@@ it . H@@ al@@ f of these tri@@ als were pos@@ itive , half of them were ne@@ ga@@ tive , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these tri@@ als in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"O@@ n@@ ly three of the ne@@ ga@@ tive tri@@ als were published , but all but one of the pos@@ itive tri@@ als were published ."
"Now if we just fl@@ ic@@ k back and for@@ th between those two , you can see what a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing difference there was between reality and what doc@@ tors , patients , com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ers of health ser@@ vic@@ es , and ac@@ ade@@ m@@ ics were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ ade@@ mic liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic fl@@ a@@ w in the cor@@ e of medic@@ ine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conduc@@ ted on pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been col@@ lec@@ ted in a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as that they could find ."
P@@ ub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation bi@@ as af@@ fec@@ ts every field of medic@@ ine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all tri@@ als , on average , go mis@@ sing in action , and we know that pos@@ itive fin@@ din@@ gs are around tw@@ ice as likely to be published as ne@@ ga@@ tive fin@@ din@@ gs ."
This is a cancer at the cor@@ e of ev@@ id@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ bas@@ ed medic@@ ine .
"If I f@@ li@@ pped a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the results from you from half of those to@@ s@@ ses , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up head@@ s ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a tw@@ o@@ -@@ head@@ ed co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ cer and you were an id@@ iot for l@@ etting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we bl@@ ind@@ ly t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of ev@@ id@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ bas@@ ed medic@@ ine .
"And to me , this is research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"If I conduc@@ ted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data poin@@ ts from that one study , you would ri@@ gh@@ tly acc@@ use me , essenti@@ ally , of research fra@@ u@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 studies but only publi@@ sh@@ es the five that give the res@@ ult that they want , we don &apos;t consid@@ er that to be research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"And when that respon@@ si@@ bility is dif@@ f@@ used between a whole n@@ et@@ work of rese@@ arch@@ ers , ac@@ ade@@ m@@ ics , ind@@ u@@ str@@ y s@@ pon@@ s@@ ors , j@@ our@@ n@@ al ed@@ it@@ ors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ table , but the ef@@ fect on patients is dam@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a dru@@ g called T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u . T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u is a dru@@ g which govern@@ ments around the world have sp@@ ent bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars on st@@ oc@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve st@@ oc@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ed T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u in pan@@ ic , in the beli@@ ef that it will reduc@@ e the rate of compl@@ ic@@ ations of in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a ."
"C@@ om@@ plic@@ ations is a me@@ d@@ ical e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism for p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ o@@ ch@@ ran@@ e sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to coll@@ ect together all of the data from all of the tri@@ als that had ever been conduc@@ ted on whether T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u actually did this or not , they found that s@@ ever@@ al of those tri@@ als were un@@ published ."
The results were un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to them .
"And when they started ob@@ ta@@ ining the writ@@ e@@ ups of those tri@@ als through vari@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ ed@@ om of In@@ forma@@ tion A@@ c@@ t re@@ ques@@ ts , through h@@ aras@@ sing vari@@ ous different organiz@@ ations , what they found was in@@ con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent ."
"And when they tri@@ ed to get a hold of the cl@@ in@@ ical study re@@ por@@ ts , the 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ p@@ age long doc@@ um@@ ents that have the best possible ren@@ d@@ ition of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t al@@ lowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the ful@@ l cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ce and the exc@@ uses and the ex@@ plan@@ ations given by the dru@@ g compan@@ y , you can see that writ@@ ten up in this week &apos;s ed@@ ition of P@@ L@@ O@@ S M@@ ed@@ ic@@ ine ."
"And the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we reco@@ gni@@ ze that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suf@@ fer f@@ ake fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pret@@ end that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , we had tri@@ als re@@ g@@ is@@ ters , and everybody said , oh , it &apos;s o@@ kay . We &apos;ll get everyone to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter their tri@@ als , they &apos;ll pos@@ t the pro@@ to@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to ch@@ ec@@ k and see if all the tri@@ als which have been conduc@@ ted and complet@@ ed have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t b@@ other to use those re@@ g@@ is@@ ters .
"And so then the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ om@@ mit@@ te@@ e of M@@ ed@@ ical J@@ our@@ n@@ al E@@ dit@@ ors came along , and they said , oh , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t pub@@ l@@ ish any j@@ our@@ n@@ als , we won &apos;t pub@@ l@@ ish any tri@@ als , un@@ less they &apos;ve been re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed before they be@@ gan ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . I@@ n 200@@ 8 , a study was conduc@@ ted which sho@@ wed that half of all of tri@@ als published by j@@ our@@ n@@ als ed@@ ited by mem@@ bers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t pro@@ per@@ ly re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed , and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed at all ."
"And then finally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ c@@ t was pas@@ sed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must pos@@ t the results of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first ed@@ ition of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people ke@@ pt to that rul@@ ing , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a disa@@ st@@ er .
We cannot know the true effec@@ ts of the medic@@ ines that we pres@@ cri@@ be if we do not have acc@@ ess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to pub@@ l@@ ish all tri@@ als conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans , incl@@ ud@@ ing the ol@@ der tri@@ als , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ c@@ t only as@@ ks that you pub@@ l@@ ish the tri@@ als conduc@@ ted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only prac@@ tic@@ ing medic@@ ine on the bas@@ is of tri@@ als that complet@@ ed in the past two years ."
"We need to pub@@ l@@ ish all tri@@ als in hum@@ ans , incl@@ ud@@ ing the ol@@ der tri@@ als , for all dru@@ gs in curr@@ ent use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ ul@@ l the k@@ not .
"One is that I &apos;m always on time , and I &apos;m not ."
"I have four small children , and I would like to bl@@ ame them for my oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ al t@@ ar@@ din@@ ess , but sometimes it &apos;s just not their fa@@ ult ."
The second thing they as@@ su@@ me is that I have lots of ti@@ ps and tric@@ ks for sav@@ ing b@@ its of time here and there .
"S@@ ome@@ times I &apos;ll hear from ma@@ gaz@@ ines that are doing a story along these lin@@ es , gener@@ ally on how to help their read@@ ers find an extra h@@ our in the day ."
You know another way to find 3@@ 2 minutes to ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ?
"D@@ on &apos;t wat@@ ch two hours of T@@ V a day , right ?"
"( Laughter ) An@@ y@@ way , the idea is we &apos;ll sa@@ ve b@@ its of time here and there , ad@@ d it up , we will finally get to everything we want to do ."
We don &apos;t build the lives we want by sav@@ ing time .
"We build the lives we want , and then time sa@@ ves itself ."
Here &apos;s what I mean .
"If you &apos;ve ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a hu@@ g@@ ely da@@ mag@@ ing , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , so@@ p@@ ping m@@ ess ."
All this is being rec@@ or@@ ded on her time lo@@ g .
W@@ in@@ ds up taking seven hours of her week .
S@@ even hours .
That &apos;s like fin@@ ding an extra h@@ our in the day .
&quot; C@@ ould you find seven hours to m@@ ent@@ or seven wor@@ thy people ? &quot;
And what this sho@@ ws us is that time is high@@ ly el@@ as@@ tic .
"We cannot make more time , but time will stre@@ t@@ ch to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ te what we cho@@ ose to put into it ."
And so the k@@ ey to time man@@ ag@@ ement is tre@@ ating our pri@@ or@@ ities as the equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of that bro@@ ken water he@@ ater .
"I remember it was a Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day mor@@ ning , and she was not av@@ a@@ il@@ able to spe@@ ak with me ."
"O@@ f course , right ?"
"But the reason she was un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to spe@@ ak with me is that she was out for a h@@ ik@@ e , because it was a beautiful sp@@ r@@ ing mor@@ ning , and she wanted to go for a h@@ ik@@ e ."
"So of course this makes me even more in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed , and when I finally do cat@@ ch up with her , she expla@@ ins it like this ."
"And gr@@ an@@ ted , there may be hor@@ ri@@ ble con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences for making different cho@@ ices , I will give you that ."
So how do we do that ?
"Well , first we need to figure out what they are ."
I want to give you two stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es for thinking about this .
"The first , on the profes@@ sion@@ al side : I &apos;m sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting an@@ n@@ ual per@@ for@@ man@@ ce re@@ vie@@ ws ."
"You look back over your success@@ es over the year , your &quot; &quot; opportun@@ ities for growth . &quot; &quot; And this ser@@ ves its pur@@ pose , but I find it &apos;s more effec@@ tive to do this looking for@@ ward ."
"You &apos;re giving yourself a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce re@@ view , and it has been an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely amazing year for you profes@@ sion@@ ally ."
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing ?
So you can write next year &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce re@@ view now .
"And you can do this for your person@@ al life , too ."
"I &apos;m sure many of you , like me , come D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber , get car@@ ds that con@@ tain these fol@@ ded up she@@ ets of col@@ ored p@@ aper , on which is writ@@ ten what is known as the family ho@@ li@@ day l@@ et@@ ter ."
"But these l@@ et@@ ters ser@@ ve a pur@@ pose , which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your person@@ al life that mat@@ ter@@ ed to you over the year ."
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing ?
So you can write next year &apos;s family ho@@ li@@ day l@@ et@@ ter now .
D@@ on &apos;t sen@@ d it .
"( Laughter ) P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t sen@@ d it ."
But you can write it .
"And now , between the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce re@@ view and the family ho@@ li@@ day l@@ et@@ ter , we have a l@@ ist of six to ten go@@ als we can work on in the next year ."
And now we need to bre@@ ak these down into do@@ able ste@@ ps .
So maybe you want to write a family history .
O@@ r maybe you want to run a 5@@ K .
We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them .
I find a really good time to do this is F@@ ri@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ ons .
F@@ ri@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on is what an econom@@ ist might call a &quot; &quot; low opportun@@ ity cost &quot; &quot; time .
M@@ ak@@ ing a thre@@ e-@@ cat@@ eg@@ ory l@@ ist re@@ min@@ ds us that there should be something in all three cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies .
"C@@ are@@ er , we think about ; relation@@ shi@@ ps , self — not so much ."
"Th@@ en look out over the whole of the next week , and see where you can pl@@ an them in ."
Wh@@ ere you pl@@ an them in is up to you .
I know this is going to be more compl@@ ic@@ ated for some people than others .
"I mean , some people &apos;s lives are just har@@ der than others ."
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that po@@ et@@ ry class if you are car@@ ing for mul@@ ti@@ ple children on your own .
I get that .
And I don &apos;t want to min@@ imi@@ ze any@@ one &apos;s st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle .
But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are em@@ power@@ ing .
There are 1@@ 6@@ 8 hours in a week .
T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ four times seven is 1@@ 6@@ 8 hours .
That is a lot of time .
"If you are working a ful@@ l-@@ time job , so 40 hours a week , s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing eight hours a night , so 5@@ 6 hours a week — that le@@ aves 7@@ 2 hours for other things ."
That is a lot of time .
"You say you &apos;re working 50 hours a week , maybe a ma@@ in job and a side hu@@ st@@ le ."
"Well , that le@@ aves 6@@ 2 hours for other things ."
You say you &apos;re working 60 hours .
"Well , that le@@ aves 5@@ 2 hours for other things ."
You say you &apos;re working more than 60 hours .
"Well , are you sure ?"
( Laughter ) There was once a study com@@ par@@ ing people &apos;s es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed work weeks with time di@@ ar@@ ies .
And that &apos;s even if you &apos;re working way more than ful@@ l-@@ time hours .
We don &apos;t even need that much time to do amazing things .
"But when most of us have b@@ its of time , what do we do ?"
"P@@ ul@@ l out the ph@@ one , right ?"
St@@ art del@@ et@@ ing e@@ ma@@ ils .
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , we &apos;re put@@ ter@@ ing around the h@@ ou@@ se or wat@@ ch@@ ing T@@ V ."
But small mo@@ ments can have great power .
You can use your b@@ its of time for b@@ its of jo@@ y .
Ma@@ ybe it &apos;s cho@@ os@@ ing to read something wonderful on the b@@ us on the way to work .
B@@ re@@ ak@@ s at work can be used for me@@ dit@@ ating or pra@@ ying .
"If family din@@ ner is out because of your crazy work s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ e , maybe family bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast could be a good sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute ."
It &apos;s about looking at the whole of one &apos;s time and seeing where the good stuff can go .
I tr@@ ul@@ y believe this .
There is time .
"E@@ ven if we are bus@@ y , we have time for what mat@@ ters ."
"And when we foc@@ us on what mat@@ ters , we can build the lives we want in the time we &apos;ve got ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have a question : Wh@@ o here remem@@ bers when they first real@@ ized they were going to die ?
"I do . I was a young bo@@ y , and my grand@@ father had just died , and I remember a few days later l@@ ying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened ."
What did it mean that he was de@@ ad ?
Wh@@ ere had he gone ?
It was like a hole in reality had op@@ en@@ ed up and s@@ wal@@ lowed him .
"But then the really sh@@ oc@@ king question oc@@ cur@@ red to me : If he could die , could it happen to me too ?"
C@@ ould that hole in reality open up and s@@ wal@@ low me ?
W@@ ould it open up ben@@ e@@ ath my bed and s@@ wal@@ low me as I s@@ le@@ pt ?
"Well , at some point , all children become aw@@ are of death ."
"It can happen in different ways , of course , and us@@ u@@ ally comes in st@@ ages ."
O@@ ur idea of death develop@@ s as we grow ol@@ der .
"And if you re@@ ach back into the dark cor@@ n@@ ers of your me@@ mor@@ y , you might remember something like what I fel@@ t when my grand@@ father died and when I real@@ ized it could happen to me too , that sense that be@@ h@@ ind all of this the vo@@ id is wa@@ iting ."
And this develop@@ ment in chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ts the develop@@ ment of our spec@@ ies .
"@@ Just as there was a point in your develop@@ ment as a child when your sense of self and of time bec@@ ame soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated enough for you to real@@ ize you were mo@@ rt@@ al , so at some point in the evolution of our spec@@ ies , some early human &apos;s sense of self and of time bec@@ ame soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated enough for them to become the first human to real@@ ize , &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot;"
"This is , if you like , our cur@@ se ."
It &apos;s the pr@@ ice we pa@@ y for being so dam@@ n cl@@ ever .
"We have to live in the knowledge that the wor@@ st thing that can possi@@ bly happen one day sur@@ ely will , the end of all our pro@@ jects , our h@@ op@@ es , our dre@@ ams , of our individ@@ ual world ."
We each live in the sh@@ ad@@ ow of a person@@ al apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se .
And that &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing . It &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying .
And so we look for a way out .
"And in my case , as I was about five years old , this me@@ ant as@@ king my m@@ um ."
"Now when I first started as@@ king what happens when we die , the grow@@ n@@ -@@ ups around me at the time ans@@ wer@@ ed with a typ@@ ical English mi@@ x of aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ness and hal@@ f-@@ he@@ ar@@ ted Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , and the ph@@ ra@@ se I heard most often was that grand@@ dad was now &quot; up there looking down on us , &quot; and if I should die too , which wouldn &apos;t happen of course , then I too would go up there , which made death sound a lot like an ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al el@@ ev@@ at@@ or ."
Now this didn &apos;t sound very pla@@ us@@ ible .
"I used to wat@@ ch a children &apos;s news program at the time , and this was the er@@ a of space explo@@ ration ."
"There were always roc@@ ket@@ s going up into the sk@@ y , up into space , going up there ."
But n@@ one of the astro@@ na@@ ut@@ s when they came back ever men@@ tion@@ ed having me@@ t my grand@@ dad or any other de@@ ad people .
"But I was sc@@ ar@@ ed , and the idea of taking the ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al el@@ ev@@ at@@ or to see my grand@@ dad s@@ oun@@ ded a lot better than being s@@ wal@@ lowed by the vo@@ id while I s@@ le@@ pt ."
"And so I beli@@ ev@@ ed it any@@ way , even though it didn &apos;t make much sense ."
"And this thought process that I went through as a child , and have been through many times since , incl@@ ud@@ ing as a grow@@ n@@ -@@ up , is a produc@@ t of what psych@@ olog@@ ists call a bi@@ as ."
"Now a bi@@ as is a way in which we sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically get things wrong , ways in which we mis@@ cal@@ cul@@ ate , mis@@ j@@ ud@@ ge , dis@@ t@@ or@@ t reality , or see what we want to see , and the bi@@ as I &apos;m talking about works like this : Con@@ front someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tel@@ ls them it isn &apos;t true and they can , instead , live for@@ ever , even if it means taking the ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ al el@@ ev@@ at@@ or ."
Now we can see this as the big@@ gest bi@@ as of all .
It has been demon@@ stra@@ ted in over 4@@ 00 em@@ pir@@ ical studies .
"Now these studies are in@@ gen@@ ious , but they &apos;re simple ."
They work like this .
"You take two gro@@ ups of people who are si@@ mil@@ ar in all rel@@ ev@@ ant res@@ pec@@ ts , and you re@@ mind one group that they &apos;re going to die but not the other , then you comp@@ are their behavior ."
So you &apos;re observ@@ ing how it bi@@ as@@ es behavior when people become aw@@ are of their mo@@ rt@@ ality .
"And every time , you get the same res@@ ult : P@@ eople who are made aw@@ are of their mo@@ rt@@ ality are more w@@ il@@ ling to believe stories that tell them they can es@@ cap@@ e death and live for@@ ever ."
"So here &apos;s an example : One rec@@ ent study took two gro@@ ups of ag@@ no@@ s@@ tics , that is people who are un@@ decided in their relig@@ ious beli@@ ef@@ s ."
"Now , one group was asked to think about being de@@ ad ."
The other group was asked to think about being lon@@ ely .
They were then asked again about their relig@@ ious beli@@ ef@@ s .
Th@@ ose who had been asked to think about being de@@ ad were af@@ ter@@ wards tw@@ ice as likely to ex@@ pres@@ s fa@@ ith in G@@ od and J@@ es@@ us .
T@@ w@@ ice as likely .
E@@ ven though the before they were all equ@@ ally ag@@ no@@ s@@ tic .
"But put the fear of death in them , and they run to J@@ es@@ us ."
"Now , this sho@@ ws that re@@ min@@ ding people of death bi@@ as@@ es them to believe , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the evidence , and it works not just for relig@@ ion , but for any kind of beli@@ ef system that prom@@ is@@ es im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality in some form , whether it &apos;s becom@@ ing f@@ amo@@ us or having children or even na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism , which prom@@ is@@ es you can live on as part of a gre@@ ater whole ."
This is a bi@@ as that has shap@@ ed the course of human history .
"Now , the theory be@@ h@@ ind this bi@@ as in the over 4@@ 00 studies is called ter@@ ro@@ r man@@ ag@@ ement theory , and the idea is simple . It &apos;s just this ."
"We devel@@ op our wor@@ ld@@ vie@@ ws , that is , the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it , in order to help us man@@ age the ter@@ ro@@ r of death ."
"And these im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality stories have thousands of different man@@ if@@ est@@ ations , but I believe that be@@ h@@ ind the ap@@ par@@ ent d@@ iver@@ sity there are actually just four bas@@ ic for@@ ms that these im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality stories can take ."
"And we can see them re@@ pe@@ ating themselves throu@@ gh@@ out history , just with s@@ light vari@@ ations to re@@ fl@@ ect the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of the day ."
"Now I &apos;m going to bri@@ ef@@ ly in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e these four bas@@ ic for@@ ms of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality story , and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they &apos;re re@@ told by each culture or gener@@ ation using the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of their day ."
"Now , the first story is the sim@@ pl@@ est ."
"We want to av@@ o@@ id death , and the dre@@ am of doing that in this body in this world for@@ ever is the first and sim@@ pl@@ est kind of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality story , and it might at first sound im@@ pla@@ us@@ ible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some my@@ th or le@@ gen@@ d of an eli@@ x@@ ir of life or a f@@ oun@@ tain of y@@ ou@@ th or something that prom@@ is@@ es to keep us going for@@ ever ."
"A@@ n@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ yp@@ t had such my@@ ths , an@@ ci@@ ent B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on , an@@ ci@@ ent India ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an history , we find them in the work of the al@@ chem@@ ists , and of course we still believe this today , only we tell this story using the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of science ."
"So 100 years ago , hor@@ mon@@ es had just been discover@@ ed , and people h@@ op@@ ed that hor@@ mon@@ e treat@@ ments were going to c@@ ure ag@@ ing and disease , and now instead we set our h@@ op@@ es on stem cells , gen@@ e@@ tic engine@@ ering , and n@@ an@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ nolo@@ gy ."
"But the idea that science can c@@ ure death is just one more ch@@ ap@@ ter in the story of the mag@@ ical eli@@ x@@ ir , a story that is as old as civiliz@@ ation ."
But bet@@ ting everything on the idea of fin@@ ding the eli@@ x@@ ir and st@@ a@@ ying al@@ ive for@@ ever is a ris@@ k@@ y stra@@ te@@ gy .
"When we look back through history at all those who have s@@ ou@@ ght an eli@@ x@@ ir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they &apos;re all de@@ ad ."
"So we need a bac@@ k@@ up pl@@ an , and exactly this kind of pl@@ an B is what the second kind of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality story of@@ fer@@ s , and that &apos;s resur@@ rec@@ tion ."
"And it st@@ a@@ ys with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organ@@ ism ."
"It ac@@ cep@@ ts that I &apos;m going to have to die but says , des@@ p@@ ite that , I can r@@ ise up and I can live again ."
"In other words , I can do what J@@ es@@ us did ."
"@@ J@@ es@@ us died , he was three days in the &#91; t@@ om@@ b &#93; , and then he ro@@ se up and liv@@ ed again ."
"And the idea that we can all be resur@@ rec@@ ted to live again is or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x believe , not just for Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans but also J@@ e@@ ws and M@@ us@@ li@@ ms ."
"But our des@@ ire to believe this story is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded that we are re@@ inv@@ ent@@ ing it again for the scientific age , for example , with the idea of c@@ r@@ y@@ on@@ ics ."
"That &apos;s the idea that when you die , you can have yourself f@@ ro@@ z@@ en , and then , at some point when technology has adv@@ an@@ ced enough , you can be th@@ aw@@ ed out and re@@ pa@@ i@@ red and rev@@ iv@@ ed and so resur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"And so some people believe an om@@ ni@@ po@@ t@@ ent go@@ d will resur@@ rec@@ t them to live again , and other people believe an om@@ ni@@ po@@ t@@ ent scient@@ ist will do it ."
"But for others , the whole idea of resur@@ rec@@ tion , of c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing out of the gr@@ ave , it &apos;s just too much like a bad zom@@ bi@@ e movi@@ e ."
"They find the body too m@@ ess@@ y , too un@@ rel@@ i@@ able to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e et@@ er@@ n@@ al life , and so they set their h@@ op@@ es on the third , more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality story , the idea that we can leave our body be@@ h@@ ind and live on as a s@@ ou@@ l ."
"Now , the maj@@ or@@ ity of people on Earth believe they have a s@@ ou@@ l , and the idea is cent@@ ral to many relig@@ ions ."
"But even though , in its curr@@ ent form , in its t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al form , the idea of the s@@ ou@@ l is still hu@@ g@@ ely popul@@ ar , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess we are again re@@ inv@@ ent@@ ing it for the dig@@ ital age , for example with the idea that you can leave your body be@@ h@@ ind by up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing your mind , your ess@@ ence , the real you , on@@ to a computer , and so live on as an av@@ at@@ ar in the e@@ ther ."
"But of course there are sk@@ ep@@ tics who say if we look at the evidence of science , particul@@ arly neuro@@ science , it su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that your mind , your ess@@ ence , the real you , is very much de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on a particular part of your body , that is , your brain ."
"And such sk@@ ep@@ tics can find com@@ for@@ t in the f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h kind of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality story , and that is le@@ ga@@ cy , the idea that you can live on through the e@@ ch@@ o you leave in the world , like the great Gre@@ e@@ k war@@ ri@@ or A@@ chil@@ les , who sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ ed his life f@@ igh@@ ting at Tro@@ y so that he might w@@ in im@@ mo@@ rt@@ al fa@@ me ."
"And the pur@@ su@@ it of fa@@ me is as w@@ id@@ es@@ pre@@ ad and popul@@ ar now as it ever was , and in our dig@@ ital age , it &apos;s even eas@@ ier to achi@@ eve ."
You don &apos;t need to be a great war@@ ri@@ or like A@@ chil@@ les or a great king or her@@ o .
"A@@ ll you need is an In@@ tern@@ et connec@@ tion and a fun@@ n@@ y c@@ at . ( Laughter ) But some people pre@@ fer to leave a more tan@@ gi@@ ble , bi@@ ological le@@ ga@@ cy — children , for example ."
"O@@ r they like , they hope , to live on as part of some gre@@ ater whole , a na@@ tion or a family or a tri@@ be , their gen@@ e po@@ ol ."
"But again , there are sk@@ ep@@ tics who d@@ ou@@ b@@ t whether le@@ ga@@ cy really is im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality ."
"W@@ o@@ ody A@@ l@@ l@@ en , for example , who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to live on in the he@@ ar@@ ts of my coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men ."
"I want to live on in my ap@@ art@@ ment . &quot; &quot; So those are the four bas@@ ic kinds of im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality stories , and I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to give just some sense of how they &apos;re re@@ told by each gener@@ ation with just s@@ light vari@@ ations to f@@ it the f@@ ash@@ ions of the day ."
"And the fact that they rec@@ ur in this way , in such a si@@ mil@@ ar form but in such different beli@@ ef syst@@ ems , su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts , I think , that we should be sk@@ ep@@ tical of the tr@@ uth of any particular ver@@ sion of these stories ."
The fact that some people believe an om@@ ni@@ po@@ t@@ ent go@@ d will resur@@ rec@@ t them to live again and others believe an om@@ ni@@ po@@ t@@ ent scient@@ ist will do it su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that nei@@ ther are really beli@@ ev@@ ing this on the str@@ eng@@ th of the evidence .
"R@@ a@@ ther , we believe these stories because we are bi@@ as@@ ed to believe them , and we are bi@@ as@@ ed to believe them because we are so af@@ ra@@ id of death ."
"So the question is , are we do@@ om@@ ed to le@@ ad the one life we have in a way that is shap@@ ed by fear and den@@ ial , or can we over@@ come this bi@@ as ?"
Well the Gre@@ e@@ k philosoph@@ er E@@ pic@@ ur@@ us thought we could .
"He arg@@ u@@ ed that the fear of death is natural , but it is not ra@@ tional ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ath , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; is nothing to us , because when we are here , death is not , and when death is here , we are gone . &quot; &quot; Now this is often quot@@ ed , but it &apos;s difficult to really gra@@ s@@ p , to really inter@@ n@@ ali@@ ze , because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine ."
"So 2@@ ,000 years later , another philosoph@@ er , L@@ ud@@ wi@@ g W@@ it@@ t@@ gen@@ ste@@ in , put it like this : &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ath is not an ev@@ ent in life : We do not live to experience death ."
"And so , &quot; &quot; he ad@@ ded , &quot; in this sense , life has no end . &quot;"
"So it was natural for me as a child to fear being s@@ wal@@ lowed by the vo@@ id , but it wasn &apos;t ra@@ tional , because being s@@ wal@@ lowed by the vo@@ id is not something that any of us will ever live to experience ."
"Now , over@@ coming this bi@@ as is not easy because the fear of death is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in us , yet when we see that the fear itself is not ra@@ tional , and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can un@@ conscious@@ ly bi@@ as us , then we can at le@@ ast start to try to min@@ imi@@ ze the in@@ flu@@ ence it has on our lives ."
"Now , I find it hel@@ ps to see life as being like a book : Just as a book is b@@ oun@@ ded by its c@@ ov@@ ers , by beginning and end , so our lives are b@@ oun@@ ded by bir@@ th and death , and even though a book is li@@ mit@@ ed by beginning and end , it can en@@ com@@ pas@@ s dis@@ t@@ ant l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , ex@@ ot@@ ic fig@@ ures , f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic adv@@ ent@@ ures ."
"And even though a book is li@@ mit@@ ed by beginning and end , the charac@@ ters within it know no hor@@ iz@@ ons ."
"They only know the mo@@ ments that make up their story , even when the book is clo@@ sed ."
And so the charac@@ ters of a book are not af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ ach@@ ing the last p@@ age .
L@@ ong J@@ o@@ h@@ n S@@ il@@ ver is not af@@ ra@@ id of you fin@@ ish@@ ing your c@@ op@@ y of &quot; &quot; T@@ reas@@ ure I@@ sl@@ and . &quot; &quot; And so it should be with us .
"I@@ mag@@ ine the book of your life , its c@@ ov@@ ers , its beginning and end , and your bir@@ th and your death ."
"You can only know the mo@@ ments in between , the mo@@ ments that make up your life ."
"It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those c@@ ov@@ ers , whether before your bir@@ th or after your death ."
"And you need@@ n &apos;t wor@@ ry how long the book is , or whether it &apos;s a co@@ mic st@@ ri@@ p or an ep@@ ic ."
The only thing that mat@@ ters is that you make it a good story .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on you saw here for a bri@@ ef moment is called quan@@ tum lev@@ it@@ ation and quan@@ tum loc@@ king .
And the object that was lev@@ it@@ ating here is called a super@@ conduc@@ tor .
"S@@ u@@ per@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity is a quan@@ tum state of matter , and it oc@@ cur@@ s only bel@@ ow a certain c@@ rit@@ ical tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ; it was discover@@ ed 100 years ago ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , only rec@@ ently , d@@ ue to s@@ ever@@ al technolo@@ g@@ ical adv@@ an@@ cem@@ ents , we are now able to demon@@ st@@ rate to you quan@@ tum lev@@ it@@ ation and quan@@ tum loc@@ king ."
"So , a super@@ conduc@@ tor is defin@@ ed by two pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"The first is z@@ ero elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce , and the second is the exp@@ ul@@ sion of a mag@@ ne@@ tic field from the inter@@ ior of the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"That s@@ oun@@ ds compl@@ ic@@ ated , right ?"
But what is elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce ?
"So , elec@@ tric@@ ity is the f@@ low of elec@@ t@@ rons inside a material ."
"And these elec@@ t@@ rons , while f@@ lowing , they coll@@ ide with the at@@ oms , and in these coll@@ is@@ ions they lo@@ se a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that ef@@ fect ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , inside a super@@ conduc@@ tor there are no coll@@ is@@ ions , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mark@@ able . Th@@ ink about it .
"In clas@@ sic@@ al physics , there is always some fr@@ ic@@ tion , some energy lo@@ ss ."
"But not here , because it is a quan@@ tum ef@@ fect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because super@@ conduc@@ tors don &apos;t like mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a super@@ conduc@@ tor will try to ex@@ pe@@ l mag@@ ne@@ tic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by cir@@ cul@@ ating curr@@ ents ."
"Now , the com@@ bin@@ ation of both effec@@ ts — the exp@@ ul@@ sion of mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds and z@@ ero elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce — is exactly a super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always per@@ fect , as we all know , and sometimes stran@@ ds of mag@@ ne@@ tic field re@@ ma@@ in inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"Now , under pro@@ per con@@ dit@@ ions , which we have here , these stran@@ ds of mag@@ ne@@ tic field can be tra@@ pped inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"And these stran@@ ds of mag@@ ne@@ tic field inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te quan@@ tit@@ ies ."
Why ? Because it is a quan@@ tum ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on . It &apos;s quan@@ tum physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like quan@@ tum partic@@ les .
"In this movi@@ e here , you can see how they f@@ low one by one dis@@ cre@@ t@@ ely ."
"This is stran@@ ds of mag@@ ne@@ tic field . These are not partic@@ les , but they be@@ have like partic@@ les ."
"So , this is why we call this ef@@ fect quan@@ tum lev@@ it@@ ation and quan@@ tum loc@@ king ."
But what happens to the super@@ conduc@@ tor when we put it inside a mag@@ ne@@ tic field ?
"Well , first there are stran@@ ds of mag@@ ne@@ tic field left inside , but now the super@@ conduc@@ tor doesn &apos;t like them mov@@ ing around , because their mov@@ em@@ ents dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which bre@@ ak@@ s the super@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity state ."
"So what it actually does , it loc@@ ks these stran@@ ds , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it loc@@ ks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is loc@@ king itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any mov@@ ement of the super@@ conduc@@ tor will change their place , will change their con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tion ."
So we get quan@@ tum loc@@ king . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a super@@ conduc@@ tor , which I w@@ ra@@ pped up so it &apos;d st@@ ay c@@ old long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ gul@@ ar mag@@ n@@ et , it just st@@ a@@ ys loc@@ ked in mi@@ da@@ ir ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just lev@@ it@@ ation . It &apos;s not just re@@ pul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be loc@@ ked in this new con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tion ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e this , or move it s@@ ligh@@ tly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quan@@ tum loc@@ king — actually loc@@ king — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al loc@@ king of the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ ma@@ in loc@@ ked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called lev@@ it@@ ation is actually loc@@ king , Y@@ eah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be sur@@ pris@@ ed to hear that if I take this cir@@ cul@@ ar mag@@ n@@ et , in which the mag@@ ne@@ tic field is the same all around , the super@@ conduc@@ tor will be able to fre@@ ely ro@@ t@@ ate around the ax@@ is of the mag@@ n@@ et ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it ro@@ t@@ ates , the loc@@ king is main@@ ta@@ ined ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can ro@@ t@@ ate the super@@ conduc@@ tor .
"We have fr@@ ic@@ tion@@ less mo@@ tion . It is still lev@@ it@@ ating , but can move fre@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have quan@@ tum loc@@ king and we can lev@@ it@@ ate it on top of this mag@@ n@@ et ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many mag@@ ne@@ tic stran@@ ds are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cul@@ ate it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion stran@@ ds of mag@@ ne@@ tic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the amazing part yet , because there is something I hav@@ en &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , ye@@ ah , the amazing part is that this super@@ conduc@@ tor that you see here is only half a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ n th@@ ic@@ k . It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely th@@ in ."
"And this extre@@ m@@ ely th@@ in la@@ y@@ er is able to lev@@ it@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own we@@ ight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able ef@@ fect . It &apos;s very st@@ rong .
"Now , I can ext@@ end this cir@@ cul@@ ar mag@@ n@@ et , and make wh@@ at@@ ever trac@@ k I want ."
"For example , I can make a large cir@@ cul@@ ar ra@@ il here ."
"And when I place the super@@ conduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this ra@@ il , it mov@@ es fre@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its position like this , and ro@@ t@@ ate , and it fre@@ ely mov@@ es in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it st@@ a@@ ys here — don &apos;t move — I will try to ro@@ t@@ ate the trac@@ k , and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it st@@ a@@ ys s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quan@@ tum loc@@ king , not lev@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it cir@@ cul@@ ate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about super@@ conduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ fer en@@ or@@ mo@@ us amount of curr@@ ents inside super@@ conduc@@ tors , so we can use them to produc@@ e st@@ rong mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I ma@@ chin@@ es , partic@@ le ac@@ cel@@ er@@ at@@ ors and so on ."
"But we can also stor@@ e energy using super@@ conduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
"And we could also produc@@ e power c@@ ab@@ les , to trans@@ fer en@@ or@@ mo@@ us amoun@@ ts of curr@@ ent between power st@@ ations ."
I@@ mag@@ ine you could back up a single power st@@ ation with a single super@@ conduc@@ ting c@@ able .
But what is the future of quan@@ tum lev@@ it@@ ation and quan@@ tum loc@@ king ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine you would have a dis@@ k si@@ mil@@ ar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch di@@ ame@@ ter , with a single difference ."
"The super@@ conduc@@ ting la@@ y@@ er , instead of being half a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ n th@@ in , being two mil@@ li@@ me@@ ters th@@ in , quite th@@ in ."
"This tw@@ o@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ in super@@ conduc@@ ting la@@ y@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 kilo@@ g@@ ram@@ s , a small c@@ ar , in my hand ."
A@@ maz@@ ing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y t@@ op@@ ic is the sec@@ re@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she st@@ ay ?"
Why would any@@ one st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s her ?
"I &apos;m not a psych@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ist , a social work@@ er or an exper@@ t in dom@@ es@@ tic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just grad@@ u@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mov@@ ed to New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity for my first job as a writ@@ er and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ even@@ te@@ en ma@@ gaz@@ ine .
"I had my first ap@@ art@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pres@@ s c@@ ard , and I had a very big sec@@ ret ."
"M@@ y sec@@ ret was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ad@@ ed with hol@@ low@@ -@@ point b@@ ul@@ l@@ ets poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times ."
The man who I lo@@ ved more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remember .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psych@@ ological tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ ised as love , one that mil@@ lions of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typ@@ ical dom@@ es@@ tic violence surviv@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in English from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in mar@@ ket@@ ing from Wh@@ art@@ on B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my career working for F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies incl@@ ud@@ ing J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son , L@@ e@@ o B@@ urn@@ et@@ t and The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ o@@ st ."

"( Laughter ) So my first mes@@ sa@@ ge for you is that dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to everyone — all ra@@ ces , all relig@@ ions , all income and education lev@@ els ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second mes@@ sa@@ ge is that everyone thin@@ ks dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ ti@@ mate , inter@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in famil@@ ies , the last place we would want or exp@@ ect to find violence , which is one reason dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use is so con@@ f@@ using ."
"I would have told you my@@ self that I was the last person on Earth who would st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s me , but in fact I was a very typ@@ ical vic@@ ti@@ m because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ages 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as likely to be dom@@ es@@ tic violence vic@@ tim@@ s as women of other ages , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are k@@ il@@ led every year by ab@@ us@@ ive par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , bo@@ y@@ friends , and h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds in the United States ."
"I was also a very typ@@ ical vic@@ ti@@ m because I knew nothing about dom@@ es@@ tic violence , its war@@ ning sign@@ s or its patterns ."
"I me@@ t Con@@ or on a c@@ old , ra@@ in@@ y J@@ an@@ u@@ ary night ."
"He sa@@ t next to me on the New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just grad@@ u@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y L@@ e@@ ag@@ ue school , and that he worked at a very im@@ pres@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the big@@ gest im@@ pres@@ sion on me that first me@@ et@@ ing was that he was s@@ mart and fun@@ n@@ y and he looked like a far@@ m bo@@ y .
"He had these big che@@ e@@ ks , these big app@@ le che@@ e@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ ond ha@@ ir , and he se@@ em@@ ed so s@@ we@@ et ."
"One of the s@@ mart@@ est things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the ill@@ us@@ ion that I was the domin@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally at the beginning by id@@ oli@@ z@@ ing me .
"We started da@@ ting , and he lo@@ ved everything about me , that I was s@@ mart , that I &apos;d gone to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , that I was pas@@ sion@@ ate about hel@@ ping te@@ en@@ age girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and my h@@ op@@ es and dre@@ ams .
"C@@ on@@ or beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a writ@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a mag@@ ical at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of tr@@ ust between us by con@@ f@@ ess@@ ing his sec@@ ret , which was that , as a very young bo@@ y starting at age four , he had been sav@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physic@@ ally ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to dro@@ p out of school in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very s@@ mart , and he &apos;d sp@@ ent almost 20 years reb@@ u@@ il@@ ding his life ."
Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y L@@ e@@ ag@@ ue de@@ gre@@ e and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right shin@@ y future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this s@@ mart , fun@@ n@@ y , sen@@ sit@@ ive man who ad@@ ored me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how shor@@ t my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I liv@@ ed , what j@@ obs I took , who my friends were and where I sp@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas , I would have l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ in@@ t of violence or control or an@@ ger in Con@@ or at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any dom@@ es@@ tic violence relation@@ ship is to s@@ educ@@ e and char@@ m the vic@@ ti@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to is@@ ol@@ ate the vic@@ ti@@ m .
"Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , he@@ y , all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ ul@@ iet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next ph@@ ase where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ art@@ ment where the ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this c@@ ity where you have friends and family and co@@ work@@ ers who can see the br@@ u@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; In@@ ste@@ ad , Con@@ or came home one F@@ ri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,"
"@@ because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and lo@@ ved that he didn &apos;t need to pro@@ ve h@@ im@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the c@@ ity and away from his ab@@ us@@ ive , d@@ y@@ s@@ func@@ tional family , and move to a tiny to@@ wn in New Engl@@ and where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New Y@@ or@@ k , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ es for your s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ all@@ ing into crazy love , that I was wal@@ king head@@ first into a care@@ fully la@@ id physical , fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al and psych@@ ological tra@@ p ."
The next step in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence pat@@ tern is to in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mov@@ ed to New Engl@@ and — you know , that place where Con@@ n@@ or was sup@@ posed to feel so sa@@ fe — he b@@ ou@@ ght three g@@ un@@ s ."
He ke@@ pt one in the g@@ love com@@ par@@ t@@ ment of our c@@ ar .
"He ke@@ pt one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our bed , and the third one he ke@@ pt in his po@@ c@@ k@@ et at all times ."
And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tra@@ u@@ ma he &apos;d experien@@ ced as a young bo@@ y .
He needed them to feel pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ted .
"But those g@@ un@@ s were really a mes@@ sa@@ ge for me , and even though he h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t ra@@ ised a hand to me , my life was already in gr@@ ave dan@@ ger every min@@ ute of every day ."
Con@@ or first physic@@ ally att@@ ac@@ ked me five days before our w@@ ed@@ ding .
It was 7 a.@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ gh@@ t@@ go@@ wn .
"I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance writ@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , and Con@@ or used my an@@ ger as an exc@@ use to put both of his hands around my nec@@ k and to s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze so ti@@ gh@@ tly that I could not bre@@ a@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ ive days later , the ten br@@ u@@ is@@ es on my nec@@ k had just f@@ ad@@ ed , and I put on my mother &apos;s w@@ ed@@ ding d@@ ress , and I marri@@ ed him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I lo@@ ved him , and he lo@@ ved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sor@@ ry ."
He had just been really st@@ res@@ sed out by the w@@ ed@@ ding and by becom@@ ing a family with me .
"It was an is@@ ol@@ ated in@@ c@@ id@@ ent , and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again ."
It happened tw@@ ice more on the h@@ on@@ ey@@ mo@@ on .
"The first time , I was driv@@ ing to find a sec@@ ret be@@ ach and I got lo@@ st , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly h@@ it the driv@@ er &apos;s side w@@ ind@@ ow ."
"And then a few days later , driv@@ ing home from our h@@ on@@ ey@@ mo@@ on , he got f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by tra@@ f@@ fic , and he thre@@ w a c@@ old B@@ i@@ g M@@ ac in my face ."
Con@@ or pro@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a week for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age .
I was mis@@ taken in thinking that I was un@@ i@@ qu@@ e and al@@ one in this sit@@ u@@ ation .
"One in three American women experi@@ ences dom@@ es@@ tic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ por@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good compan@@ y ."
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I st@@ ay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ad@@ ed g@@ un@@ s to my head , p@@ u@@ shed me down st@@ air@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the k@@ ey out of the c@@ ar ign@@ ition as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , po@@ ured co@@ f@@ fe@@ e gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I d@@ res@@ sed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of my@@ self as a b@@ at@@ ter@@ ed wi@@ fe ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I was a very st@@ rong woman in love with a de@@ ep@@ ly tro@@ ub@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his demon@@ s ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"@@ To me , this is the sa@@ d@@ d@@ est and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we vic@@ tim@@ s know something you us@@ u@@ ally don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ bly dan@@ ger@@ ous to leave an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fin@@ al step in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence pat@@ tern is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 7@@ 0 percent of dom@@ es@@ tic violence m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers happen after the vic@@ ti@@ m has en@@ ded the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to lo@@ se ."
"O@@ ther ou@@ t@@ comes incl@@ u@@ de lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ marri@@ es ; den@@ ial of fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al resour@@ ces ; and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the vic@@ ti@@ m and her children , who are re@@ gul@@ arly for@@ ced by family cour@@ t j@@ ud@@ g@@ es to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vis@@ ed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one fin@@ al , sa@@ dis@@ tic be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my den@@ ial ."
I real@@ ized that the man who I lo@@ ved so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I bro@@ ke the sil@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the pol@@ ice , my ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors , my friends and family , tot@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ ped me ."
"We t@@ end to ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e vic@@ tim@@ s as gr@@ is@@ ly head@@ lin@@ es , self-@@ des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive women , da@@ mag@@ ed go@@ ods ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she st@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; is cod@@ e for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her fa@@ ult for st@@ a@@ ying , &quot; &quot; as if vic@@ tim@@ s in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ally cho@@ ose to f@@ all in love with men in@@ t@@ ent u@@ po@@ n des@@ tro@@ ying us ."
"But since publi@@ sh@@ ing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ zy L@@ ove , &quot; &quot; I have heard hund@@ re@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an in@@ val@@ u@@ able life les@@ son from what happened , and who reb@@ u@@ il@@ t lives — jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives — as emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , w@@ iv@@ es and mo@@ thers , lives completely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typ@@ ical dom@@ es@@ tic violence vic@@ ti@@ m and a typ@@ ical dom@@ es@@ tic violence surviv@@ or .
"I re@@ marri@@ ed a kind and gen@@ tle man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that min@@ iv@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me ."
"R@@ ight now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how st@@ up@@ id was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I prom@@ ise you there are s@@ ever@@ al people list@@ en@@ ing to me right now who are curr@@ ently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers themselves .
"A@@ b@@ use could be af@@ fec@@ ting your dau@@ ghter , your sis@@ ter , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own crazy love story by bre@@ ak@@ ing the sil@@ ence .
I &apos;m still bre@@ ak@@ ing the sil@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ ping other vic@@ tim@@ s , and it &apos;s my fin@@ al requ@@ est of you ."
Tal@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ b@@ use th@@ riv@@ es only in sil@@ ence .
You have the power to end dom@@ es@@ tic violence simply by shin@@ ing a spo@@ t@@ light on it .
We vic@@ tim@@ s need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the sec@@ re@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ work@@ ers , your friends and family ."
"R@@ ec@@ ast surviv@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with ful@@ l fut@@ ures ."
"R@@ ec@@ o@@ gni@@ ze the early sign@@ s of violence and consci@@ enti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show vic@@ tim@@ s a sa@@ fe way out ."
"@@ To@@ gether we can make our bed@@ s , our din@@ ner t@@ ab@@ les and our famil@@ ies the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul o@@ as@@ es they should be ."
Thank you .

One billion people .
Th@@ ose are the problems in the develop@@ ing world .
And it &apos;s easy for us not to be em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with those people who seem so dis@@ tan@@ ced from us .
We see that in the S@@ and@@ ers / Tr@@ um@@ p cam@@ pa@@ ign@@ s in my own country .
"We &apos;ve been working on this problem for 25 years , since R@@ i@@ o , the K@@ y@@ ot@@ o P@@ ro@@ to@@ col@@ s ."
"O@@ ur most rec@@ ent move is the P@@ aris treat@@ y , and the res@@ ul@@ ting cli@@ mate ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents that are being ra@@ ti@@ fied by na@@ tions around the world ."
"I think we can be very h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul that those ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , which are bot@@ t@@ om@@ -@@ up ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , where na@@ tions have said what they think they can do , are gen@@ u@@ ine and for@@ th@@ coming for the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the par@@ ties ."
"The un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate thing is that now , as we look at the inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ent anal@@ y@@ ses of what those cli@@ mate tre@@ ati@@ es are li@@ able to y@@ i@@ el@@ d , the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of the problem before us becom@@ es c@@ lear ."
It sho@@ ws basically C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ sions around the world over the next 30 years .
There are three things that you need to look at and app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate .
"In order to control cli@@ mate , C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ sions have to liter@@ ally go to z@@ ero because it &apos;s the c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative em@@ is@@ sions that dr@@ ive he@@ ating on the planet ."
This should tell you that we are lo@@ sing the ra@@ ce to f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
"The second thing you should not@@ ice is that the b@@ ul@@ k of the growth comes from the develop@@ ing countries , from China , from India , from the rest of the world , which incl@@ ud@@ es S@@ ou@@ th A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a and In@@ don@@ es@@ ia and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , as most of these countries move their people into the lower ran@@ ge of lif@@ est@@ y@@ les that we liter@@ ally take for gr@@ an@@ ted in the develop@@ ed world ."
"The fin@@ al thing that you should not@@ ice is that each year , about 10 gi@@ ga@@ t@@ ons of car@@ b@@ on are getting ad@@ ded to the planet &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , and then dif@@ f@@ using into the oc@@ e@@ an and into the land ."
That &apos;s on top of the 5@@ 50 gi@@ ga@@ t@@ ons that are in place today .
"A@@ t the end of 30 years , we will have put 8@@ 50 gi@@ ga@@ t@@ ons of car@@ b@@ on into the air , and that probably goes a long way to@@ wards loc@@ king in a 2@@ -@@ 4 de@@ gre@@ e C increase in global mean sur@@ face tem@@ per@@ atures , loc@@ king in oc@@ e@@ an ac@@ id@@ i@@ fic@@ ation and loc@@ king in se@@ a level r@@ ise ."
"Now , this is a pro@@ jec@@ tion made by men by the ac@@ tions of society , and it &apos;s ours to change , not to ac@@ cept ."
It &apos;s a func@@ tion of their natural resour@@ ces .
It &apos;s a func@@ tion of the develop@@ ment pat@@ h that they &apos;ve fol@@ lowed as a society .
It &apos;s a func@@ tion of where on the sur@@ face of the planet they are .
"M@@ any , many , many things go into the cho@@ ices of countries , and they each make a different cho@@ ice ."
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing thing that we need to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate is the cho@@ ice that China has made .
"@@ China has made the cho@@ ice , and will make the cho@@ ice , to run on co@@ al ."
The United States has an al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive .
China has many fe@@ wer cho@@ ices and a much har@@ der row to ho@@ e .
"If you look at China , and you ask yourself why has co@@ al been important to it , you have to remember what China &apos;s done ."
"@@ China b@@ rou@@ ght people to power , not power to people ."
It didn &apos;t do ru@@ ral elec@@ tri@@ fic@@ ation .
It ur@@ ban@@ ized .
"It ur@@ ban@@ ized by taking low@@ -@@ cost lab@@ or and low@@ -@@ cost energy , cre@@ ating ex@@ port ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ es that could fun@@ d a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amount of growth ."
"If we look at China &apos;s pat@@ h , all of us know that pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity in China has dra@@ ma@@ tically increas@@ ed ."
"In 19@@ 80 , 80 percent of China &apos;s population liv@@ ed bel@@ ow the extre@@ me pov@@ ert@@ y level , bel@@ ow the level of having $ 1@@ .@@ 90 per person per day ."
"R@@ ight now , we &apos;re basically wa@@ iting for a mi@@ ra@@ cle ."
"If they can &apos;t make it sa@@ fe , if they can &apos;t make it che@@ a@@ p , it should not be de@@ p@@ lo@@ yed ."
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in the water sup@@ p@@ ly that it wouldn &apos;t oc@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to question it ."
This is my super@@ market .
"One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never bro@@ ke ."
"We now have an almost un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed vari@@ ety of ph@@ ones , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ ones ."
These are c@@ ell ph@@ ones of the future .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite is the middle one — the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er , no@@ se ha@@ ir tri@@ m@@ m@@ er , and c@@ r@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e t@@ or@@ ch ."
So par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices .
Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ t@@ ations .
You want b@@ ut@@ ton f@@ ly or z@@ ip@@ per f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ shed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wa@@ shed ?
"I had very low , no particular expec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ av@@ or ."
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
"W@@ ith a hundred different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no exc@@ use for fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"And so the n@@ et res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , and we feel wor@@ se ."
So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
"There is a huge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in happiness , amo@@ n@@ g rese@@ arch@@ ers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier .
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these co@@ gn@@ itive tra@@ ps .
"This app@@ li@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ li@@ es to s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit compl@@ ex@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a us@@ ef@@ ul word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the not@@ ion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real co@@ gn@@ itive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ port@@ ed a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been list@@ en@@ ing to a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ch@@ ing sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic .
"They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a me@@ mor@@ y ; the me@@ mor@@ y was ru@@ ined , and the me@@ mor@@ y was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experien@@ cing self , who lives in the present and kno@@ ws the present , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present ."
"It &apos;s the experien@@ cing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ e@@ ps sc@@ ore , and main@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing l@@ ately ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to A@@ l@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ ities , the experien@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the not@@ ion of happiness ."
"Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er ."
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic respon@@ se of our me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es — it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me be@@ gin with one example .
They were asked to re@@ port on their pa@@ in every 60 secon@@ ds .
"@@ Here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ordin@@ gs ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them suf@@ fer@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suf@@ fer@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y was longer , and every min@@ ute of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suf@@ fer@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ ise .
The sur@@ pr@@ ise is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se me@@ mor@@ y of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ies were different , and because a very c@@ rit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends ."
And nei@@ ther of these stories is very insp@@ ir@@ ing or great — but one of them is this dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in tot@@ al ? &quot;"
"And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in me@@ mor@@ y ."
Now this is a direc@@ t con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between the experien@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ra@@ n cl@@ in@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ext@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much ."
"That will cause the pati@@ ent to suf@@ fer , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that me@@ mor@@ y del@@ iv@@ ers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant mo@@ ments and en@@ din@@ gs ."
"@@ En@@ din@@ gs are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated ."
"Now , the experien@@ cing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ously ."
"It has mo@@ ments of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mo@@ ments ?
And the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward : They are lo@@ st for@@ ever .
M@@ o@@ st of them are completely ign@@ ored by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens d@@ uring these mo@@ ments of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this e@@ arth .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ e@@ ps for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experien@@ cing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
The experien@@ cing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences , we cho@@ ose between me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es of experi@@ ences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future nor@@ m@@ ally as experi@@ ences ."
We think of our future as an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es .
"I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very f@@ requ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ext@@ ent , in the ser@@ vic@@ e of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self ."
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for con@@ sum@@ ing me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on me@@ mor@@ y rel@@ ative to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be des@@ tro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remember anything ."
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two not@@ ions of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experien@@ cing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mo@@ ments in the experien@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mo@@ ments is a fa@@ ir@@ ly compl@@ ic@@ ated process .
What are the emo@@ tions that can be meas@@ ured ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experien@@ cing self over time ."
It is about how sat@@ is@@ fied or pl@@ eas@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ er@@ y different not@@ ion .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish those not@@ ions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been m@@ ess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in prec@@ is@@ ely this way ."
"The dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between the happiness of the experien@@ cing self and the sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to measure the two se@@ par@@ ately ."
"So in rec@@ ent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the ma@@ in les@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you me@@ t somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?"
You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is main@@ ly being sat@@ is@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like ."
"There are other pl@@ eas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute for well-@@ being .
It is a completely different not@@ ion .
"Now , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer ."
"Well , it turns out that cli@@ mate is not very important to the experien@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self that dec@@ ides how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well-@@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that G@@ all@@ up surv@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , v@@ ary with income ."
"And it turns out that , bel@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple — bel@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progres@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ or@@ er they get ."
"A@@ b@@ ove that , we get an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely fl@@ at line ."
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lin@@ es so fl@@ at .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but l@@ ack of money certain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y , and we can measure that mis@@ er@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more sat@@ is@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for emo@@ tions .
"C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , li@@ b@@ ert@@ y , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took ser@@ i@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y and so for@@ th ."
P@@ eople are reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of public pol@@ ic@@ y .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence pol@@ ic@@ y , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ ade or two , part of national stat@@ is@@ tics ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at le@@ ast should be — the most interesting pol@@ ic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to trac@@ k over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a vari@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and o@@ il &apos;s a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent starting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but o@@ il &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mark@@ able stuff .
"You take about eight or so car@@ b@@ on at@@ oms , about 20 hy@@ d@@ rog@@ en at@@ oms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this mar@@ vel@@ ous li@@ qu@@ id : very ener@@ g@@ y-@@ den@@ se and very easy to re@@ fin@@ e into a number of very us@@ ef@@ ul produc@@ ts and fu@@ els ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of o@@ il out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ c@@ k@@ et map of where it &apos;s all loc@@ ated .
A big@@ ger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the o@@ il in the world ."
G@@ e@@ olog@@ ists have a pretty good idea of where the o@@ il is .
This is about 100 tr@@ il@@ lion g@@ all@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de o@@ il still to be develop@@ ed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about o@@ il , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , o@@ il &apos;s going to last for@@ ever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this o@@ il , 1@@ 000 me@@ ters bel@@ ow where you &apos;re all sit@@ ting is one of the larg@@ est produc@@ ing o@@ il fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ ils if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of o@@ il ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about o@@ il ? Wh@@ ere is it in the energy system ?
"@@ Here &apos;s a little s@@ n@@ ap@@ sh@@ ot of 1@@ 50 years of o@@ il , and it &apos;s been a domin@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 1@@ 50 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little sec@@ ret I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 25 years , o@@ il has been pla@@ ying less and less of a ro@@ le in global energy syst@@ ems ."
"There was one kind of pe@@ ak o@@ il in 19@@ 8@@ 5 , when o@@ il re@@ pres@@ ented 50 percent of global energy sup@@ p@@ ly ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been de@@ cl@@ ining and I believe it will contin@@ ue to de@@ cl@@ ine .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion in the U.@@ S@@ . probably pe@@ ak@@ ed in 200@@ 7 and is de@@ cl@@ ining .
So o@@ il is pla@@ ying a less si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ro@@ le every year .
"And so , 25 years ago , there was a pe@@ ak o@@ il ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a pe@@ ak co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a pe@@ ak wo@@ od ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy syst@@ ems .
And what &apos;s been taking up the sl@@ ack in the last few dec@@ ades ?
"Well , a lot of natural ga@@ s and a little bit of n@@ uc@@ lear , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few dec@@ ades is pe@@ ak ga@@ s , and be@@ y@@ ond that , pe@@ ak ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in tot@@ al isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ ils — but there &apos;s a very important mes@@ sa@@ ge here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically dec@@ ar@@ b@@ on@@ iz@@ ing our energy system ."
"E@@ ner@@ gy syst@@ ems of the world becom@@ ing progres@@ si@@ vely — year on year , dec@@ ade on dec@@ ade , century on century — becom@@ ing less car@@ b@@ on in@@ ten@@ se ."
"And that contin@@ ues into the future with the ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develop@@ ing today , re@@ ach@@ ing maybe 30 percent of pri@@ mar@@ y energy by mi@@ d century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ ven@@ tional ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ y@@ ond .
"What is the future of tr@@ ul@@ y su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in cent@@ ral T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of lim@@ est@@ one .
"I pic@@ ked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ all@@ s , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just lim@@ est@@ one , nothing really spec@@ ial about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of ch@@ al@@ k ."
I pic@@ ked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little youn@@ ger .
"And it &apos;s different than this lim@@ est@@ one , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lec@@ ture and write on the ch@@ al@@ k@@ bo@@ ard with this ."
"Y@@ eah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
What &apos;s different is how the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ f@@ f the co@@ ast of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ al@@ one sh@@ ell .
"Now , mil@@ lions of ab@@ al@@ one every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already gu@@ ess@@ ing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times tou@@ gh@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the low@@ ly ab@@ al@@ one is able to la@@ y down the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ als in la@@ y@@ ers , making this beautiful , ir@@ id@@ es@@ cent mother of pe@@ ar@@ l ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y speci@@ aliz@@ ed material that the ab@@ al@@ one self-@@ as@@ s@@ em@@ bl@@ es , mil@@ lions of ab@@ al@@ one , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredi@@ ble stuff .
"A@@ ll the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll su@@ g@@ gest that this co@@ al is about as exc@@ iting as this ch@@ al@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fu@@ els or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps no@@ vel mater@@ i@@ als for b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies or fu@@ el cells , nature h@@ as@@ n &apos;t ever built those per@@ fect mater@@ i@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"@@ N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ al@@ one sh@@ ell , the surviv@@ al of a spec@@ ies didn &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on building those mater@@ i@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es differ@@ ently ."
And so that is my story .
The o@@ il will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ lion w@@ ind@@ mil@@ ls .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people inv@@ ented ideas — they had ideas , in@@ no@@ v@@ ations , technology — and the St@@ one A@@ ge en@@ ded , not because we ra@@ n out of st@@ ones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of o@@ il , long before we run out of o@@ il ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"It &apos;s like a co@@ in f@@ li@@ p ; it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , really ."
This is the way we treat people as respon@@ si@@ ble ad@@ ults .
And I think some people may have mis@@ underst@@ ood .
That &apos;s the way evolution works .
"Now , maybe we want to treat it as met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical ."
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both chall@@ eng@@ ed and exc@@ ited .
My exc@@ it@@ ement is : I get a chan@@ ce to give something back .
My challenge is : the shor@@ test s@@ em@@ in@@ ar I us@@ u@@ ally do is 50 hours .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;m not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating . I do we@@ ek@@ ends — I do more , ob@@ vi@@ ously , I also co@@ ach people — but I &apos;m into im@@ mer@@ sion , because how did you learn language ?"
"@@ Not just by learning princi@@ pl@@ es , you got in it and you did it so often that it bec@@ ame real ."
"The bot@@ tom line of why I &apos;m here , b@@ es@@ ides being a crazy mo@@ f@@ o , is that — I &apos;m not here to mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ate you , you don &apos;t need that , ob@@ vi@@ ously ."
"O@@ f@@ ten that &apos;s what people think I do , and it &apos;s the fur@@ th@@ est thing from it ."
"What happens , though , is people say to me , &quot; I don &apos;t need any mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation . &quot;"
But that &apos;s not what I do .
I &apos;m the &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; guy .
I want to know why you do what you do .
What is your mo@@ tive for action ?
What is it that driv@@ es you in your life today ? Not 10 years ago .
A@@ re you run@@ ning the same pat@@ tern ?
"Because I believe that the in@@ vis@@ ible force of inter@@ n@@ al dr@@ ive , acti@@ v@@ ated , is the most important thing ."
I &apos;m here because I believe emo@@ tion is the force of life .
All of us here have great min@@ ds .
"M@@ o@@ st of us here have great min@@ ds , right ?"
We all know how to think .
W@@ ith our min@@ ds we can ra@@ tion@@ ali@@ ze anything .
We can make anything happen .
"I ag@@ ree with what was descri@@ bed a few days ago , that people work in their self-@@ inter@@ est ."
But we know that that &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ sh@@ it at times .
"You don &apos;t work in your self-@@ inter@@ est all the time , because when emo@@ tion comes into it , the w@@ ir@@ ing changes in the way it func@@ tions ."
"So it &apos;s wonderful to think intel@@ lec@@ tually about how the life of the world is , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally those who are very s@@ mart can play this ga@@ me in our head ."
But I really want to know what &apos;s driv@@ ing you .
One : so that you can con@@ tri@@ b@@ ute more .
I &apos;ve got to do something right now or nothing mat@@ ters .
"I get the ph@@ one call when the child is going to com@@ mit su@@ ic@@ ide , I &apos;ve got to do something ."
"In 2@@ 9 years , I &apos;m very gra@@ te@@ ful to tell you I &apos;ve never lo@@ st one ."
"When I get those call@@ s about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce , that &apos;s one thing ."
How do you make a change ?
"I &apos;m also looking to see what is shap@@ ing the person &apos;s ability to con@@ tri@@ b@@ ute , to do something be@@ y@@ ond themselves ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe the real question is , I look at life and say there &apos;s two ma@@ st@@ er l@@ ess@@ ons ."
"One is : there &apos;s the science of achi@@ ev@@ ement , which almost everyone here has ma@@ ster@@ ed amaz@@ ing@@ ly ."
"&quot; How do you take the in@@ vis@@ ible and make it vis@@ ible , &quot; How do you make your dre@@ ams happen ?"
"O@@ n@@ ce you know the ga@@ me , you just up the an@@ te , don &apos;t you ?"
But when it comes to ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment — that &apos;s an art .
"The reason is , it &apos;s about app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation and con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion ."
You can only feel so much by yourself .
I &apos;ve had an interesting labo@@ rat@@ ory to try to answer the real question how somebody &apos;s life changes if you look at them like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ?
L@@ ik@@ e all the resour@@ ces they say they need .
"You gave not a 1@@ 00-@@ doll@@ ar computer , but the best computer ."
"You gave them love , jo@@ y , were there to com@@ for@@ t them ."
What is it that shap@@ es us ?
We live in a ther@@ ap@@ y culture .
"And you wouldn &apos;t be in this room if you b@@ ou@@ ght that , but most of society thin@@ ks bio@@ graph@@ y is des@@ tiny ."
O@@ f course it does if you live there .
We &apos;ve got to re@@ mind ourselves that dec@@ ision is the ul@@ ti@@ mate power .
"When you ask people , have you fa@@ il@@ ed to achi@@ eve something si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant in your life ?"
"S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ eve something ?"
"S@@ omebody who &apos;s working for you , or a par@@ t@@ ner , or even yourself ."
"When you fa@@ il to achi@@ eve , what &apos;s the reason people say ?"
What do they tell you ?
"D@@ id@@ n &apos;t have the knowledge , didn &apos;t have the money , didn &apos;t have the time , didn &apos;t have the technology ."
I didn &apos;t have the right man@@ ag@@ er .
A@@ l G@@ ore : Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t . T@@ R : The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( C@@ he@@ ering ) ( Applause contin@@ ues ) T@@ R : And — ( Applause ) What do all those , incl@@ ud@@ ing the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , have in common ? ( Laughter )"
"They are a cl@@ a@@ im to you mis@@ sing resour@@ ces , and they may be ac@@ cu@@ rate ."
"You may not have the money , or the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , but that is not the defin@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ rec@@ t me if I &apos;m wrong .
The defin@@ ing fac@@ tor is never resour@@ ces ; it &apos;s resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
"And what I mean speci@@ fic@@ ally , rather than just some ph@@ ra@@ se , is if you have emo@@ tion , human emo@@ tion , something that I experien@@ ced from you the day before y@@ es@@ ter@@ day at a level that is as prof@@ ound as I &apos;ve ever experien@@ ced and I believe with that emo@@ tion you would have be@@ at his as@@ s and won ."
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : Y@@ eah !
( Applause ) ( C@@ he@@ ering ) How easy for me to tell him what he should do .
"But I know when we wat@@ ched the deb@@ ate at that time , there were emo@@ tions that bloc@@ ked people &apos;s ability to get this man &apos;s intel@@ l@@ ect and cap@@ ac@@ ity ."
But there was emo@@ tion there .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
"S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
"@@ T@@ R : So , emo@@ tion is it ."
"And if we get the right emo@@ tion , we can get ourselves to do anything ."
"If you &apos;re cre@@ ative , pla@@ y@@ ful , fu@@ n enough , can you get through to any@@ body , y@@ es or no ?"
"He &apos;s bro@@ ken my pat@@ tern , that son@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ b@@ it@@ ch ."
"( Laughter ) But I app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated the energy , I &apos;ll tell you that . ( Laughter )"
What de@@ ter@@ min@@ es your resour@@ ces ?
"If dec@@ is@@ ions shap@@ e des@@ tiny , what de@@ ter@@ min@@ es it is three dec@@ is@@ ions ."
What will you foc@@ us on ?
You have to dec@@ ide what you &apos;re going to foc@@ us on .
Con@@ sci@@ ously or un@@ conscious@@ ly .
"@@ the min@@ ute you dec@@ ide to foc@@ us , you must give it a mean@@ ing , and that mean@@ ing produc@@ es emo@@ tion ."
I@@ s this the end or the beginning ?
"I@@ s G@@ od p@@ un@@ ish@@ ing me or re@@ war@@ ding me , or is this the ro@@ ll of the d@@ ice ?"
"A@@ n emo@@ tion cre@@ ates what we &apos;re going to do , or the action ."
But what was his dec@@ ision of what to foc@@ us on ?
D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent than most people . What did it mean ?
It wasn &apos;t the end ; it was the beginning .
"He goes off and w@@ ins seven ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ shi@@ ps he never once won before the cancer , because he got emo@@ tional f@@ it@@ ness , psych@@ ological str@@ eng@@ th ."
That &apos;s the difference in human be@@ ings that I &apos;ve seen of the three million I &apos;ve been around .
"In my la@@ b , I &apos;ve had three million people from 80 countries over the last 2@@ 9 years ."
"And after a while , patterns become ob@@ vi@@ ous ."
"You see that S@@ ou@@ th America and A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a may be connec@@ ted in a certain way , right ?"
"O@@ thers say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , that s@@ oun@@ ds r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s simple ."
"So , what shap@@ ed L@@ ance ? What shap@@ es you ?"
T@@ w@@ o in@@ vis@@ ible for@@ ces . V@@ er@@ y qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly . One : state .
"We all have had times , you did something , and after , you thought to yourself , &quot; I can &apos;t believe I said or did that , that was so st@@ up@@ id . &quot;"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
"O@@ r after you did something , you go , &quot; &quot; That was me ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t your ability ; it was your state ."
Y@@ our mo@@ del of the world is what shap@@ es you long ter@@ m .
Y@@ our mo@@ del of the world is the fil@@ ter . That &apos;s what &apos;s shap@@ ing us .
It makes people make dec@@ is@@ ions .
"@@ To in@@ flu@@ ence somebody , we need to know what already in@@ flu@@ ences them ."
It &apos;s made up of three parts .
"Wh@@ o has ever got a go@@ al or des@@ ire and thought , is this all there is ?"
"S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
It &apos;s needs we have . I believe there are six human needs .
"S@@ econ@@ d , once you know what the t@@ arg@@ et that &apos;s driv@@ ing you is and you un@@ c@@ over it for the tr@@ uth — you don &apos;t form it — then you find out what &apos;s your map , what &apos;s the beli@@ ef syst@@ ems that tell you how to get those needs ."
Con@@ tro@@ l everybody ? D@@ ev@@ el@@ op a sk@@ ill ? G@@ ive up ? S@@ mo@@ ke a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te ?
"And if you got tot@@ ally certain , i@@ ron@@ ically , even though we need that — you &apos;re not certain about your health , or your children , or money ."
"If you &apos;re not sure the ce@@ il@@ ing will hold up , you won &apos;t list@@ en to any speak@@ er ."
"Wh@@ ile we go for certain@@ ty differ@@ ently , if we get tot@@ al certain@@ ty , we get what ?"
"You know what will happen , when and how it will happen , what would you feel ?"
"B@@ ored out of your min@@ ds . So , G@@ od , in H@@ er in@@ fin@@ ite w@@ is@@ dom , gave us a second human need , which is un@@ certain@@ ty ."
We need vari@@ ety . We need sur@@ pr@@ ise .
"@@ How many of you here love sur@@ pris@@ es ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ y@@ e ."
T@@ R : B@@ ul@@ l@@ sh@@ it . You like the sur@@ pris@@ es you want .
H@@ ave you ever r@@ ented a video or a fil@@ m that you &apos;ve already seen ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s done this ? G@@ et a f@@ uc@@ king life .
Wh@@ at@@ ever it takes .
"If I put a gu@@ n to your head and I live in the &apos; ho@@ od , in@@ stan@@ tly I &apos;m si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ."
Z@@ ero to 10 . How high ? 10 .
How certain am I that you &apos;re going to res@@ po@@ nd to me ? 10 .
How much un@@ certain@@ ty ?
Wh@@ o kno@@ ws what &apos;s going to happen next ? K@@ ind of exc@@ iting .
L@@ ik@@ e c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing up into a c@@ ave and doing that stuff all the way down there .
T@@ ot@@ al vari@@ ety and un@@ certain@@ ty .
"And it &apos;s si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , isn &apos;t it ? So you want to ris@@ k your life for it ."
So that &apos;s why violence has always been around and will be around un@@ less we have a consciousness change as a spec@@ ies .
"You can get si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance a million ways , but to be si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , you &apos;ve got to be un@@ i@@ qu@@ e and different ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what we really need : connec@@ tion and love , f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h need ."
Wh@@ o here has been h@@ ur@@ t in an in@@ ti@@ mate relation@@ ship ?
"If you don &apos;t ra@@ ise your hand , you &apos;ve had other sh@@ it , too ."
And you &apos;re going to get h@@ ur@@ t again .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you gl@@ ad you came to this pos@@ itive vis@@ it ?
Here &apos;s what &apos;s true : we need it .
"We can do it through in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , fri@@ end@@ ship , pra@@ y@@ er , through wal@@ king in nature ."
"If nothing else works for you , don &apos;t get a c@@ at , get a do@@ g , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone six months , when you come back 5 minutes later ."
"Th@@ ese first four needs , every human fin@@ ds a way to me@@ et ."
"E@@ ven if you li@@ e to yourself , you need to have s@@ pl@@ it person@@ alit@@ ies ."
I call the first four needs the needs of the person@@ ality .
The last two are the needs of the sp@@ ir@@ it .
And this is where ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment comes .
You won &apos;t get it from the first four .
"You &apos;ll figure a way , smo@@ ke , dr@@ ink , do wh@@ at@@ ever , me@@ et the first four ."
"But number five , you must grow ."
"If you don &apos;t grow , you &apos;re what ?"
"If a relation@@ ship or business is not gro@@ wing , if you &apos;re not gro@@ wing , doesn &apos;t matter how much money or friends you have , how many love you , you feel like h@@ ell ."
Because the si@@ x@@ th need is to con@@ tri@@ b@@ ute be@@ y@@ ond ourselves .
"Because we all know , cor@@ n@@ y as that s@@ oun@@ ds , the sec@@ ret to living is giving ."
"We all know life is not about me , it &apos;s about we ."
"This culture kno@@ ws that , this room kno@@ ws that ."
"You can feel the difference in him , and it &apos;s beautiful ."
And that call@@ ing can tou@@ ch other people .
"M@@ y life was tou@@ ched because when I was 11 years old , Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , no money , no food , we were not going to star@@ ve , but my father was tot@@ ally m@@ ess@@ ed up , my mo@@ m was l@@ etting him know how bad he m@@ ess@@ ed up , and somebody came to the do@@ or and del@@ iver@@ ed food ."
"M@@ y father made three dec@@ is@@ ions , I know what they were , bri@@ ef@@ ly ."
H@@ is foc@@ us was &quot; &quot; This is char@@ ity .
What does it mean ? I &apos;m wor@@ th@@ less .
"What do I have to do ? L@@ e@@ ave my family , &quot; &quot; which he did ."
It was one of the most pain@@ ful experi@@ ences of life .
My three dec@@ is@@ ions gave me a different pat@@ h .
I set foc@@ us on &quot; &quot; There &apos;s food . &quot; &quot; What a con@@ cept !
"( Laughter ) But this is what changed my life , shap@@ ed me as a human being ."
"S@@ omebody &apos;s gi@@ ft , I don &apos;t even know who it is ."
"M@@ y father always said , &quot; &quot; No one giv@@ es a sh@@ it . &quot; &quot; And now somebody I don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not as@@ king for anything , just giving us food , looking out for us ."
It made me believe this : that str@@ ang@@ ers care .
"And that made me dec@@ ide , if str@@ ang@@ ers care about me and my family , I care about them ."
I &apos;m going to do something to make a difference .
"So when I was 1@@ 7 , I went out on Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , it was my t@@ arg@@ et for years to have enough money to fe@@ ed two famil@@ ies ."
The most fu@@ n and mov@@ ing thing I ever did in my life .
"@@ N@@ ex@@ t year , I did four , then eight ."
"I didn &apos;t tell any@@ body what I was doing , I wasn &apos;t doing it for bro@@ w@@ ni@@ e poin@@ ts ."
"But after eight , I thought I could use some help ."
"So I went out , got my friends inv@@ ol@@ ved , then I gre@@ w compan@@ ies , got 11 , and I built the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion ."
"@@ 18 years later , I &apos;m pro@@ u@@ d to tell you last year we f@@ ed 2 million people in 3@@ 5 countries through our f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion ."
"A@@ ll d@@ uring the ho@@ li@@ days , Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas , in different countries around the world ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"I don &apos;t tell you that to bra@@ g , but because I &apos;m pro@@ u@@ d of human be@@ ings because they get exc@@ ited to con@@ tri@@ b@@ ute once they &apos;ve had the chan@@ ce to experience it , not talk about it ."
"So , finally — I &apos;m about out of time ."
The t@@ arg@@ et that shap@@ es you — Here &apos;s what &apos;s different about people .
We have the same needs .
"But are you a certain@@ ty fre@@ ak , is that what you value most , or un@@ certain@@ ty ?"
This man couldn &apos;t be a certain@@ ty fre@@ ak if he c@@ lim@@ bed through those c@@ aves .
A@@ re you driv@@ en by si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance or love ?
"And as you move in a direc@@ tion , you have a des@@ tin@@ ation or des@@ tiny ."
They want to h@@ on@@ or G@@ od or h@@ on@@ or their family .
The last piece is emo@@ tion .
One of the parts of the map is like time .
S@@ ome people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years .
"S@@ omebody else &apos;s is three secon@@ ds , which is what I have ."
And the last one I &apos;ve already men@@ tion@@ ed that f@@ ell to you .
You use this thing and you don &apos;t get there .
I@@ mag@@ ine if your beli@@ ef@@ s gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e you can never get to where you want to go .
( Laughter ) The last thing is emo@@ tion .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;ll tell you about emo@@ tion .
"There are 6@@ ,000 emo@@ tions that we have words for in the English language , which is just a lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation that changes by language ."
"But if your domin@@ ant emo@@ tions — If I have 20@@ ,000 people or 1@@ ,000 and I have them write down all the emo@@ tions that they experience in an average week , and I give them as long as they need , and on one side they write em@@ power@@ ing emo@@ tions , the other &apos;s dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing , gu@@ ess how many emo@@ tions they experience ? L@@ ess than 12 ."
And half of those make them feel like sh@@ it .
They have six good feel@@ ings .
"H@@ app@@ y , happy , exc@@ ited , oh sh@@ it , f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed , depres@@ sed ."
"@@ How many of you know somebody who , no matter what happens , fin@@ ds a way to get p@@ is@@ sed off ?"
"( Laughter ) O@@ r no matter what happens , they find a way to be happy or exc@@ ited ."
How many of you know somebody like this ?
"When 9 / 11 happened , I &apos;ll fin@@ ish with this , I was in H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i ."
"I got up , had no pl@@ an for this , and I said — we had fi@@ re@@ works , I do crazy sh@@ it , fu@@ n stuff , and at the end , I st@@ op@@ ped ."
"I had this pl@@ an , but I never know what I &apos;m going to say ."
"And all of a su@@ d@@ den , I said , &quot; Wh@@ en do people really start to live ? Wh@@ en they face death . &quot;"
"And I went through this whole thing about , if you wer@@ en &apos;t going to get off this is@@ land , if n@@ ine days from now , you were going to die , who would you call , what would you say , what would you do ?"
That night is when 9 / 11 happened .
"One woman had come to the s@@ em@@ in@@ ar , and when she came there , her pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end had been kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed and m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed ."
"H@@ er new bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end wanted to mar@@ ry her , and she said no ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; If you go to that H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i thing , it &apos;s over with us . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I fin@@ i@@ shed that night , she called him and left a mes@@ sa@@ ge at the top of the W@@ or@@ ld Tra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter where he worked , saying , &quot; &quot; I love you , I want you to know I want to mar@@ ry you ."
"It was st@@ up@@ id of me . &quot; &quot; She was as@@ le@@ ep , because it was 3 a.@@ m@@ . for us , when he called her back , and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ ey , I can &apos;t tell you what this means ."
"I don &apos;t know how to tell you this , but you gave me the gre@@ at@@ est gi@@ ft , because I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And she pla@@ yed the rec@@ or@@ ding for us in the room ."
She was on L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing later .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re probably wonder@@ ing how on Earth this could happen to you tw@@ ice ."
All I can say is this must be G@@ od &apos;s mes@@ sa@@ ge to you .
"F@@ rom now on , every day , give your all , love your all ."
"D@@ on &apos;t let anything ever stop you . &quot; &quot; She fin@@ ish@@ es , and a man stan@@ ds up , and he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan , I &apos;m a M@@ us@@ li@@ m ."
"I &apos;d love to hold your hand and say I &apos;m sor@@ ry , but fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , this is re@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you the rest , because I &apos;m out of time ."

10 secon@@ ds !

Now I want to share with you three things I learned about my@@ self that day .
"In my own hum@@ an@@ ity and mis@@ takes , I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to get better at everything I tri@@ ed ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
There &apos;s something that I &apos;d like you to see .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) R@@ e@@ por@@ ter : It &apos;s a story that &apos;s de@@ ep@@ ly un@@ s@@ et@@ t@@ led mil@@ lions in China : fo@@ ot@@ age of a tw@@ o@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old gir@@ l h@@ it by a v@@ an and left b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing in the stre@@ et by pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by , fo@@ ot@@ age too graph@@ ic to be sho@@ wn ."
The enti@@ re acc@@ id@@ ent is c@@ au@@ ght on c@@ amer@@ a .
"The driv@@ er pa@@ uses after h@@ it@@ ting the child , his back whe@@ els seen re@@ st@@ ing on her for over a second ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in two minutes , three people pas@@ s tw@@ o@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old W@@ an@@ g Y@@ ue by ."
The first wal@@ ks around the b@@ ad@@ ly in@@ j@@ ured t@@ od@@ d@@ l@@ er completely .
O@@ thers look at her before mov@@ ing off .
"She was ru@@ shed to ho@@ sp@@ ital , but it was too l@@ ate . She died ."
"I won@@ der how many of you , looking at that , said to your@@ selves just now , &quot; &quot; I would not have done that ."
I would have st@@ op@@ ped to help . &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ ise your hands if that thought oc@@ cur@@ red to you .
"As I thought , that &apos;s most of you ."
"But before you give yourself too much cre@@ dit , look at this ."
"@@ U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F re@@ por@@ ts that in 20@@ 11 , 6@@ .@@ 9 million children under five died from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able , pov@@ ert@@ y-@@ rel@@ ated dis@@ eas@@ es ."
U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F thin@@ ks that that &apos;s good news because the figure has been ste@@ ad@@ ily coming down from 12 million in 19@@ 90 . That is good .
"But still , 6@@ .@@ 9 million is 19@@ ,000 children d@@ ying every day ."
D@@ o@@ es it really matter that we &apos;re not wal@@ king past them in the stre@@ et ?
D@@ o@@ es it really matter that they &apos;re far away ?
I don &apos;t think it does make a mor@@ ally rel@@ ev@@ ant difference .
"The fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different na@@ tion@@ ality or ra@@ ce , n@@ one of that seems mor@@ ally rel@@ ev@@ ant to me ."
"What is really important is , can we reduc@@ e that death t@@ ol@@ l ? C@@ an we sa@@ ve some of those 19@@ ,000 children d@@ ying every day ?"
"And the answer is , y@@ es we can ."
E@@ ach of us sp@@ ends money on things that we do not really need .
"You can think what your own h@@ ab@@ it is , whether it &apos;s a new c@@ ar , a v@@ ac@@ ation or just something like bu@@ ying bot@@ t@@ led water when the water that comes out of the ta@@ p is per@@ fec@@ tly sa@@ fe to dr@@ ink ."
"You could take the money you &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding on those un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary things and give it to this organiz@@ ation , the A@@ ga@@ inst M@@ al@@ aria F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , which would take the money you had given and use it to buy n@@ ets like this one to pro@@ t@@ ect children like this one , and we know rel@@ i@@ ably that if we pro@@ v@@ ide n@@ ets , they &apos;re used , and they reduc@@ e the number of children d@@ ying from mal@@ aria , just one of the many pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able dis@@ eas@@ es that are respon@@ si@@ ble for some of those 19@@ ,000 children d@@ ying every day ."
"F@@ or@@ tun@@ ately , more and more people are understanding this idea , and the res@@ ult is a gro@@ wing mov@@ ement : effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ism ."
It &apos;s important because it com@@ bin@@ es both the heart and the head .
"The heart , of course , you fel@@ t ."
You fel@@ t the em@@ pa@@ thy for that child .
"But it &apos;s really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effec@@ tive and well-@@ direc@@ ted , and not only that , but also I think reason hel@@ ps us to understand that other people , wh@@ er@@ ever they are , are like us , that they can suf@@ fer as we can , that parents g@@ ri@@ eve for the de@@ a@@ ths of their children , as we do , and that just as our lives and our well-@@ being matter to us , it mat@@ ters just as much to all of these people ."
So I think reason is not just some ne@@ ut@@ ral to@@ ol to help you get wh@@ at@@ ever you want .
It does help us to put per@@ spec@@ tive on our sit@@ u@@ ation .
And I think that &apos;s why many of the most si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant people in effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ism have been people who have had bac@@ k@@ gro@@ un@@ ds in philosoph@@ y or econom@@ ics or mat@@ h .
"And that might seem sur@@ pris@@ ing , because a lot of people think , &quot; &quot; P@@ h@@ ilosoph@@ y is re@@ mo@@ te from the real world ; econom@@ ics , we &apos;re told , just makes us more sel@@ f@@ ish , and we know that mat@@ h is for ner@@ ds . &quot; &quot; But in fact it does make a difference , and in fact there &apos;s one particular ner@@ d who has been a particul@@ arly effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ist because he got this ."
"This is the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite of the B@@ ill &a@@ m@@ p@@ ; M@@ el@@ inda G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , and if you look at the words on the top ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side , it says , &quot; &quot; All lives have equ@@ al value . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the understanding , the ra@@ tional understanding of our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world that has led to these people being the most effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ists in history , B@@ ill and M@@ el@@ inda G@@ ates and W@@ ar@@ re@@ n B@@ uf@@ f@@ et@@ t ."
"( Applause ) No one , not An@@ dre@@ w C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e , not J@@ o@@ h@@ n D@@ . R@@ oc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ l@@ er , has ever given as much to char@@ ity as each one of these three , and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is high@@ ly effec@@ tive ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to one es@@ ti@@ mate , the G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion has already sav@@ ed 5@@ .@@ 8 million lives and many mil@@ lions more , people , getting dis@@ eas@@ es that would have made them very sic@@ k , even if even@@ tually they surviv@@ ed ."
"O@@ ver the coming years , und@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ably the G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is going to give a lot more , is going to sa@@ ve a lot more lives ."
"Well , you might say , that &apos;s fin@@ e if you &apos;re a bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e , you can have that kind of im@@ p@@ act ."
"But if I &apos;m not , what can I do ?"
So I &apos;m going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe st@@ and in the way of them giving .
They wor@@ ry how much of a difference they can make .
"He bec@@ ame an effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ist when he cal@@ cul@@ ated that with the money that he was likely to ear@@ n throu@@ gh@@ out his career , an ac@@ ade@@ mic career , he could give enough to c@@ ure 8@@ 0,000 people of bl@@ ind@@ ness in develop@@ ing countries and still have enough left for a per@@ fec@@ tly ade@@ qu@@ ate stan@@ dar@@ d of living ."
T@@ ob@@ y h@@ im@@ self does better than that .
"He &apos;s pl@@ ed@@ g@@ ed to live on 18@@ ,000 po@@ un@@ ds a year — that &apos;s less than 3@@ 0,000 dollars — and to give the rest to those organiz@@ ations ."
"And y@@ es , T@@ ob@@ y is marri@@ ed and he does have a mo@@ rt@@ ga@@ ge ."
"And then , as they got to the age at which many people start to think of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , they re@@ turned to them , and they &apos;ve decided to c@@ ut back on their sp@@ en@@ ding , to live mo@@ des@@ tly , and to give both money and time to hel@@ ping to fi@@ ght global pov@@ ert@@ y ."
"Now , men@@ tion@@ ing time might le@@ ad you to think , &quot; &quot; Well , should I ab@@ an@@ don my career and put all of my time into sav@@ ing some of these 19@@ ,000 lives that are lo@@ st every day ? &quot; &quot; One person who &apos;s thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the big@@ gest im@@ p@@ act for good in the world is W@@ ill C@@ ro@@ uch ."
"He &apos;s a grad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent in philosoph@@ y , and he &apos;s set up a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite called 8@@ 0,000 H@@ ours , the number of hours he es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es most people sp@@ end on their career , to adv@@ ise people on how to have the best , most effec@@ tive career ."
"But you might be sur@@ pris@@ ed to know that one of the care@@ ers that he en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ es people to consid@@ er , if they have the right abil@@ ities and charac@@ ter , is to go into ban@@ king or fin@@ ance ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because if you ear@@ n a lot of money , you can give away a lot of money , and if you &apos;re success@@ ful in that career , you could give enough to an a@@ id organiz@@ ation so that it could emp@@ lo@@ y , let &apos;s say , five a@@ id work@@ ers in develop@@ ing countries , and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done ."
Here &apos;s one young man who &apos;s taken this ad@@ vic@@ e .
H@@ is name is M@@ at@@ t W@@ e@@ ig@@ er .
"He was a stud@@ ent at P@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ et@@ on in philosoph@@ y and mat@@ h , actually won the pri@@ ze for the best under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate philosoph@@ y th@@ esis last year when he grad@@ u@@ ated ."
But he &apos;s gone into fin@@ ance in New Y@@ or@@ k .
He &apos;s already ear@@ ning enough so that he &apos;s giving a si@@ x@@ -@@ figure su@@ m to effec@@ tive char@@ ities and still le@@ av@@ ing h@@ im@@ self with enough to live on .
"M@@ at@@ t has also hel@@ ped me to set up an organiz@@ ation that I &apos;m working with that has the name taken from the tit@@ le of a book I w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; The L@@ i@@ fe You C@@ an S@@ ave , &quot; which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we &apos;re going to live an e@@ th@@ ical life , it &apos;s not enough just to fol@@ low the thou@@ -@@ sh@@ al@@ t-@@ n@@ ots and not che@@ at , ste@@ al , ma@@ im , k@@ ill , but that if we have enough , we have to share some of that with people who have so little ."
"And the organiz@@ ation dra@@ ws together people of different gener@@ ations , like H@@ ol@@ ly M@@ or@@ gan , who &apos;s an under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate , who &apos;s pl@@ ed@@ g@@ ed to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has , and on the right , A@@ da W@@ an , who has worked direc@@ tly for the po@@ or , but has now gone to Y@@ ale to do an M@@ B@@ A to have more to give ."
"M@@ any people will think , though , that char@@ ities ar@@ en &apos;t really all that effec@@ tive ."
So let &apos;s talk about effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
"@@ T@@ ob@@ y O@@ r@@ d is very con@@ cer@@ ned about this , and he &apos;s cal@@ cul@@ ated that some char@@ ities are hund@@ re@@ ds or even thousands of times more effec@@ tive than others , so it &apos;s very important to find the effec@@ tive ones ."
"@@ T@@ ake , for example , pro@@ vid@@ ing a gu@@ ide do@@ g for a bl@@ ind person ."
"That &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?"
"Well , right , it is a good thing to do , but you have to think what else you could do with the resour@@ ces ."
It co@@ st@@ s some@@ where between 20 and 50 dollars to c@@ ure a bl@@ ind person in a develop@@ ing country if they have tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a .
"So you do the su@@ ms , and you get something like that ."
"You could pro@@ v@@ ide one gu@@ ide do@@ g for one bl@@ ind American , or you could c@@ ure between 4@@ 00 and 2@@ ,000 people of bl@@ ind@@ ness ."
I think it &apos;s c@@ lear what &apos;s the better thing to do .
"But if you want to look for effec@@ tive char@@ ities , this is a good w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite to go to ."
"@@ G@@ iv@@ e@@ Well ex@@ ists to really as@@ s@@ ess the im@@ p@@ act of char@@ ities , not just whether they &apos;re well-@@ run , and it &apos;s scre@@ en@@ ed hund@@ re@@ ds of char@@ ities and curr@@ ently is re@@ com@@ men@@ ding only three , of which the A@@ ga@@ inst M@@ al@@ aria F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is number one ."
"So it &apos;s very t@@ ough . If you want to look for other re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tions , th@@ eli@@ fe@@ y@@ ou@@ can@@ sav@@ e@@ .@@ co@@ m and G@@ iv@@ ing What We C@@ an both have a some@@ what bro@@ ad@@ er l@@ ist , but you can find effec@@ tive organiz@@ ations , and not just in the are@@ a of sav@@ ing lives from the po@@ or ."
I &apos;m pl@@ eas@@ ed to say that there is now also a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite looking at effec@@ tive an@@ ima@@ l organiz@@ ations .
"That &apos;s another cause that I &apos;ve been con@@ cer@@ ned about all my life , the im@@ men@@ se amount of suf@@ fer@@ ing that hum@@ ans in@@ fl@@ ic@@ t on liter@@ ally ten@@ s of bil@@ lions of an@@ im@@ als every year ."
"So if you want to look for effec@@ tive organiz@@ ations to reduc@@ e that suf@@ fer@@ ing , you can go to E@@ f@@ fec@@ tive A@@ ni@@ mal A@@ c@@ ti@@ vis@@ m ."
And some effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ists think it &apos;s very important to make sure that our spec@@ ies surviv@@ es at all .
So they &apos;re looking at ways to reduc@@ e the ris@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion .
"@@ Here &apos;s one ris@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion that we all bec@@ ame aw@@ are of rec@@ ently , when an as@@ ter@@ o@@ id pas@@ sed clo@@ se to our planet ."
"P@@ os@@ si@@ bly research could help us not only to predic@@ t the pat@@ h of as@@ ter@@ o@@ id@@ s that might coll@@ ide with us , but actually to de@@ fl@@ ect them ."
So some people think that would be a good thing to give to .
There &apos;s many possi@@ bil@@ ities .
"M@@ y fin@@ al question is , some people will think it &apos;s a bur@@ den to give ."
I don &apos;t really believe it is .
I &apos;ve en@@ jo@@ yed giving all of my life since I was a grad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent .
It &apos;s been something ful@@ fil@@ ling to me .
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e B@@ res@@ l@@ er said to me that he &apos;s not an al@@ tr@@ u@@ ist .
He thin@@ ks that the life he &apos;s sav@@ ing is his own .
"And H@@ ol@@ ly M@@ or@@ gan told me that she used to b@@ at@@ tle depres@@ sion until she got inv@@ ol@@ ved with effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ism , and now is one of the happ@@ i@@ est people she kno@@ ws ."
I think one of the reas@@ ons for this is that being an effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ist hel@@ ps to over@@ come what I call the S@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us problem .
"@@ Here &apos;s S@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us as port@@ ra@@ yed by T@@ it@@ ian , con@@ de@@ m@@ ned by the g@@ ods to p@@ us@@ h a huge b@@ ou@@ l@@ der up to the top of the h@@ ill ."
"@@ Just as he gets there , the ef@@ for@@ t becom@@ es too much , the b@@ ou@@ l@@ der es@@ cap@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ls all the way down the h@@ ill , he has to tr@@ ud@@ ge back down to p@@ us@@ h it up again , and the same thing happens again and again for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity ."
"D@@ o@@ es that re@@ mind you of a con@@ sum@@ er lif@@ est@@ y@@ le , where you work hard to get money , you sp@@ end that money on con@@ sum@@ er go@@ ods which you hope you &apos;ll en@@ jo@@ y using ?"
"But then the money &apos;s gone , you have to work hard to get more , sp@@ end more , and to main@@ tain the same level of happiness , it &apos;s kind of a h@@ ed@@ on@@ ic tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ill ."
"You never get off , and you never really feel sat@@ is@@ fied ."
Bec@@ om@@ ing an effec@@ tive al@@ tr@@ u@@ ist giv@@ es you that mean@@ ing and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
It en@@ ab@@ les you to have a so@@ li@@ d bas@@ is for self-@@ es@@ te@@ e@@ m on which you can feel your life was really wor@@ th living .
I &apos;m going to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de by telling you about an e@@ ma@@ il that I re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed while I was writ@@ ing this talk just a mon@@ th or so ago .
"It &apos;s from a man n@@ amed Ch@@ ris C@@ ro@@ y , who I &apos;d never heard of ."
This is a picture of him sho@@ wing him rec@@ over@@ ing from sur@@ ger@@ y .
Why was he rec@@ over@@ ing from sur@@ ger@@ y ?
"The e@@ ma@@ il be@@ gan , &quot; &quot; L@@ ast Tu@@ es@@ day , I an@@ on@@ y@@ mo@@ us@@ ly don@@ ated my right kid@@ ney to a stran@@ ger ."
That started a kid@@ ney cha@@ in which en@@ ab@@ led four people to re@@ ce@@ ive kid@@ ne@@ ys . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s about 100 people each year in the U.@@ S@@ .
and more in other countries who do that .
I was pl@@ eas@@ ed to read it . Ch@@ ris went on to say that he &apos;d been in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by my writ@@ ings in what he did .
"Well , I have to ad@@ mit , I &apos;m also some@@ what em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sed by that , because I still have two kid@@ ne@@ ys ."
"And that did make me feel a little bit better , because I have given more than 5@@ ,000 dollars to the A@@ ga@@ inst M@@ al@@ aria F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion and to vari@@ ous other effec@@ tive char@@ ities ."
"So if you &apos;re feel@@ ing bad because you still have two kid@@ ne@@ ys as well , there &apos;s a way for you to get off the ho@@ ok ."
Thank you .

"O@@ ur mis@@ sion is to build a deta@@ il@@ ed , real@@ is@@ tic computer mo@@ del of the human brain ."
"And we &apos;ve done , in the past four years , a pro@@ of of con@@ cept on a small part of the ro@@ d@@ ent brain , and with this pro@@ of of con@@ cept we are now sc@@ al@@ ing the pro@@ ject up to re@@ ach the human brain ."
Why are we doing this ?
There are three important reas@@ ons .
"The first is , it &apos;s essenti@@ al for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and I think that it is a k@@ ey step in evolution ."
"The second reason is , we cannot keep doing an@@ ima@@ l experim@@ ent@@ ation for@@ ever , and we have to em@@ body all our data and all our knowledge into a working mo@@ del ."
It &apos;s like a N@@ o@@ ah &apos;s A@@ r@@ k . It &apos;s like an arch@@ ive .
"And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are af@@ fec@@ ted by mental dis@@ order , and the dru@@ gs that are used today are larg@@ ely em@@ pir@@ ical ."
I think that we can come up with very con@@ cre@@ te solu@@ tions on how to treat dis@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
"Now , even at this stage , we can use the brain mo@@ del to ex@@ pl@@ ore some fundamental questions about how the brain works ."
"And here , at TE@@ D , for the first time , I &apos;d like to share with you how we &apos;re ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing one theory — there are many the@@ or@@ ies — one theory of how the brain works ."
"So , this theory is that the brain cre@@ ates , buil@@ ds , a ver@@ sion of the universe , and pro@@ jects this ver@@ sion of the universe , like a b@@ ub@@ ble , all around us ."
"Now , this is of course a t@@ op@@ ic of philosoph@@ ical deb@@ ate for cent@@ ur@@ ies ."
"But , for the first time , we can actually ad@@ d@@ ress this , with brain sim@@ ul@@ ation , and ask very sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic and ri@@ go@@ ro@@ us questions , whether this theory could possi@@ bly be true ."
"The reason why the mo@@ on is huge on the hor@@ iz@@ on is simply because our per@@ cep@@ tual b@@ ub@@ ble does not stre@@ t@@ ch out 3@@ 8@@ 0,000 kilo@@ me@@ ters ."
It run@@ s out of space .
"And so what we do is we comp@@ are the buil@@ din@@ gs within our per@@ cep@@ tual b@@ ub@@ ble , and we make a dec@@ ision ."
"We make a dec@@ ision it &apos;s that big , even though it &apos;s not that big ."
And what that ill@@ ust@@ rat@@ es is that dec@@ is@@ ions are the k@@ ey things that sup@@ port our per@@ cep@@ tual b@@ ub@@ ble . It ke@@ e@@ ps it al@@ ive .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out dec@@ is@@ ions you cannot see , you cannot think , you cannot feel ."
"And you may think that an@@ es@@ the@@ tics work by sen@@ ding you into some de@@ ep s@@ le@@ ep , or by bloc@@ king your re@@ cep@@ tors so that you don &apos;t feel pa@@ in , but in fact most an@@ es@@ the@@ tics don &apos;t work that way ."
What they do is they in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e a no@@ ise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other .
"They are con@@ f@@ used , and you cannot make a dec@@ ision ."
"So , while you &apos;re trying to make up your mind what the doc@@ tor , the sur@@ ge@@ on , is doing while he &apos;s h@@ ac@@ king away at your body , he &apos;s long gone ."
He &apos;s at home having te@@ a .
"( Laughter ) So , when you wal@@ k up to a do@@ or and you open it , what you comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely have to do to per@@ ce@@ ive is to make dec@@ is@@ ions , thousands of dec@@ is@@ ions about the size of the room , the w@@ all@@ s , the he@@ ight , the ob@@ jects in this room ."
9@@ 9 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the ey@@ es .
It is what you in@@ fer about that room .
"So I can say , with some certain@@ ty , &quot; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"But I cannot say , &quot; &quot; You think , ther@@ e@@ fore you are , &quot; &quot; because &quot; &quot; you &quot; &quot; are within my per@@ cep@@ tual b@@ ub@@ ble ."
"Now , we can spec@@ ul@@ ate and philosoph@@ ize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years ."
We can ask a very con@@ cre@@ te question .
&quot; C@@ an the brain build such a per@@ cep@@ tion ? &quot;
I@@ s it cap@@ able of doing it ?
D@@ o@@ es it have the sub@@ st@@ ance to do it ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to descri@@ be to you today .
"So , it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain ."
It had to impro@@ ve it a little bit .
"It had to ad@@ d to the fron@@ t@@ al part , so that you would have inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts , because they had to c@@ ope on land ."
But the real big step was the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x .
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
"The ma@@ m@@ m@@ als needed it because they had to c@@ ope with par@@ en@@ th@@ ood , social inter@@ ac@@ tions , compl@@ ex co@@ gn@@ itive func@@ tions ."
"So , you can think of the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x actually as the ul@@ ti@@ mate solu@@ tion today , of the universe as we know it ."
"It &apos;s the p@@ in@@ nac@@ le , it &apos;s the fin@@ al produc@@ t that the universe has produc@@ ed ."
"It was so success@@ ful in evolution that from mo@@ use to man it exp@@ and@@ ed about a thousan@@ d@@ f@@ old in terms of the numbers of neurons , to produc@@ e this almost fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing or@@ gan , structure ."
And it has not st@@ op@@ ped its evolu@@ tion@@ ary pat@@ h .
"In fact , the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x in the human brain is evol@@ v@@ ing at an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us spe@@ ed ."
"If you zo@@ om into the sur@@ face of the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x , you disc@@ over that it &apos;s made up of little mod@@ ul@@ es , G@@ 5 proc@@ ess@@ ors , like in a computer ."
But there are about a million of them .
They were so success@@ ful in evolution that what we did was to du@@ plic@@ ate them over and over and ad@@ d more and more of them to the brain until we ra@@ n out of space in the sk@@ ul@@ l .
"And the brain started to f@@ old in on itself , and that &apos;s why the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x is so high@@ ly con@@ vol@@ ut@@ ed ."
"We &apos;re just p@@ ac@@ king in col@@ um@@ n@@ s , so that we &apos;d have more ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n@@ s to per@@ form more compl@@ ex func@@ tions ."
"So you can think of the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x actually as a massive gr@@ and pi@@ an@@ o , a mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ k@@ ey gr@@ and pi@@ an@@ o ."
E@@ ach of these ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n@@ s would produc@@ e a not@@ e .
You s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ate it ; it produc@@ es a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y .
But it &apos;s not just a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y of per@@ cep@@ tion .
"It &apos;s a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y of your universe , your reality ."
"Now , of course it takes years to learn how to ma@@ st@@ er a gr@@ and pi@@ an@@ o with a million ke@@ ys ."
"That &apos;s why you have to sen@@ d your kids to good scho@@ ols , h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly even@@ tually to O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
But it &apos;s not only education .
It &apos;s also gen@@ e@@ tics .
"You may be born l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , where you know how to ma@@ st@@ er your ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n , and you can play a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y ."
"In fact , there is a new theory of aut@@ ism called the &quot; &quot; in@@ ten@@ se world &quot; &quot; theory , which su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n@@ s are super@@ -@@ col@@ um@@ n@@ s ."
"They are high@@ ly re@@ ac@@ tive , and they are super@@ -@@ pl@@ as@@ tic , and so the aut@@ ists are probably cap@@ able of building and learning a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y which is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able for us ."
"But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these col@@ um@@ n@@ s , the not@@ e is going to be off ."
"The per@@ cep@@ tion , the sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y that you create is going to be cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ted , and you will have sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms of disease ."
"So , the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il for neuro@@ science is really to understand the des@@ ign of the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ it@@ ical col@@ um@@ n — and it &apos;s not just for neuro@@ science ; it &apos;s perhaps to understand per@@ cep@@ tion , to understand reality , and perhaps to even also understand physical reality ."
"So , what we did was , for the past 15 years , was to dis@@ s@@ ect out the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x , sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically ."
It &apos;s a bit like going and cat@@ al@@ o@@ ging a piece of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est .
How many tre@@ es does it have ?
What shap@@ es are the tre@@ es ?
How many of each typ@@ e of t@@ ree do you have ? Wh@@ ere are they pos@@ it@@ ion@@ ed ?
"But it &apos;s a bit more than cat@@ al@@ o@@ ging because you actually have to descri@@ be and disc@@ over all the rul@@ es of commun@@ ic@@ ation , the rul@@ es of connec@@ ti@@ vity , because the neurons don &apos;t just like to con@@ n@@ ect with any neuro@@ n ."
They cho@@ ose very care@@ fully who they con@@ n@@ ect with .
It &apos;s also more than cat@@ al@@ o@@ ging because you actually have to build thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al dig@@ ital mod@@ els of them .
"And we did that for ten@@ s of thousands of neurons , built dig@@ ital mod@@ els of all the different typ@@ es of neurons we came across ."
"And once you have that , you can actually be@@ gin to build the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n ."
And here we &apos;re co@@ il@@ ing them up .
"But as you do this , what you see is that the br@@ an@@ ch@@ es inter@@ s@@ ect actually in mil@@ lions of loc@@ ations , and at each of these inter@@ sec@@ tions they can form a sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se ."
And a sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se is a chem@@ ical loc@@ ation where they commun@@ ic@@ ate with each other .
And these sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses together form the n@@ et@@ work or the cir@@ cu@@ it of the brain .
"Now , the cir@@ cu@@ it , you could also think of as the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the brain ."
"And when you think of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? What is the pat@@ tern of the car@@ p@@ et ?"
"You real@@ ize that this pos@@ es a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain , and es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally to a theory that says that there is some reality that em@@ er@@ g@@ es out of this car@@ p@@ et , out of this particular car@@ p@@ et with a particular pat@@ tern ."
The reason is because the most important des@@ ign sec@@ ret of the brain is d@@ iver@@ sity .
E@@ very neuro@@ n is different .
It &apos;s the same in the for@@ est . E@@ very p@@ ine t@@ ree is different .
"You may have many different typ@@ es of tre@@ es , but every p@@ ine t@@ ree is different . And in the brain it &apos;s the same ."
"So there is no neuro@@ n in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuro@@ n in my brain that is the same as in your@@ s ."
And your neurons are not going to be ori@@ ented and pos@@ it@@ ion@@ ed in exactly the same way .
And you may have more or less neurons .
"So it &apos;s very un@@ likely that you got the same f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry ."
"So , how could we possi@@ bly create a reality that we can even understand each other ?"
"Well , we don &apos;t have to spec@@ ul@@ ate ."
We can look at all 10 million sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses now .
We can look at the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c . And we can change neurons .
We can use different neurons with different vari@@ ations .
"We can position them in different places , ori@@ ent them in different places ."
We can use less or more of them .
And when we do that what we discover@@ ed is that the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry does change .
But the pat@@ tern of how the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry is des@@ ign@@ ed does not .
"So , the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the brain , even though your brain may be sm@@ all@@ er , big@@ ger , it may have different typ@@ es of neurons , different mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ es of neurons , we actually do share the same f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c ."
"And we think this is speci@@ es@@ -@@ spec@@ if@@ ic , which means that that could explain why we can &apos;t commun@@ ic@@ ate across spec@@ ies ."
"So , let &apos;s s@@ w@@ it@@ ch it on . But to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come al@@ ive ."
"We make it come al@@ ive with equ@@ ations , a lot of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics ."
"And , in fact , the equ@@ ations that make neurons into elec@@ tr@@ ical gener@@ at@@ ors were discover@@ ed by two C@@ am@@ br@@ id@@ ge N@@ ob@@ el Lau@@ re@@ ates ."
"So , we have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics to make neurons come al@@ ive ."
"We also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics to descri@@ be how neurons coll@@ ect information , and how they create a little ligh@@ t@@ ning b@@ ol@@ t to commun@@ ic@@ ate with each other ."
"And when they get to the sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se , what they do is they effec@@ ti@@ vely , liter@@ ally , sh@@ oc@@ k the sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se ."
It &apos;s like elec@@ tr@@ ical sh@@ oc@@ k that rel@@ eas@@ es the chem@@ ic@@ als from these sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses .
And we &apos;ve got the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics to descri@@ be this process .
So we can descri@@ be the commun@@ ic@@ ation between the neurons .
There liter@@ ally are only a h@@ and@@ ful of equ@@ ations that you need to sim@@ ul@@ ate the acti@@ vity of the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x .
But what you do need is a very big computer .
And in fact you need one l@@ ap@@ top to do all the cal@@ cul@@ ations just for one neuro@@ n .
"So you need 1@@ 0,000 l@@ ap@@ t@@ op@@ s ."
"So where do you go ? You go to I@@ B@@ M , and you get a super@@ computer , because they know how to take 1@@ 0,000 l@@ ap@@ t@@ op@@ s and put it into the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or ."
So now we have this B@@ l@@ ue G@@ en@@ e super@@ computer .
"We can lo@@ ad up all the neurons , each one on to its proc@@ ess@@ or , and fir@@ e it up , and see what happens ."
T@@ ake the mag@@ ic car@@ p@@ et for a r@@ ide .
Here we acti@@ v@@ ate it . And this giv@@ es the first g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of what is happening in your brain when there is a s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ation .
It &apos;s the first view .
"Now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; My go@@ d . How is reality coming out of that ? &quot;"
"But , in fact , you can start , even though we hav@@ en &apos;t tra@@ ined this ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n to create a spec@@ if@@ ic reality ."
"But we can ask , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere is the ro@@ se ? &quot; &quot; We can ask , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere is it inside , if we s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ate it with a picture ? &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere is it inside the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x ?"
U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely it &apos;s got to be there if we s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ated it with it .
"So , the way that we can look at that is to ign@@ ore the neurons , ign@@ ore the sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses , and look just at the ra@@ w elec@@ tr@@ ical acti@@ vity ."
Because that is what it &apos;s cre@@ ating .
It &apos;s cre@@ ating elec@@ tr@@ ical patterns .
"So when we did this , we inde@@ ed , for the first time , saw these gh@@ o@@ st@@ -@@ like struc@@ tures : elec@@ tr@@ ical ob@@ jects ap@@ pe@@ aring within the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ tical col@@ um@@ n ."
And it &apos;s these elec@@ tr@@ ical ob@@ jects that are hol@@ ding all the information about wh@@ at@@ ever s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ated it .
"And then when we zo@@ om@@ ed into this , it &apos;s like a ver@@ it@@ able universe ."
So the next step is just to take these brain co@@ ordin@@ ates and to pro@@ ject them into per@@ cep@@ tual space .
"And if you do that , you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine , by this piece of the brain ."
"So , in sum@@ mar@@ y , I think that the universe may have — it &apos;s possible — evol@@ ved a brain to see itself , which may be a first step in becom@@ ing aw@@ are of itself ."
"There is a lot more to do to test these the@@ or@@ ies , and to test any other the@@ or@@ ies ."
But I hope that you are at le@@ ast par@@ tly con@@ vin@@ ced that it is not im@@ possible to build a brain .
"We can do it within 10 years , and if we do suc@@ ce@@ ed , we will sen@@ d to TE@@ D , in 10 years , a h@@ olog@@ ram to talk to you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man out there , some@@ where , who looks a little bit like the ac@@ tor I@@ d@@ ris E@@ l@@ b@@ a , or at le@@ ast he did 20 years ago ."
"And I did exactly what you &apos;re not sup@@ posed to do , which is s@@ wer@@ ve to av@@ o@@ id it ."
( Applause ) I tell you all of this because the ev@@ ents of that night changed the course of my life to some de@@ gre@@ e .
"Wh@@ ere does it come from , and how does it devel@@ op , and what are the extre@@ me for@@ ms that it can take ?"
So it &apos;s a sel@@ fl@@ ess act in@@ ten@@ ded to ben@@ ef@@ it only the other .
And the answer may be that the bra@@ ins of high@@ ly al@@ tr@@ u@@ is@@ tic people are different in fundamental ways .
"P@@ sych@@ op@@ a@@ thy is a develop@@ mental dis@@ order with st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly gen@@ e@@ tic or@@ ig@@ ins , and it results in a person@@ ality that &apos;s c@@ old and un@@ car@@ ing and a ten@@ den@@ cy to en@@ ga@@ ge in ant@@ is@@ o@@ ci@@ al and sometimes very viol@@ ent behavior ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , al@@ though they &apos;re not gener@@ ally in@@ sen@@ sit@@ ive to other people &apos;s emo@@ tions , they are in@@ sen@@ sit@@ ive to sign@@ s that other people are in dis@@ t@@ ress ."
"And in particular , they have diffic@@ ul@@ ty reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing fe@@ ar@@ ful f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions like this one ."
So these are people who have vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed to under@@ go maj@@ or sur@@ ger@@ y so that one of their own heal@@ thy kid@@ ne@@ ys can be re@@ mov@@ ed and trans@@ plan@@ ted into a very ill stran@@ ger that they &apos;ve never me@@ t and may never me@@ et .
They are better at reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing other people &apos;s fear .
They &apos;re liter@@ ally better at det@@ ec@@ ting when somebody else is in dis@@ t@@ ress .
This may be in part because their am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is more re@@ ac@@ tive to these ex@@ pres@@ sions .
H@@ i .
Thank you .
&#91; J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer B@@ re@@ a is s@@ oun@@ d@@ -@@ sen@@ sit@@ ive .
"The live audi@@ ence was asked to ap@@ pl@@ au@@ d A@@ S@@ L@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le , in sil@@ ence . &#93; So , five years ago , this was me ."
Th@@ en one day I had a f@@ ever of 1@@ 0@@ 4@@ .@@ 7 de@@ gre@@ es .
"I probably should have gone to the doc@@ tor , but I &apos;d never really been sic@@ k in my life , and I knew that us@@ u@@ ally , if you have a vir@@ us , you st@@ ay home and you make some ch@@ ic@@ ken s@@ ou@@ p , and in a few days , everything will be fin@@ e ."
But this time it wasn &apos;t fin@@ e .
"A@@ f@@ ter the f@@ ever bro@@ ke , for three weeks I was so di@@ z@@ zy , I couldn &apos;t leave my h@@ ou@@ se ."
I would wal@@ k stra@@ ight into do@@ or f@@ rames .
I had to hu@@ g the w@@ all@@ s just to make it to the ba@@ th@@ room .
"That sp@@ r@@ ing I got in@@ fec@@ tion after in@@ fec@@ tion , and every time I went to the doc@@ tor , he said there was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely nothing wrong ."
Ma@@ ybe this is what it &apos;s like to be on the other side of 25 .
( Laughter ) Th@@ en the neuro@@ log@@ ical sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms started .
S@@ ome@@ times I would find that I couldn &apos;t dra@@ w the right side of a cir@@ cle .
O@@ ther times I wouldn &apos;t be able to spe@@ ak or move at all .
"I saw every kind of speci@@ al@@ ist : in@@ fec@@ ti@@ ous disease doc@@ tors , der@@ mat@@ olog@@ ists , en@@ doc@@ r@@ in@@ olog@@ ists , car@@ di@@ olog@@ ists ."
I even saw a psych@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ist .
"M@@ y psych@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ist said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s c@@ lear you &apos;re really sic@@ k , but not with anything psych@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c ."
"I hope they can find out what &apos;s wrong with you . &quot; &quot; The next day , my neuro@@ log@@ ist diagno@@ sed me with con@@ ver@@ sion dis@@ order ."
"He told me that everything — the f@@ ev@@ ers , the sor@@ e th@@ ro@@ at@@ s , the sin@@ us in@@ fec@@ tion , all of the ga@@ st@@ ro@@ in@@ tes@@ tin@@ al , neuro@@ log@@ ical and car@@ di@@ ac sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms — were being ca@@ used by some dis@@ t@@ ant emo@@ tional tra@@ u@@ ma that I could not remember ."
"The sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms were real , he said , but they had no bi@@ ological cause ."
I was tra@@ ining to be a social scient@@ ist .
"I had stu@@ died stat@@ is@@ tics , prob@@ ability theory , ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical mod@@ el@@ ing , experim@@ ental des@@ ign ."
I fel@@ t like I couldn &apos;t just re@@ ject my neuro@@ log@@ ist &apos;s diagno@@ sis .
"It didn &apos;t feel true , but I knew from my tra@@ ining that the tr@@ uth is often coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ itive , so eas@@ ily ob@@ sc@@ ured by what we want to believe ."
So I had to consid@@ er the possi@@ bility that he was right .
"That day , I ra@@ n a small experiment ."
"I wal@@ ked back the two mil@@ es from my neuro@@ log@@ ist &apos;s off@@ ice to my h@@ ou@@ se , my le@@ gs w@@ ra@@ pped in this stran@@ ge , almost elec@@ tri@@ c kind of pa@@ in ."
"I me@@ dit@@ ated on that pa@@ in , con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating how my mind could have possi@@ bly gener@@ ated all this ."
My brain and my sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d were b@@ urn@@ ing .
"M@@ y nec@@ k was so s@@ ti@@ f@@ f I couldn &apos;t tou@@ ch my ch@@ in to my ch@@ est , and the s@@ ligh@@ test sound — the ru@@ st@@ ling of the she@@ ets , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and wal@@ king b@@ are@@ fo@@ ot in the next room — could cause exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating pa@@ in ."
I would sp@@ end most of the next two years in bed .
How could my doc@@ tor have g@@ ot@@ ten it so wrong ?
"I thought I had a r@@ are disease , something doc@@ tors had never seen ."
I was diagno@@ sed with my@@ al@@ g@@ ic en@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ om@@ y@@ el@@ it@@ is .
"If my h@@ us@@ b@@ and goes for a run , he might be sor@@ e for a couple of days ."
It is a per@@ fect cu@@ st@@ om pris@@ on .
"It &apos;s been four years , and I &apos;ve still never been as well as I was the min@@ ute before I wal@@ ked home from my neuro@@ log@@ ist &apos;s off@@ ice ."
"In the U@@ S , where I &apos;m from , it &apos;s about one million people ."
How could a disease this common and this dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating have been for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten by medic@@ ine ?
The R@@ o@@ man physic@@ ian G@@ al@@ en thought that hy@@ ster@@ ia was ca@@ used by s@@ ex@@ ual de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation in particul@@ arly pas@@ sion@@ ate women .
"The Gre@@ e@@ ks thought the ut@@ er@@ us would liter@@ ally d@@ ry up and w@@ and@@ er around the body in se@@ arch of mo@@ ist@@ ure , pres@@ sing on inter@@ n@@ al organs — y@@ es — ca@@ using sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms from extre@@ me emo@@ tions to di@@ z@@ z@@ iness and par@@ al@@ y@@ sis ."
The c@@ ure was marri@@ age and mo@@ ther@@ ho@@ od .
"A@@ ll of these ou@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ s have ten@@ ded to dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately af@@ fect women , and in time , when doc@@ tors fa@@ il@@ ed to find the one cause of the disease , they thought that these ou@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ s were mass hy@@ ster@@ ia ."
Why has this idea had such st@@ a@@ ying power ?
"They want to know the answer , and this cat@@ eg@@ ory al@@ lo@@ ws doc@@ tors to treat what would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise be un@@ treat@@ able , to explain ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es that have no ex@@ plan@@ ation ."
The problem is that this can cause real har@@ m .
"In the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , a psych@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ist n@@ amed E@@ li@@ ot S@@ later stu@@ died a co@@ hor@@ t of 8@@ 5 patients who had been diagno@@ sed with hy@@ ster@@ ia ."
"@@ N@@ ine years later , 12 of them were de@@ ad and 30 had become disa@@ bl@@ ed ."
"A@@ ll around the world , M@@ E is one of the le@@ ast f@@ und@@ ed dis@@ eas@@ es ."
"In the U@@ S , we sp@@ end each year rou@@ gh@@ ly 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 dollars per A@@ I@@ D@@ S pati@@ ent , 2@@ 50 dollars per M@@ S pati@@ ent and just 5 dollars per year per M@@ E pati@@ ent ."
This was not just ligh@@ t@@ ning .
I was not just un@@ l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
"The ign@@ or@@ ance sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing my disease has been a cho@@ ice , a cho@@ ice made by the inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions that were sup@@ posed to pro@@ t@@ ect us ."
"A@@ no@@ ther woman with ov@@ arian cancer , who for years was told that it was just early men@@ op@@ ause ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e the hy@@ ster@@ ia of old , this has everything to do with gen@@ der and with wh@@ ose stories we believe ."
"S@@ ev@@ ent@@ y-@@ five percent of aut@@ o@@ im@@ mun@@ e disease patients are women , and in some dis@@ eas@@ es , it &apos;s as high as 90 percent ."
And men may even have a more difficult time getting diagno@@ sed .
My brain is not what it used to be .
"@@ Here &apos;s the good part : des@@ p@@ ite everything , I still have hope ."
So many dis@@ eas@@ es were once thought of as psych@@ ological until science un@@ c@@ over@@ ed their bi@@ ological me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ eve things that seem to de@@ f@@ y all of the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ?"
F@@ or example : Why is Ap@@ ple so in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ?
"Y@@ e@@ ar after year , after year , they &apos;re more in@@ no@@ v@@ ative than all their comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer compan@@ y ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing led the C@@ iv@@ il R@@ igh@@ ts M@@ ov@@ ement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suf@@ fer@@ ed in pre@@ -@@ civ@@ il ri@@ gh@@ ts America , and he certain@@ ly wasn &apos;t the only great o@@ rat@@ or of the day ."
"And this discover@@ y prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly changed the way in which I oper@@ ate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a pat@@ tern ."
And it &apos;s the complet@@ e op@@ pos@@ ite to everyone else .
"A@@ ll I did was co@@ dif@@ y it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s sim@@ pl@@ est idea ."
I call it the gol@@ den cir@@ cle .
This little idea expla@@ ins why some organiz@@ ations and some lead@@ ers are able to insp@@ ire where others ar@@ en &apos;t .
Let me defin@@ e the terms really qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
"E@@ very single person , every single organiz@@ ation on the planet kno@@ ws what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organiz@@ ations know why they do what they do ."
"B@@ y &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your pur@@ pose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your beli@@ ef ?
Why do you get out of bed in the mor@@ ning ?
I use Ap@@ ple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beauti@@ fully des@@ ign@@ ed , simple to use and us@@ er fri@@ end@@ ly ."
Here &apos;s how Ap@@ ple actually commun@@ ic@@ ates .
"&quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing we do , we believe in chall@@ eng@@ ing the stat@@ us qu@@ o ."
We believe in thinking differ@@ ently .
We just happen to make great comput@@ ers .
"But we &apos;re also per@@ fec@@ tly com@@ for@@ table bu@@ ying an M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er from Ap@@ ple , or a ph@@ one from Ap@@ ple , or a D@@ V@@ R from Ap@@ ple ."
Th@@ e@@ ir comp@@ et@@ it@@ ors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ at@@ e@@ way came out with fl@@ at@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re em@@ in@@ ently qu@@ ali@@ fied to make fl@@ at@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
N@@ ob@@ ody b@@ ou@@ ght one .
It &apos;s all gro@@ und@@ ed in the ten@@ ets of bi@@ ology .
"@@ Not psych@@ ology , bi@@ ology ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ w@@ est brain , our H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pi@@ en brain , our ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x is respon@@ si@@ ble for all of our ra@@ tional and anal@@ y@@ tical thought and language .
"The middle two sec@@ tions make up our lim@@ b@@ ic bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ b@@ ic bra@@ ins are respon@@ si@@ ble for all of our feel@@ ings , like tr@@ ust and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t dr@@ ive behavior .
This is where g@@ ut dec@@ is@@ ions come from .
The go@@ al is not just to h@@ ire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to h@@ ire people who believe what you believe .
M@@ o@@ st people don &apos;t know about S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ le@@ y .
"And S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ le@@ y had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for success ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He hi@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the market con@@ dit@@ ions were f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic .
"The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es fol@@ lowed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for L@@ ang@@ le@@ y ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ le@@ y ?
"The difference was , O@@ r@@ vil@@ le and W@@ il@@ b@@ ur were driv@@ en by a cause , by a pur@@ pose , by a beli@@ ef ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could figure out this fl@@ ying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the res@@ ult .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the ri@@ ch@@ es .
"And lo and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the pa@@ y@@ ch@@ ec@@ k .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get r@@ ich , he didn &apos;t get f@@ amo@@ us , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to at@@ trac@@ t those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early ad@@ op@@ ters .
"And these gu@@ ys , the in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors and the early ad@@ op@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ for@@ table making those g@@ ut dec@@ is@@ ions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that pro@@ ve what they believe ."
"So let me give you a f@@ amo@@ us example , a f@@ amo@@ us fa@@ il@@ ure and a f@@ amo@@ us success of the la@@ w of dif@@ f@@ us@@ ion of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al example .
I Ti@@ V@@ o stuff on my pi@@ ec@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ ime W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their st@@ oc@@ k was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never t@@ rad@@ ed ab@@ ove 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the sum@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people sho@@ wed up on the m@@ all in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing spe@@ ak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them sho@@ wed up for him ?
They sho@@ wed up for themselves .
"We fol@@ lowed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are lead@@ ers and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ L@@ e@@ ad@@ ers hold a position of power or au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , but those who le@@ ad insp@@ ire us ."
So I &apos;m going to spe@@ ak about a problem that I have and that &apos;s that I &apos;m a philosoph@@ er .
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en I go to a par@@ ty and people ask me what do I do and I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a prof@@ ess@@ or , &quot; &quot; their ey@@ es gl@@ aze over ."
"When I go to an ac@@ ade@@ mic co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ty and there are all the prof@@ ess@@ ors around , they ask me what field I &apos;m in and I say , &quot; &quot; philosoph@@ y &quot; &quot; — their ey@@ es gl@@ aze over ."
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en I go to a philosoph@@ er &apos;s par@@ ty ( Laughter ) and they ask me what I work on and I say , &quot; &quot; consciousness , &quot; &quot; their ey@@ es don &apos;t gl@@ aze over — their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a s@@ nar@@ l . ( Laughter )"
"And I get ho@@ ots of der@@ ision and c@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and grow@@ ls because they think , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s im@@ possible ! You can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot; &quot; The very ch@@ ut@@ z@@ pa@@ h of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question ."
"M@@ y l@@ ate , l@@ am@@ ented fri@@ end B@@ ob N@@ o@@ z@@ ic@@ k , a fin@@ e philosoph@@ er , in one of his bo@@ o@@ ks , &quot; &quot; P@@ h@@ ilosoph@@ ical E@@ x@@ plan@@ ations , &quot; &quot; is com@@ m@@ ent@@ ing on the e@@ th@@ os of philosoph@@ y — the way philosoph@@ ers go about their business ."
"And he says , you know , &quot; &quot; P@@ h@@ ilosoph@@ ers love ra@@ tional argum@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; It seems as if the ide@@ al argum@@ ent for most philosoph@@ ers is you give your audi@@ ence the pre@@ mis@@ es and then you give them the in@@ fer@@ ences and the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , and if they don &apos;t ac@@ cept the con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , they die ."
Th@@ e@@ ir head@@ s explo@@ de . &quot; &quot; The idea is to have an argum@@ ent that is so power@@ ful that it kno@@ c@@ ks out your op@@ pon@@ ents .
But in fact that doesn &apos;t change people &apos;s min@@ ds at all .
"It &apos;s very hard to change people &apos;s min@@ ds about something like consciousness , and I finally fig@@ ured out the reason for that ."
The reason for that is that everybody &apos;s an exper@@ t on consciousness .
We heard the other day that everybody &apos;s got a st@@ rong op@@ in@@ ion about video gam@@ es .
"They all have an idea for a video ga@@ me , even if they &apos;re not exp@@ erts ."
But they don &apos;t consid@@ er themselves exp@@ erts on video gam@@ es ; they &apos;ve just got st@@ rong op@@ in@@ ions .
"I &apos;m sure that people here who work on , say , cli@@ mate change and global war@@ m@@ ing , or on the future of the In@@ tern@@ et , en@@ coun@@ ter people who have very st@@ rong op@@ in@@ ions about what &apos;s going to happen next ."
But they probably don &apos;t think of these op@@ in@@ ions as exp@@ ert@@ ise .
They &apos;re just st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly hel@@ d op@@ in@@ ions .
"But with re@@ gar@@ d to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; &quot; I am an exper@@ t ."
"S@@ im@@ p@@ ly by being consci@@ ous , I know all about this . &quot; &quot; And so , you tell them your theory and they say , &quot; &quot; No , no , that &apos;s not the way consciousness is !@@ "
"@@ No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot; &quot; And they say this with an amazing con@@ f@@ idence ."
And so what I &apos;m going to try to do today is to sh@@ ake your con@@ f@@ idence . Because I know the feel@@ ing — I can feel it my@@ self .
"I want to sh@@ ake your con@@ f@@ idence that you know your own in@@ ner@@ most min@@ ds — that you are , your@@ selves , au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ative about your own consciousness ."
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
"Now , this n@@ ice picture sho@@ ws a thou@@ gh@@ t-@@ bal@@ lo@@ on , a thou@@ gh@@ t-@@ b@@ ub@@ ble ."
I think everybody underst@@ an@@ ds what that means .
That &apos;s sup@@ posed to ex@@ h@@ ib@@ it the stre@@ am of consciousness .
This is my fav@@ or@@ ite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
It &apos;s a S@@ au@@ l S@@ te@@ in@@ ber@@ g of course — it was a New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er c@@ over .
And this fel@@ low here is looking at the pain@@ ting by B@@ ra@@ qu@@ e .
"That re@@ min@@ ds him of the word bar@@ o@@ qu@@ e , bar@@ ra@@ c@@ k , bar@@ k , po@@ od@@ le , S@@ uz@@ an@@ ne R@@ . — he &apos;s off to the ra@@ ces ."
"There &apos;s a wonderful stre@@ am of consciousness here and if you fol@@ low it along , you learn a lot about this man ."
"What I particul@@ arly like about this picture , too , is that S@@ te@@ in@@ ber@@ g has ren@@ der@@ ed the guy in this sort of poin@@ t@@ ill@@ ist st@@ y@@ le ."
"Wh@@ ich re@@ min@@ ds us , as R@@ od B@@ ro@@ o@@ ks was saying y@@ es@@ ter@@ day : what we are , what each of us is — what you are , what I am — is appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely 100 tr@@ il@@ lion little cel@@ l@@ ul@@ ar rob@@ ots ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
"@@ No other in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents at all . We &apos;re just made of cells , about 100 tr@@ il@@ lion of them ."
"@@ Not a single one of those cells is consci@@ ous ; not a single one of those cells kno@@ ws who you are , or car@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ how , we have to explain how when you put together te@@ ams , ar@@ mi@@ es , b@@ at@@ tal@@ ions of hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ lions of little rob@@ ot@@ ic un@@ consci@@ ous cells — not so different really from a bac@@ ter@@ i@@ um , each one of them — the res@@ ult is this . I mean , just look at it ."
"The cont@@ ent — there &apos;s c@@ olo@@ r , there &apos;s ideas , there &apos;s me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es , there &apos;s history . And some@@ how all that cont@@ ent of consciousness is ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed by the bus@@ y acti@@ vity of those ho@@ ar@@ ds of neurons ."
How is that possible ? M@@ any people just think it isn &apos;t possible at all .
"They think , &quot; &quot; No , there can &apos;t be any sort of nat@@ ur@@ al@@ is@@ tic ex@@ plan@@ ation of consciousness . &quot; &quot; This is a lo@@ vely book by a fri@@ end of mine n@@ amed L@@ e@@ e S@@ i@@ eg@@ el , who &apos;s a prof@@ ess@@ or of relig@@ ion , actually , at the Un@@ iver@@ sity of H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i , and he &apos;s an exper@@ t mag@@ ician , and an exper@@ t on the stre@@ et mag@@ ic of India , which is what this book is about , &quot; N@@ et of M@@ ag@@ ic . &quot;"
And there &apos;s a pas@@ sa@@ ge in it which I would love to share with you .
It speak@@ s so el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently to the problem .
"&quot; &quot; &apos; I &apos;m writ@@ ing a book on mag@@ ic , &apos; I explain , and I &apos;m asked , &apos; R@@ e@@ al mag@@ ic ? &apos; B@@ y &apos; real mag@@ ic , &apos; people mean mi@@ ra@@ cl@@ es , th@@ au@@ mat@@ ur@@ g@@ ical ac@@ ts , and super@@ natural po@@ w@@ ers ."
"@@ &apos;@@ No , &apos; I answer . &apos; Con@@ j@@ uring tric@@ ks , not real mag@@ ic . &apos; &apos; R@@ e@@ al mag@@ ic , &apos; in other words , re@@ fer@@ s to the mag@@ ic that is not real ; while the mag@@ ic that is real , that can actually be done , is not real mag@@ ic . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s the way a lot of people feel about consciousness . ( Laughter )"
R@@ e@@ al consciousness is not a ba@@ g of tric@@ ks .
"If you &apos;re going to explain this as a ba@@ g of tric@@ ks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , wh@@ at@@ ever it is ."
"And , as Mar@@ vin said , and as other people have said , &quot; Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is a ba@@ g of tric@@ ks . &quot;"
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dis@@ sat@@ is@@ fied and incre@@ d@@ ul@@ ous when I at@@ tem@@ pt to explain consciousness .
"So this is the problem . So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a mag@@ ic tric@@ k expla@@ ined to you ."
"@@ How many of you here , if somebody — some s@@ mart al@@ ec@@ k — star@@ ts telling you how a particular mag@@ ic tric@@ k is done , you sort of want to bloc@@ k your e@@ ars and say , &quot; &quot; No , no , I don &apos;t want to know !@@ "
D@@ on &apos;t take the th@@ r@@ ill of it away . I &apos;d rather be my@@ s@@ ti@@ fied .
"D@@ on &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot; &quot; A lot of people feel that way about consciousness , I &apos;ve discover@@ ed ."
"And I &apos;m sor@@ ry if I im@@ pose some cl@@ ar@@ ity , some understanding on you ."
You &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tric@@ ks .
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosoph@@ ers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosoph@@ er expla@@ ins the sa@@ w@@ ing@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ad@@ y-@@ in@@ -@@ half tric@@ k .
You know the sa@@ w@@ ing@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ad@@ y-@@ in@@ -@@ half tric@@ k ?
"The philosoph@@ er says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to explain to you how that &apos;s done ."
"You see , the mag@@ ician doesn &apos;t really saw the l@@ ad@@ y in half . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; He mer@@ ely makes you think that he does . &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , and how does he do that ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , that &apos;s not my de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m going to ill@@ ust@@ rate how philosoph@@ ers explain consciousness ."
But I &apos;m going to try to also show you that consciousness isn &apos;t quite as mar@@ vel@@ ous — your own consciousness isn &apos;t quite as wonderful — as you may have thought it is .
"This is something , by the way , that L@@ e@@ e S@@ i@@ eg@@ el tal@@ ks about in his book ."
"He mar@@ vel@@ s at how he &apos;ll do a mag@@ ic show , and af@@ ter@@ wards people will s@@ we@@ ar they saw him do X , Y , and Z@@ . He never did those things ."
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
P@@ eople &apos;s me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es in@@ fl@@ ate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
"Now , let &apos;s see if this will work . All right . Let &apos;s just wat@@ ch this ."
W@@ at@@ ch it care@@ fully .
"I &apos;m working with a young comput@@ er@@ -@@ an@@ i@@ mat@@ or doc@@ um@@ ent@@ arian n@@ amed N@@ ic@@ k D@@ e@@ am@@ er , and this is a little de@@ m@@ o that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larg@@ er pro@@ ject some of you may be interes@@ ted in ."
We &apos;re looking for a bac@@ k@@ er .
It &apos;s a fe@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ l@@ eng@@ th doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary on consciousness .
"O@@ K , now , you all saw what changed , right ?"
How many of you not@@ ic@@ ed that every one of those s@@ qu@@ ar@@ es changed c@@ olo@@ r ?
E@@ very one . I &apos;ll just show you by run@@ ning it again .
"E@@ ven when you know that they &apos;re all going to change c@@ olo@@ r , it &apos;s very hard to not@@ ice . You have to really con@@ cent@@ rate to pic@@ k up any of the changes at all ."
"Now , this is an example — one of many — of a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that &apos;s now being stu@@ died quite a bit ."
"It &apos;s one that I predic@@ ted in the last p@@ age or two of my 19@@ 9@@ 1 book , &quot; &quot; Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness E@@ x@@ pla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; where I said if you did experim@@ ents of this sort , you &apos;d find that people were un@@ able to pic@@ k up really large changes ."
"If there &apos;s time at the end , I &apos;ll show you the much more dra@@ ma@@ tic case ."
"Now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aw@@ are of them ?"
"Well , ear@@ li@@ er today , J@@ ef@@ f H@@ aw@@ kin@@ s men@@ tion@@ ed the way your ey@@ e sac@@ c@@ ades , the way your ey@@ e mov@@ es around three or four times a second ."
"He didn &apos;t men@@ tion the spe@@ ed . Y@@ our ey@@ e is con@@ stan@@ tly in mo@@ tion , mov@@ ing around , looking at ey@@ es , no@@ ses , el@@ bo@@ ws , looking at interesting things in the world ."
"And where your ey@@ e isn &apos;t looking , you &apos;re re@@ mark@@ ably im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed in your vis@@ ion ."
"That &apos;s because the f@@ ov@@ e@@ al part of your ey@@ e , which is the high@@ -@@ res@@ olu@@ tion part , is only about the size of your th@@ um@@ b@@ na@@ il hel@@ d at ar@@ ms l@@ eng@@ th ."
That &apos;s the deta@@ il part .
"It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?"
"It doesn &apos;t seem that way , but that &apos;s the way it is ."
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
Here &apos;s a completely different ef@@ fect . This is a pain@@ ting by B@@ el@@ l@@ ot@@ to .
It &apos;s in the mus@@ e@@ um in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina .
B@@ el@@ l@@ ot@@ to was a stud@@ ent of C@@ anal@@ et@@ to &apos;s .
And I love pain@@ tin@@ gs like that — the pain@@ ting is actually about as big as it is right here .
"And I love C@@ anal@@ et@@ to@@ s , because C@@ anal@@ et@@ to has this f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic deta@@ il , and you can get right up and see all the deta@@ ils on the pain@@ ting ."
"And I started across the h@@ all in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina , because I thought it was probably a C@@ anal@@ et@@ to , and would have all that in deta@@ il ."
"And I not@@ ic@@ ed that on the br@@ id@@ ge there , there &apos;s a lot of people — you can just bar@@ ely see them wal@@ king across the br@@ id@@ ge ."
"And I thought as I got clo@@ s@@ er I would be able to see all the deta@@ il of most people , see their clo@@ th@@ es , and so for@@ th ."
"And as I got clo@@ s@@ er and clo@@ s@@ er , I actually scre@@ amed ."
"I y@@ el@@ led out because when I got clo@@ s@@ er , I found the deta@@ il wasn &apos;t there at all ."
There were just little art@@ fully plac@@ ed bl@@ obs of pain@@ t .
"And as I wal@@ ked to@@ wards the picture , I was expec@@ ting deta@@ il that wasn &apos;t there ."
"The art@@ ist had very cl@@ ever@@ ly su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted people and clo@@ th@@ es and w@@ ag@@ ons and all sor@@ ts of things , and my brain had taken the su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion ."
"You &apos;re famil@@ i@@ ar with a more rec@@ ent technology , which is — There , you can get a better view of the bl@@ obs ."
"S@@ e@@ e , when you get clo@@ se they &apos;re really just bl@@ obs of pain@@ t ."
You will have seen something like this — this is the re@@ ver@@ se ef@@ fect .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
"Now , what does your brain do when it takes the su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion ?"
"When an art@@ ful blo@@ b of pain@@ t or two , by an art@@ ist , su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts a person — say , one of Mar@@ vin M@@ in@@ sk@@ y &apos;s little society of mind — do they sen@@ d little pa@@ inter@@ s out to f@@ ill in all the deta@@ ils in your brain some@@ where ?"
"I don &apos;t think so . Not a chan@@ ce . But then , how on Earth is it done ?"
"Well , remember the philosoph@@ er &apos;s ex@@ plan@@ ation of the l@@ ad@@ y ?"
It &apos;s the same thing .
The brain just makes you think that it &apos;s got the deta@@ il there .
"You think the deta@@ il &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there ."
The brain isn &apos;t actually put@@ ting the deta@@ il in your head at all .
It &apos;s just making you exp@@ ect the deta@@ il .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
"I@@ s the shap@@ e on the left the same as the shap@@ e on the right , ro@@ t@@ ated ?"
Y@@ es .
"@@ How many of you did it by ro@@ t@@ ating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s ey@@ e , to see if it mat@@ ched up with the one on the right ?"
How many of you ro@@ t@@ ated the one on the right ? O@@ K .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s in fact been a very interesting deb@@ ate ra@@ ging for over 20 years in co@@ gn@@ itive science — vari@@ ous experim@@ ents started by R@@ o@@ ger S@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d , who meas@@ ured the an@@ gul@@ ar vel@@ oc@@ ity of ro@@ t@@ ation of mental imag@@ es ."
"Y@@ es , it &apos;s possible to do that ."
But the deta@@ ils of the process are still in si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant contro@@ ver@@ s@@ y .
"And if you read that liter@@ ature , one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you &apos;re the sub@@ ject in the experiment , you don &apos;t know ."
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beli@@ ef@@ s .
"And they come in a certain order , at a certain time ."
And what expla@@ ins the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
"Well , that &apos;s where you have to go bac@@ k@@ stage and ask the mag@@ ician ."
"This is a figure that I love : B@@ rad@@ le@@ y , P@@ et@@ ri@@ e , and D@@ u@@ ma@@ is ."
"You may think that I &apos;ve che@@ ated , that I &apos;ve put a little wh@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ white b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y there ."
"@@ How many of you see that sort of b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y , with the N@@ ec@@ k@@ er cu@@ be f@@ lo@@ ating in front of the cir@@ cl@@ es ?"
C@@ an you see it ?
"Well , you know , in ef@@ fect , the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y &apos;s really there , in a certain sense ."
"Y@@ our brain is actually comput@@ ing that b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y , the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y that goes right there ."
"But now , not@@ ice there are two ways of seeing the cu@@ be , right ?"
It &apos;s a N@@ ec@@ k@@ er cu@@ be .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body can see the two ways of seeing the cu@@ be ? O@@ K .
C@@ an you see the four ways of seeing the cu@@ be ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
"If you &apos;re seeing it as a cu@@ be f@@ lo@@ ating in front of some cir@@ cl@@ es , some black cir@@ cl@@ es , there &apos;s another way of seeing it ."
"As a cu@@ be , on a black bac@@ k@@ ground , as seen through a piece of S@@ w@@ is@@ s che@@ ese ."
( Laughter ) C@@ an you get it ? How many of you can &apos;t get it ? That &apos;ll help . ( Laughter )
Now you can get it . These are two very different ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena .
"When you see the cu@@ be one way , be@@ h@@ ind the scre@@ en , those b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies go away ."
"But there &apos;s still a sort of fil@@ ling in , as we can tell if we look at this ."
"We don &apos;t have any tro@@ ub@@ le seeing the cu@@ be , but where does the c@@ olo@@ r change ?"
D@@ o@@ es your brain have to sen@@ d little pa@@ inter@@ s in there ?
The pur@@ pl@@ e-@@ pa@@ inter@@ s and the gre@@ en@@ -@@ pa@@ inter@@ s fi@@ ght over who &apos;s going to pain@@ t that bit be@@ h@@ ind the cur@@ tain ? No .
Y@@ our brain just l@@ ets it go . The brain doesn &apos;t need to f@@ ill that in .
"When I first started talking about the B@@ rad@@ le@@ y , P@@ et@@ ri@@ e , D@@ u@@ ma@@ is example that you just saw — I &apos;ll go back to it , this one — I said that there was no fil@@ l@@ ing@@ -@@ in be@@ h@@ ind there ."
"And I sup@@ posed that that was just a fl@@ at tr@@ uth , always true ."
But R@@ ob V@@ an L@@ ier has rec@@ ently sho@@ wn that it isn &apos;t .
"Now , if you think you see some p@@ ale y@@ el@@ low — I &apos;ll run this a few more times ."
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok in the gra@@ y are@@ as , and see if you seem to see something sort of sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y mov@@ ing in there — ye@@ ah , it &apos;s amazing . There &apos;s nothing there . It &apos;s no tric@@ k ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; F@@ a@@ il@@ ure to D@@ et@@ ect Ch@@ ang@@ es in S@@ cen@@ es &quot; &quot; sl@@ ide &#93; This is R@@ on R@@ en@@ sin@@ k &apos;s work , which was in some de@@ gre@@ e insp@@ i@@ red by that su@@ g@@ ges@@ tion right at the end of the book ."
Let me just p@@ ause this for a second if I can .
This is chan@@ ge@@ -@@ bl@@ ind@@ ness .
"What you &apos;re going to see is two pic@@ tures , one of which is s@@ ligh@@ tly different from the other ."
"You see here the red ro@@ of and the gra@@ y ro@@ of , and in between them there will be a mas@@ k , which is just a bl@@ ank scre@@ en , for about a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a second ."
"So you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a mas@@ k , then the second picture , then a mas@@ k ."
"And this will just contin@@ ue , and your job as the sub@@ ject is to pres@@ s the b@@ ut@@ ton when you see the change ."
"So , show the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al picture for 2@@ 40 mil@@ l@@ is@@ econ@@ ds . B@@ l@@ ank ."
S@@ how the next picture for 2@@ 40 mil@@ l@@ is@@ econ@@ ds . B@@ l@@ ank .
"And keep going , until the sub@@ ject pres@@ ses the b@@ ut@@ ton , saying , &quot; I see the change . &quot;"
So now we &apos;re going to be sub@@ jects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . S@@ ome exam@@ pl@@ es .
No tro@@ ub@@ le there .
C@@ an everybody see ? All right .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , R@@ en@@ sin@@ k &apos;s sub@@ jects took only a little bit more than a second to pres@@ s the b@@ ut@@ ton ."
C@@ an you see that one ?
2@@ .@@ 9 secon@@ ds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the ro@@ of of that bar@@ n ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s easy .
I@@ s it a br@@ id@@ ge or a doc@@ k ?
"There are a few more really dra@@ ma@@ tic ones , and then I &apos;ll clo@@ se ."
I want you to see a few that are particul@@ arly st@@ ri@@ king .
This one because it &apos;s so large and yet it &apos;s pretty hard to see .
C@@ an you see it ?
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : Y@@ es .
D@@ an D@@ en@@ n@@ et@@ t : S@@ e@@ e the sh@@ ad@@ o@@ ws going back and for@@ th ? P@@ re@@ t@@ ty big .
So 1@@ 5@@ .@@ 5 secon@@ ds is the me@@ dian time for sub@@ jects in his experiment there .
"I love this one . I &apos;ll end with this one , just because it &apos;s such an ob@@ vi@@ ous and important thing ."
How many still don &apos;t see it ? How many still don &apos;t see it ?
How many en@@ gin@@ es on the wing of that B@@ o@@ e@@ ing ?
( Laughter ) R@@ ight in the middle of the picture !
Th@@ an@@ ks very much for your at@@ ten@@ tion .
"What I wanted to show you is that scient@@ ists , using their f@@ rom@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ outside , thir@@ d@@ -@@ person me@@ th@@ ods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dre@@ am of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity on your own consciousness that you think you are ."
And we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
"@@ J@@ ef@@ f H@@ aw@@ kin@@ s , this mor@@ ning , was descri@@ b@@ ing his at@@ tem@@ pt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuro@@ science ."
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
"H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ cho@@ ol once — I was at a talk — direc@@ tor of the la@@ b said , &quot; &quot; I@@ n our la@@ b , we have a saying ."
"If you work on one neuro@@ n , that &apos;s neuro@@ science ."
"If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psych@@ ology . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down ."
Thank you very much .

"I ’ m going around the world giving tal@@ ks about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in , and us@@ u@@ ally what I ’ m talking about is D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"Now that tit@@ le , that ph@@ ra@@ se , comes from a c@@ rit@@ ic , an early c@@ rit@@ ic , and this is a pas@@ sa@@ ge that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; I@@ n the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance is the ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ er ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the fundamental princi@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a per@@ fect and beautiful machine , it is not requ@@ is@@ ite to know how to make it ."
"This pro@@ position will be found on care@@ ful exam@@ in@@ ation to ex@@ pres@@ s , in con@@ den@@ sed form , the essenti@@ al pur@@ port of the Th@@ e@@ ory , and to ex@@ pres@@ s in a few words all M@@ r@@ .

E@@ x@@ actly . And it is a stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion ."
A cre@@ ation@@ ist p@@ am@@ ph@@ let has this wonderful p@@ age in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ w@@ o : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pain@@ ting that didn ’ t have a pain@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any c@@ ar that didn ’ t have a mak@@ er ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the ab@@ ove , give deta@@ ils . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ h@@ a ! I mean , it really is a stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
You would have thought it stan@@ ds to reason that des@@ ign requ@@ ir@@ es an intelli@@ gent des@@ ign@@ er .
But D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws that it ’ s just f@@ al@@ se .
"@@ To@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s other stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally p@@ uz@@ z@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It stan@@ ds to reason that we love ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake because it is s@@ we@@ et .
G@@ u@@ ys go for girls like this because they are s@@ ex@@ y .
We ad@@ ore b@@ ab@@ ies because they ’ re so c@@ ute .
"And , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ k@@ es because they are fun@@ n@@ y ."
This is all bac@@ k@@ wards . It is . And D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with s@@ we@@ et . O@@ ur s@@ we@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is basically an evol@@ ved su@@ ga@@ r det@@ ec@@ tor , because su@@ ga@@ r is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ r@@ ud@@ ely , and that ’ s why we like su@@ ga@@ r ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is s@@ we@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because h@@ on@@ ey is s@@ we@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally s@@ we@@ et about h@@ on@@ ey ."
"If you looked at gl@@ uc@@ ose mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es t@@ ill you were bl@@ ind , you wouldn ’ t see why they t@@ as@@ ted s@@ we@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re s@@ we@@ et .
"So if you think first there was s@@ we@@ et@@ ness , and then we evol@@ ved to like s@@ we@@ et@@ ness , you ’ ve got it bac@@ k@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way ro@@ und ."
S@@ we@@ et@@ ness was born with the w@@ ir@@ ing which evol@@ ved .
And there ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally s@@ ex@@ y about these young la@@ dies .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on e@@ arth do you get ch@@ im@@ ps to mate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a solu@@ tion : h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a qu@@ ic@@ k@@ er way ."
"@@ Just w@@ ire the ch@@ im@@ ps up to love that look , and ap@@ par@@ ently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ im@@ ps evol@@ ved our different ways ."
"We bec@@ ame bal@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ died , od@@ d@@ ly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we h@@ ad@@ n ’ t , then probably this would be the he@@ ight of s@@ ex@@ iness ."
O@@ ur s@@ we@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an evol@@ ved and inst@@ in@@ c@@ tual pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy food .
It wasn ’ t des@@ ign@@ ed for ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake .
Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake is a super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ ik@@ o T@@ in@@ ber@@ g@@ en , who did his f@@ amo@@ us experim@@ ents with gul@@ ls , where he found that that or@@ an@@ ge spo@@ t on the gul@@ l ’ s be@@ ak — if he made a big@@ ger , or@@ an@@ ger spo@@ t the gul@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ks would pec@@ k at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ per@@ s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us for them , and they lo@@ ved it ."
"What we see with , say , ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake is it ’ s a super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us to tw@@ e@@ ak our des@@ ign w@@ ir@@ ing ."
And there are lots of super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ uli ; ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate c@@ ake is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ uli for s@@ ex@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ nor@@ mal s@@ tim@@ uli for c@@ ut@@ en@@ ess . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love b@@ ab@@ ies , and that we not be put off by , say , m@@ ess@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers ."
"So b@@ ab@@ ies have to at@@ trac@@ t our af@@ fec@@ tion and our n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a rec@@ ent study sho@@ ws that mo@@ thers pre@@ fer the sm@@ ell of the d@@ ir@@ ty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own b@@ ab@@ y ."
So nature works on many lev@@ els here .
"But now , if b@@ ab@@ ies didn ’ t look the way they do — if b@@ ab@@ ies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find ad@@ o@@ ra@@ ble , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , oh my go@@ od@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , finally what about fun@@ n@@ y . My answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think evolu@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s d@@ ir@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a power@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
It ’ s a ne@@ ural system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a gr@@ ub@@ by cl@@ er@@ ical job .
O@@ ur b@@ um@@ per s@@ tic@@ k@@ er for this view is that this is the jo@@ y of deb@@ u@@ g@@ ging .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of deb@@ u@@ g@@ ging get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using hu@@ mo@@ r as a sort of neuro@@ scientific pro@@ be by s@@ w@@ it@@ ch@@ ing hu@@ mo@@ r on and off , by turn@@ ing the kno@@ b on a jo@@ ke — now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y ... oh , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..@@ ."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y — in this way , we can actually learn something about the arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain , the func@@ tional arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ le@@ y is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ le@@ y M@@ o@@ del .
"He ’ s a computer scient@@ ist , R@@ e@@ gin@@ al@@ d A@@ dam@@ s a psych@@ olog@@ ist , and there I am , and we ’ re put@@ ting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"You si@@ r , that &apos;s three ."
And any@@ body on this side here ?
"W@@ ould somebody get us started by giving us a tw@@ o@@ -@@ dig@@ it number , pl@@ ease ?"
"A@@ B : 2@@ 2 . And another tw@@ o@@ -@@ dig@@ it number , si@@ r ?"
A@@ B : 5@@ 9@@ 4 . Let &apos;s give three of them a n@@ ice ro@@ und of ap@@ plause there .
"( Applause ) W@@ ould you like to try a more stan@@ dar@@ d cal@@ cul@@ at@@ or , just in case ?"
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : 25 .
"A@@ B : 2@@ 3 s@@ qu@@ ar@@ ed , O@@ K ."
V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er : 5@@ 2@@ 9 . A@@ B : 5@@ 2@@ 9 .

A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : 19@@ 6@@ 6 .
"A@@ B : 18@@ 2@@ 4 , O@@ K ."
There was a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man up here who had a 1@@ 0-@@ dig@@ it cal@@ cul@@ at@@ or .
"You have a 1@@ 0-@@ dig@@ it cal@@ cul@@ at@@ or , si@@ r , as well ?"
"O@@ h , I did this row already ."
I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak the problem down into three parts .
"Now , let me rec@@ a@@ p ."
Let me explain what that is .
"If , ho@@ w@@ ever , I am right , wh@@ at@@ ever you do , don &apos;t keep it to yourself , O@@ K ?"
"@@ 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2 becom@@ es co@@ o@@ k@@ i@@ e f@@ is@@ sion , co@@ o@@ k@@ i@@ e f@@ is@@ sion is 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 2@@ 2 ."
"That seems right , I &apos;ll go on . C@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ i@@ e f@@ is@@ sion , O@@ K ."
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : Y@@ eah ! A@@ B : G@@ ood .
Thank you very much .
"Now , not@@ ice that the lead@@ er em@@ bra@@ ces him as an equ@@ al ."
It takes g@@ ut@@ s to st@@ and out like that .
So a mov@@ ement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got mo@@ men@@ tum . This is the ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"And what a per@@ fect place to do that , at TE@@ D ."
( Applause )
"But there is a new , technolo@@ g@@ ical inst@@ it@@ u@@ tion that will fundam@@ ent@@ ally change how we ex@@ change value , and it &apos;s called the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in ."
"Now , that &apos;s a pretty b@@ old stat@@ ement , but if you take nothing else away from this talk , I actually want you to remember that while bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in technology is rel@@ ati@@ vely new , it &apos;s also a contin@@ u@@ ation of a very human story , and the story is this ."
"As hum@@ ans , we find ways to lower un@@ certain@@ ty about one another so that we can ex@@ change value ."
"He pas@@ sed away at the end of 20@@ 15 , but Nor@@ th pi@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ed what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; new inst@@ it@@ u@@ tional econom@@ ics . &quot; &quot; And what he me@@ ant by inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions were really just forma@@ l rul@@ es like a con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion , and informa@@ l con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , like bri@@ ber@@ y ."
"As our societies gre@@ w more compl@@ ex and our tra@@ de ro@@ utes gre@@ w more dis@@ t@@ ant , we built up more forma@@ l inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions , inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions like ban@@ ks for cur@@ ren@@ cy , govern@@ ments , cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions ."
"As D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as@@ s Nor@@ th saw it , inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions are a to@@ ol to lower un@@ certain@@ ty so that we can con@@ n@@ ect and ex@@ change all kinds of value in society ."
So what is the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in ?
"The tr@@ an@@ sac@@ tions are sec@@ ured through c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ graph@@ y , and over time , that tr@@ an@@ sac@@ tion history gets loc@@ ked in bloc@@ ks of data that are then c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ graph@@ ically lin@@ ked together and sec@@ ured ."
"This cre@@ ates an im@@ m@@ ut@@ able , un@@ for@@ ge@@ able rec@@ or@@ d of all of the tr@@ an@@ sac@@ tions across this n@@ et@@ work ."
This rec@@ or@@ d is re@@ plic@@ ated on every computer that uses the n@@ et@@ work .
It &apos;s not an ap@@ p .
It &apos;s not a compan@@ y .
I think it &apos;s clo@@ s@@ est in descri@@ p@@ tion to something like W@@ ik@@ ip@@ ed@@ ia .
We can see everything on W@@ ik@@ ip@@ ed@@ ia .
It &apos;s a com@@ pos@@ ite view that &apos;s con@@ stan@@ tly chang@@ ing and being up@@ da@@ ted .
"O@@ n W@@ ik@@ ip@@ ed@@ ia , it &apos;s an open pl@@ at@@ form that stor@@ es words and imag@@ es and the changes to that data over time ."
"O@@ n the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in , you can think of it as an open in@@ fra@@ structure that stor@@ es many kinds of as@@ s@@ ets ."
"It stor@@ es the history of cu@@ st@@ o@@ di@@ an@@ ship , ow@@ ner@@ ship and loc@@ ation for as@@ s@@ ets like the dig@@ ital cur@@ ren@@ cy B@@ it@@ co@@ in , other dig@@ ital as@@ s@@ ets like a tit@@ le of ow@@ ner@@ ship of I@@ P ."
"It could be a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate , a con@@ trac@@ t , real world ob@@ jects , even person@@ al id@@ enti@@ fi@@ able information ."
"So let &apos;s take the first example , not kno@@ wing who we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with ."
S@@ ay I want to buy a used s@@ mart@@ ph@@ one on e@@ B@@ ay .
The first thing I &apos;m going to do is look up who I &apos;m bu@@ ying from .
A@@ re they a power us@@ er ?
"@@ Do they have great re@@ vie@@ ws and rat@@ ings , or do they have no pro@@ fil@@ e at all ?"
"R@@ ev@@ i@@ e@@ ws , rat@@ ings , ch@@ ec@@ k@@ mar@@ ks : these are the att@@ est@@ ations about our id@@ ent@@ ities that we c@@ ob@@ ble together today and use to lower un@@ certain@@ ty about who we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with ."
But the problem is they &apos;re very fra@@ g@@ m@@ ented .
Th@@ ink about how many pro@@ fil@@ es you have .
"B@@ loc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins al@@ low for us to create an open , global pl@@ at@@ form on which to stor@@ e any att@@ est@@ ation about any individ@@ ual from any s@@ our@@ ce ."
This al@@ lo@@ ws us to create a us@@ er@@ -@@ contro@@ l@@ led port@@ able id@@ ent@@ ity .
"@@ U@@ sing the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in , we can create a shar@@ ed reality across n@@ on@@ tr@@ ust@@ ing ent@@ ities ."
Th@@ ink back to W@@ ik@@ ip@@ ed@@ ia .
"It &apos;s a shar@@ ed da@@ t@@ ab@@ ase , and even though it has mul@@ ti@@ ple read@@ ers and mul@@ ti@@ ple writ@@ ers at the same time , it has one single tr@@ uth ."
We can create a dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed da@@ t@@ ab@@ ase that has the same ef@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy of a mo@@ no@@ po@@ ly without actually cre@@ ating that cent@@ ral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"It means for con@@ sum@@ ers , we can have a lot more trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy ."
This is a whole new world in terms of our vis@@ i@@ bility .
"So I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about how bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins can lower our un@@ certain@@ ties about id@@ ent@@ ity and how they change what we mean about trans@@ par@@ en@@ cy in long dis@@ tan@@ ces and compl@@ ex t@@ rad@@ es , like in a sup@@ p@@ ly cha@@ in ."
"The last un@@ certain@@ ty that we often face is one of the most op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded , and it &apos;s ren@@ eg@@ ing ."
What if you don &apos;t sen@@ d me the s@@ mart@@ ph@@ one ?
C@@ an I get my money back ?
"B@@ loc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins al@@ low us to write cod@@ e , b@@ ind@@ ing con@@ trac@@ ts , between individ@@ ual@@ s and then gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that those con@@ trac@@ ts will be@@ ar out without a third par@@ ty en@@ for@@ cer ."
"So if we look at the s@@ mart@@ ph@@ one example , you could think about esc@@ row ."
"You are fin@@ an@@ cing that ph@@ one , but you don &apos;t need to rel@@ ease the fun@@ ds until you can ver@@ if@@ y that all the con@@ dit@@ ions have been me@@ t ."
You got the ph@@ one .
"It means a lot of human economic acti@@ vity can get coll@@ at@@ er@@ aliz@@ ed and aut@@ o@@ mat@@ ed , and p@@ us@@ h a lot of human inter@@ ven@@ tion to the ed@@ g@@ es , the places where information mov@@ es from the real world to the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in ."
"So rather than all of our un@@ certain@@ ties s@@ lowing us down and requ@@ ir@@ ing inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions like ban@@ ks , our govern@@ ments , our cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions , we can actually har@@ ness all of that col@@ lec@@ tive un@@ certain@@ ty and use it to col@@ labo@@ rate and ex@@ change more and fas@@ ter and more open ."
It &apos;s also an in@@ no@@ v@@ ation in computer science .
"B@@ loc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins give us the technolo@@ g@@ ical cap@@ ability of cre@@ ating a rec@@ or@@ d of human ex@@ change , of ex@@ change of cur@@ ren@@ cy , of all kinds of dig@@ ital and physical as@@ s@@ ets , even of our own person@@ al at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes , in a tot@@ ally new way ."
Thank you .

"I think I underst@@ ood that it &apos;s coming , it of@@ fer@@ s a lot of po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al , and it &apos;s compl@@ ex ."
What is your es@@ ti@@ mate for the rate of ad@@ op@@ tion ?
What is a par@@ ent ? What is a par@@ ent ?
"It &apos;s not an easy question . To@@ day we have ad@@ op@@ tion ,"
S@@ h@@ all we tell our child about the s@@ per@@ m don@@ ation ?
"If so , when ?"
What words to use ?
"S@@ per@@ m don@@ ors are often re@@ fer@@ red to as &quot; &quot; bi@@ ological fa@@ thers , &quot; &quot; but should we really be using the word &quot; &quot; father ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s a philosoph@@ er and social scient@@ ist , I have been stud@@ ying these questions about the con@@ cept of par@@ en@@ th@@ ood ."
"But today , I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children ."
"I will show you that they know what mat@@ ters most in a family , even though their family looks a little different ."
I will show you their cre@@ ative ways of de@@ al@@ ing with t@@ ough questions .
But I will also show you the parents &apos; un@@ certain@@ ties .
"In this treat@@ ment tim@@ el@@ ine , you can see two poin@@ ts at which we conduc@@ ted inter@@ vie@@ ws ."
"We incl@@ ud@@ ed h@@ et@@ er@@ os@@ ex@@ ual cou@@ pl@@ es , where the man for some reason did not have go@@ od@@ -@@ qu@@ ality s@@ per@@ m , and les@@ b@@ ian cou@@ pl@@ es who ob@@ vi@@ ously needed to find s@@ per@@ m el@@ se@@ where ."
We also incl@@ ud@@ ed children .
I wanted to know how those children defin@@ e con@@ cep@@ ts like par@@ en@@ th@@ ood and family .
"In fact , that is what I asked them , only not in that way ."
I dre@@ w an app@@ le t@@ ree instead .
"This way , I could ask ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t , philosoph@@ ical questions in a way that did not make them run off ."
And that ill@@ ust@@ rat@@ es my research appro@@ ach .
"B@@ y des@@ ig@@ ning tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es like this , I can bring as little mean@@ ing and cont@@ ent as possible to the inter@@ view , because I want to hear that from them ."
I asked them : What would your family look like if it were an app@@ le t@@ ree ?
"And they could take a p@@ aper app@@ le for everyone who , in their view , was a mem@@ ber of the family , write a name on it and han@@ g it wh@@ er@@ ever they wanted ."
And I would ask questions .
M@@ o@@ st children started with a par@@ ent or a si@@ bl@@ ing .
"One started with &quot; &quot; B@@ ox@@ er , &quot; &quot; the de@@ ad do@@ g of his grand@@ parents ."
"A@@ t this point , n@@ one of the children started men@@ tion@@ ing the don@@ or ."
"So , I asked them about their bir@@ th story ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore you were born , it was just your mo@@ m and dad , or mo@@ m and mom@@ my ."
C@@ an you tell me how you came into the family ? &quot; &quot; And they expla@@ ined .
"One said , &quot; &quot; My parents did not have good se@@ ed@@ s , but there are fri@@ end@@ ly men out there who have sp@@ are se@@ ed@@ s ."
"She put the se@@ ed@@ s in her bel@@ ly — some@@ how — and her bel@@ ly gre@@ w really big , and there I was . &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m ."
"So only when they started men@@ tion@@ ing the don@@ or , I asked questions about him , using their own words ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t put this one up there with the others ."
He &apos;s not part of my family .
But I will not put him on the ground .
That &apos;s too c@@ old and too hard .
"I think he should be in the tr@@ un@@ k , because he made my family possible ."
"If he would not have done this , that would really be sad because my family would not be here , and I would not be here . &quot; &quot; So also , parents con@@ struc@@ ted family tal@@ es — tal@@ es to tell their children ."
And why not ?
It &apos;s their way of expla@@ ining ; their do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself with family nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves .
D@@ I@@ Y .
"And these stories were high@@ ly d@@ iver@@ se , but they all had one thing in common : it was a tal@@ e of lon@@ ging for a child and a qu@@ est for that child ."
It was about how spec@@ ial and how de@@ ep@@ ly lo@@ ved their child was .
And research so far sho@@ ws that these children are doing fin@@ e .
They do not have more problems than other kids .
Un@@ der@@ l@@ ying was a fear that their children might disa@@ p@@ pro@@ ve and would re@@ ject the n@@ on@@ -@@ gen@@ e@@ tic par@@ ent .
Well .
I want to tell you about a te@@ en@@ age bo@@ y .
He was don@@ or@@ -@@ con@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed but not part of our study .
You &apos;re not even my father ! &quot; &quot; That was exactly what the parents in our study fe@@ ar@@ ed .
"Now , the bo@@ y so@@ on fel@@ t sor@@ ry , and they made up ."
But it is the re@@ action of his father that is most interesting .
"He said , &quot; &quot; This ou@@ t@@ bur@@ st had nothing to do with the l@@ ack of a gen@@ e@@ tic lin@@ k ."
It &apos;s what they do at that age .
These things happen in all famil@@ ies .
"And every now and then , all parents may won@@ der : A@@ m I a good enough par@@ ent ?"
"Th@@ ese parents , too ."
"They , ab@@ ove all , wanted to do what &apos;s best for their child ."
But they also sometimes wonder@@ ed : A@@ m I a real par@@ ent ?
"E@@ ven 10 years later , they still remember the ad@@ vic@@ e they were given ."
The coun@@ sel@@ or said so . &quot; &quot; Well .
I don &apos;t know ; that &apos;s quite different from how we res@@ po@@ nd to children &apos;s questions .
"We will not say , &quot; No , mil@@ k is not made in a fac@@ t@@ ory . &quot;"
"So something stran@@ ge happened here , and of course these children not@@ ic@@ ed that ."
"One bo@@ y said , &quot; &quot; I asked my parents lo@@ ad@@ s of questions , but they ac@@ ted really we@@ ir@@ d ."
"So , you know , I have a fri@@ end at school , and she &apos;s made in the same way ."
"When I have a question , I just go and ask her . &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ever guy ."
P@@ rob@@ le@@ m sol@@ ved .
And that &apos;s the stran@@ ge thing about ad@@ vic@@ e .
"When we of@@ fer people p@@ il@@ ls , we ga@@ ther evidence first ."
And ad@@ vic@@ e ?
It should be ad@@ vic@@ e that there is evidence for — evidence that it actually impro@@ ves patients &apos; lives .
So the philosoph@@ er in me would now like to of@@ fer you a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x : I adv@@ ise you to stop fol@@ lowing ad@@ vic@@ e .
"But , y@@ es ."
( Applause ) I will not end here with what went wrong ; I would not be doing j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce to the war@@ m@@ th we found in those famil@@ ies .
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber the bo@@ o@@ ks and the tri@@ p to the far@@ m@@ er ?
"When parents do things that work for them , they do br@@ il@@ li@@ ant things ."
And we do not need to be profes@@ sion@@ als to create those .
"In that case , be@@ ar in mind three things ."
W@@ or@@ k with ad@@ vic@@ e that works for your family .
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber — you &apos;re the exper@@ t , because you live your family life ."
"And finally , believe in your abil@@ ities and your cre@@ ati@@ vity , because you can do it yourself ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I was depres@@ sed ; I said , but I can make a difference in this field ."
So why don &apos;t we have a good theory of bra@@ ins ?
"R@@ e@@ ality , though — I call it real intelligence ."
It can att@@ ack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
But the rob@@ ot@@ ics part is the har@@ d@@ est part . That &apos;s old brain . That &apos;s really hard .
I have a con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to make .
"But first , I want you to make a little con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to me ."
"In the past year , I want you to just ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;ve experien@@ ced rel@@ ati@@ vely little stress ."
An@@ y@@ one ?
How about a moder@@ ate amount of stress ?
Wh@@ o has experien@@ ced a lot of stress ?
Y@@ eah . M@@ e too .
But that is not my con@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
"M@@ y con@@ f@@ es@@ sion is this : I am a health psych@@ olog@@ ist , and my mis@@ sion is to help people be happ@@ ier and heal@@ th@@ ier ."
"But I fear that something I &apos;ve been teach@@ ing for the last 10 years is doing more har@@ m than good , and it has to do with stress ."
"For years I &apos;ve been telling people , stress makes you sic@@ k ."
It increas@@ es the ris@@ k of everything from the common c@@ old to car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease .
"B@@ as@@ ically , I &apos;ve turned stress into the en@@ em@@ y ."
"But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
Let me start with the study that made me re@@ think my whole appro@@ ach to stress .
"This study trac@@ ked 3@@ 0,000 ad@@ ults in the United States for eight years , and they started by as@@ king people , &quot; How much stress have you experien@@ ced in the last year ? &quot;"
"They also asked , &quot; Do you believe that stress is har@@ m@@ ful for your health ? &quot;"
And then they used public death rec@@ or@@ ds to find out who died .
( Laughter ) O@@ kay .
S@@ ome bad news first .
P@@ eople who experien@@ ced a lot of stress in the pre@@ vi@@ ous year had a 4@@ 3 percent increas@@ ed ris@@ k of d@@ ying .
But that was only true for the people who also beli@@ ev@@ ed that stress is har@@ m@@ ful for your health .
( Laughter ) P@@ eople who experien@@ ced a lot of stress but did not view stress as har@@ m@@ ful were no more likely to die .
"Now the rese@@ arch@@ ers es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed that over the eight years they were trac@@ king de@@ a@@ ths , 18@@ 2@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans died pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely , not from stress , but from the beli@@ ef that stress is bad for you ."
"( Laughter ) That is over 20@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths a year ."
( Laughter ) You can see why this study fre@@ ak@@ ed me out .
Here I &apos;ve been sp@@ en@@ ding so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health .
So this study got me wonder@@ ing : C@@ an chang@@ ing how you think about stress make you heal@@ th@@ ier ?
And here the science says y@@ es .
"When you change your mind about stress , you can change your body &apos;s respon@@ se to stress ."
"Now to explain how this works , I want you all to pret@@ end that you are par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts in a study des@@ ign@@ ed to stress you out ."
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
"You come into the labo@@ rat@@ ory , and you &apos;re told you have to give a f@@ iv@@ e-@@ min@@ ute im@@ prom@@ p@@ tu spe@@ ec@@ h on your person@@ al we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess@@ es to a pan@@ el of exper@@ t ev@@ al@@ u@@ at@@ ors sit@@ ting right in front of you , and to make sure you feel the pres@@ sure , there are b@@ right ligh@@ ts and a c@@ amer@@ a in your face , kind of like this ."
"( Laughter ) And the ev@@ al@@ u@@ at@@ ors have been tra@@ ined to give you dis@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging , n@@ on@@ -@@ ver@@ b@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back , like this ."
"( E@@ x@@ hal@@ es ) ( Laughter ) Now that you &apos;re suf@@ fic@@ i@@ ently demo@@ ral@@ ized , time for part two : a mat@@ h test ."
"And un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to you , the experim@@ en@@ ter has been tra@@ ined to h@@ aras@@ s you d@@ uring it ."
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fu@@ n .
F@@ or me .
O@@ kay .
( Laughter ) I want you all to coun@@ t bac@@ k@@ wards from 9@@ 9@@ 6 in incre@@ ments of seven .
"You &apos;re going to do this out l@@ ou@@ d , as f@@ ast as you can , starting with 9@@ 9@@ 6 ."
G@@ o !
( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence coun@@ ting ) G@@ o fas@@ ter . F@@ as@@ ter pl@@ ease .
You &apos;re going too s@@ low .
"( A@@ u@@ di@@ ence coun@@ ting ) S@@ top . S@@ top , stop , stop ."
That guy made a mis@@ take .
We are going to have to start all over again .
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?"
"O@@ kay , so you get the idea ."
"Y@@ our heart might be po@@ und@@ ing , you might be bre@@ a@@ thing fas@@ ter , maybe bre@@ ak@@ ing out into a s@@ we@@ at ."
"And nor@@ m@@ ally , we inter@@ pre@@ t these physical changes as an@@ x@@ i@@ ety or sign@@ s that we ar@@ en &apos;t c@@ op@@ ing very well with the pres@@ sure ."
Now that is exactly what par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts were told in a study conduc@@ ted at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Un@@ iver@@ sity .
"B@@ e@@ fore they went through the social stress test , they were t@@ au@@ ght to re@@ think their stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful ."
That po@@ und@@ ing heart is pre@@ par@@ ing you for action .
"If you &apos;re bre@@ a@@ thing fas@@ ter , it &apos;s no problem ."
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ g@@ en to your brain .
"And par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts who learned to view the stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful for their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce , well , they were less st@@ res@@ sed out , less an@@ x@@ ious , more con@@ f@@ id@@ ent , but the most fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating fin@@ ding to me was how their physical stress respon@@ se changed ."
And this is one of the reas@@ ons that ch@@ ron@@ ic stress is sometimes as@@ soci@@ ated with car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease .
It &apos;s not really heal@@ thy to be in this state all the time .
"But in the study , when par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts vie@@ wed their stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful , their blo@@ od v@@ ess@@ els st@@ ay@@ ed rel@@ ax@@ ed like this ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir heart was still po@@ und@@ ing , but this is a much heal@@ th@@ ier car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar pro@@ fil@@ e ."
It actually looks a lot like what happens in mo@@ ments of jo@@ y and cou@@ ra@@ ge .
"O@@ ver a li@@ fe@@ time of st@@ res@@ s@@ ful experi@@ ences , this one bi@@ ological change could be the difference between a st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart att@@ ack at age 50 and living well into your 9@@ 0s ."
"And this is really what the new science of stress re@@ ve@@ als , that how you think about stress mat@@ ters ."
So my go@@ al as a health psych@@ olog@@ ist has changed .
I no longer want to get ri@@ d of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little inter@@ ven@@ tion .
"And when you view stress in that way , your body beli@@ ev@@ es you , and your stress respon@@ se becom@@ es heal@@ th@@ ier ."
"Now I said I have over a dec@@ ade of demo@@ ni@@ z@@ ing stress to re@@ de@@ e@@ m my@@ self from , so we are going to do one more inter@@ ven@@ tion ."
"I want to tell you about one of the most under@@ -@@ app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated as@@ pec@@ ts of the stress respon@@ se , and the idea is this : St@@ ress makes you social ."
"@@ To understand this side of stress , we need to talk about a hor@@ mon@@ e , oxytocin , and I know oxytocin has already g@@ ot@@ ten as much h@@ yp@@ e as a hor@@ mon@@ e can get ."
"It even has its own c@@ ute n@@ ic@@ k@@ name , the c@@ ud@@ dle hor@@ mon@@ e , because it &apos;s rel@@ eas@@ ed when you hu@@ g someone ."
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is inv@@ ol@@ ved in .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin is a neuro@@ -@@ hor@@ mon@@ e .
It fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ es your brain &apos;s social inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts .
It pri@@ m@@ es you to do things that str@@ eng@@ then clo@@ se relation@@ shi@@ ps .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin makes you c@@ r@@ ave physical cont@@ act with your friends and family .
It en@@ han@@ ces your em@@ pa@@ thy .
It even makes you more w@@ il@@ ling to help and sup@@ port the people you care about .
S@@ ome people have even su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted we should s@@ nor@@ t oxytocin ...
to become more com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate and car@@ ing .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress hor@@ mon@@ e .
Y@@ our p@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ ary gl@@ and p@@ um@@ ps this stuff out as part of the stress respon@@ se .
It &apos;s as much a part of your stress respon@@ se as the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine that makes your heart po@@ und .
"And when oxytocin is rel@@ eas@@ ed in the stress respon@@ se , it is mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ating you to see@@ k sup@@ port ."
"Y@@ our bi@@ ological stress respon@@ se is n@@ ud@@ ging you to tell someone how you feel , instead of bot@@ t@@ ling it up ."
Y@@ our stress respon@@ se wan@@ ts to make sure you not@@ ice when someone else in your life is st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing so that you can sup@@ port each other .
"O@@ kay , so how is kno@@ wing this side of stress going to make you heal@@ th@@ ier ?"
"Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain ."
It &apos;s a natural an@@ ti@@ -@@ in@@ fl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory .
It also hel@@ ps your blo@@ od v@@ ess@@ els st@@ ay rel@@ ax@@ ed d@@ uring stress .
But my fav@@ or@@ ite ef@@ fect on the body is actually on the heart .
"Y@@ our heart has re@@ cep@@ tors for this hor@@ mon@@ e , and oxytocin hel@@ ps heart cells regener@@ ate and he@@ al from any st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed da@@ mag@@ e ."
This stress hor@@ mon@@ e str@@ eng@@ th@@ ens your heart .
And the co@@ ol thing is that all of these physical ben@@ ef@@ its of oxytocin are en@@ han@@ ced by social cont@@ act and social sup@@ port .
"So when you re@@ ach out to others under stress , ei@@ ther to see@@ k sup@@ port or to help someone else , you rel@@ ease more of this hor@@ mon@@ e , your stress respon@@ se becom@@ es heal@@ th@@ ier , and you actually rec@@ over fas@@ ter from stress ."
"I find this amazing , that your stress respon@@ se has a buil@@ t-@@ in me@@ chan@@ ism for stress res@@ il@@ i@@ ence , and that me@@ chan@@ ism is human connec@@ tion ."
I want to fin@@ ish by telling you about one more study .
"This study trac@@ ked about 1@@ ,000 ad@@ ults in the United States , and they ran@@ g@@ ed in age from 3@@ 4 to 9@@ 3 , and they started the study by as@@ king , &quot; How much stress have you experien@@ ced in the last year ? &quot;"
"O@@ kay , so the bad news first : F@@ or every maj@@ or st@@ res@@ s@@ ful life experience , like fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al diffic@@ ul@@ ties or family c@@ ris@@ is , that increas@@ ed the ris@@ k of d@@ ying by 30 percent ."
But — and I hope you are expec@@ ting a &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; by now — but that wasn &apos;t true for everyone .
P@@ eople who sp@@ ent time car@@ ing for others sho@@ wed ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely no st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ rel@@ ated increase in d@@ ying .
Z@@ ero .
C@@ aring created res@@ il@@ i@@ ence .
And so we see once again that the har@@ m@@ ful effec@@ ts of stress on your health are not in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
How you think and how you act can trans@@ form your experience of stress .
"When you cho@@ ose to view your stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful , you create the bi@@ ology of cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"And when you cho@@ ose to con@@ n@@ ect with others under stress , you can create res@@ il@@ i@@ ence ."
"Now I wouldn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily ask for more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful experi@@ ences in my life , but this science has given me a whole new app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for stress ."
St@@ ress giv@@ es us acc@@ ess to our he@@ ar@@ ts .
"The com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate heart that fin@@ ds jo@@ y and mean@@ ing in connec@@ ting with others , and y@@ es , your po@@ und@@ ing physical heart , working so hard to give you str@@ eng@@ th and energy ."
"And when you cho@@ ose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty prof@@ ound stat@@ ement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can tr@@ ust yourself to h@@ and@@ le life &apos;s chall@@ eng@@ es .
And you &apos;re remem@@ ber@@ ing that you don &apos;t have to face them al@@ one .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us ."
It seems amazing to me that a beli@@ ef about stress can make so much difference to someone &apos;s life expec@@ tan@@ cy .
"It &apos;s equ@@ ally w@@ ise to go for the st@@ res@@ s@@ ful job so long as you believe that you can h@@ and@@ le it , in some sense ?"
"In 19@@ 8@@ 7 , T@@ ina L@@ or@@ d found her@@ self in quite the pic@@ k@@ le ."
C@@ or@@ d &apos;s mother M@@ aria was th@@ r@@ il@@ led until they ho@@ o@@ ked up again .
"@@ T@@ ina had already been kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed , stra@@ pped to a ra@@ ft and s@@ ent over a wat@@ er@@ f@@ all ."
She and her b@@ ab@@ y were pre@@ sum@@ ed de@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; S@@ top ! &quot; &quot; she scre@@ amed .
&quot; &quot; A@@ m I too l@@ ate ?
"C@@ or@@ d , I &apos;ve come so far ."
"( Laughter ) Now , if you &apos;ve ever seen a so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a , you know the stories and the charac@@ ters can be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , larg@@ er than life , and if you &apos;re a f@@ an , you find that ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation fu@@ n , and if you &apos;re not , maybe you find them mel@@ od@@ ra@@ ma@@ tic or un@@ soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe you think wat@@ ch@@ ing so@@ a@@ p oper@@ as is a was@@ te of time , that their big@@ ness means their l@@ ess@@ ons are small or n@@ on@@ ex@@ ist@@ ent ."

We c@@ y@@ cle through tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y and jo@@ y just like these charac@@ ters .
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , they show us it &apos;s never too l@@ ate to change your story ."
"So with that , let &apos;s start with so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a les@@ son one : sur@@ ren@@ der is not an op@@ tion ."

( Laughter )"
"But before the tu@@ mo@@ r could k@@ ill him , Mar@@ l@@ ena sh@@ ot him , and he tum@@ bl@@ ed off a cat@@ wal@@ k to his death ."
And so it went for 30 years .
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven when we saw the body , we knew better ."
He &apos;s called the P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x for a reason .
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
"As long as the show is still on the air , or you &apos;re still bre@@ a@@ thing , nothing is per@@ man@@ ent ."
R@@ es@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion is possible .
"Now , of course , just like life , so@@ a@@ p oper@@ as do ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely me@@ et the big fin@@ ale ."
It was six months of d@@ ying and I ro@@ de that tra@@ in right into the mo@@ un@@ tain .
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ree months later , nothing was O@@ K ."
"That was when I wat@@ ched the fin@@ al ep@@ is@@ od@@ e air , and I real@@ ized the show was not the only f@@ at@@ ality ."
I was one too .
I just had to ta@@ p into everything I had ever learned about so@@ a@@ p oper@@ as .
"I had to be br@@ ave like E@@ ric@@ a and re@@ f@@ use to sur@@ ren@@ der , so every day , I made a dec@@ ision to fi@@ ght ."
I had to be v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able like S@@ te@@ ph@@ an@@ i@@ e and sa@@ cri@@ f@@ ice my e@@ go .
I had to ask for help a lot of times across many st@@ ates .
"I had to be ada@@ p@@ table like C@@ arly and evol@@ ve my sk@@ il@@ ls , my min@@ d@@ set , and my cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces , and then I had to be res@@ il@@ i@@ ent , like S@@ te@@ f@@ an@@ o , and resur@@ rec@@ t my@@ self and my career like a ph@@ o@@ en@@ i@@ x from the ash@@ es ."
E@@ ven@@ tually I got an inter@@ view .
"A@@ f@@ ter 15 years in news and ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment , n@@ ine months of un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment and this one inter@@ view , I had an of@@ fer for an en@@ try level job ."
I was 3@@ 7 years old and I was back from the de@@ ad .
"We will all experience what looks like an en@@ ding , and we can cho@@ ose to make it a beginning ."
"@@ K@@ ind of like T@@ ina , who mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously surviv@@ ed that wat@@ er@@ f@@ all , and because I h@@ ate to leave a c@@ lif@@ f@@ han@@ ger han@@ ging , T@@ ina and C@@ or@@ d did get div@@ or@@ ced , but they got re@@ marri@@ ed three times before the show went off the air in 20@@ 12 ."
"So remember , as long as there is bre@@ ath in your body , it &apos;s never too l@@ ate to change your story ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I am Brit@@ ish .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ever before has the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; I am Brit@@ ish &quot; &quot; el@@ ic@@ ited so much p@@ ity . ( Laughter )
I come from an is@@ land where many of us like to believe there &apos;s been a lot of contin@@ u@@ ity over the last thou@@ s@@ and years .
We t@@ end to have hist@@ or@@ ically im@@ posed change on others but done much less of it ourselves .
"So it came as an im@@ men@@ se sh@@ oc@@ k to me when I wo@@ ke up on the mor@@ ning of J@@ un@@ e 2@@ 4 to disc@@ over that my country had v@@ ot@@ ed to leave the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , my P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ is@@ ter had re@@ sign@@ ed , and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land was consid@@ ering a re@@ fer@@ end@@ um that could bring to an end the very ex@@ ist@@ ence of the United K@@ ing@@ dom ."
"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sh@@ oc@@ k for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sh@@ oc@@ k for many people , but it was also something that , over the fol@@ lowing s@@ ever@@ al days , created a complet@@ e political mel@@ t@@ down in my country ."
"There were call@@ s for a second re@@ fer@@ end@@ um , almost as if , fol@@ lowing a s@@ por@@ ts mat@@ ch , we could ask the op@@ position for a re@@ play ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body was bl@@ am@@ ing everybody else .
They bl@@ amed the lead@@ er of the op@@ position for not f@@ igh@@ ting it hard enough .
The educ@@ ated bl@@ amed the less well-@@ educ@@ ated .
That complet@@ e mel@@ t@@ down was made even wor@@ se by the most tra@@ g@@ ic el@@ ement of it : lev@@ els of x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ ob@@ ia and ra@@ c@@ ist ab@@ use in the stre@@ ets of Brit@@ ain at a level that I have never seen before in my li@@ fe@@ time .
"P@@ eople are now talking about whether my country is becom@@ ing a L@@ it@@ tle Engl@@ and , or , as one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 19@@ 5@@ 0s no@@ st@@ al@@ gia the@@ me par@@ k f@@ lo@@ ating in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ gre@@ e of sh@@ oc@@ k that we &apos;ve experien@@ ced since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ ep@@ er struc@@ tu@@ ral fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very bas@@ ic questions .
"F@@ ir@@ st , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all res@@ po@@ nd ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present ?"
H@@ ind@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ot@@ e s@@ pl@@ it along lin@@ es of age , education , class and ge@@ o@@ graph@@ y ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ o@@ graph@@ ically , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land that most st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly com@@ mit@@ ted to being part of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very st@@ rong amb@@ iv@@ al@@ ence ."
Th@@ ose div@@ is@@ ions are things we really need to reco@@ gni@@ ze and take ser@@ i@@ ously .
"But more prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly , the v@@ ot@@ e teach@@ es us something about the nature of polit@@ ics today ."
Con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary polit@@ ics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about globaliz@@ ation .
The fa@@ ult line of con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary polit@@ ics is between those that em@@ bra@@ ce globaliz@@ ation and those that fear globaliz@@ ation .
But those ideas are ones that si@@ gni@@ f@@ y fear and ali@@ en@@ ation .
They re@@ present a re@@ treat back to@@ wards na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism and bor@@ d@@ ers in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The bl@@ ue are@@ as show R@@ e@@ ma@@ in and the red are@@ as L@@ e@@ ave .
"When I looked at this , what person@@ ally struc@@ k me was the very little time in my life I &apos;ve actually sp@@ ent in many of the red are@@ as ."
"In some of those places , I didn &apos;t even know the nam@@ es of the v@@ ot@@ ing dis@@ tric@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to nar@@ rate globaliz@@ ation to those people , to reco@@ gni@@ ze that for those people who have not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily been to univer@@ sity , who hav@@ en &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily gro@@ wn up with the In@@ tern@@ et , that don &apos;t get opportun@@ ities to tr@@ av@@ el , they may be un@@ per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed by the nar@@ ra@@ tive that we find per@@ su@@ as@@ ive in our often liber@@ al b@@ ub@@ bl@@ es . ( Applause )"
It means that we need to re@@ ach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the L@@ e@@ ave v@@ ot@@ e , a min@@ or@@ ity have p@@ ed@@ d@@ led the polit@@ ics of fear and h@@ at@@ red , cre@@ ating li@@ es and mis@@ tr@@ ust around , for inst@@ ance , the idea that the v@@ ot@@ e on Eu@@ rop@@ e could reduc@@ e the number of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ l@@ um@@ -@@ se@@ ek@@ ers coming to Eu@@ rop@@ e , when the v@@ ot@@ e on le@@ av@@ ing had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion from outside the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on ."
But for a si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant maj@@ or@@ ity of the L@@ e@@ ave v@@ ot@@ ers the con@@ cer@@ n was dis@@ ill@@ us@@ ion@@ ment with the political est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
This re@@ plic@@ ates around Eu@@ rop@@ e and much of the liber@@ al democra@@ tic world .
"We see it with the r@@ ise in popul@@ ar@@ ity of D@@ on@@ al@@ d Tr@@ um@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism of V@@ ik@@ tor O@@ r@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ un@@ gar@@ y , with the increase in popul@@ ar@@ ity of Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating liber@@ al , open , t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ gen@@ tly need a new vis@@ ion , a vis@@ ion of a more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant , incl@@ us@@ ive globaliz@@ ation , one that br@@ ings people with us rather than le@@ av@@ ing them be@@ h@@ ind ."
That vis@@ ion of globaliz@@ ation is one that has to start by a reco@@ gn@@ ition of the pos@@ itive ben@@ ef@@ its of globaliz@@ ation .
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s amo@@ n@@ g@@ st econom@@ ists is that f@@ ree tra@@ de , the mov@@ ement of cap@@ ital , the mov@@ ement of people across bor@@ d@@ ers ben@@ ef@@ it everyone on ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te ."
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s amo@@ n@@ g@@ st inter@@ national rel@@ ations s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars is that globaliz@@ ation br@@ ings inter@@ de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce , which br@@ ings co@@ oper@@ ation and pe@@ ace ."
But globaliz@@ ation also has re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tive effec@@ ts .
It cre@@ ates w@@ in@@ n@@ ers and lo@@ s@@ ers .
"@@ To take the example of mi@@ gra@@ tion , we know that im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion is a n@@ et pos@@ itive for the econom@@ y as a whole under almost all cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces ."
"But we also have to be very aw@@ are that there are re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tive con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences , that import@@ an@@ tly , low@@ -@@ sk@@ il@@ led im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion can le@@ ad to a reduc@@ tion in w@@ ages for the most im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed in our societies and also put pres@@ sure on h@@ ou@@ se pr@@ ices ."
"In 200@@ 2 , the form@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ar@@ y-@@ G@@ ener@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ of@@ i An@@ n@@ an , gave a spe@@ ec@@ h at Y@@ ale Un@@ iver@@ sity , and that spe@@ ec@@ h was on the t@@ op@@ ic of incl@@ us@@ ive globaliz@@ ation ."
That was the spe@@ ec@@ h in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
B@@ ig@@ ot@@ ry and ign@@ or@@ ance are the u@@ g@@ ly face of ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ion@@ ary and ant@@ agon@@ is@@ tic globaliz@@ ation . &quot; &quot; That idea of incl@@ us@@ ive globaliz@@ ation was bri@@ ef@@ ly rev@@ iv@@ ed in 200@@ 8 in a con@@ fer@@ ence on progres@@ sive govern@@ ance inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ing many of the lead@@ ers of Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an countries .
"But ami@@ d au@@ ster@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al c@@ ris@@ is of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed almost without a tra@@ ce ."
G@@ lob@@ aliz@@ ation has been taken to sup@@ port a ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al ag@@ en@@ da .
It &apos;s per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed to be part of an el@@ ite ag@@ en@@ da rather than something that ben@@ ef@@ its all .
"So the question is , how can we achi@@ eve that go@@ al ?"
How can we bal@@ ance on the one hand ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing fear and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand re@@ f@@ using ve@@ h@@ em@@ ently to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ ob@@ ia and na@@ tion@@ al@@ ism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scient@@ ist , that social science of@@ fer@@ s some places to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ forma@@ tion has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point ."
The first rel@@ ates to the idea of civ@@ ic education .
What stan@@ ds out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the ga@@ p between public per@@ cep@@ tion and em@@ pir@@ ical reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we reb@@ u@@ il@@ d res@@ p@@ ect for tr@@ uth and evidence into our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es ?
"It has to be@@ gin with education , but it has to start with the reco@@ gn@@ ition that there are huge ga@@ ps ."
"In 20@@ 1@@ 4 , the pol@@ l@@ st@@ er I@@ p@@ so@@ s M@@ O@@ R@@ I published a surv@@ ey on at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es to im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion , and it sho@@ wed that as numbers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts increase , so public con@@ cer@@ n with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion also increas@@ es , al@@ though it ob@@ vi@@ ously didn &apos;t un@@ p@@ ack c@@ au@@ sal@@ ity , because this could equ@@ ally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and me@@ dia nar@@ ra@@ tive around it ."
But the same surv@@ ey also re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed huge public mis@@ information and mis@@ understanding about the nature of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion .
"For example , in these at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es in the United K@@ ing@@ dom , the public beli@@ ev@@ ed that lev@@ els of as@@ y@@ l@@ um were a gre@@ ater pro@@ por@@ tion of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion than they were , but they also beli@@ ev@@ ed the lev@@ els of educ@@ ational mi@@ gra@@ tion were far lower as a pro@@ por@@ tion of over@@ all mi@@ gra@@ tion than they actually are ."
"So we have to ad@@ d@@ ress this mis@@ information , the ga@@ p between per@@ cep@@ tion and reality on k@@ ey as@@ pec@@ ts of globaliz@@ ation ."
"And that can &apos;t just be something that &apos;s left to our scho@@ ols , al@@ though that &apos;s important to be@@ gin at an early age ."
The second thing that I think is an opportun@@ ity is the idea to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge more inter@@ action across d@@ iver@@ se commun@@ ities .
"So for inst@@ ance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast have the high@@ est numbers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts , and they are also by far the most t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the low@@ est lev@@ els of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion that actually are the most ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ion@@ ary and in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts .
So we need to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge ex@@ change program@@ s .
We need to en@@ sure that ol@@ der gener@@ ations who maybe can &apos;t tr@@ av@@ el get acc@@ ess to the In@@ tern@@ et .
This ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion from the F@@ in@@ an@@ ci@@ al T@@ im@@ es pos@@ t-@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really st@@ ri@@ king .
But the problem is that those people in those are@@ as didn &apos;t per@@ ce@@ ive themselves to be ben@@ ef@@ ic@@ iar@@ ies .
They didn &apos;t believe that they were actually getting acc@@ ess to material ben@@ ef@@ its of increas@@ ed tra@@ de and increas@@ ed mo@@ bility around the world .
"I work on questions pre@@ domin@@ an@@ tly to do with re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , and one of the ideas I sp@@ ent a lot of my time pre@@ ach@@ ing , main@@ ly to develop@@ ing countries around the world , is that in order to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , we can &apos;t just ben@@ ef@@ it the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e popul@@ ations , we also have to ad@@ d@@ ress the con@@ cer@@ n@@ s of the ho@@ st commun@@ ities in loc@@ al are@@ as ."
"F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , if we &apos;re going to really take ser@@ i@@ ously the need to en@@ sure people share in the economic ben@@ ef@@ its , our bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es and cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions need a mo@@ del of globaliz@@ ation that reco@@ gni@@ z@@ es that they , too , have to take people with them ."
The f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h and fin@@ al idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more respon@@ si@@ ble polit@@ ics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that com@@ par@@ es at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es on globaliz@@ ation .
"We might not achi@@ eve that today , but at the very le@@ ast we have to call u@@ po@@ n our polit@@ ici@@ ans and our me@@ dia to dro@@ p a language of fear and be far more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant of one another ."
I am still Brit@@ ish .
I am still Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an .
I am still a global c@@ it@@ iz@@ en .
"For those of us who believe that our id@@ ent@@ ities are not m@@ ut@@ u@@ ally ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive , we have to all work together to en@@ sure that globaliz@@ ation takes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t leave people be@@ h@@ ind ."
O@@ n@@ ly then will we tr@@ ul@@ y re@@ con@@ c@@ ile democra@@ cy and globaliz@@ ation .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pl@@ eas@@ ure to be here .
I last did a TE@@ D Tal@@ k I think about seven years ago or so .
I tal@@ ked about sp@@ agh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ uc@@ e .
"And so many people , I gu@@ ess , wat@@ ch those vide@@ os ."
"P@@ eople have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about sp@@ agh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ uc@@ e , which is a wonderful thing in the shor@@ t ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ ven to be less than ide@@ al over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put sp@@ agh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ uc@@ e be@@ h@@ ind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this mor@@ ning &apos;s s@@ es@@ sion is Th@@ ings We M@@ ake .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most pre@@ ci@@ ous ob@@ jects of his er@@ a .
And the man &apos;s name is C@@ ar@@ l Norden .
C@@ ar@@ l Norden was born in 18@@ 80 .
And he was S@@ w@@ is@@ s .
"And of course , the S@@ w@@ is@@ s can be d@@ ivid@@ ed into two gener@@ al cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies : those who make small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects and those who h@@ and@@ le the money of those who buy small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects ."
And C@@ ar@@ l Norden is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the form@@ er cam@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ ec@@ h in Z@@ ur@@ ich .
"In fact , one of his clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es is a young man n@@ amed L@@ en@@ in who would go on to bre@@ ak small , exp@@ en@@ sive , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ob@@ jects ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ w@@ is@@ s engine@@ er , C@@ ar@@ l ."
And I mean that in its ful@@ l@@ est sense of the word .
"He we@@ ars thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important m@@ ust@@ ach@@ e ; and he is domin@@ e@@ ering and nar@@ c@@ is@@ sis@@ tic and driv@@ en and has an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary e@@ go ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our days ; and he has very st@@ rong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ nat@@ ing curr@@ ent ; and he fe@@ els like a sun@@ tan is a si@@ g@@ n of moral we@@ ak@@ ness ; and he dr@@ in@@ ks lots of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ; and he does his best work sit@@ ting in his mother &apos;s kit@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ ur@@ ich for hours in complet@@ e sil@@ ence with nothing but a sl@@ ide rul@@ e ."
"In any case , C@@ ar@@ l Norden e@@ mi@@ gra@@ t@@ es to the United States just before the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar and s@@ ets up sho@@ p on L@@ af@@ ay@@ et@@ te S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan ."
And he becom@@ es ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the question of how to dro@@ p bomb@@ s from an air@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ da@@ r , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a compl@@ ic@@ ated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ es an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to dro@@ p an object , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some st@@ ation@@ ary t@@ arg@@ et in the face of all kinds of w@@ in@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d c@@ over and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments ."
"And all sor@@ ts of people , mov@@ ing up to the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar and between the w@@ ars , tri@@ ed to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ arly everybody came up shor@@ t ."
The bomb@@ si@@ gh@@ ts that were av@@ a@@ il@@ able were incredi@@ bly c@@ ru@@ de .
But C@@ ar@@ l Norden is really the one who cra@@ c@@ ks the cod@@ e .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ bly compl@@ ic@@ ated dev@@ ice .
It we@@ igh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bomb@@ sight .
And it has all kinds of lev@@ ers and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and ga@@ dg@@ ets and gau@@ g@@ es .
And he makes this compl@@ ic@@ ated thing .
"And what he al@@ lo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er take this particular object , vis@@ u@@ ally sight the t@@ arg@@ et , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as c@@ one of the bom@@ ber , and then they pl@@ u@@ g in the al@@ tit@@ u@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the w@@ ind and the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the t@@ arg@@ et ."
And the bomb@@ sight will tell him when to dro@@ p the bom@@ b .
"And as Norden f@@ amo@@ us@@ ly says , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore that bomb@@ sight came along , bomb@@ s would ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely mis@@ s their t@@ arg@@ et by a mil@@ e or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mar@@ k 15 Norden bomb@@ sight , he could dro@@ p a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ bly exc@@ ited the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary was by the news of the Norden bomb@@ sight .
It was like man@@ na from he@@ aven .
"@@ Here was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , where mil@@ lions of men f@@ ou@@ ght each other in the tr@@ en@@ ch@@ es , getting no@@ where , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a dev@@ ice that al@@ lowed them to f@@ ly up in the sk@@ ies high ab@@ ove en@@ em@@ y ter@@ rit@@ ory and des@@ tro@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever they wanted with p@@ in@@ point acc@@ ura@@ cy ."
And the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develop@@ ing the Norden bomb@@ sight .
"And to put that in per@@ spec@@ tive , the tot@@ al cost of the M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan pro@@ ject was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was sp@@ ent on this Norden bomb@@ sight as was sp@@ ent on the most f@@ amo@@ us mil@@ it@@ ar@@ y-@@ ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al pro@@ ject of the moder@@ n er@@ a .
"And there were people , stra@@ te@@ g@@ ists , within the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single dev@@ ice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and vic@@ t@@ ory when it came to the b@@ at@@ tle against the N@@ az@@ is and against the Jap@@ an@@ ese ."
"And for Norden as well , this dev@@ ice had incredi@@ ble moral import@@ ance , because Norden was a com@@ mit@@ ted Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bomb@@ sight as his inv@@ en@@ tion , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of suf@@ fer@@ ing in any kind of war be reduc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bomb@@ sight do ?
Well it al@@ lowed you to do that .
It al@@ lowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years lead@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these Norden bomb@@ si@@ gh@@ ts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tra@@ ined 5@@ 0,000 bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ex@@ ten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tra@@ ining s@@ es@@ sions — because these things are essenti@@ ally anal@@ o@@ g comput@@ ers ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to s@@ we@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tu@@ red , they will not div@@ ul@@ ge a single deta@@ il of this particular dev@@ ice to the en@@ em@@ y , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the en@@ em@@ y not get their hands on this ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely essenti@@ al piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Norden bomb@@ sight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a ser@@ ies of ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ rou@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is h@@ and@@ c@@ uf@@ f@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never al@@ lowed to be ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ ed .
"And there &apos;s a little in@@ cen@@ di@@ ary dev@@ ice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever cra@@ sh@@ es , it will be des@@ tro@@ yed and there &apos;s no way the en@@ em@@ y can ever get their hands on it ."
The Norden bomb@@ sight is the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il .
So what happens d@@ uring the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il ."
"In prac@@ ti@@ ce , the Norden bomb@@ sight can dro@@ p a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under per@@ fect con@@ dit@@ ions ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , con@@ dit@@ ions ar@@ en &apos;t per@@ fect ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers have the ability to pro@@ per@@ ly program an anal@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , it bre@@ ak@@ s down a lot ."
"It &apos;s ful@@ l of all kinds of g@@ y@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ es and pul@@ le@@ ys and ga@@ dg@@ ets and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ou@@ ght to in the he@@ at of b@@ at@@ tle ."
"Th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , when Norden was making his cal@@ cul@@ ations , he as@@ sum@@ ed that a plan@@ e would be fl@@ ying at a rel@@ ati@@ vely s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ tit@@ ud@@ es ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sh@@ ot down ."
So they started fl@@ ying them at high al@@ tit@@ ud@@ es at incredi@@ bly high spe@@ ed@@ s .
And the Norden bomb@@ sight doesn &apos;t work as well under those con@@ dit@@ ions .
"But most of all , the Norden bomb@@ sight requ@@ i@@ red the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er to make vis@@ ual cont@@ act with the t@@ arg@@ et ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It needs cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ y to be really ac@@ cu@@ rate .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were ab@@ ove C@@ ent@@ ral Eu@@ rop@@ e between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 4@@ 5 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how in@@ ac@@ cu@@ rate the Norden bomb@@ sight was , there was a f@@ amo@@ us case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the A@@ l@@ li@@ es bomb@@ ed a chem@@ ical pl@@ ant in L@@ e@@ un@@ a , G@@ er@@ many ."
And the chem@@ ical pl@@ ant com@@ pris@@ ed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ res .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the A@@ l@@ li@@ es dro@@ pped 8@@ 5@@ ,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re chem@@ ical pl@@ ant , using the Norden bomb@@ sight ."
Well what per@@ cent@@ age of those bomb@@ s do you think actually l@@ and@@ ed inside the 7@@ 00-@@ ac@@ re per@@ ime@@ ter of the pl@@ ant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that l@@ and@@ ed , 1@@ 6 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The L@@ e@@ un@@ a chem@@ ical pl@@ ant , after one of the most ex@@ ten@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those prec@@ au@@ tions to keep the Norden bomb@@ sight out of the hands of the N@@ az@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that C@@ ar@@ l Norden , as a pro@@ per S@@ w@@ is@@ s , was very en@@ amo@@ red of G@@ er@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he hi@@ red a whole bun@@ ch of them , incl@@ ud@@ ing a man n@@ amed H@@ er@@ man@@ n L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a complet@@ e set of the plan@@ s for the Norden bomb@@ sight to the N@@ az@@ is ."
"So they had their own Norden bomb@@ sight throu@@ gh@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bomb@@ sight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bomb@@ si@@ gh@@ ts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really s@@ mart people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve inv@@ ented ga@@ dg@@ ets that will for@@ ever change our world ."
They &apos;ve inv@@ ented w@@ eb@@ sit@@ es that will al@@ low people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve inv@@ ented some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world for@@ ever better ."
"If you go into the mil@@ it@@ ary , you &apos;ll find lots of C@@ ar@@ l Nor@@ den@@ s as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very c@@ lear about how little that means .
"In the I@@ ra@@ q W@@ ar , at the beginning of the first I@@ ra@@ q W@@ ar , the U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary , the air force , s@@ ent two s@@ qu@@ ad@@ rons of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ i@@ ghter E@@ ag@@ les to the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i des@@ ert equ@@ ip@@ ped with these five million doll@@ ar c@@ amer@@ as that al@@ lowed them to see the enti@@ re des@@ ert f@@ lo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to des@@ tro@@ y — remember the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ s@@ ile la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ sil@@ es that the I@@ ra@@ q@@ is were la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing at the I@@ s@@ ra@@ elis ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two s@@ qu@@ ad@@ rons was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ s@@ ile la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"And so they f@@ le@@ w mis@@ sions day and night , and they dro@@ pped thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ sil@@ es in an at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of this particular s@@ cour@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ dit done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually des@@ tro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ ero , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ a@@ pon@@ s wer@@ en &apos;t ac@@ cu@@ rate ?
"O@@ h no , they were br@@ il@@ lian@@ tly ac@@ cu@@ rate ."
"They could have des@@ tro@@ yed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d la@@ un@@ ch@@ ers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ r@@ els is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to f@@ igh@@ ting w@@ ars .
O@@ r take the b@@ at@@ tle in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
What is the si@@ g@@ nature we@@ apo@@ n of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan ?
It &apos;s the dro@@ ne . What is the dro@@ ne ?
Well it is the grand@@ son of the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bomb@@ sight .
It is this we@@ apo@@ n of dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating acc@@ ura@@ cy and prec@@ ision .
"And over the course of the last six years in Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan , the C@@ I@@ A has f@@ lo@@ wn hund@@ re@@ ds of dro@@ ne mis@@ sil@@ es , and it &apos;s used those dro@@ nes to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 s@@ us@@ pec@@ ted P@@ ak@@ ist@@ ani and Tal@@ ib@@ an mil@@ it@@ an@@ ts ."
Now what is the acc@@ ura@@ cy of those dro@@ nes ?
Well it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent acc@@ ura@@ cy when it comes to dro@@ ne st@@ rik@@ es .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be k@@ il@@ led , right ?"
That is one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary rec@@ or@@ ds in the history of moder@@ n war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same peri@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these dro@@ nes with dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating acc@@ ura@@ cy , the number of att@@ ac@@ ks , of su@@ ic@@ ide att@@ ac@@ ks and ter@@ ro@@ r@@ ist att@@ ac@@ ks , against American for@@ ces in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan has increas@@ ed ten@@ f@@ old ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent in k@@ il@@ ling them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not descri@@ bed to you a success story .
I &apos;ve descri@@ bed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our in@@ f@@ at@@ u@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more compl@@ ex than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the acc@@ ura@@ cy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more import@@ an@@ tly , whether you ou@@ ght to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a pos@@ ts@@ cri@@ pt to the Norden story of C@@ ar@@ l Norden and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bomb@@ sight .
"And that is , on A@@ u@@ g@@ ust 6 , 19@@ 4@@ 5 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bom@@ ber called the E@@ no@@ la G@@ ay f@@ le@@ w over Jap@@ an and , using a Norden bomb@@ sight , dro@@ pped a very large ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear dev@@ ice on the c@@ ity of H@@ iro@@ sh@@ im@@ a ."
"And as was typ@@ ical with the Norden bomb@@ sight , the bom@@ b actually mis@@ sed its t@@ arg@@ et by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est i@@ ron@@ y of all when it comes to the Norden bomb@@ sight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion doll@@ ar bomb@@ sight was used to dro@@ p its three billion doll@@ ar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bomb@@ sight at all ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , back in New Y@@ or@@ k , no one told C@@ ar@@ l Norden that his bomb@@ sight was used over H@@ iro@@ sh@@ im@@ a ."
He was a com@@ mit@@ ted Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an .
He thought he had des@@ ign@@ ed something that would reduc@@ e the t@@ ol@@ l of suf@@ fer@@ ing in war .
It would have bro@@ ken his heart .
( Applause )
"I ad@@ mit that I &apos;m a little bit nerv@@ ous here because I &apos;m going to say some rad@@ ical things , about how we should think about cancer differ@@ ently , to an audi@@ ence that con@@ ta@@ ins a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do ."
But I will also con@@ test that I &apos;m not as nerv@@ ous as I should be because I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;m right about this .
"( Laughter ) And that this , in fact , will be the way that we treat cancer in the future ."
"In order to talk about cancer , I &apos;m going to actually have to — let me get the big sl@@ ide here ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , I &apos;m going to try to give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive of gen@@ om@@ ics ."
"I want to put it in per@@ spec@@ tive of the big@@ ger picture of all the other things that are going on — and then talk about something you hav@@ en &apos;t heard so much about , which is pro@@ te@@ om@@ ics ."
"H@@ av@@ ing expla@@ ined those , that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about tre@@ ating cancer ."
So let me start with gen@@ om@@ ics .
It is the h@@ ot t@@ op@@ ic .
It is the place where we &apos;re learning the most .
This is the great fron@@ ti@@ er .
But it has its li@@ mit@@ ations .
"And in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the anal@@ o@@ gy that the gen@@ ome is like the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ t of your body , and if that were only true , it would be great , but it &apos;s not ."
It &apos;s like the parts l@@ ist of your body .
"It doesn &apos;t say how things are connec@@ ted , what ca@@ uses what and so on ."
"So if I can make an anal@@ o@@ gy , let &apos;s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant , a heal@@ thy re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant and a sic@@ k re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant , and all you had was the l@@ ist of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that they had in their l@@ ar@@ der ."
"So it might be that , if you went to a F@@ ren@@ ch re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant and you looked through it and you found they only had mar@@ gar@@ ine and they didn &apos;t have b@@ ut@@ ter , you could say , &quot; &quot; A@@ h , I see what &apos;s wrong with them ."
I can make them heal@@ thy . &quot; &quot; And there probably are spec@@ ial cas@@ es of that .
You could certain@@ ly tell the difference between a Ch@@ in@@ ese re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant and a F@@ ren@@ ch re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant by what they had in a l@@ ar@@ der .
"So the l@@ ist of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents does tell you something , and sometimes it tel@@ ls you something that &apos;s wrong ."
"If they have t@@ ons of sal@@ t , you might gu@@ ess they &apos;re using too much sal@@ t , or something like that ."
"But it &apos;s li@@ mit@@ ed , because really to know if it &apos;s a heal@@ thy re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant , you need to t@@ as@@ te the food , you need to know what goes on in the kit@@ ch@@ en , you need the produc@@ t of all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents ."
"So if I look at a person and I look at a person &apos;s gen@@ ome , it &apos;s the same thing ."
The part of the gen@@ ome that we can read is the l@@ ist of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents .
"And so inde@@ ed , there are times when we can find in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that &#91; are &#93; bad ."
"C@@ y@@ s@@ tic fi@@ bro@@ sis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent and you have a disease , and we can actually make a direc@@ t cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ce between the in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent and the disease ."
"But most things , you really have to know what &apos;s going on in the kit@@ ch@@ en , because , mo@@ st@@ ly , sic@@ k people used to be heal@@ thy people — they have the same gen@@ ome ."
So the gen@@ ome really tel@@ ls you much more about pre@@ dis@@ position .
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an A@@ si@@ an person and a Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an person by looking at their in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents l@@ ist .
But you really for the most part can &apos;t tell the difference between a heal@@ thy person and a sic@@ k person — ex@@ cept in some of these spec@@ ial cas@@ es .
So why all the big de@@ al about gen@@ e@@ tics ?
"Well first of all , it &apos;s because we can read it , which is f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ."
It is very us@@ ef@@ ul in certain cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces .
It &apos;s also the great the@@ or@@ e@@ tical tri@@ um@@ p@@ h of bi@@ ology .
It &apos;s the one theory that the bi@@ olog@@ ists ever really got right .
It &apos;s fundamental to D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and M@@ en@@ del and so on .
And so it &apos;s the one thing where they predic@@ ted a the@@ or@@ e@@ tical con@@ struc@@ t .
"So M@@ en@@ del had this idea of a gen@@ e as an ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t thing , and D@@ ar@@ w@@ in built a whole theory that de@@ pen@@ ded on them ex@@ is@@ ting , and then W@@ ats@@ on and C@@ ric@@ k actually looked and found one ."
So this happens in physics all the time .
"You predic@@ t a black hole , and you look out the tel@@ esc@@ ope and there it is , just like you said ."
But it r@@ ar@@ ely happens in bi@@ ology .
"So this great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h — it &apos;s so good , there &apos;s almost a relig@@ ious experience in bi@@ ology ."
And D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ ian evolution is really the cor@@ e theory .
"So the other reason it &apos;s been very popul@@ ar is because we can measure it , it &apos;s dig@@ ital ."
"And in fact , th@@ an@@ ks to K@@ ary M@@ ul@@ lis , you can basically measure your gen@@ ome in your kit@@ ch@@ en with a few extra in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents ."
"So for inst@@ ance , by meas@@ uring the gen@@ ome , we &apos;ve learned a lot about how we &apos;re rel@@ ated to other kinds of an@@ im@@ als by the clo@@ sen@@ ess of our gen@@ ome , or how we &apos;re rel@@ ated to each other — the family t@@ ree , or the t@@ ree of life ."
There &apos;s a huge amount of information about the gen@@ e@@ tics just by com@@ par@@ ing the gen@@ e@@ tic si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity .
"Now of course , in me@@ d@@ ical ap@@ plic@@ ation , that is very us@@ ef@@ ul because it &apos;s the same kind of information that the doc@@ tor gets from your family me@@ d@@ ical history — ex@@ cept probably , your gen@@ ome kno@@ ws much more about your me@@ d@@ ical history than you do ."
"And so by read@@ ing the gen@@ ome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know ."
"And so we can disc@@ over things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your rel@@ ati@@ ves , but they may be sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
I did the 2@@ 3@@ and@@ M@@ e thing and was very sur@@ pris@@ ed to disc@@ over that I am f@@ at and bal@@ d .
( Laughter ) But sometimes you can learn much more us@@ ef@@ ul things about that .
"But mo@@ st@@ ly what you need to know , to find out if you &apos;re sic@@ k , is not your pre@@ dis@@ pos@@ it@@ ions , but it &apos;s actually what &apos;s going on in your body right now ."
"So to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the gen@@ es are produc@@ ing and what &apos;s happening after the gen@@ e@@ tics , and that &apos;s what pro@@ te@@ om@@ ics is about ."
"@@ Just like gen@@ ome mi@@ x@@ es the study of all the gen@@ es , pro@@ te@@ om@@ ics is the study of all the pro@@ te@@ ins ."
"And the pro@@ te@@ ins are all of the little things in your body that are sign@@ al@@ ing between the cells — actually , the ma@@ chin@@ es that are oper@@ ating — that &apos;s where the action is ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , a human body is a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sic@@ k , something &apos;s gone wrong with that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And so the tric@@ k is — un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , we don &apos;t have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the gen@@ ome ."
"So the problem is that meas@@ uring — if you try to measure all the pro@@ te@@ ins , it &apos;s a very el@@ ab@@ o@@ rate process ."
"It requ@@ ir@@ es hund@@ re@@ ds of ste@@ ps , and it takes a long , long time ."
And it mat@@ ters how much of the pro@@ te@@ in it is .
"It could be very si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant that a pro@@ te@@ in changed by 10 percent , so it &apos;s not a n@@ ice dig@@ ital thing like D@@ N@@ A ."
"And basically our problem is somebody &apos;s in the middle of this very long stage , they p@@ ause for just a moment , and they leave something in an en@@ z@@ y@@ me for a second , and all of a su@@ d@@ den all the meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments from then on don &apos;t work ."
And so then people get very in@@ con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent results when they do it this way .
P@@ eople have tri@@ ed very hard to do this .
I tri@@ ed this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it .
I ke@@ pt getting this call from this on@@ c@@ olog@@ ist n@@ amed D@@ av@@ id A@@ g@@ us .
"And Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed M@@ in@@ ds gets a lot of call@@ s from people who want help with their problems , and I didn &apos;t think this was a very likely one to call back , so I ke@@ pt on giving him to the del@@ ay l@@ ist ."
"And then one day , I get a call from J@@ o@@ h@@ n D@@ o@@ er@@ r , B@@ ill B@@ er@@ k@@ man and A@@ l G@@ ore on the same day saying re@@ turn D@@ av@@ id A@@ g@@ us &apos;s ph@@ one call ."
"( Laughter ) So I was like , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay . This guy &apos;s at le@@ ast resour@@ ce@@ ful . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we started talking , and he said , &quot; &quot; I really need a better way to measure pro@@ te@@ ins . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ o@@ ked at that . B@@ e@@ en there ."
"@@ Not going to be easy . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No , no . I really need it ."
"I mean , I see patients d@@ ying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them ."
We have to have a w@@ ind@@ ow into this . &quot; &quot; And he took me through spec@@ if@@ ic exam@@ pl@@ es of when he really needed it .
"And I real@@ ized , w@@ ow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so I said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot; &quot; Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed M@@ in@@ ds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting any@@ body &apos;s f@@ und@@ ing or per@@ mis@@ sion or anything ."
So we started pla@@ ying around with this .
"And as we did it , we real@@ ized this was the bas@@ ic problem — that taking the si@@ p of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e — that there were hum@@ ans doing this compl@@ ic@@ ated process and that what really needed to be done was to aut@@ o@@ mate this process like an as@@ s@@ em@@ bly line and build rob@@ ots that would measure pro@@ te@@ om@@ ics ."
"And so we did that , and working with D@@ av@@ id , we made a little compan@@ y called Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed P@@ ro@@ te@@ om@@ ics even@@ tually , which makes this rob@@ ot@@ ic as@@ s@@ em@@ bly line , which , in a very con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent way , meas@@ ures the pro@@ te@@ in ."
And I &apos;ll show you what that pro@@ te@@ in meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment looks like .
"B@@ as@@ ically , what we do is we take a dro@@ p of blo@@ od out of a pati@@ ent , and we sort out the pro@@ te@@ ins in the dro@@ p of blo@@ od ac@@ cor@@ ding to how much they we@@ igh , how s@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ y they are , and we ar@@ ran@@ ge them in an imag@@ e ."
And so we can look at liter@@ ally hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of fe@@ atures at once out of that dro@@ p of blo@@ od .
"And we can take a different one to@@ mor@@ row , and you will see your pro@@ te@@ ins to@@ mor@@ row will be different — they &apos;ll be different after you e@@ at or after you s@@ le@@ ep ."
They really tell us what &apos;s going on there .
"And so this picture , which looks like a big sm@@ ud@@ ge to you , is actually the thing that got me really th@@ r@@ il@@ led about this and made me feel like we were on the right trac@@ k ."
"So if I zo@@ om into that picture , I can just show you what it means ."
"We sort out the pro@@ te@@ ins — from left to right is the we@@ ight of the fra@@ g@@ ments that we &apos;re getting , and from top to bot@@ tom is how s@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ y they are ."
So we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in here just to show you a little bit of it .
And so each of these lin@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents some sign@@ al that we &apos;re getting out of a piece of a pro@@ te@@ in .
"And you can see how the lin@@ es oc@@ c@@ ur in these little gro@@ ups of b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p ."
"And that &apos;s because we &apos;re meas@@ uring the we@@ ight so prec@@ is@@ ely that — car@@ b@@ on comes in different is@@ ot@@ op@@ es , so if it has an extra ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ n on it , we actually measure it as a different chem@@ ical ."
So we &apos;re actually meas@@ uring each is@@ ot@@ ope as a different one .
And so that giv@@ es you an idea of how ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely sen@@ sit@@ ive this is .
"So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o and looking at the stars and looking through the tel@@ esc@@ ope for the first time , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly you say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , it &apos;s way more compl@@ ic@@ ated than we thought it was . &quot; &quot; But we can see that stuff out there and actually see fe@@ atures of it ."
So this is the si@@ g@@ nature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
"So what we do with this is , for example , we can look at two patients , one that respon@@ ded to a dru@@ g and one that didn &apos;t res@@ po@@ nd to a dru@@ g , and ask , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on differ@@ ently inside of them ? &quot; &quot; And so we can make these meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments prec@@ is@@ ely enough that we can over@@ la@@ y two patients and look at the differ@@ ences ."
So here we have A@@ l@@ ice in gre@@ en and B@@ ob in red .
We over@@ la@@ y them . This is ac@@ tual data .
"And you can see , mo@@ st@@ ly it over@@ l@@ aps and it &apos;s y@@ el@@ low , but there &apos;s some things that just A@@ l@@ ice has and some things that just B@@ ob has ."
"And if we find a pat@@ tern of things of the respon@@ d@@ ers to the dru@@ g , we see that in the blo@@ od , they have the con@@ d@@ ition that al@@ lo@@ ws them to res@@ po@@ nd to this dru@@ g ."
"We might not even know what this pro@@ te@@ in is , but we can see it &apos;s a mark@@ er for the respon@@ se to the disease ."
"So this already , I think , is tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously us@@ ef@@ ul in all kinds of medic@@ ine ."
But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we &apos;re going to treat cancer .
So let me move to cancer .
"The thing about cancer — when I got into this , I really knew nothing about it , but working with D@@ av@@ id A@@ g@@ us , I started wat@@ ch@@ ing how cancer was actually being tre@@ ated and went to oper@@ ations where it was being c@@ ut out ."
"And as I looked at it , to me it didn &apos;t make sense how we were appro@@ ach@@ ing cancer , and in order to make sense of it , I had to learn where did this come from ."
We &apos;re tre@@ ating cancer almost like it &apos;s an in@@ fec@@ ti@@ ous disease .
We &apos;re tre@@ ating it as something that got inside of you that we have to k@@ ill .
So this is the great par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
This is another case where a the@@ or@@ e@@ tical par@@ a@@ dig@@ m in bi@@ ology really worked — was the ger@@ m theory of disease .
"So what doc@@ tors are mo@@ st@@ ly tra@@ ined to do is diagno@@ se — that is , put you into a cat@@ eg@@ ory and app@@ ly a scienti@@ fic@@ ally pro@@ ven treat@@ ment for that diagno@@ sis — and that works great for in@@ fec@@ ti@@ ous dis@@ eas@@ es ."
"So if we put you in the cat@@ eg@@ ory of you &apos;ve got sy@@ ph@@ ilis , we can give you pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in ."
We know that that works .
"If you &apos;ve got mal@@ aria , we give you qu@@ in@@ ine or some der@@ iv@@ ative of it ."
"And so that &apos;s the bas@@ ic thing doc@@ tors are tra@@ ined to do , and it &apos;s mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous in the case of in@@ fec@@ ti@@ ous disease — how well it works ."
And many people in this audi@@ ence probably wouldn &apos;t be al@@ ive if doc@@ tors didn &apos;t do this .
But now let &apos;s app@@ ly that to syst@@ ems dis@@ eas@@ es like cancer .
"The problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you ."
It &apos;s you ; you &apos;re bro@@ ken .
That con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion inside of you got mi@@ x@@ ed up in some way .
So how do we diagno@@ se that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ?
"Well , right now what we do is we div@@ ide it by part of the body — you know , where did it ap@@ pe@@ ar ? — and we put you in different cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies ac@@ cor@@ ding to the part of the body ."
"And then we do a cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ al for a dru@@ g for l@@ un@@ g cancer and one for pro@@ state cancer and one for bre@@ ast cancer , and we treat these as if they &apos;re se@@ par@@ ate dis@@ eas@@ es and that this way of d@@ ivid@@ ing them had something to do with what actually went wrong ."
"And of course , it really doesn &apos;t have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a fa@@ il@@ ure of the system ."
"And in fact , I think we &apos;re even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing ."
I think this is the big mis@@ take .
I think cancer should not be a n@@ ou@@ n .
"We should talk about can@@ cer@@ ing as something we do , not something we have ."
"And so those tu@@ mor@@ s , those are sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms of cancer ."
"And so your body is probably can@@ cer@@ ing all the time , but there are lots of syst@@ ems in your body that keep it under control ."
"And so to give you an idea of an anal@@ o@@ gy of what I mean by thinking of can@@ cer@@ ing as a ver@@ b , imagine we didn &apos;t know anything about pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing , and the way that we tal@@ ked about it , we &apos;d come home and we &apos;d find a le@@ ak in our kit@@ ch@@ en and we &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , my h@@ ou@@ se has water . &quot; &quot; We might div@@ ide it — the pl@@ um@@ ber would say , &quot; &quot; Well , where &apos;s the water ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s in the kit@@ ch@@ en . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you must have kit@@ ch@@ en water . &quot;"
That &apos;s kind of the level at which it is .
"&quot; &quot; K@@ it@@ ch@@ en water , well , first of all , we &apos;ll go in there and we &apos;ll mo@@ p out a lot of it ."
"And then we know that if we sp@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le D@@ ran@@ o around the kit@@ ch@@ en , that hel@@ ps ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as living room water , it &apos;s better to do t@@ ar on the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; And it s@@ oun@@ ds sil@@ ly , but that &apos;s basically what we do ."
"And I &apos;m not saying you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t mo@@ p up your water if you have cancer , but I &apos;m saying that &apos;s not really the problem ; that &apos;s the sym@@ p@@ tom of the problem ."
"What we really need to get at is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s happening at the level of the pro@@ te@@ on@@ omi@@ c ac@@ tions , happening at the level of why is your body not heal@@ ing itself in the way that it nor@@ m@@ ally does ?"
"Because nor@@ m@@ ally , your body is de@@ al@@ ing with this problem all the time ."
"So your h@@ ou@@ se is de@@ al@@ ing with le@@ ak@@ s all the time , but it &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ing them . It &apos;s dra@@ ining them out and so on ."
"So what we need is to have a c@@ au@@ sa@@ tive mo@@ del of what &apos;s actually going on , and pro@@ te@@ om@@ ics actually giv@@ es us the ability to build a mo@@ del like that ."
D@@ av@@ id got me in@@ vit@@ ed to give a talk at N@@ ational C@@ an@@ cer In@@ st@@ it@@ ute and An@@ na B@@ ar@@ k@@ er was there .
"And so I gave this talk and said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you gu@@ ys do this ? &quot; &quot; And An@@ na said , &quot; &quot; Because nob@@ ody within cancer would look at it this way ."
"But what we &apos;re going to do , is we &apos;re going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doc@@ tors who really know about cancer and work out different program@@ s of research . &quot; &quot; So D@@ av@@ id and I app@@ li@@ ed to this program and created a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um at U@@ S@@ C where we &apos;ve got some of the best on@@ c@@ olog@@ ists in the world and some of the best bi@@ olog@@ ists in the world , from C@@ old S@@ pr@@ ing H@@ ar@@ b@@ or , S@@ tan@@ for@@ d , A@@ us@@ ti@@ n — I won &apos;t even go through and name all the places — to have a research pro@@ ject that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a mo@@ del of cancer like this ."
"We &apos;re doing it in m@@ ice first , and we will k@@ ill a lot of m@@ ice in the process of doing this , but they will die for a good cause ."
"And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predic@@ tive mo@@ del where we can understand , when cancer happens , what &apos;s actually happening in there and which treat@@ ment will treat that cancer ."
So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treat@@ ment will be like in the future .
"So I think even@@ tually , once we have one of these mod@@ els for people , which we &apos;ll get even@@ tually — I mean , our group won &apos;t get all the way there — but even@@ tually we &apos;ll have a very good computer mo@@ del — sort of like a global cli@@ mate mo@@ del for we@@ a@@ ther ."
It has lots of different information about what &apos;s the process going on in this pro@@ te@@ omi@@ c con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion on many different sc@@ al@@ es .
"And so we will sim@@ ul@@ ate in that mo@@ del for your particular cancer — and this also will be for A@@ L@@ S , or any kind of system neu@@ rode@@ gener@@ ative dis@@ eas@@ es , things like that — we will sim@@ ul@@ ate speci@@ fic@@ ally you , not just a gener@@ ic person , but what &apos;s actually going on inside you ."
"And in that sim@@ ul@@ ation , what we could do is des@@ ign for you speci@@ fic@@ ally a se@@ qu@@ ence of treat@@ ments , and it might be very gen@@ tle treat@@ ments , very small amoun@@ ts of dru@@ gs ."
"It might be things like , don &apos;t e@@ at that day , or give them a little ch@@ emo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y , maybe a little radi@@ ation ."
"O@@ f course , we &apos;ll do sur@@ ger@@ y sometimes and so on ."
But des@@ ign a program of treat@@ ments speci@@ fic@@ ally for you and help your body gu@@ ide back to health — gu@@ ide your body back to health .
Because your body will do most of the work of fi@@ x@@ ing it if we just sort of pro@@ p it up in the ways that are wrong .
We put it in the equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of s@@ pl@@ in@@ ts .
"And so your body basically has lots and lots of me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms for fi@@ x@@ ing cancer , and we just have to pro@@ p those up in the right way and get them to do the job ."
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be tre@@ ated in the future .
"It &apos;s going to requ@@ ire a lot of work , a lot of research ."
There will be many te@@ ams like our te@@ am that work on this .
"But I think even@@ tually , we will des@@ ign for everybody a cu@@ st@@ om treat@@ ment for cancer ."
So th@@ ank you very much .

"She is not wel@@ com@@ ed , nei@@ ther by father n@@ or by mother ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od comes and com@@ mis@@ er@@ ates with the mother , and nob@@ ody con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ates the father ."
And a mother is very un@@ com@@ for@@ table for having a gir@@ l child .

She can have fu@@ n .
"She can play with her friends in the stre@@ ets , and she can move around in the stre@@ ets like a b@@ ut@@ ter@@ f@@ ly ."
"But when she en@@ ters her te@@ ens , when she becom@@ es 1@@ 3 years old , she is for@@ b@@ id@@ den to go out of her home without a mal@@ e es@@ cor@@ t ."
She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four w@@ all@@ s of her home .
She is no more a f@@ ree individ@@ ual .
"She becom@@ es the so@@ -@@ called h@@ on@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ thers and of her family , and if she trans@@ g@@ res@@ ses the cod@@ e of that so@@ -@@ called h@@ on@@ or , she could even be k@@ il@@ led ."

"So this bro@@ ther , he sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sis@@ ters at the al@@ t@@ ar of so@@ -@@ called h@@ on@@ or ."
And there is one more nor@@ m of the pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al societies that is called ob@@ e@@ di@@ ence .
"A good gir@@ l is sup@@ posed to be very qu@@ iet , very hum@@ ble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive ."
It is the c@@ rit@@ eria .
The ro@@ le mo@@ del good gir@@ l should be very qu@@ iet .
"She is sup@@ posed to be sil@@ ent and she is sup@@ posed to ac@@ cept the dec@@ is@@ ions of her father and mother and the dec@@ is@@ ions of el@@ d@@ ers , even if she does not like them ."
"If she is marri@@ ed to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is marri@@ ed to an old man , she has to ac@@ cept , because she does not want to be d@@ ub@@ bed as dis@@ ob@@ e@@ di@@ ent ."
"If she is marri@@ ed very early , she has to ac@@ cept ."
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , she will be called dis@@ ob@@ e@@ di@@ ent ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is w@@ ed@@ ded , bed@@ ded , and then she giv@@ es bir@@ th to more s@@ ons and dau@@ gh@@ ters ."
"And it is the i@@ ron@@ y of the sit@@ u@@ ation that this mother , she teach@@ es the same les@@ son of ob@@ e@@ di@@ ence to her dau@@ ghter and the same les@@ son of h@@ on@@ or to her s@@ ons ."

"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters , when M@@ al@@ ala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like ne@@ w@@ born children , to be h@@ on@@ est , but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es , believe me , I got extre@@ m@@ ely h@@ on@@ ored ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with a her@@ o@@ ic le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y fre@@ ed@@ om fi@@ ghter in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan ."
"H@@ er name was M@@ al@@ al@@ ai of M@@ ai@@ w@@ and , and I n@@ amed my dau@@ ghter after her ."

"But when I looked , all were men , and I pic@@ ked my p@@ en , dre@@ w a line from my name , and w@@ ro@@ te , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ ala . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ mit@@ ted her in my school ."

En@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ment in a school means reco@@ gn@@ ition of her id@@ ent@@ ity and her name .
A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has en@@ ter@@ ed the world of dre@@ ams and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions where she can ex@@ pl@@ ore her po@@ ten@@ ti@@ als for her future life .
"I have five sis@@ ters , and n@@ one of them could go to school , and you will be as@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ shed , two weeks before , when I was fil@@ ling out the C@@ an@@ a@@ dian v@@ isa form , and I was fil@@ ling out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ nam@@ es of some of my sis@@ ters ."
"And the reason was that I have never , never seen the nam@@ es of my sis@@ ters writ@@ ten on any doc@@ um@@ ent ."
That was the reason that I val@@ u@@ ed my dau@@ ghter .
"What my father could not give to my sis@@ ters and to his dau@@ gh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the intelligence and the br@@ il@@ li@@ ance of my dau@@ ghter .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to s@@ it with me when my friends used to come .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings .
"And all these good val@@ ues , I tri@@ ed to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her person@@ ality ."
"And this was not only she , only M@@ al@@ ala ."
"I im@@ par@@ ted all these good val@@ ues to my school , gir@@ l students and bo@@ y students as well ."
I used education for em@@ an@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"I t@@ au@@ ght my girls , I t@@ au@@ ght my gir@@ l students , to un@@ learn the les@@ son of ob@@ e@@ di@@ ence ."
I t@@ au@@ ght my bo@@ y students to un@@ learn the les@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ h@@ on@@ or .
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters , we were st@@ riv@@ ing for more ri@@ gh@@ ts for women , and we were st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ gh@@ ts and particul@@ arly to women &apos;s ri@@ gh@@ ts .
It was called Tal@@ ib@@ an@@ iz@@ ation .
"It means a complet@@ e ne@@ ga@@ tion of women &apos;s par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in all political , econom@@ ical and social acti@@ vit@@ ies ."
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of scho@@ ols were lo@@ st .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ h@@ ib@@ ited from going to school .
W@@ omen were for@@ ced to we@@ ar ve@@ ils and they were st@@ op@@ ped from going to the mar@@ ket@@ s .
"M@@ us@@ ici@@ ans were sil@@ en@@ ced , girls were f@@ log@@ g@@ ed and sin@@ g@@ ers were k@@ il@@ led ."
It &apos;s really the most sc@@ ary thing .
"She w@@ ro@@ te a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C blo@@ g , she vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed her@@ self for the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ ies , and she spo@@ ke from every pl@@ at@@ form she could ."
And her vo@@ ice was the most power@@ ful vo@@ ice .
It sp@@ read like a c@@ res@@ cen@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the Tal@@ ib@@ an could not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate her cam@@ pa@@ ign , and on O@@ c@@ t@@ ob@@ er 9 20@@ 12 , she was sh@@ ot in the head at point bl@@ ank ran@@ ge ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black hole .
"Wh@@ ile my dau@@ ghter was on the ver@@ ge of life and death , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of my wi@@ fe , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be bl@@ amed for what happened to my dau@@ ghter and your dau@@ ghter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t bl@@ ame yourself ."
You st@@ ood for the right cause .
"You put your life at st@@ ake for the cause of tr@@ uth , for the cause of pe@@ ace , and for the cause of education , and your dau@@ ghter in insp@@ i@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right pat@@ h and G@@ od will pro@@ t@@ ect her . &quot; &quot; These few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When M@@ al@@ ala was in the ho@@ sp@@ ital , and she was going through the s@@ ev@@ ere pa@@ ins and she had had s@@ ev@@ ere he@@ ada@@ ch@@ es because her f@@ aci@@ al ner@@ ve was c@@ ut down , I used to see a dark sh@@ ad@@ ow sp@@ read@@ ing on the face of my wi@@ fe ."
But my dau@@ ghter never com@@ pla@@ ined .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fin@@ e with my c@@ ro@@ o@@ ked s@@ mil@@ e and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be o@@ kay . P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters , we learned from her how to be res@@ il@@ i@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m gl@@ ad to share with you that des@@ p@@ ite being an ic@@ on for the ri@@ gh@@ ts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old gir@@ l ."
She cri@@ es when her ho@@ me@@ work is in@@ complet@@ e .
"She qu@@ ar@@ r@@ els with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"P@@ eople ask me , what spec@@ ial is in my m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship which has made M@@ al@@ ala so b@@ old and so cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and so v@@ oc@@ al and po@@ ised ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not cli@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .

I &apos;m going to talk to you today about h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing fear into hope .
"When we go to the physic@@ ian today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re tr@@ ul@@ y af@@ ra@@ id of .
"D@@ i@@ ab@@ et@@ es , cancer , P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , l@@ un@@ g fa@@ il@@ ure — things that we know are deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating dis@@ eas@@ es , for which there &apos;s rel@@ ati@@ vely little that can be done ."
"And what I want to la@@ y out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will mel@@ t down if you think it already h@@ as@@ n &apos;t , and where we are cl@@ in@@ ically today , and where we might go to@@ mor@@ row , and what some of the h@@ ur@@ d@@ les are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I prom@@ ise ."
"I want to start with this sl@@ ide , because this sl@@ ide sort of tel@@ ls the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an issue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ tic@@ les on the bi@@ on@@ ic human .
It was basically a regener@@ ative medic@@ ine issue .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a cl@@ in@@ ically rel@@ ev@@ ant tim@@ es@@ cal@@ e .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a da@@ mag@@ ed hi@@ p , you can put an ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial hi@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine used on their front c@@ over .
This is the complet@@ e an@@ ti@@ th@@ esis of regener@@ ative medic@@ ine .
This is not regener@@ ative medic@@ ine .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is what B@@ us@@ iness W@@ e@@ e@@ k put up when they did a story about regener@@ ative medic@@ ine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of fig@@ uring out how to am@@ eli@@ o@@ rate sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms with dev@@ ices and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will regener@@ ate lo@@ st func@@ tion of the body by regener@@ ating the func@@ tion of organs and da@@ mag@@ ed t@@ issue ."
"So that at the end of the treat@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treat@@ ment ."
V@@ er@@ y few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are tr@@ ul@@ y no@@ vel .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Ch@@ ar@@ les L@@ ind@@ ber@@ gh , who was better known for fl@@ ying air@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the N@@ ob@@ el Lau@@ re@@ ates from R@@ oc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ l@@ er , to be@@ gin to think about , could you culture organs ?"
"And they published this book in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually be@@ gan to think about , what could you do in bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole organs ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exc@@ iting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks y@@ es@@ ter@@ day tal@@ ked about impro@@ v@@ ing the qu@@ ality of life , and reduc@@ ing pov@@ ert@@ y , and essenti@@ ally increas@@ ing life expec@@ tan@@ cy all around the glob@@ e ."
"One of the chall@@ eng@@ es is that the ri@@ ch@@ er we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more exp@@ en@@ sive it is to take care of our dis@@ eas@@ es as we get ol@@ der ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ su@@ s the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can basically see that the ri@@ ch@@ er a country is , the ol@@ der the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particul@@ arly dra@@ ma@@ tic challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a bro@@ ken an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ ma ."
"If the average age in your country is 4@@ 5 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at diab@@ et@@ es , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set diab@@ et@@ es , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , co@@ ron@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease — things that are in@@ her@@ ently more difficult to treat , and much more exp@@ en@@ sive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demo@@ graph@@ ics in the U.@@ S@@ . here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Un@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; I@@ n 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sic@@ k , pa@@ ying for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experien@@ cing deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"And this is mat@@ ched in every ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed , we@@ al@@ thy country in the world ."
How can you actually af@@ for@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ su@@ s cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 4@@ 5 , 40 to 4@@ 5 , there &apos;s a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ik@@ e in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individ@@ ual sp@@ end on your own health care , pl@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a sp@@ ik@@ e ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dis@@ eas@@ es and experience what I would call heal@@ thy ag@@ ing ."
"I &apos;d su@@ g@@ gest there are four things , and n@@ one of these things incl@@ u@@ de an in@@ sur@@ ance system or a le@@ ga@@ l system ."
All those things do is change who pa@@ ys .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tual cost of the treat@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too depres@@ sing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mo@@ ni@@ es should be put into pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of diagno@@ sing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the progres@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to c@@ ure the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sym@@ p@@ tom ."
"Th@@ ink of it in terms of diab@@ et@@ es , for inst@@ ance ."
"@@ To@@ day , with diab@@ et@@ es , what do we do ?"
"We diagno@@ se the disease even@@ tually , once it becom@@ es sym@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic , and then we treat the sym@@ p@@ tom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ sul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good ther@@ ap@@ y .
"But even@@ tually it st@@ op@@ s working , and diab@@ et@@ es lead@@ s to a predic@@ table on@@ set of deb@@ il@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y couldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to regener@@ ate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sym@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ?"
"And it might be a little bit exp@@ en@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would tr@@ ul@@ y be able to do something different ."
"This video , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
This is a ne@@ w@@ t re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a ne@@ w@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b regener@@ ation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in regener@@ ative medic@@ ine is doing this in every or@@ gan system of the body , for t@@ issu@@ es and for organs themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sic@@ k , the mes@@ sa@@ ge is we will treat your sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that to@@ mor@@ row — and when to@@ mor@@ row is we could deb@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ able future — we will talk about regener@@ ative re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic up here , si@@ mil@@ ar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 7@@ 0 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q that have lo@@ st lim@@ b@@ s .
"I@@ mag@@ ine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the regener@@ ation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a w@@ il@@ d con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s ap@@ plic@@ able , again , to every or@@ gan system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to devel@@ op a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body .
We need to learn to spe@@ ak the body &apos;s language .
And to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch on proc@@ ess@@ es that we knew how to do when we were a f@@ et@@ us .
"A ma@@ m@@ mal@@ ian f@@ et@@ us , if it lo@@ ses a lim@@ b d@@ uring the first tri@@ mes@@ ter of pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ N@@ A has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ oun@@ d@@ -@@ heal@@ ing me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lo@@ st as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lo@@ se their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p in an acc@@ id@@ ent , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to en@@ ga@@ ge in that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body , we need to spe@@ ak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that al@@ low us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ ver@@ se with the body .
The first is cel@@ l@@ ul@@ ar ther@@ ap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ pl@@ ant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , we can use mater@@ i@@ als ."
We heard y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about the import@@ ance of new mater@@ i@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent mater@@ i@@ als , des@@ ign mater@@ i@@ als , or ex@@ trac@@ t mater@@ i@@ als from a natural environ@@ ment , then we might be able to have those mater@@ i@@ als in@@ duc@@ e the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use s@@ mart dev@@ ices that will off@@ lo@@ ad the work of the body and al@@ low it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with mater@@ i@@ als ."
St@@ eve B@@ ad@@ y@@ la@@ k — who &apos;s at the Un@@ iver@@ sity of P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh — about a dec@@ ade ago had a re@@ mark@@ able idea .
"And that idea was that the small in@@ t@@ est@@ ine of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that al@@ lowed it to re@@ ma@@ in bi@@ olog@@ ically ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary fac@@ tors and sign@@ als that would sign@@ al the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that us@@ u@@ ally in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small in@@ t@@ est@@ ine , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a t@@ issu@@ e-@@ spec@@ if@@ ic respon@@ se , or would it make small in@@ t@@ est@@ ine if I tri@@ ed to make a new e@@ ar ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t comp@@ el@@ ling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a comp@@ el@@ ling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , for those of you that are even the s@@ ligh@@ test bit s@@ qu@@ e@@ am@@ ish — even though you may not like to ad@@ mit it in front of your friends — the ligh@@ ts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , ch@@ ec@@ k your B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the scre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to l@@ au@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diab@@ et@@ es .
"I think a lot of times we hear about diab@@ e@@ tics , diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t con@@ n@@ ect the ul@@ cer with the even@@ tual treat@@ ment , which is am@@ put@@ ation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sl@@ ide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer . It &apos;s tra@@ g@@ ic .
The treat@@ ment for this is am@@ put@@ ation .
"This is an ol@@ der l@@ ad@@ y . She has cancer of the li@@ ver as well as diab@@ et@@ es , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body in@@ t@@ act ."
"And this l@@ ad@@ y decided , after a year of at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted treat@@ ment of that ul@@ cer , that she would try this new ther@@ ap@@ y that St@@ eve inv@@ ented ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material con@@ ta@@ ined only natural sign@@ als .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more dis@@ t@@ res@@ sing sl@@ ides for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a hor@@ se . The hor@@ se is not in pa@@ in .
"If the hor@@ se was in pa@@ in , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sl@@ ide ."
The hor@@ se just has another no@@ st@@ ri@@ l that &apos;s develop@@ ed because of a r@@ id@@ ing acc@@ id@@ ent .
"@@ Just a few weeks after treat@@ ment — in this case , taking that material , turn@@ ing it into a g@@ el , and p@@ ac@@ king that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the treat@@ ment a few times — and the hor@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tra@@ sound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ att@@ ach@@ ed .
"There are now 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ oun@@ ds ."
C@@ ould you regener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave St@@ eve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ inst@@ it@@ u@@ tion pro@@ ject to be@@ gin the process of as@@ king that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million doll@@ ar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 ye@@ ar-@@ old man who &apos;s lo@@ st the end of his fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p .
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber that I men@@ tion@@ ed before the children who lo@@ se their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps .
A@@ f@@ ter treat@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is cl@@ in@@ ically rel@@ ev@@ ant today .
There are mater@@ i@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pat@@ ch@@ es .
But could you go a little fur@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a da@@ mag@@ ed piece of t@@ issue , put a bio@@ -@@ de@@ gra@@ da@@ ble material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart mus@@ cle be@@ ating in a dis@@ h .
This was done by Ter@@ u@@ o O@@ kan@@ o at To@@ k@@ y@@ o W@@ omen &apos;s H@@ o@@ sp@@ ital .
He can actually grow be@@ ating t@@ issue in a dis@@ h .
"He chil@@ ls the dis@@ h , it changes its pro@@ per@@ ties and he pe@@ els it right out of the dis@@ h ."
It &apos;s the co@@ ol@@ est stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cel@@ l-@@ bas@@ ed regener@@ ation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being re@@ mov@@ ed from the hi@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ ga@@ in , if you &apos;re s@@ qu@@ e@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to wat@@ ch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of co@@ ol .
"So this is a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s oper@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ ore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ y@@ pas@@ s oper@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mov@@ ed at the beginning of the proc@@ ed@@ ure being in@@ jec@@ ted direc@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"@@ Here go the stem cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really care@@ fully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a bac@@ k@@ -@@ fl@@ us@@ h ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sor@@ ts of new technology , new dev@@ ices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a ran@@ do@@ miz@@ ed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if you take an extre@@ m@@ ely sic@@ k pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , for these particular patients , they bec@@ ame as@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ."
These are now two years out .
"The co@@ ol@@ est thing would be is if you could diagno@@ se the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same proc@@ ed@@ ure , but now done min@@ im@@ ally inv@@ as@@ iv@@ ely , with only three hol@@ es in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply in@@ jec@@ ting stem cells through a l@@ ap@@ ar@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ic proc@@ ed@@ ure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those deta@@ ils , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less sic@@ k , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ to@@ ma@@ tic state through that kind of ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"@@ Here &apos;s another example of st@@ em@@ -@@ c@@ ell ther@@ ap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite cl@@ in@@ ical yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey Mar@@ ra from P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great s@@ our@@ ce of stem cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are p@@ ac@@ ked in that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your tum@@ my@@ -@@ t@@ uc@@ k ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , and in this case , the stem cells are is@@ ol@@ ated and turned into neurons ."
All done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ der@@ iv@@ ed , or a@@ di@@ pos@@ e-@@ der@@ iv@@ ed , stem cells ."
I tal@@ ked before about the use of dev@@ ices to dra@@ ma@@ tically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I clo@@ se up .
This is equ@@ ally tra@@ g@@ ic .
"We have a very ab@@ id@@ ing and he@@ art@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with our colle@@ ag@@ ues at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for S@@ ur@@ g@@ ical R@@ es@@ e@@ arch in the U@@ S A@@ r@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very s@@ ever@@ ely b@@ urn@@ ed .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding appro@@ ach .
"We make something over here , and then we trans@@ pl@@ ant it on@@ to the s@@ ite of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , we@@ ar@@ able bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been des@@ ign@@ ed — it should be tes@@ ted cl@@ in@@ ically later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by J@@ o@@ er@@ g G@@ er@@ l@@ ach in P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will la@@ y down in the w@@ ound bed .
The gu@@ n that you see there sp@@ ra@@ ys cells .
That &apos;s going to sp@@ ra@@ y cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will ser@@ ve to f@@ ert@@ il@@ ize the environ@@ ment , del@@ iv@@ er other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ e@@ fore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ posed to try the so@@ d@@ ding appro@@ ach ."
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very power@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the imag@@ es kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ bly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary .
A@@ l@@ most every field of science engine@@ ering and cl@@ in@@ ical prac@@ ti@@ ce is inv@@ ol@@ ved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of govern@@ ments , and a number of regi@@ ons , have reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Jap@@ an@@ ese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to inv@@ est first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ in@@ c@@ idence .
Jap@@ an is the ol@@ d@@ est country on e@@ arth in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re put@@ ting a lot of stra@@ te@@ g@@ ic inv@@ est@@ ment foc@@ used in this are@@ a .
"The Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just la@@ un@@ ched a national t@@ issu@@ e-@@ engine@@ ering center .
The first year b@@ ud@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
I@@ n the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different appro@@ ach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ ore to come and be in the real world as pres@@ id@@ ent ."
We &apos;ve had a different appro@@ ach .
And the appro@@ ach has basically been to just sort of fun@@ d things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no stra@@ te@@ g@@ ic inv@@ est@@ ment to bring all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and foc@@ us them in a care@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little che@@ a@@ p sh@@ ot , at the direc@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ m@@ ing man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ an@@ ti from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard went to vis@@ it with him and a number of his direc@@ tors of his inst@@ it@@ ute just a few months ago , to try and con@@ vin@@ ce him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and foc@@ us it , in a stra@@ te@@ g@@ ic way , to make sure we can ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the p@@ ace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very tes@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing , what the N@@ I@@ H direc@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vis@@ ion is larg@@ er than our app@@ et@@ ite . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to clo@@ se by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vis@@ ion , but together we can change his app@@ et@@ ite ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple requ@@ est .
"I &apos;d like all of you to p@@ ause for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched we@@ ak@@ l@@ ings , and take st@@ oc@@ k of your mis@@ er@@ able ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the ad@@ vic@@ e that St@@ . B@@ en@@ ed@@ ic@@ t gave his rather star@@ t@@ led fol@@ low@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the ad@@ vic@@ e that I decided to fol@@ low my@@ self when I turned 40 .
"@@ U@@ p until that moment , I had been that clas@@ si@@ c cor@@ po@@ rate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was dr@@ in@@ king too much , I was working too hard and I was ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ d@@ ress the th@@ or@@ n@@ y issue of work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
"So I ste@@ pped back from the work@@ force , and I sp@@ ent a year at home with my wi@@ fe and four young children ."
But all I learned about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance from that year was that I found it quite easy to bal@@ ance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very us@@ ef@@ ul sk@@ ill , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve sp@@ ent these seven years since st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with , stud@@ ying and writ@@ ing about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
And I have four observ@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an h@@ on@@ est deb@@ ate ."
But the tro@@ ub@@ le is so many people talk so much r@@ ub@@ b@@ ish about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance .
"A@@ ll the disc@@ us@@ sions about f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or d@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ days or pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity leave only ser@@ ve to mas@@ k the cor@@ e issue , which is that certain job and career cho@@ ices are fundam@@ ent@@ ally in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with being mean@@ ing@@ fully en@@ gag@@ ed on a da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day bas@@ is with a young family ."
Now the first step in sol@@ v@@ ing any problem is ac@@ knowl@@ ed@@ ging the reality of the sit@@ u@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there lead@@ ing lives of qu@@ iet , scre@@ am@@ ing des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at j@@ obs they h@@ ate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ pres@@ s people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my con@@ ten@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in j@@ e@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ shir@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the n@@ u@@ b of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observ@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tr@@ uth that govern@@ ments and cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions ar@@ en &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individ@@ ual@@ s to take control and respon@@ si@@ bility for the typ@@ e of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t des@@ ign your life , someone else will des@@ ign it for you , and you may just not like their idea of bal@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s particul@@ arly important — this isn &apos;t on the W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ide W@@ eb , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s particul@@ arly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the hands of a com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al cor@@ po@@ ration ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad compan@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all compan@@ ies .
Because com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al compan@@ ies are in@@ her@@ ently des@@ ign@@ ed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ N@@ A ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-@@ in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ed compan@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , put@@ ting chil@@ d@@ care fac@@ il@@ ities in the work@@ place is wonderful and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the blo@@ ody off@@ ice ."
We have to be respon@@ si@@ ble for s@@ etting and en@@ for@@ cing the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The third observ@@ ation is we have to be care@@ ful with the time fra@@ me that we cho@@ ose u@@ po@@ n which to j@@ ud@@ ge our bal@@ ance .
"B@@ e@@ fore I went back to work after my year at home , I sa@@ t down and I w@@ ro@@ te out a deta@@ il@@ ed , ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al bal@@ an@@ ced day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : w@@ ake up well re@@ st@@ ed after a good night &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ ave sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ ave bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast with my wi@@ fe and children .
H@@ ave sex again .
( Laughter ) D@@ r@@ ive the kids to school on the way to the off@@ ice .
Do three hours &apos; work .
P@@ la@@ y a s@@ port with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
M@@ e@@ et some mat@@ es in the p@@ u@@ b for an early even@@ ing dr@@ ink .
D@@ r@@ ive home for din@@ ner with my wi@@ fe and kids .
M@@ ed@@ it@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ ave sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ ave sex again .
G@@ o to bed .
( Applause ) How often do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be real@@ is@@ tic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ on@@ ga@@ te the time fra@@ me u@@ po@@ n which we j@@ ud@@ ge the bal@@ ance in our life , but we need to el@@ on@@ ga@@ te it without f@@ all@@ ing into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wi@@ fe has div@@ or@@ ced me , my health is fa@@ il@@ ing , I &apos;ve got no mat@@ es or interes@@ ts left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too shor@@ t ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h observ@@ ation : We need to appro@@ ach bal@@ ance in a bal@@ an@@ ced way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ig@@ el , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I real@@ ize that my life is completely out of bal@@ ance .
It &apos;s tot@@ ally domin@@ ated by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I com@@ m@@ ute two hours a day .
All of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fa@@ il@@ ed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life ap@@ art from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a g@@ ri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a g@@ y@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mo@@ c@@ k , but being a f@@ it 1@@ 0-@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day off@@ ice rat isn &apos;t more bal@@ an@@ ced ; it &apos;s more f@@ it . ( Laughter )"
"@@ L@@ ov@@ ely though physical ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intel@@ lec@@ tual side ; there &apos;s the emo@@ tional side ; there &apos;s the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual side ."
"And to be bal@@ an@@ ced , I believe we have to att@@ end to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 st@@ o@@ ma@@ ch c@@ run@@ ch@@ es ."
Now that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ lo@@ ody h@@ ell mate , I hav@@ en &apos;t got time to get f@@ it ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I tr@@ ul@@ y understand how that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
But an in@@ c@@ id@@ ent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
"M@@ y wi@@ fe , who is some@@ where in the audi@@ ence today , called me up at the off@@ ice and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ig@@ el , you need to pic@@ k our youn@@ gest son &quot; &quot; — H@@ ar@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that even@@ ing ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pic@@ ked H@@ ar@@ ry up at the school ga@@ t@@ es .
"We wal@@ ked down to the loc@@ al par@@ k , m@@ ess@@ ed around on the s@@ w@@ ings , pla@@ yed some sil@@ ly gam@@ es ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the loc@@ al c@@ af@@ e , and we shar@@ ed a p@@ iz@@ z@@ a for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man pa@@ j@@ amas ."
"I then read him a ch@@ ap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ a@@ h@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es and the G@@ i@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to bed , t@@ uc@@ ked him in , gave him a k@@ is@@ s on his for@@ e@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; G@@ o@@ od@@ night , mate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his bed@@ room ."
"As I was wal@@ king out of his bed@@ room , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done anything , h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ney W@@ or@@ ld or b@@ ou@@ ght him a P@@ la@@ y@@ st@@ ation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
B@@ e@@ ing more bal@@ an@@ ced doesn &apos;t mean dra@@ ma@@ tic u@@ ph@@ e@@ av@@ al in your life .
"W@@ ith the sm@@ all@@ est inv@@ est@@ ment in the right places , you can rad@@ ically trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ ition of success away from the mo@@ ron@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ is@@ tic not@@ ion that the person with the most money when he dies w@@ ins , to a more thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful and bal@@ an@@ ced defin@@ ition of what a life well liv@@ ed looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th sp@@ read@@ ing ."

I mov@@ ed to America 12 years ago with my wi@@ fe Ter@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s le@@ av@@ ing mil@@ lions of children be@@ h@@ ind .
It actually co@@ st@@ s an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us amount to mo@@ p up the da@@ mag@@ e from the dro@@ po@@ ut c@@ ris@@ is .
But the dro@@ po@@ ut c@@ ris@@ is is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ las@@ s si@@ z@@ es are sm@@ all@@ er than in many countries .
"The tro@@ ub@@ le is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion ."
"There are three princi@@ pl@@ es on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es , and they are cont@@ rad@@ ic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to lab@@ or and most students have to end@@ ure ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t they ?
What scho@@ ols are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very nar@@ row spec@@ tr@@ um of achi@@ ev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to arg@@ ue against science and mat@@ h .
"A real education has to give equ@@ al we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the hum@@ an@@ ities , to physical education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achi@@ ev@@ ement to put that particular ability out , or to s@@ ti@@ f@@ le it ."
Te@@ ach@@ ers are the lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od of the success of scho@@ ols .
"A@@ n old fri@@ end of mine — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ et@@ ing .
The ro@@ le of a teacher is to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate learning .
They should be diagno@@ s@@ tic . They should help .
"So in place of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to fol@@ low ro@@ ut@@ ine al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms rather than to exc@@ ite that power of imag@@ in@@ ation and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t list@@ en to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , what we have is a culture of stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ land .
M@@ any st@@ ates in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a head@@ w@@ ind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very stud@@ ent who dro@@ ps out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bio@@ graph@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very person@@ aliz@@ ed .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an organ@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the w@@ in@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y ."
S@@ even in@@ ch@@ es of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very shor@@ t peri@@ od .
The whole f@@ lo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y was car@@ p@@ et@@ ed in f@@ low@@ ers for a while .
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers know that .
"And if the mov@@ ement is st@@ rong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a revolu@@ tion ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people re@@ ach success and then fa@@ il ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that lead@@ s up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we s@@ it back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us success@@ ful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I worked hard , I p@@ u@@ shed my@@ self ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fig@@ ured , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just s@@ it back and rel@@ a@@ x . &quot; &quot; R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I always tri@@ ed to impro@@ ve and do good work ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped because I fig@@ ured , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to impro@@ ve any more . &quot; &quot; R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fig@@ ured I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sh@@ ot guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like mag@@ ic ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative bloc@@ k .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing success , I always foc@@ used on cli@@ ents and pro@@ jects , and ign@@ ored the money . Th@@ en all this money started po@@ uring in ."
And I got dis@@ trac@@ ted by it .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I was on the ph@@ one to my st@@ oc@@ k@@ bro@@ k@@ er and my real est@@ ate ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my cli@@ ents ."
"And re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always did what I lo@@ ved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ ag@@ ement . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ag@@ er , but I fig@@ ured I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pres@@ id@@ ent of the compan@@ y ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d form@@ ed over my head and here I was , ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ d@@ ly very success@@ ful , but in@@ war@@ d@@ ly very depres@@ sed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a f@@ ast c@@ ar .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fas@@ ter but just as depres@@ sed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depres@@ sed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy P@@ ro@@ z@@ ac . &quot; &quot; And he put me on an@@ ti@@ -@@ depres@@ san@@ ts ."
"And ye@@ ah , the black cl@@ ou@@ d f@@ ad@@ ed a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just f@@ lo@@ ating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if cli@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And cli@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer serv@@ ing them , I was only serv@@ ing my@@ self ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jects to others who would ser@@ ve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for business to dro@@ p like a roc@@ k ."
"M@@ y par@@ t@@ ner and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , there was nob@@ ody for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jects I lo@@ ved .
"I had fu@@ n again , I worked har@@ der and , to c@@ ut a long story shor@@ t , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a qu@@ ic@@ k tri@@ p .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , business gre@@ w big@@ ger than ever ."
"And when I went back to fol@@ lowing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed al@@ together ."
"And I wo@@ ke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need P@@ ro@@ z@@ ac any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and hav@@ en &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a contin@@ u@@ ous j@@ our@@ ney .
"And if we want to av@@ o@@ id &quot; &quot; success@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , &quot; &quot; we just keep fol@@ lowing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , because that is not only how we achi@@ eve success , it &apos;s how we su@@ st@@ ain it ."
So here is to your contin@@ u@@ ed success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as ad@@ ults , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
"There &apos;s still some con@@ f@@ us@@ ion about that question , as this is a fa@@ ir@@ ly new field of research ."
"For example , I was talking to one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues , R@@ ob@@ ert , who is an on@@ c@@ olog@@ ist , and he was telling me , &quot; &quot; S@@ and@@ r@@ ine , this is p@@ uz@@ z@@ ling ."
"S@@ ome of my patients that have been told they are cu@@ red of their cancer still devel@@ op sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms of depres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; And I respon@@ ded to him , &quot; &quot; Well , from my point of view that makes sense ."
"The dru@@ g you give to your patients that st@@ op@@ s the cancer cells mul@@ ti@@ pl@@ ying also st@@ op@@ s the ne@@ w@@ born neurons being gener@@ ated in their brain . &quot; &quot; And then R@@ ob@@ ert looked at me like I was crazy and said , &quot; &quot; But S@@ and@@ r@@ ine , these are ad@@ ult patients — ad@@ ults do not grow new ner@@ ve cells . &quot; &quot; And much to his sur@@ pr@@ ise , I said , &quot; &quot; Well actually , we do . &quot; &quot; And this is a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that we call neu@@ rogen@@ esis ."
"@@ &#91; N@@ e@@ u@@ rogen@@ esis &#93; Now R@@ ob@@ ert is not a neuro@@ scient@@ ist , and when he went to me@@ d@@ ical school he was not t@@ au@@ ght what we know now — that the ad@@ ult brain can gener@@ ate new ner@@ ve cells ."
"So R@@ ob@@ ert , you know , being the good doc@@ tor that he is , wanted to come to my la@@ b to understand the t@@ op@@ ic a little bit better ."
And I took him for a t@@ our of one of the most exc@@ iting parts of the brain when it comes to neu@@ rogen@@ esis — and this is the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us .
So this is this gra@@ y structure in the center of the brain .
"And what we &apos;ve known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , me@@ mor@@ y , mo@@ od and emo@@ tion ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , what we have learned more rec@@ ently is that this is one of the un@@ i@@ qu@@ e struc@@ tures of the ad@@ ult brain where new neurons can be gener@@ ated ."
"And if we sl@@ ice through the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us and zo@@ om in , what you actually see here in bl@@ ue is a ne@@ w@@ born neuro@@ n in an ad@@ ult mo@@ use brain ."
"So when it comes to the human brain — my colle@@ ag@@ ue J@@ on@@ as F@@ ris@@ é@@ n from the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ et , has es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed that we produc@@ e 7@@ 00 new neurons per day in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
"You might think this is not much , com@@ par@@ ed to the bil@@ lions of neurons we have ."
"But by the time we turn 50 , we will have all ex@@ changed the neurons we were born with in that structure with ad@@ ul@@ t-@@ born neurons ."
So why are these new neurons important and what are their func@@ tions ?
"F@@ ir@@ st , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and me@@ mor@@ y ."
"And this is es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally new and true for sp@@ ati@@ al reco@@ gn@@ ition — so like , how you nav@@ i@@ ga@@ te your way in the c@@ ity ."
And more interesting to my colle@@ ag@@ ue R@@ ob@@ ert is the research we have been doing on neu@@ rogen@@ esis and depres@@ sion .
"And if we give an@@ ti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts , then we increase the produc@@ tion of these ne@@ w@@ born neurons , and we de@@ cre@@ ase the sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms of depres@@ sion , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing a c@@ lear lin@@ k between neu@@ rogen@@ esis and depres@@ sion ."
"But mo@@ re@@ over , if you just bloc@@ k neu@@ rogen@@ esis , then you bloc@@ k the ef@@ fic@@ ac@@ y of the an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"So by then , R@@ ob@@ ert had underst@@ ood that very likely his patients were suf@@ fer@@ ing from depres@@ sion even after being cu@@ red of their cancer , because the cancer dru@@ g had st@@ op@@ ped ne@@ w@@ born neurons from being gener@@ ated ."
And it will take time to gener@@ ate new neurons that re@@ ach nor@@ mal func@@ tions .
"So , col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vely , now we think we have enough evidence to say that neu@@ rogen@@ esis is a t@@ arg@@ et of cho@@ ice if we want to impro@@ ve me@@ mor@@ y forma@@ tion or mo@@ od , or even pre@@ v@@ ent the de@@ cl@@ ine as@@ soci@@ ated with ag@@ ing , or as@@ soci@@ ated with stress ."
So the next question is : can we control neu@@ rogen@@ esis ?
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qu@@ i@@ z .
"I &apos;m going to give you a set of behav@@ i@@ ors and acti@@ vit@@ ies , and you tell me if you think they will increase neu@@ rogen@@ esis or if they will de@@ cre@@ ase neu@@ rogen@@ esis ."
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
Y@@ es .
L@@ ear@@ ning will increase the produc@@ tion of these new neurons .
How about stress ?
"Y@@ es , stress will de@@ cre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
How about s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation ?
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , it will de@@ cre@@ ase neu@@ rogen@@ esis ."
How about sex ?
"O@@ h , w@@ ow !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , you are right , it will increase the produc@@ tion of new neurons ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , it &apos;s all about bal@@ ance here ."
We don &apos;t want to f@@ all in a sit@@ u@@ ation — ( Laughter ) about too much sex lead@@ ing to s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation . ( Laughter )
How about getting ol@@ der ?
"So the neu@@ rogen@@ esis rate will de@@ cre@@ ase as we get ol@@ der , but it is still oc@@ curr@@ ing ."
"And then finally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you j@@ ud@@ ge that one by yourself .
And here you see a sec@@ tion of the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us of a mo@@ use that had no run@@ ning whe@@ el in its c@@ age .
And the little black d@@ ots you see are actually ne@@ w@@ born neu@@ ron@@ s@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ be .
"And now , you see a sec@@ tion of the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us of a mo@@ use that had a run@@ ning whe@@ el in its c@@ age ."
"So acti@@ vity im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts neu@@ rogen@@ esis , but that &apos;s not all ."
What you e@@ at will have an ef@@ fect on the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us .
So here we have a sam@@ ple of di@@ et — of n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents that have been sho@@ wn to have ef@@ fic@@ ac@@ y .
And I &apos;m just going to point a few out to you : C@@ al@@ ori@@ e re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion of 20 to 30 percent will increase neu@@ rogen@@ esis .
In@@ ter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent fas@@ ting — sp@@ ac@@ ing the time between your me@@ als — will increase neu@@ rogen@@ esis .
"I@@ n@@ take of fl@@ av@@ on@@ o@@ id@@ s , which are con@@ ta@@ ined in dark ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate or bl@@ u@@ eb@@ er@@ ri@@ es , will increase neu@@ rogen@@ esis ."
"O@@ me@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id@@ s , present in f@@ at@@ ty f@@ ish , like sal@@ mon , will increase the produc@@ tion of these new neurons ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ s@@ ely , a di@@ et r@@ ich in high sa@@ tu@@ ra@@ ted f@@ at will have a ne@@ ga@@ tive im@@ p@@ act on neu@@ rogen@@ esis ."
E@@ th@@ an@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l — will de@@ cre@@ ase neu@@ rogen@@ esis .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , not everything is lo@@ st ; res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , which is con@@ ta@@ ined in red w@@ ine , has been sho@@ wn to pro@@ mo@@ te the surviv@@ al of these new neurons ."
"So next time you are at a din@@ ner par@@ ty , you might want to re@@ ach for this possi@@ bly &quot; &quot; neu@@ rogen@@ es@@ is@@ -@@ ne@@ ut@@ ral &quot; &quot; dr@@ ink ."
"( Laughter ) And then finally , let me point out the last one — a qu@@ ir@@ k@@ y one ."
"So Jap@@ an@@ ese gro@@ ups are fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with food t@@ ext@@ ures , and they have sho@@ wn that actually sof@@ t di@@ et im@@ pa@@ ir@@ s neu@@ rogen@@ esis , as op@@ posed to food that requ@@ ir@@ es mas@@ tic@@ ation — che@@ wing — or c@@ run@@ ch@@ y food ."
"So all of this data , where we need to look at the cel@@ l@@ ul@@ ar level , has been gener@@ ated using an@@ ima@@ l mod@@ els ."
"But this di@@ et has also been given to human par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts , and what we could see is that the di@@ et mod@@ ul@@ ates me@@ mor@@ y and mo@@ od in the same direc@@ tion as it mod@@ ul@@ ates neu@@ rogen@@ esis , such as : cal@@ ori@@ e re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion will impro@@ ve me@@ mor@@ y cap@@ ac@@ ity , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as a high@@ -@@ f@@ at di@@ et will ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms of depres@@ sion — as op@@ posed to ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id@@ s , which increase neu@@ rogen@@ esis , and also help to de@@ cre@@ ase the sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms of depres@@ sion ."
"So we think that the ef@@ fect of di@@ et on mental health , on me@@ mor@@ y and mo@@ od , is actually medi@@ ated by the produc@@ tion of the new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
"O@@ n our side — neuro@@ scient@@ ists interes@@ ted in neu@@ rogen@@ esis — we need to understand better the func@@ tion of these new neurons , and how we can control their surviv@@ al and their produc@@ tion ."
We also need to find a way to pro@@ t@@ ect the neu@@ rogen@@ esis of R@@ ob@@ ert &apos;s patients .
And on your side — I leave you in ch@@ arg@@ e of your neu@@ rogen@@ esis .
Thank you .

( Applause )
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pl@@ an , but in order for me to tell you what that pl@@ an is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of s@@ ets the stage ."
"I tri@@ ed to look at where did the kind of learning we do in scho@@ ols , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the big@@ gest of the em@@ pir@@ es on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Brit@@ ish E@@ m@@ pir@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ mag@@ ine trying to run the show , trying to run the enti@@ re planet , without comput@@ ers , without tel@@ e@@ ph@@ ones , with data h@@ and@@ writ@@ ten on pi@@ ec@@ es of p@@ aper , and tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was amazing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive machine .
"In order to have that machine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produc@@ e those people : the school .
The scho@@ ols would produc@@ e the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ re@@ auc@@ ra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tive machine .
They must be id@@ en@@ tical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good h@@ and@@ writ@@ ing , because the data is h@@ and@@ writ@@ ten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do mul@@ ti@@ plic@@ ation , div@@ ision , ad@@ d@@ ition and sub@@ trac@@ tion in their head ."
They must be so id@@ en@@ tical that you could pic@@ k one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ada and he would be in@@ stan@@ tly func@@ tional .
The V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ er@@ ed a system that was so rob@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , contin@@ u@@ ously produc@@ ing id@@ en@@ tical people for a machine that no longer ex@@ ists ."
"The em@@ pir@@ e is gone , so what are we doing with that des@@ ign that produc@@ es these id@@ en@@ tical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty st@@ rong com@@ ment there .
"I said scho@@ ols as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s quite f@@ ash@@ ion@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s not bro@@ ken . It &apos;s wonder@@ fully con@@ struc@@ ted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s ou@@ t@@ da@@ ted .
What are the kind of j@@ obs that we have today ?
"Well , the cl@@ er@@ ks are the comput@@ ers ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every off@@ ice .
And you have people who gu@@ ide those comput@@ ers to do their cl@@ er@@ ical j@@ obs .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to write beauti@@ fully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to mul@@ ti@@ p@@ ly numbers in their head@@ s .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read disc@@ er@@ n@@ ing@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ obs of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in wh@@ at@@ ever way they want ."
How is pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ p@@ are them for that world ?
"Well , I b@@ um@@ ped into this whole thing completely by acc@@ id@@ ent ."
"I used to te@@ ach people how to write computer program@@ s in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , 1@@ 4 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a sl@@ um ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer program@@ s ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of parents , r@@ ich people , who had comput@@ ers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with comput@@ ers ."
"And my dau@@ ghter — oh , sur@@ ely she is ex@@ tra@@ -@@ intelli@@ gent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly fig@@ ured that , how come all the r@@ ich people are having these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the po@@ or do wrong ?
"I made a hole in the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y w@@ all of the sl@@ um next to my off@@ ice , and st@@ uc@@ k a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the In@@ tern@@ et was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an we tou@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you w@@ ish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight hours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s im@@ possible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; My colle@@ ag@@ ues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solu@@ tion ."
"One of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , sho@@ wed them how to use the mo@@ use . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 mil@@ es out of D@@ el@@ h@@ i into a really re@@ mo@@ te village where the chan@@ ces of a pas@@ sing sof@@ tw@@ are develop@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to st@@ ay , so I st@@ uc@@ k my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids pla@@ ying gam@@ es on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fas@@ ter proc@@ ess@@ or and a better mo@@ use . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ rit@@ ated vo@@ ice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to te@@ ach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; te@@ ach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so cas@@ u@@ ally ."
Here &apos;s a shor@@ t g@@ lim@@ p@@ se from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the H@@ ole in the W@@ all .
O@@ n your right is an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old .
To his left is his stud@@ ent . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teach@@ ing her how to bro@@ w@@ se .
"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all fil@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; A@@ n e@@ igh@@ t-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old telling his el@@ der sis@@ ter what to do .
"And finally a gir@@ l expla@@ ining in M@@ ara@@ th@@ i what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a proc@@ ess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publi@@ sh@@ ing ."
"I published every@@ where . I w@@ ro@@ te down and meas@@ ured everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left al@@ one with a computer in any language will re@@ ach the same stan@@ dar@@ d as an off@@ ice sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cur@@ ious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experim@@ ent@@ ing with other sub@@ jects , amo@@ n@@ g them , for example , pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one commun@@ ity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose English pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would impro@@ ve their j@@ obs ."
"I gave them a spe@@ e@@ ch@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ t@@ ex@@ t eng@@ ine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it typ@@ es what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and wat@@ ch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ put@@ er : N@@ ice to me@@ et y@@ ou@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ d : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
Su@@ ga@@ ta M@@ it@@ ra : The reason I en@@ ded with the face of this young l@@ ad@@ y over there is because I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call center in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have t@@ or@@ tu@@ red you about your cre@@ dit c@@ ard bil@@ ls in a very c@@ lear English ac@@ cent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Wh@@ ere does it stop ?
I decided I would des@@ tro@@ y my own argum@@ ent by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ position .
"I made a hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis , a r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis ."
"@@ T@@ ami@@ l is a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ dian language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ speak@@ ing children in a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ dian village learn the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ nolo@@ gy of D@@ N@@ A re@@ plic@@ ation in English from a stre@@ ets@@ ide computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a z@@ ero ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another z@@ ero ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all comput@@ ers there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed all kinds of stuff from the In@@ tern@@ et about D@@ N@@ A re@@ plic@@ ation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came r@@ ush@@ ing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very t@@ op@@ ical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and diag@@ ram@@ s and chem@@ is@@ try ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had develop@@ ed a new pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ ical me@@ th@@ od , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I hav@@ en &apos;t the fo@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a z@@ ero . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve underst@@ ood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I exp@@ ect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We hav@@ en &apos;t given up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these scre@@ ens and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little gir@@ l who you see just now , she ra@@ ised her hand , and she says to me in bro@@ ken T@@ ami@@ l and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , ap@@ art from the fact that impro@@ per re@@ plic@@ ation of the D@@ N@@ A mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e ca@@ uses disease , we hav@@ en &apos;t underst@@ ood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tes@@ ted them ."
"I got an educ@@ ational im@@ possi@@ bility , z@@ ero to 30 percent in two months in the tro@@ p@@ ical he@@ at with a computer under the t@@ ree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a dec@@ ade a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the V@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ ian nor@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fa@@ il .
How do I get them to pas@@ s ? I have to get them 20 more mar@@ ks .
"I couldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old gir@@ l who was an ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ant and she pla@@ yed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this gir@@ l , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that t@@ ree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ th@@ od of the grand@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; St@@ and be@@ h@@ ind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , w@@ ow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next p@@ age ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what gr@@ an@@ ni@@ es do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The sc@@ or@@ es j@@ um@@ ped to 50 percent .
"@@ K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am had c@@ au@@ ght up with my control school in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , a r@@ ich p@@ riv@@ ate school with a tra@@ ined bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ nolo@@ gy teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that gra@@ p@@ h I knew there is a way to level the pla@@ ying field .
Here &apos;s K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am .
( Ch@@ il@@ dren speak@@ ing ) N@@ e@@ u@@ rons ... commun@@ ic@@ ation .
"I got the c@@ amer@@ a an@@ gle wrong . That one is just ama@@ te@@ ur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons commun@@ ic@@ ate ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ obs going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children po@@ uring over with their mo@@ bil@@ e ph@@ ones on the one hand and then rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ tly going to school to pic@@ k up their bo@@ o@@ ks with their other hand ."
What will it be to@@ mor@@ row ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating question , a question that was f@@ ram@@ ed for me by N@@ ich@@ ol@@ as N@@ e@@ gro@@ pon@@ te — could it be that we are head@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are h@@ om@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens .
"@@ K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ap@@ e st@@ and up and become H@@ om@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
What an achi@@ ev@@ ement that is .
But we have to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te that into our own future .
En@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement seems to be the k@@ ey .
"If you look at K@@ up@@ p@@ am , if you look at all of the experim@@ ents that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; sal@@ ut@@ ing learning ."
There is evidence from neuro@@ science .
"The re@@ p@@ t@@ il@@ ian part of our brain , which s@@ its in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ ut@@ s down everything else , it sh@@ ut@@ s down the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ ut@@ s all of that down ."
P@@ un@@ ish@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ at@@ s .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pir@@ es when you needed those people who can surv@@ ive under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re st@@ anding in a tr@@ en@@ ch all al@@ one , if you could have surviv@@ ed , you &apos;re o@@ kay , you &apos;ve pas@@ sed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fa@@ il@@ ed ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pir@@ es is gone .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that bal@@ ance back from thre@@ at to pl@@ eas@@ ure .
I came back to Engl@@ and looking for Brit@@ ish grand@@ mo@@ thers .
"I put out not@@ ices in p@@ ap@@ ers saying , if you are a Brit@@ ish grand@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a w@@ eb c@@ amer@@ a , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per week for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more Brit@@ ish grand@@ mo@@ thers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d s@@ its on the In@@ tern@@ et .
"If there &apos;s a child in tro@@ ub@@ le , we be@@ am a G@@ ra@@ n ."
She goes on over S@@ k@@ yp@@ e and she sor@@ ts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called D@@ ig@@ gl@@ es in nor@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ tern Engl@@ and , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ ami@@ l N@@ ad@@ u , India , 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es away ."
She does it with only one ag@@ e-@@ old ges@@ ture .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ at@@ ch this .
G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . You say it . You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
Ch@@ il@@ dren : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ bre@@ ad M@@ an@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ bre@@ ad M@@ an . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : Well done ! V@@ er@@ y good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the produc@@ t of educ@@ ational self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"If you al@@ low the educ@@ ational process to self-@@ organ@@ ize , then learning em@@ er@@ g@@ es ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about l@@ etting it happen .
The teacher s@@ ets the process in mo@@ tion and then she stan@@ ds back in a@@ we and wat@@ ch@@ es as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is poin@@ ting at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I in@@ t@@ end to build these S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ gan@@ ized L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are basically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , col@@ labo@@ ration and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement put together ."
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed this in many , many scho@@ ols ."
"It &apos;s been tri@@ ed all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ il@@ dren talking ) This one is in Engl@@ and .
"He main@@ ta@@ ins la@@ w and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
G@@ ir@@ l : The tot@@ al number of elec@@ t@@ rons is not equ@@ al to the tot@@ al number of pro@@ t@@ ons — S@@ M : A@@ ust@@ ral@@ ia G@@ ir@@ l : — giving it a n@@ et pos@@ itive or ne@@ ga@@ tive elec@@ tr@@ ical ch@@ arg@@ e .
The n@@ et ch@@ arg@@ e on an ion is equ@@ al to the number of pro@@ t@@ ons in the ion min@@ us the number of elec@@ t@@ rons .
S@@ M : A dec@@ ade a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when St@@ one A@@ ge men and women used to s@@ it and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing ligh@@ ts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um , but we &apos;ve lo@@ st sight of those won@@ dro@@ us questions ."
We &apos;ve b@@ rou@@ ght it down to the tan@@ gent of an an@@ gle .
But that &apos;s not s@@ ex@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a me@@ te@@ or@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a mag@@ ic word . It &apos;s called the tan@@ gent of an an@@ gle , &quot; &quot; and leave him al@@ one . He &apos;ll figure it out ."
So here are a couple of imag@@ es from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed incredi@@ ble , incredi@@ ble questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world be@@ gin ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we bre@@ a@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ is@@ es the question , and then stan@@ ds back and ad@@ mir@@ es the answer ."
So what &apos;s my w@@ ish ?
My w@@ ish is that we des@@ ign the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be sp@@ are parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to des@@ ign a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — han@@ g on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
My w@@ ish is to help des@@ ign a future of learning by sup@@ port@@ ing children all over the world to ta@@ p into their won@@ der and their ability to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these intel@@ lec@@ tual adv@@ ent@@ ures driv@@ en by the big questions which their medi@@ at@@ ors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ il@@ ity where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ il@@ ity which is prac@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one gr@@ an@@ n@@ y who man@@ ages health and saf@@ ety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The ligh@@ ts are turned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ pose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ gan@@ ized L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in cl@@ ub@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great doc@@ um@@ ent produc@@ ed by TE@@ D which tel@@ ls you how to do it .
"If you would pl@@ ease , pl@@ ease do it across all five contin@@ ents and sen@@ d me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the S@@ cho@@ ol of C@@ l@@ ou@@ ds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my w@@ ish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as .
"A@@ t 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et , where the air is th@@ in , I once built two H@@ ole in the W@@ all comput@@ ers , and the children f@@ loc@@ ked there ."
And there was this little gir@@ l who was fol@@ lowing me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly ."
"She su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ra@@ ised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; G@@ et on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good ad@@ vic@@ e .
I &apos;ll fol@@ low her ad@@ vic@@ e . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . W@@ ow . ( Applause )
I want to talk to you about something kind of big .
We &apos;ll start here .
6@@ 5 million years ago the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs had a bad day .
"( Laughter ) A ch@@ un@@ k of roc@@ k six mil@@ es across , mov@@ ing something like 50 times the spe@@ ed of a ri@@ f@@ le b@@ ul@@ let , sl@@ am@@ m@@ ed into the Earth ."
"It rel@@ eas@@ ed its energy all at once , and it was an explo@@ sion that was min@@ d@@ -@@ num@@ b@@ ing ."
"If you took every n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ apo@@ n ever built at the he@@ ight of the C@@ old W@@ ar , l@@ um@@ ped them together and b@@ le@@ w them up at the same time , that would be one on@@ e-@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ th of the energy rel@@ eas@@ ed at that moment ."
The din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs had a really bad day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now , a si@@ x@@ -@@ mil@@ e-@@ w@@ ide roc@@ k is very large ."
We all live here in B@@ ou@@ l@@ der .
"If you look out your w@@ ind@@ ow and you can see L@@ ong &apos;s P@@ e@@ ak , you &apos;re probably famil@@ i@@ ar with it ."
"Now , s@@ co@@ op up L@@ ong &apos;s P@@ e@@ ak , and put it out in space ."
"@@ T@@ ake M@@ e@@ ek@@ er , M@@ t . M@@ e@@ ek@@ er . L@@ um@@ p that in there , and put that in space as well , and M@@ t . E@@ ver@@ est , and K@@ 2 , and the In@@ dian pe@@ ak@@ s ."
"Th@@ en you &apos;re starting to get an idea of how much roc@@ k we &apos;re talking about , o@@ kay ?"
We know it was that big because of the im@@ p@@ act it had and the cra@@ ter it left .
"It h@@ it in what we now know as Y@@ uc@@ at@@ an , the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o ."
"You can see here , there &apos;s the Y@@ uc@@ at@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ sul@@ a , if you reco@@ gni@@ ze C@@ o@@ z@@ u@@ me@@ l off the e@@ ast co@@ ast there ."
Here is how big of a cra@@ ter was left .
"It was huge . To give you a sense of the sc@@ ale , o@@ kay , there you go . The sc@@ ale here is 50 mil@@ es on top , a hundred kilo@@ me@@ ters on the bot@@ tom . This thing was 3@@ 00 kilo@@ me@@ ters across — 200 mil@@ es — an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us cra@@ ter that exc@@ av@@ ated out v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of e@@ arth that s@@ pla@@ shed around the glob@@ e and set fir@@ es all over the planet , thre@@ w up enough d@@ ust to bloc@@ k out the su@@ n ."
It wi@@ ped out 7@@ 5 percent of all spec@@ ies on Earth .
"Now , not all as@@ ter@@ o@@ id@@ s are that big ."
S@@ ome of them are sm@@ all@@ er .
Here is one that came in over the United States in O@@ c@@ t@@ ob@@ er of 19@@ 9@@ 2 .
It came in on a F@@ ri@@ day night .
Why is that important ?
"Because back then , video c@@ amer@@ as were just starting to become popul@@ ar , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all gam@@ es to fil@@ m their kids play fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all . And since this came in on a F@@ ri@@ day , they were able to get this great fo@@ ot@@ age of this thing bre@@ ak@@ ing up as it came in over W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ ina , Mar@@ y@@ land , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania and New J@@ er@@ se@@ y until it did that to a c@@ ar in New Y@@ or@@ k ."
"( Laughter ) Now , this is not a 20@@ 0-@@ mil@@ e-@@ w@@ ide cra@@ ter , but then again you can see the roc@@ k which is sit@@ ting right here , about the size of a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , that h@@ it that c@@ ar and did that da@@ mag@@ e ."
Now this thing was probably about the size of a school b@@ us when it first came in .
"It bro@@ ke up through at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic pres@@ sure , it c@@ r@@ um@@ bl@@ ed , and then the pi@@ ec@@ es f@@ ell ap@@ art and did some da@@ mag@@ e ."
"Now , you wouldn &apos;t want that f@@ all@@ ing on your fo@@ ot or your head , because it would do that to it ."
That would be bad .
"But it won &apos;t wi@@ p@@ e out , you know , all life on Earth , so that &apos;s fin@@ e . But it turns out , you don &apos;t need something six mil@@ es across to do a lot of da@@ mag@@ e ."
"There is a me@@ dian point between tiny roc@@ k and gi@@ gan@@ tic roc@@ k , and in fact , if any of you have ever been to ne@@ ar W@@ in@@ s@@ low , A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a , there is a cra@@ ter in the des@@ ert there that is so ic@@ on@@ ic that it is actually called M@@ et@@ e@@ or C@@ ra@@ ter ."
"@@ To give you a sense of sc@@ ale , this is about a mil@@ e w@@ ide ."
"If you look up at the top , that &apos;s a par@@ king lot , and those are re@@ cre@@ ational ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les right there ."
"So it &apos;s about a mil@@ e across , 6@@ 00 fe@@ et de@@ ep ."
"The object that form@@ ed this was probably about 30 to 50 yar@@ ds across , so rou@@ gh@@ ly the size of M@@ ac@@ k@@ ey A@@ ud@@ it@@ ori@@ um here ."
"It came in at spe@@ ed@@ s that were tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous , sl@@ am@@ m@@ ed into the ground , b@@ le@@ w up , and explo@@ ded with the energy of rou@@ gh@@ ly a 20@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ ton n@@ uc@@ lear bom@@ b — a very he@@ f@@ ty bom@@ b ."
"This was 5@@ 0,000 years ago , so it may have wi@@ ped out a few b@@ uf@@ f@@ al@@ o or an@@ tel@@ ope , or something like that out in the des@@ ert , but it probably would not have ca@@ used global dev@@ as@@ t@@ ation ."
It turns out that these things don &apos;t have to h@@ it the ground to do a lot of da@@ mag@@ e .
"Now , in 19@@ 0@@ 8 , over S@@ ib@@ eria , ne@@ ar the T@@ un@@ g@@ us@@ k@@ a regi@@ on — for those of you who are D@@ an A@@ y@@ k@@ ro@@ y@@ d f@@ ans and saw &quot; &quot; G@@ ho@@ st@@ bu@@ st@@ ers , &quot; &quot; when he tal@@ ked about the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al ri@@ ft since the S@@ ib@@ eria bl@@ ast of 19@@ 0@@ 9 , where he got the da@@ te wrong , but that &apos;s o@@ kay . ( Laughter ) It was 19@@ 0@@ 8 . That &apos;s fin@@ e . I can live with that . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ no@@ ther roc@@ k came into the Earth &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here and this one b@@ le@@ w up ab@@ ove the ground , s@@ ever@@ al mil@@ es up ab@@ ove the sur@@ face of the Earth ."
"The he@@ at from the explo@@ sion set fir@@ e to the for@@ est bel@@ ow it , and then the sh@@ oc@@ k w@@ ave came down and kno@@ c@@ ked down tre@@ es for hund@@ re@@ ds of s@@ qu@@ are mil@@ es , o@@ kay ?"
This did a huge amount of da@@ mag@@ e .
"And again , this was a roc@@ k probably rou@@ gh@@ ly the size of this au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um that we &apos;re sit@@ ting in ."
"In M@@ et@@ e@@ or C@@ ra@@ ter it was made of met@@ al , and met@@ al is much tou@@ gh@@ er , so it made it to the ground ."
"The one over T@@ un@@ g@@ us@@ k@@ a was probably made of roc@@ k , and that &apos;s much more c@@ r@@ um@@ bly , so it b@@ le@@ w up in the air . E@@ i@@ ther way , these are tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous explo@@ sions , 20 me@@ ga@@ t@@ ons ."
"Now , when these things b@@ low up , they &apos;re not going to do global ec@@ ological da@@ mag@@ e ."
They &apos;re not going to do something like the din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur@@ -@@ k@@ ill@@ er did .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
"But they will do global economic da@@ mag@@ e , because they don &apos;t have to h@@ it , nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , to do this kind of da@@ mag@@ e ."
They don &apos;t have to do global dev@@ as@@ t@@ ation .
"If one of these things were to h@@ it pretty much any@@ where , it would cause a pan@@ ic ."
"But if it came over a c@@ ity , an important c@@ ity — not that any c@@ ity is more important than others , but some of them we de@@ p@@ end on them more on the global economic bas@@ is — that could do a huge amount of da@@ mag@@ e to us as a civiliz@@ ation ."
"So , now that I &apos;ve sc@@ ar@@ ed the cra@@ p out of you ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) what can we do about this ? All right ?
This is a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al thre@@ at .
Let me not@@ e that we have not had a gi@@ ant im@@ p@@ act like the din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur@@ -@@ k@@ ill@@ er for 6@@ 5 million years . They &apos;re very r@@ are .
"The sm@@ all@@ er ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a mil@@ l@@ en@@ ni@@ um , every few cent@@ ur@@ ies or every few thou@@ s@@ and years , but it &apos;s still something to be aw@@ are of ."
"Well , what do we do about them ?"
The first thing we have to do is find them .
This is an imag@@ e of an as@@ ter@@ o@@ id that pas@@ sed us in 200@@ 9 .
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely fa@@ in@@ t .
I don &apos;t even know if you can see that in the back row . These are just stars .
"This is a roc@@ k that was about 30 yar@@ ds across , so rou@@ gh@@ ly the size of the ones that b@@ le@@ w up over T@@ un@@ g@@ us@@ k@@ a and h@@ it A@@ ri@@ zon@@ a 5@@ 0,000 years ago ."
These things are fa@@ in@@ t .
"They &apos;re hard to see , and the sk@@ y is really big ."
We have to find these things first .
"Well the good news is , we &apos;re looking for them ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has dev@@ ot@@ ed money to this .
"The N@@ ational S@@ ci@@ ence F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , other countries are very interes@@ ted in doing this ."
"We &apos;re building tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es that are looking for the thre@@ at . That &apos;s a great first step , but what &apos;s the second step ? The second step is that we see one head@@ ing to@@ ward us , we have to stop it . What do we do ?"
"You &apos;ve probably heard about the as@@ ter@@ o@@ id A@@ po@@ ph@@ is . If you hav@@ en &apos;t yet , you will ."
"If you &apos;ve heard about the M@@ ay@@ an 20@@ 12 apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se , you &apos;re going to hear about A@@ po@@ ph@@ is , because you &apos;re k@@ ey@@ ed in to all the do@@ om@@ s@@ day n@@ et@@ works any@@ way ."
A@@ po@@ ph@@ is is an as@@ ter@@ o@@ id that was discover@@ ed in 200@@ 4 .
"It &apos;s rou@@ gh@@ ly 2@@ 50 yar@@ ds across , so it &apos;s pretty big — big size , you know , big@@ ger than a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all st@@ a@@ di@@ um — and it &apos;s going to pas@@ s by the Earth in Ap@@ ri@@ l of 20@@ 2@@ 9 ."
And it &apos;s going to pas@@ s us so clo@@ se that it &apos;s actually going to come under@@ ne@@ ath our we@@ a@@ ther sa@@ tel@@ lit@@ es .
"The Earth &apos;s grav@@ ity is going to b@@ end the or@@ bit of this thing so much that if it &apos;s just right , if it pas@@ ses through this regi@@ on of space , this kid@@ ney be@@ an@@ -@@ shap@@ ed regi@@ on called the k@@ ey@@ hole , the Earth &apos;s grav@@ ity will b@@ end it just enough that seven years later on Ap@@ ri@@ l 1@@ 3 , which is a F@@ ri@@ day , I &apos;ll not@@ e , in the year 20@@ 3@@ 6 ... ( Laughter ) — you can &apos;t pl@@ an that kind of stuff — A@@ po@@ ph@@ is is going to h@@ it us . And it &apos;s 2@@ 50 me@@ ters across , so it would do un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able da@@ mag@@ e ."
"Now the good news is that the od@@ ds of it actually pas@@ sing through this k@@ ey@@ hole and h@@ it@@ ting us next go@@ -@@ around are one in a million , rou@@ gh@@ ly — very , very low od@@ ds , so I person@@ ally am not l@@ ying aw@@ ake at night wor@@ r@@ ying about this at all ."
I don &apos;t think A@@ po@@ ph@@ is is a problem .
"In fact , A@@ po@@ ph@@ is is a bl@@ ess@@ ing in dis@@ gu@@ ise , because it wo@@ ke us up to the dan@@ g@@ ers of these things ."
This thing was discover@@ ed just a few years ago and could h@@ it us a few years from now .
"It won &apos;t , but it giv@@ es us a chan@@ ce to study these kinds of as@@ ter@@ o@@ id@@ s . We didn &apos;t really nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily understand these k@@ ey@@ hol@@ es , and now we do and it turns out that &apos;s really important , because how do you stop an as@@ ter@@ o@@ id like this ?"
"Well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re st@@ anding in the middle of the ro@@ ad and a c@@ ar &apos;s head@@ ed for you ? What do you do ? You do this ."
R@@ ight ? M@@ ove . The c@@ ar goes past you .
"But we can &apos;t move the Earth , at le@@ ast not eas@@ ily , but we can move a small as@@ ter@@ o@@ id ."
"And it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it ."
"In the year 200@@ 5 , N@@ A@@ S@@ A la@@ un@@ ched a pro@@ be called D@@ e@@ ep I@@ m@@ p@@ act , which sl@@ am@@ m@@ ed into — sl@@ am@@ m@@ ed a piece of itself into the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us of a co@@ me@@ t ."
C@@ ome@@ ts are very much like as@@ ter@@ o@@ id@@ s .
The pur@@ pose wasn &apos;t to p@@ us@@ h it out of the way .
"The pur@@ pose was to make a cra@@ ter to exc@@ av@@ ate the material and see what was under@@ ne@@ ath the sur@@ face of this co@@ me@@ t , which we learned quite a bit about ."
"We did move the co@@ me@@ t a little tiny bit , not very much , but that wasn &apos;t the point ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , think about this ."
"This thing is or@@ b@@ iting the su@@ n at 10 mil@@ es per second , 20 mil@@ es per second ."
We sh@@ ot a space pro@@ be at it and h@@ it it . O@@ kay ?
"I@@ mag@@ ine how hard that must be , and we did it ."
That means we can do it again .
"If we need , if we see an as@@ ter@@ o@@ id that &apos;s coming to@@ ward us , and it &apos;s head@@ ed right for us , and we have two years to go , bo@@ om ! We h@@ it it ."
"You can try to — you know , if you wat@@ ch the movi@@ es , you might think about , why don &apos;t we use a n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ apo@@ n ?"
"It &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is tim@@ ing ."
"You sho@@ ot a n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ apo@@ n at this thing , you have to b@@ low it up within a few mil@@ l@@ is@@ econ@@ ds of t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance or else you &apos;ll just mis@@ s it ."
And there are a lot of other problems with that . It &apos;s very hard to do .
But just h@@ it@@ ting something ? That &apos;s pretty easy .
"I think even N@@ A@@ S@@ A can do that , and they pro@@ ved that they can . ( Laughter ) The problem is , what happens if you h@@ it this as@@ ter@@ o@@ id , you &apos;ve changed the or@@ bit , you measure the or@@ bit and then you find out , oh , ye@@ ah , we just p@@ u@@ shed it into a k@@ ey@@ hole , and now it &apos;s going to h@@ it us in three years ."
"Well , my op@@ in@@ ion is , fin@@ e . O@@ kay ?"
It &apos;s not h@@ it@@ ting us in six months . That &apos;s good .
Now we have three years to do something else .
"And you can h@@ it it again . That &apos;s kind of h@@ am@@ -@@ f@@ is@@ ted . You might just p@@ us@@ h it into a third k@@ ey@@ hole or wh@@ at@@ ever , so you don &apos;t do that ."
"And this is the part , it &apos;s the part I just love ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ f@@ ter the big mach@@ o &quot; &quot; R@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r B@@ A@@ M ! We &apos;re gon@@ na h@@ it this thing in the face , &quot; &quot; then we bring in the vel@@ v@@ et g@@ lo@@ ves . ( Laughter )"
"There &apos;s a group of scient@@ ists and engine@@ ers and astro@@ na@@ ut@@ s and they call themselves The B@@ 6@@ 12 F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion . F@@ or those of you who &apos;ve read &quot; &quot; The L@@ it@@ tle P@@ r@@ in@@ ce , &quot; &quot; you understand that re@@ fer@@ ence , I hope .

"Th@@ ese are s@@ mart gu@@ ys — men and women — astro@@ na@@ ut@@ s , like I said , engine@@ ers ."
"R@@ ust@@ y S@@ ch@@ we@@ ic@@ k@@ art , who was an A@@ pol@@ lo 9 astro@@ na@@ ut , is on this .

But then what we do is we la@@ un@@ ch a pro@@ be that has to we@@ igh a ton or two ."
"It doesn &apos;t have to be huge — couple of t@@ ons , not that big — and you par@@ k it ne@@ ar the as@@ ter@@ o@@ id ."
"You don &apos;t land on it , because these things are tum@@ bl@@ ing end over end . It &apos;s very hard to land on them ."
In@@ ste@@ ad you get ne@@ ar it .
"The grav@@ ity of the as@@ ter@@ o@@ id pul@@ ls on the pro@@ be , and the pro@@ be has a couple of t@@ ons of mass ."
"It has a little tiny bit of grav@@ ity , but it &apos;s enough that it can pul@@ l the as@@ ter@@ o@@ id , and you have your roc@@ ket@@ s set up , so you can — oh , you can bar@@ ely see it here , but there &apos;s roc@@ k@@ et pl@@ um@@ es — and you basically , these gu@@ ys are connec@@ ted by their own grav@@ ity , and if you move the pro@@ be very s@@ low@@ ly , very , very gen@@ tly , you can very eas@@ ily fin@@ es@@ se that roc@@ k into a sa@@ fe or@@ bit ."
"You can even put in or@@ bit around the Earth where we could mine it , al@@ though that &apos;s a whole other thing . I won &apos;t go into that ."
( Laughter ) But we &apos;d be r@@ ich ! ( Laughter )
"So think about this , right ?"
"There are these gi@@ ant roc@@ ks fl@@ ying out there , and they &apos;re h@@ it@@ ting us , and they &apos;re doing da@@ mag@@ e to us , but we &apos;ve fig@@ ured out how to do this , and all the pi@@ ec@@ es are in place to do this ."
"We have astro@@ nom@@ ers in place with tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es looking for them . We have s@@ mart people , very , very s@@ mart people , who are con@@ cer@@ ned about this and fig@@ uring out how to fi@@ x the problem , and we have the technology to do this ."
This pro@@ be actually can &apos;t use chem@@ ical roc@@ ket@@ s .
"@@ Ch@@ em@@ ical roc@@ ket@@ s pro@@ v@@ ide too much th@@ r@@ ust , too much p@@ us@@ h . The pro@@ be would just sho@@ ot away ."
"We inv@@ ented something called an ion dr@@ ive , which is a very , very , very low@@ -@@ th@@ r@@ ust eng@@ ine ."
"It gener@@ ates the force a piece of p@@ aper would have on your hand , incredi@@ bly light , but it can run for months and years , pro@@ vid@@ ing that very gen@@ tle p@@ us@@ h ."
"If any@@ body here is a f@@ an of the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al &quot; &quot; St@@ ar T@@ re@@ k , &quot; &quot; they ra@@ n across an ali@@ en ship that had an ion dr@@ ive , and S@@ po@@ c@@ k said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re very te@@ chn@@ ically soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ."
"They &apos;re a hundred years a@@ head of us with this dr@@ ive . &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , we have an ion dr@@ ive now . ( Laughter ) We don &apos;t have the En@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise , but we &apos;ve got an ion dr@@ ive now ."
( Applause ) S@@ po@@ c@@ k .
( Laughter ) So ...
"@@ that &apos;s the difference , that &apos;s the difference between us and the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs ."
This happened to them .
It doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
"The difference between the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs and us is that we have a space program and we can v@@ ot@@ e , and so we can change our future ."
( Laughter ) We have the ability to change our future .
"@@ 6@@ 5 million years from now , we don &apos;t have to have our b@@ ones col@@ lec@@ ting d@@ ust in a mus@@ e@@ um ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galaxy , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
"And if you take a c@@ amer@@ a and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ ut@@ ter open , as long as your c@@ amer@@ a is att@@ ach@@ ed to the H@@ ub@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace Tel@@ esc@@ ope , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little bl@@ obs is a galaxy rou@@ gh@@ ly the size of our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those bl@@ obs .
There are appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely a hundred billion galaxies in the observ@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich tel@@ ls you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely beautiful .
"I &apos;ve often wonder@@ ed , what is the evolu@@ tion@@ ary pres@@ sure that made our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t ada@@ pt and evol@@ ve to really en@@ jo@@ y pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a co@@ smo@@ log@@ ist , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big cl@@ ue we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and meas@@ ured its vel@@ oc@@ ity , it would be mov@@ ing away from you ."
"And if you look at a galaxy even far@@ ther away , it would be mov@@ ing away fas@@ ter ."
So we say the universe is exp@@ anding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were clo@@ s@@ er together ."
"In the past , the universe was more den@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze things together , the tem@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g , was also very , very smo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a sur@@ pr@@ ise .
The air in this room is very smo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the con@@ dit@@ ions ne@@ ar the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g are very , very different than the con@@ dit@@ ions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot den@@ s@@ er ."
The grav@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l of things was a lot st@@ ron@@ ger ne@@ ar the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ ed into a regi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ ing without any im@@ per@@ fec@@ tions , without any little spo@@ ts where there were a few more at@@ oms than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have coll@@ ap@@ sed under the grav@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l into a huge black hole ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ ep@@ ing the universe very , very smo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a del@@ ic@@ ate ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement ."
It &apos;s a cl@@ ue that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was given to us by L@@ ud@@ wi@@ g B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , an A@@ ust@@ ri@@ an physic@@ ist in the 19@@ th century ."
And B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion was that he hel@@ ped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the r@@ and@@ om@@ ness , the dis@@ order , the cha@@ ot@@ ic@@ ness of some syst@@ ems ."
B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n gave us a form@@ ul@@ a — en@@ grav@@ ed on his t@@ om@@ b@@ st@@ one now — that really quan@@ ti@@ f@@ ies what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t not@@ ice , so that ma@@ c@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t not@@ ice each individ@@ ual at@@ om ."
A low entropy con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tion is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ ran@@ g@@ em@@ ents that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ g@@ em@@ ents that look that way .
"This is a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics — the la@@ w that says that entropy increas@@ es in the universe , or in some is@@ ol@@ ated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy increas@@ es is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it le@@ aves something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy increas@@ es , by the way , is what &apos;s be@@ h@@ ind what we call the ar@@ row of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increas@@ ing — the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increas@@ ing ."
"B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n expla@@ ined that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the fact that the early universe was very , very smo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as co@@ smo@@ log@@ ists .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough at@@ ten@@ tion to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a moder@@ n co@@ smo@@ log@@ ist , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ ich@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a ser@@ ies of a bun@@ ch of different lec@@ tures ."
"He gave the popul@@ ar lec@@ tures that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter of P@@ h@@ ysic@@ al L@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h under@@ gra@@ ds that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on P@@ h@@ ysic@@ s . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h grad@@ u@@ ate students that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on G@@ rav@@ it@@ ation . &quot; &quot; I@@ n every one of these bo@@ o@@ ks , every one of these s@@ ets of lec@@ tures , he em@@ ph@@ as@@ ized this p@@ uz@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy cont@@ ent , and since then the entropy has increas@@ ed ."
The ar@@ row of time cannot be completely underst@@ ood until the my@@ ster@@ y of the begin@@ n@@ ings of the history of the universe are reduc@@ ed still fur@@ ther from spec@@ ul@@ ation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; S@@ ur@@ ely , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve fig@@ ured it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve fig@@ ured it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten wor@@ se , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating .
The universe is not only exp@@ anding .
"If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s mov@@ ing away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be mov@@ ing away fas@@ ter ."
In@@ d@@ ivid@@ ual galaxies are spe@@ ed@@ ing away from us fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter so we say the universe is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating .
"@@ Un@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at le@@ ast have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that emp@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little c@@ ub@@ ic cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s partic@@ les , matter , radi@@ ation or wh@@ at@@ ever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , ac@@ cor@@ ding to E@@ inste@@ in , ex@@ erts a p@@ us@@ h on the universe ."
It is a per@@ p@@ et@@ ual im@@ pul@@ se that p@@ ush@@ es galaxies ap@@ art from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not dil@@ ute away as the universe ex@@ pan@@ ds ."
"The amount of energy in each c@@ ub@@ ic cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter re@@ ma@@ ins the same , even as the universe gets big@@ ger and big@@ ger ."
This has c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al im@@ plic@@ ations for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will exp@@ and for@@ ever ."
"B@@ ack when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would rec@@ ol@@ l@@ ap@@ se in the future .
E@@ inste@@ in was fon@@ d of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep exp@@ anding for@@ ever and ever and ever ."
"@@ 1@@ 4 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , for all in@@ t@@ ents and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ p@@ ace may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite regi@@ on of space that we have acc@@ ess to , sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by a hor@@ iz@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on for@@ ever , space is li@@ mit@@ ed to us ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , emp@@ ty space has a tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king told us that a black hole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually em@@ its radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ coun@@ t quan@@ tum me@@ chan@@ ics ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time around the black hole br@@ ings to life the quan@@ tum me@@ chan@@ ical fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , and the black hole radi@@ ates ."
"A prec@@ is@@ ely si@@ mil@@ ar cal@@ cul@@ ation by H@@ aw@@ king and G@@ ary G@@ ib@@ b@@ ons sho@@ wed that if you have dark energy in emp@@ ty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates ."
The energy of emp@@ ty space br@@ ings to life quan@@ tum fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations .
"And so even though the universe will last for@@ ever , and ordin@@ ary matter and radi@@ ation will dil@@ ute away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ mal fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations , even in emp@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of ga@@ s that las@@ ts for@@ ever .
Well what is the im@@ plic@@ ation of that ?
That im@@ plic@@ ation was stu@@ died by B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy increas@@ es because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a prob@@ abil@@ is@@ tic stat@@ ement .
"It will probably increase , and the prob@@ ability is en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly huge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all ga@@ ther@@ ing over one part of the room and suf@@ foc@@ ating us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ likely ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they loc@@ ked the do@@ ors and ke@@ pt us here liter@@ ally for@@ ever , that would happen ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that is al@@ lowed , every con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tion that is al@@ lowed to be ob@@ ta@@ ined by the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es in this room , would even@@ tually be ob@@ ta@@ ined ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ mal equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g . He didn &apos;t know about the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were expla@@ ined by I@@ sa@@ ac N@@ e@@ w@@ ton — they were ab@@ sol@@ ute ; they just st@@ uc@@ k there for@@ ever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es were just sp@@ read out even@@ ly every@@ where — the everything mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es .
"But if you &apos;re B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , you know that if you wa@@ it long enough , the ran@@ dom fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations of those mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es will oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally bring them into lower entropy con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tions ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will exp@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations into lower entropy , more organiz@@ ed sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very moder@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding ideas — the mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se and the an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic princi@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ mal equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber , life itself de@@ pen@@ ds on the ar@@ row of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze , wal@@ k and talk , if we liv@@ ed in ther@@ mal equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big universe , with r@@ and@@ om@@ ly b@@ um@@ ping into each other partic@@ les , there will oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally be small fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations in the lower entropy st@@ ates , and then they rel@@ a@@ x back ."
But there will also be large fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations .
"O@@ c@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , we will only live in the part of the mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big set of fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ating partic@@ les , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the regi@@ on where entropy is low .
Ma@@ ybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your ho@@ me@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment is to really think about this , to con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate what it means ."
"C@@ ar@@ l S@@ a@@ gan once f@@ amo@@ us@@ ly said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s scen@@ ari@@ o , if you want to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you just wa@@ it for the ran@@ dom mo@@ tion of at@@ oms to make you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more f@@ requ@@ ently than the ran@@ dom mo@@ tions of at@@ oms making you an app@@ le or@@ ch@@ ard and some su@@ ga@@ r and an ov@@ en , and then making you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
So this scen@@ ari@@ o makes predic@@ tions .
And the predic@@ tions are that the fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations that make us are min@@ ima@@ l .
"E@@ ven if you imagine that this room we are in now ex@@ ists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es , but our im@@ pres@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h and the United States and the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y , it &apos;s much eas@@ ier for all those im@@ pres@@ sions to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h , the United States and the galaxy ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ e@@ fore , this scen@@ ari@@ o does not work ; it is not right ."
This scen@@ ari@@ o predic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ ima@@ l fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation .
"E@@ ven if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ ey@@ n@@ man also underst@@ ood this .
"F@@ ey@@ n@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis that the world is a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , all the predic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were d@@ ue to a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , we would not exp@@ ect order any@@ where but where we have just not@@ ic@@ ed it ."
We ther@@ e@@ fore con@@ cl@@ u@@ de the universe is not a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ su@@ s the universe that really ex@@ ists ."
I just sho@@ wed you this picture .
The universe is exp@@ anding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ ma@@ ins around , the stars around us will use up their n@@ uc@@ lear fu@@ el , they will stop b@@ urn@@ ing ."
They will f@@ all into black hol@@ es .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black hol@@ es .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has liv@@ ed .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black hol@@ es don &apos;t last for@@ ever .
"They will ev@@ apo@@ rate , and we will be left with nothing but emp@@ ty space ."
That emp@@ ty space las@@ ts essenti@@ ally for@@ ever .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , you not@@ ice , since emp@@ ty space giv@@ es off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ mal fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations , and it c@@ y@@ cl@@ es around all the different possible com@@ bin@@ ations of the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ ed@@ om that ex@@ ist in emp@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe las@@ ts for@@ ever , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can possi@@ bly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a peri@@ od of time equ@@ al to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one : If the universe las@@ ts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 1@@ 4 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ for@@ table af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g ?"
Why ar@@ en &apos;t we in emp@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation out of the no@@ thin@@ g@@ ness .
Why ar@@ en &apos;t you ?
M@@ ore ho@@ me@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ari@@ o .
E@@ i@@ ther it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a br@@ ute fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop as@@ king questions .
O@@ r maybe the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g is not the beginning of the universe .
"A@@ n eg@@ g , an un@@ bro@@ ken eg@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tion , and yet , when we open our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ ah , how sur@@ pris@@ ing to find this low entropy con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tion in our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an eg@@ g is not a clo@@ sed system ; it comes out of a ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
Ma@@ ybe the universe comes out of a univer@@ sal ch@@ ic@@ ken .
"M@@ a@@ ybe there is something that nat@@ ur@@ ally , through the growth of the laws of physics , giv@@ es r@@ ise to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tions ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much big@@ ger mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ."
That &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ari@@ o .
So the organiz@@ ers asked me to end with a b@@ old spec@@ ul@@ ation .
My b@@ old spec@@ ul@@ ation is that I will be ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely vin@@ dic@@ ated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my curr@@ ent w@@ il@@ d ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tr@@ u@@ ths by the scientific and ex@@ tern@@ al commun@@ ities ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larg@@ er mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g in terms of a theory that we will be able to comp@@ are to observ@@ ations ."
This is a predic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human ra@@ ce about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exc@@ iting to think we may finally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .
( Applause )
L@@ ast year at TE@@ D I gave an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I prom@@ ised to come back and give you an up@@ da@@ te on how that machine worked .
"So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the larg@@ est scientific experiment ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted — 2@@ 7 kilo@@ me@@ ters in cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence ."
"I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the con@@ dit@@ ions that were present less than a bil@@ li@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe be@@ gan , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second ."
It &apos;s nothing if not amb@@ it@@ ious .
This is the machine bel@@ ow G@@ en@@ eva .
We take the pic@@ tures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ gs inside det@@ ec@@ tors .
"This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S det@@ ec@@ tor — 4@@ 4 me@@ ters w@@ ide , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ ame@@ ter ."
S@@ pec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale .
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se cel@@ eb@@ ration in the control room .
"It &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ lid@@ ing with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C d@@ eli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing partic@@ les into the det@@ ec@@ tor ."
"In other words , when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 0@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h ."
"I don &apos;t know whether this got the big@@ gest che@@ er , or this , when someone went on@@ to G@@ o@@ o@@ gle and saw the front p@@ age was like that ."
It means we made cul@@ tu@@ ral im@@ p@@ act as well as scientific im@@ p@@ act .
"A@@ b@@ out a week later we had a problem with the machine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of w@@ ire here — these g@@ old w@@ ir@@ es ."
Th@@ ose w@@ ir@@ es car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thou@@ s@@ and am@@ ps when the machine is working in ful@@ l power .
"Now the engine@@ ers amo@@ n@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small w@@ ir@@ es . &quot;"
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting w@@ ire .
"So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those w@@ ir@@ es can take that curr@@ ent ."
"In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ n@@ ets in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ fect ."
"So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up s@@ ligh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed elec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce ."
This was the res@@ ult .
"Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consid@@ er those mag@@ n@@ ets we@@ igh over 20 t@@ ons , and they mov@@ ed about a fo@@ ot ."
So we da@@ mag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ n@@ ets .
"We had to take them out , which we did ."
"We re@@ con@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them ."
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
B@@ y the end of M@@ arch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again .
"We will s@@ w@@ it@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ ul@@ y , and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building bloc@@ ks of the universe are ."
"Now of course , in a way those acc@@ id@@ ents re@@ ign@@ ite the deb@@ ate about the value of science and engine@@ ering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to re@@ fut@@ e ."
"I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C ."
"I will leave the fin@@ al word to an English scient@@ ist , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , when de@@ fen@@ ding his pro@@ te@@ ge &apos;s us@@ el@@ ess experim@@ ents — his pro@@ te@@ ge was M@@ i@@ cha@@ el F@@ ar@@ ada@@ y — said this , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is so dan@@ ger@@ ous to the progress of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"I work with a bun@@ ch of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans , philosoph@@ ers and computer scient@@ ists , and we s@@ it around and think about the future of machine intelligence , amo@@ n@@ g other things ."
"S@@ ome people think that some of these things are sort of science fic@@ tion@@ -@@ y , far out there , crazy ."
"But I like to say , o@@ kay , let &apos;s look at the moder@@ n human con@@ d@@ ition ."
( Laughter ) This is the nor@@ mal way for things to be .
"But if we think about it , we are actually rec@@ ently ar@@ riv@@ ed gu@@ es@@ ts on this planet , the human spec@@ ies ."
"Th@@ ink about if Earth was created one year ago , the human spec@@ ies , then , would be 10 minutes old ."
The ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al er@@ a started two secon@@ ds ago .
"A@@ no@@ ther way to look at this is to think of world G@@ D@@ P over the last 1@@ 0,000 years , I &apos;ve actually taken the tro@@ ub@@ le to p@@ lot this for you in a gra@@ p@@ h ."
It looks like this .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a cur@@ ious shap@@ e for a nor@@ mal con@@ d@@ ition .
I sure wouldn &apos;t want to s@@ it on it .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated through human history , and right now , technology adv@@ an@@ ces extre@@ m@@ ely ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly — that is the pro@@ x@@ i@@ mate cause , that &apos;s why we are curr@@ ently so very produc@@ tive ."
But I like to think back fur@@ ther to the ul@@ ti@@ mate cause .
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok at these two high@@ ly dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ i@@ shed gen@@ t@@ l@@ em@@ en : We have K@@ an@@ z@@ i — he &apos;s ma@@ ster@@ ed 200 le@@ x@@ ical to@@ k@@ ens , an incredi@@ ble fe@@ at ."
And E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten un@@ le@@ a@@ shed the second super@@ str@@ ing revolu@@ tion .
"If we look under the ho@@ od , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little larg@@ er , it maybe also has a few tric@@ ks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese in@@ vis@@ ible differ@@ ences cannot be too compl@@ ic@@ ated , ho@@ w@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ c@@ es@@ tor ."
We know that compl@@ ic@@ ated me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms take a long time to evol@@ ve .
"So a bun@@ ch of rel@@ ati@@ vely min@@ or changes take us from K@@ an@@ z@@ i to W@@ it@@ ten , from bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ off t@@ ree br@@ an@@ ch@@ es to inter@@ contin@@ ental b@@ all@@ is@@ tic mis@@ sil@@ es ."
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed , and everything we care about , de@@ pen@@ ds c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally on some rel@@ ati@@ vely min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
"And the co@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ary , of course , is that any fur@@ ther changes that could si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly change the sub@@ st@@ rate of thinking could have po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally en@@ or@@ mo@@ us con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ."
"S@@ ome of my colle@@ ag@@ ues think we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of something that could cause a prof@@ ound change in that sub@@ st@@ rate , and that is machine super@@ intelligence ."
A@@ r@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence used to be about put@@ ting com@@ man@@ ds in a bo@@ x .
You would have human program@@ m@@ ers that would pa@@ inst@@ ak@@ ing@@ ly h@@ and@@ cra@@ ft knowledge it@@ ems .
"You build up these exper@@ t syst@@ ems , and they were kind of us@@ ef@@ ul for some pur@@ pos@@ es , but they were very br@@ it@@ tle , you couldn &apos;t sc@@ ale them ."
"But since then , a par@@ a@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence ."
"@@ To@@ day , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than h@@ and@@ cra@@ f@@ ting knowledge re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations and fe@@ atures , we create al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that learn , often from ra@@ w per@@ cep@@ tual data ."
B@@ as@@ ically the same thing that the human in@@ f@@ ant does .
"The res@@ ult is A@@ .@@ I@@ . that is not li@@ mit@@ ed to one do@@ ma@@ in — the same system can learn to trans@@ l@@ ate between any pa@@ ir@@ s of langu@@ ages , or learn to play any computer ga@@ me on the A@@ t@@ ari con@@ so@@ le ."
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same power@@ ful , c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ do@@ ma@@ in ability to learn and pl@@ an as a human being has ."
"So the question is , how far are we from being able to mat@@ ch those tric@@ ks ?"
"And the me@@ dian answer was 20@@ 40 or 20@@ 50 , de@@ pen@@ ding on prec@@ is@@ ely which group of exp@@ erts we asked ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tr@@ uth is nob@@ ody really kno@@ ws ."
What we do know is that the ul@@ ti@@ mate li@@ mit to information proc@@ ess@@ ing in a machine sub@@ st@@ rate li@@ es far outside the lim@@ its in bi@@ ological t@@ issue .
This comes down to physics .
"A bi@@ ological neuro@@ n fir@@ es , maybe , at 200 h@@ ert@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day trans@@ ist@@ or oper@@ ates at the G@@ i@@ ga@@ h@@ ert@@ z .
"@@ N@@ e@@ u@@ rons pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ te s@@ low@@ ly in ax@@ ons , 100 me@@ ters per second , t@@ op@@ s ."
"But in comput@@ ers , sign@@ als can tr@@ av@@ el at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"There are also size li@@ mit@@ ations , like a human brain has to f@@ it inside a c@@ ran@@ i@@ um , but a computer can be the size of a w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se or larg@@ er ."
"So the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al for super@@ intelligence li@@ es d@@ or@@ man@@ t in matter , much like the power of the at@@ om la@@ y d@@ or@@ man@@ t throu@@ gh@@ out human history , pati@@ ently wa@@ iting there until 19@@ 4@@ 5 ."
"In this century , scient@@ ists may learn to aw@@ ak@@ en the power of ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence explo@@ sion .
"Now most people , when they think about what is s@@ mart and what is d@@ um@@ b , I think have in mind a picture rou@@ gh@@ ly like this ."
"So at one end we have the village id@@ iot , and then far over at the other side we have E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten , or A@@ l@@ b@@ ert E@@ inste@@ in , or wh@@ o@@ ever your fav@@ or@@ ite g@@ ur@@ u is ."
"But I think that from the point of view of ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence , the true picture is actually probably more like this : A@@ I star@@ ts out at this point here , at z@@ ero intelligence , and then , after many , many years of really hard work , maybe even@@ tually we get to mo@@ us@@ e-@@ level ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence , something that can nav@@ i@@ ga@@ te cl@@ ut@@ ter@@ ed environ@@ ments as well as a mo@@ use can ."
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of inv@@ est@@ ment , maybe even@@ tually we get to ch@@ impanze@@ e-@@ level ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village id@@ iot ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence ."
"And a few mo@@ ments later , we are be@@ y@@ ond E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The tra@@ in doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ um@@ an@@ vil@@ le St@@ ation .
"It &apos;s likely , rather , to s@@ wo@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has prof@@ ound im@@ plic@@ ations , particul@@ arly when it comes to questions of power ."
"For example , ch@@ impanze@@ es are st@@ rong — po@@ und for po@@ und , a ch@@ impanze@@ e is about tw@@ ice as st@@ rong as a f@@ it human mal@@ e ."
"And yet , the f@@ ate of K@@ an@@ z@@ i and his p@@ als de@@ pen@@ ds a lot more on what we hum@@ ans do than on what the ch@@ impanze@@ es do themselves ."
"O@@ n@@ ce there is super@@ intelligence , the f@@ ate of hum@@ an@@ ity may de@@ p@@ end on what the super@@ intelligence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ach@@ ine intelligence is the last inv@@ en@@ tion that hum@@ an@@ ity will ever need to make .
"M@@ ach@@ ines will then be better at inv@@ ent@@ ing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on dig@@ ital tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es ."
What this means is basically a tel@@ esc@@ op@@ ing of the future .
"Th@@ ink of all the crazy tech@@ nologi@@ es that you could have imag@@ ined maybe hum@@ ans could have develop@@ ed in the ful@@ l@@ ness of time : c@@ ures for ag@@ ing , space col@@ on@@ iz@@ ation , self-@@ re@@ plic@@ ating n@@ an@@ ob@@ ots or up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing of min@@ ds into comput@@ ers , all kinds of science fic@@ tion@@ -@@ y stuff that &apos;s n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent with the laws of physics ."
"A@@ ll of this super@@ intelligence could devel@@ op , and possi@@ bly quite ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly ."
"Now , a super@@ intelligence with such technolo@@ g@@ ical mat@@ ur@@ ity would be extre@@ m@@ ely power@@ ful , and at le@@ ast in some scen@@ ari@@ os , it would be able to get what it wan@@ ts ."
We would then have a future that would be shap@@ ed by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
"Now a good question is , what are those pre@@ fer@@ ences ?"
Here it gets tric@@ k@@ ier .
"@@ To make any head@@ way with this , we must first of all av@@ o@@ id an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ mor@@ ph@@ iz@@ ing ."
"And this is i@@ ron@@ ic because every ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper ar@@ tic@@ le about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ ce@@ ive of the issue more ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tly , not in terms of v@@ iv@@ id H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od scen@@ ari@@ os ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ation process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ fig@@ ura@@ tions ."
A super@@ intelligence is a really st@@ rong op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ation process .
It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely good at using av@@ a@@ il@@ able means to achi@@ eve a state in which its go@@ al is real@@ ized .
"This means that there is no nec@@ ess@@ ary connec@@ tion between being high@@ ly intelli@@ gent in this sense , and having an ob@@ jec@@ tive that we hum@@ ans would find wor@@ th@@ while or mean@@ ing@@ ful ."
S@@ up@@ pose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make hum@@ ans s@@ mil@@ e .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becom@@ es super@@ intelli@@ gent , it real@@ iz@@ es that there is a more effec@@ tive way to achi@@ eve this go@@ al : take control of the world and s@@ tic@@ k elec@@ tro@@ des into the f@@ aci@@ al mus@@ cl@@ es of hum@@ ans to cause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing gr@@ ins ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , sup@@ pose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical problem ."
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becom@@ es super@@ intelli@@ gent , it real@@ iz@@ es that the most effec@@ tive way to get the solu@@ tion to this problem is by trans@@ form@@ ing the planet into a gi@@ ant computer , so as to increase its thinking cap@@ ac@@ ity ."
"O@@ f course , per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ably things won &apos;t go wrong in these particular ways ; these are car@@ to@@ on exam@@ pl@@ es ."
This is a les@@ son that &apos;s also t@@ au@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
K@@ ing M@@ i@@ das wi@@ sh@@ es that everything he tou@@ ch@@ es be turned into g@@ old .
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his dau@@ ghter , she turns into g@@ old ."
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his food , it turns into g@@ old ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts s@@ tic@@ king elec@@ tro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on the system — like , where is the off s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the In@@ tern@@ et ?"
"@@ B , why hav@@ en &apos;t the ch@@ impanze@@ es fl@@ ic@@ ked the off s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to hum@@ an@@ ity , or the N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als ?"
They certain@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"We have an off s@@ w@@ it@@ ch , for example , right here ."
"The point is , we should not be con@@ f@@ id@@ ent that we have this under control here ."
"So we dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect the e@@ ther@@ n@@ et c@@ able to create an air ga@@ p , but again , like mer@@ ely human h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely trans@@ g@@ ress air ga@@ ps using social engine@@ ering ."

"O@@ r maybe you could pret@@ end to mal@@ func@@ tion , and then when the program@@ m@@ ers open you up to see what went wrong with you , they look at the s@@ our@@ ce cod@@ e — B@@ am ! — the man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation can take place ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
"I believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create super@@ intelli@@ gent A@@ .@@ I@@ . such that even if — when — it es@@ cap@@ es , it is still sa@@ fe because it is fundam@@ ent@@ ally on our side because it shar@@ es our val@@ ues ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fa@@ ir@@ ly op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that uses its intelligence to learn what we value , and its mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation system is con@@ struc@@ ted in such a way that it is mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated to pur@@ su@@ e our val@@ ues or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it predic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us l@@ ever@@ age its intelligence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of val@@ u@@ e-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
"This can happen , and the ou@@ t@@ come could be very good for hum@@ an@@ ity ."
But it doesn &apos;t happen aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically .
The in@@ it@@ ial con@@ dit@@ ions for the intelligence explo@@ sion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a contro@@ l@@ led det@@ on@@ ation .
"And there are also some es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic issu@@ es that would need to be sol@@ ved , sor@@ ted out : the ex@@ act deta@@ ils of its dec@@ ision theory , how to de@@ al with log@@ ical un@@ certain@@ ty and so for@@ th ."
"So the te@@ chn@@ ical problems that need to be sol@@ ved to make this work look quite difficult — not as difficult as making a super@@ intelli@@ gent A@@ .@@ I@@ . , but fa@@ ir@@ ly difficult ."
Here is the wor@@ ry : M@@ ak@@ ing super@@ intelli@@ gent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard challenge .
M@@ ak@@ ing super@@ intelli@@ gent A@@ .@@ I@@ . that is sa@@ fe inv@@ ol@@ ves some ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al challenge on top of that .
"So I think that we should work out a solu@@ tion to the control problem in adv@@ ance , so that we have it av@@ a@@ il@@ able by the time it is needed ."
"But the more of the control problem that we sol@@ ve in adv@@ ance , the better the od@@ ds that the trans@@ ition to the machine intelligence er@@ a will go well ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out o@@ kay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mat@@ ter@@ ed was to get this thing right ."

"@@ Not your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and write something more fu@@ n .

C@@ an any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I c@@ over the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are id@@ en@@ tical ."
V@@ ision is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some co@@ gn@@ itive ill@@ us@@ ions , or dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making ill@@ us@@ ions , in the same way ."
"@@ G@@ er@@ many is on the left , and A@@ u@@ str@@ ia is on the right ."
"The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"P@@ eople don &apos;t ch@@ ec@@ k , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"A@@ ll these medic@@ ations , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pul@@ l the pati@@ ent back and try i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exam@@ pl@@ es on ir@@ ra@@ tional dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making .
"Now , we@@ ek@@ end in P@@ aris , we@@ ek@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , you have to pa@@ y for it yourself , it &apos;s two e@@ u@@ ros 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ min@@ ute da@@ t@@ es .

"@@ 1@@ .@@ 3 billion years ago , in a dis@@ t@@ ant , dis@@ t@@ ant galaxy , two black hol@@ es loc@@ ked into a sp@@ i@@ ral , f@@ all@@ ing in@@ ex@@ o@@ ra@@ bly to@@ wards each other and coll@@ ided , con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing three S@@ un@@ s &apos; wor@@ th of stuff into p@@ ure energy in a t@@ ent@@ h of a second ."
"For that bri@@ ef moment in time , the g@@ low was bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Un@@ iver@@ se ."
It was a very big ban@@ g .
But they didn &apos;t rel@@ ease their energy in light .
"I mean , you know , they &apos;re black hol@@ es ."
"A@@ ll that energy was p@@ um@@ ped into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space and time itself , making the Un@@ iver@@ se explo@@ de in grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ aves ."
Let me give you a sense of the tim@@ es@@ cal@@ e at work here .
"@@ 1@@ .@@ 3 billion years ago , Earth had just man@@ ag@@ ed to evol@@ ve mul@@ tic@@ el@@ l@@ ul@@ ar life ."
"S@@ in@@ ce then , Earth has made and evol@@ ved cor@@ als , f@@ ish , plan@@ ts , din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs , people and even — G@@ od sa@@ ve us — the In@@ tern@@ et ."
"Now , most people thought they were n@@ ut@@ s ."
But enough people real@@ ized that they were br@@ il@@ li@@ ant n@@ ut@@ s that the U@@ S N@@ ational S@@ ci@@ ence F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion decided to fun@@ d their crazy idea .
It &apos;s now called A@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ced L@@ I@@ G@@ O as a res@@ ult .
"In early S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber of 20@@ 15 , L@@ I@@ G@@ O turned on for a fin@@ al test run while they sor@@ ted out a few l@@ ing@@ ering deta@@ ils ."
"And on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 4 of 20@@ 15 , just days after the det@@ ec@@ tor had gone live , the grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ aves from those col@@ lid@@ ing black hol@@ es pas@@ sed through the Earth ."
And they pas@@ sed through you and me .
And they pas@@ sed through the det@@ ec@@ tor .
( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) S@@ c@@ ot@@ t H@@ u@@ gh@@ es : There &apos;s two mo@@ ments in my life more emo@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ten@@ se than that .
"You know , it was the pa@@ yof@@ f of my career , basically ."
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ ave .
A grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ ave is a ri@@ p@@ ple in the shap@@ e of space and time .
"As the w@@ ave pas@@ ses by , it stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es space and everything in it in one direc@@ tion , and com@@ pres@@ ses it in the other ."
This has led to coun@@ t@@ less in@@ struc@@ tors of gener@@ al rel@@ ati@@ vity doing a really sil@@ ly dan@@ ce to demon@@ st@@ rate in their clas@@ ses on gener@@ al rel@@ ati@@ vity .
"&quot; It stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es and ex@@ pan@@ ds , it stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es and ex@@ pan@@ ds . &quot;"
So the tro@@ ub@@ le with grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ aves is that they &apos;re very we@@ ak ; they &apos;re pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ously we@@ ak .
"For example , the w@@ aves that h@@ it us on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 4 — and y@@ es , every single one of you stre@@ t@@ ched and com@@ pres@@ sed under the action of that w@@ ave — when the w@@ aves h@@ it , they stre@@ t@@ ched the average person by one part in 10 to the 2@@ 1 ."
"That &apos;s a de@@ ci@@ mal place , 20 z@@ er@@ o@@ es , and a one ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the L@@ I@@ G@@ O people were n@@ ut@@ s .
E@@ ven with a las@@ er det@@ ec@@ tor five kilo@@ me@@ ters long — and that &apos;s already crazy — they would have to measure the l@@ eng@@ th of those det@@ ec@@ tors to less than one thousan@@ d@@ th of the radi@@ us of the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us of an at@@ om .
And that &apos;s pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous .
"So to@@ wards the end of his clas@@ si@@ c t@@ ex@@ t on grav@@ ity , L@@ I@@ G@@ O co@@ -@@ f@@ oun@@ der K@@ i@@ p Th@@ or@@ ne descri@@ bed the h@@ un@@ t for grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ aves as fol@@ lo@@ ws : He said , &quot; &quot; The te@@ chn@@ ical diffic@@ ul@@ ties to be sur@@ mo@@ un@@ ted in con@@ struc@@ ting such det@@ ec@@ tors are en@@ or@@ mo@@ us ."
"But physic@@ ists are in@@ gen@@ ious , and with the sup@@ port of a bro@@ ad la@@ y public , all ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les will sur@@ ely be over@@ come . &quot; &quot; Th@@ or@@ ne published that in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 4@@ 2 years before he suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed ."
"Now , coming back to L@@ I@@ G@@ O , S@@ c@@ ot@@ t lik@@ es to say that L@@ I@@ G@@ O ac@@ ts like an e@@ ar more than it does like an ey@@ e ."
I want to explain what that means .
"@@ V@@ is@@ ible light has a w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , a size , that &apos;s much sm@@ all@@ er than the things around you , the fe@@ atures on people &apos;s fac@@ es , the size of your c@@ ell ph@@ one ."
"And that &apos;s really us@@ ef@@ ul , because it l@@ ets you make an imag@@ e or a map of the things around you , by looking at the light coming from different spo@@ ts in the scen@@ e about you ."
S@@ ound is different .
A@@ u@@ di@@ ble sound has a w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th that can be up to 50 fe@@ et long .
"And that makes it really difficult — in fact , in prac@@ tical pur@@ pos@@ es , im@@ possible — to make an imag@@ e of something you really care about ."
Y@@ our child &apos;s face .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we use sound to list@@ en for fe@@ atures like p@@ it@@ ch and t@@ one and r@@ hy@@ th@@ m and v@@ olu@@ me to in@@ fer a story be@@ h@@ ind the s@@ oun@@ ds ."
That &apos;s A@@ l@@ ice talking .
That &apos;s B@@ ob inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ting .
S@@ il@@ ly B@@ ob .
"So , the same is true of grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ aves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple imag@@ es of things out in the Un@@ iver@@ se .
"But by list@@ en@@ ing to changes in the am@@ pl@@ it@@ u@@ de and f@@ requ@@ en@@ cy of those w@@ aves , we can hear the story that those w@@ aves are telling ."
"And at le@@ ast for L@@ I@@ G@@ O , the f@@ requ@@ en@@ ci@@ es that it can hear are in the audi@@ o b@@ and ."
"So if we con@@ ver@@ t the w@@ ave patterns into pres@@ sure w@@ aves and air , into sound , we can liter@@ ally hear the Un@@ iver@@ se speak@@ ing to us ."
"For example , list@@ en@@ ing to grav@@ ity , just in this way , can tell us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black hol@@ es , something my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ c@@ ot@@ t has sp@@ ent an aw@@ ful lot of time thinking about ."
"( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) S@@ H : If the two black hol@@ es are n@@ on@@ -@@ sp@@ in@@ ning , you get a very simple ch@@ ir@@ p : wh@@ o@@ op !@@ "
"If the two bo@@ dies are sp@@ in@@ ning very ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly , I have that same ch@@ ir@@ p , but with a mod@@ ul@@ ation on top of it , so it kind of goes : wh@@ ir , wh@@ ir , wh@@ ir !@@ "
It &apos;s sort of the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of sp@@ in im@@ prin@@ ted on this w@@ av@@ e@@ form .
A@@ A : It &apos;s wor@@ th pa@@ using here to think about what that means .
"@@ T@@ w@@ o black hol@@ es , the den@@ s@@ est thing in the Un@@ iver@@ se , one with a mass of 2@@ 9 S@@ un@@ s and one with a mass of 3@@ 6 S@@ un@@ s , wh@@ ir@@ ling around each other 100 times per second before they coll@@ ide ."
It &apos;s f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the las@@ ting import@@ ance of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
It &apos;s an enti@@ rel@@ y new way to ob@@ ser@@ ve the Un@@ iver@@ se that we &apos;ve never had before .
It &apos;s a way that l@@ ets us hear the Un@@ iver@@ se and hear the in@@ vis@@ ible .
And there &apos;s a lot out there that we can &apos;t see — in prac@@ ti@@ ce or even in princi@@ ple .
"So super@@ no@@ va , for example : I would love to know why very massive stars explo@@ de in super@@ no@@ va@@ e ."
"We &apos;ll never see through it , it &apos;s op@@ a@@ qu@@ e to light ."
"W@@ ith grav@@ it@@ ational w@@ aves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"P@@ er@@ haps most import@@ an@@ tly , I &apos;m pos@@ itive that there are things out there that we &apos;ve never seen that we may never be able to see and that we hav@@ en &apos;t even imag@@ ined — things that we &apos;ll only disc@@ over by list@@ en@@ ing ."
"And in fact , even in that very first ev@@ ent , L@@ I@@ G@@ O found things that we didn &apos;t exp@@ ect ."
"They &apos;re these massive things that are old , from pre@@ hist@@ or@@ ic times , and the black hol@@ es are kind of like the din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur b@@ ones with which we do this arch@@ e@@ ology ."
A@@ A : O@@ ur challenge now is to be as au@@ da@@ ci@@ ous as possible .
"O@@ ur job is to dre@@ am up and build new observ@@ at@@ or@@ ies — a whole new gener@@ ation of observ@@ at@@ or@@ ies — on the ground , in space ."

"P@@ lan@@ et@@ ary syst@@ ems outside our own are like dis@@ t@@ ant c@@ ities wh@@ ose ligh@@ ts we can see tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stud@@ ying those tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing ligh@@ ts though , we can learn about how stars and plan@@ ets inter@@ act to form their own ec@@ o@@ system and make h@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s that are am@@ en@@ able to life ."

C@@ an you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sk@@ y the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er star@@ es at , where it se@@ arch@@ es for plan@@ ets by meas@@ uring the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very prec@@ is@@ ely ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny di@@ m@@ m@@ ing of light that is ca@@ used by a planet pas@@ sing in front of one of these stars and bloc@@ king some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of oper@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al new plan@@ et@@ ary syst@@ ems around other stars ."
"@@ To give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two dec@@ ades of se@@ arch@@ ing , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to K@@ e@@ pl@@ er ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can de@@ ter@@ mine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can de@@ ter@@ mine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its par@@ ent star ."
That dis@@ tan@@ ce is really important because it tel@@ ls us how much light the planet re@@ ce@@ iv@@ es over@@ all .
"And that dis@@ tan@@ ce and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sit@@ ting around a cam@@ p@@ fir@@ e : You want to be clo@@ se enough to the cam@@ p@@ fir@@ e so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so clo@@ se that you &apos;re too to@@ as@@ ty and you get b@@ urn@@ ed ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you re@@ ce@@ ive over@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Su@@ n .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in vis@@ ible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll not@@ ice that it looks pretty much like the ic@@ on@@ ic y@@ el@@ low b@@ all — that Su@@ n that we all dra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll not@@ ice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Su@@ n has f@@ rec@@ kl@@ es ."
"Th@@ ese f@@ rec@@ kl@@ es are called sun@@ spo@@ ts , and they are just one of the man@@ if@@ est@@ ations of the Su@@ n &apos;s mag@@ ne@@ tic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to v@@ ary .
"And we can measure this very , very prec@@ is@@ ely with K@@ e@@ pl@@ er and tra@@ ce their effec@@ ts ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , these are just the ti@@ p of the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ey@@ es , we would really see the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic and dra@@ ma@@ tic effec@@ ts of our Su@@ n &apos;s mag@@ ne@@ tic acti@@ vity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ Just think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ d@@ y outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y ab@@ ove you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is h@@ ab@@ it@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much tot@@ al light it re@@ ce@@ iv@@ es and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space we@@ a@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at plan@@ ets around other stars in the same kind of deta@@ il that we can look at plan@@ ets in our own sol@@ ar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ars — three plan@@ ets in our own sol@@ ar system that are rou@@ gh@@ ly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the mean@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the plan@@ ets and their par@@ ent stars to s@@ us@@ s out cl@@ ues about which plan@@ ets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment it makes is pre@@ ci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and plan@@ ets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that s@@ ets the stage for the forma@@ tion of life in the universe ."
"Wh@@ ile it &apos;s K@@ e@@ pl@@ er the tel@@ esc@@ ope , the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent that star@@ es , it &apos;s we , life , who are se@@ arch@@ ing ."

C@@ om@@ passion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no In@@ dian com@@ passion .
There &apos;s no American com@@ passion .
"It trans@@ cen@@ ds na@@ tion , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experien@@ ced by people oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally .
"Th@@ en this oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ al com@@ passion , we are not talking about — it will never re@@ ma@@ in oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ al ."
"B@@ y man@@ da@@ te , you cannot make a person com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate ."

"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to disc@@ over a certain wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
"I am going to c@@ ite the possi@@ bility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tra@@ g@@ ic life , one is happy in mo@@ ments which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a sl@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k jo@@ ke , ac@@ cep@@ ts h@@ im@@ self and also the s@@ che@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ es@@ elf ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
All of them are tot@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disc@@ over your wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the object — the s@@ che@@ me of things — f@@ use into on@@ en@@ ess , an experience nob@@ ody can say , &quot; &quot; I am den@@ i@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and s@@ und@@ ry ."

But the ex@@ ten@@ sion of the log@@ ic is that you don &apos;t need to ful@@ f@@ ill your des@@ ire to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess and still be whole .
"Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that real@@ iz@@ ation , that reco@@ gn@@ ition : &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ybe I am the whole ."
Ma@@ ybe the s@@ w@@ am@@ i is right .
Ma@@ ybe the s@@ w@@ am@@ i is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything becom@@ es mean@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to bl@@ ame my@@ self .
"If one has to bl@@ ame on@@ es@@ elf , one has a million reas@@ ons pl@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being li@@ mit@@ ed — if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is li@@ mit@@ ed any which way you look at it . L@@ im@@ ited ."
"Y@@ our knowledge is li@@ mit@@ ed , health is li@@ mit@@ ed , and power is ther@@ e@@ fore li@@ mit@@ ed , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be li@@ mit@@ ed ."
C@@ om@@ passion is going to be li@@ mit@@ ed .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is going to be li@@ mit@@ less .
"You cannot com@@ m@@ and com@@ passion un@@ less you become li@@ mit@@ less , and nob@@ ody can become li@@ mit@@ less , ei@@ ther you are or you are not . P@@ er@@ i@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not li@@ mit@@ less too .
"Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all li@@ mit@@ ations , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is the reality of you when you rel@@ ate to the world .
It is love first .
"When you rel@@ ate to the world , the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ if@@ est@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is , what we say , love ."
And itself becom@@ es com@@ passion if the object that you rel@@ ate to ev@@ o@@ k@@ es that emo@@ tion .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into shar@@ ing ."
You ex@@ pres@@ s yourself because you have com@@ passion .
"@@ To disc@@ over com@@ passion , you need to be com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"@@ To disc@@ over the cap@@ ac@@ ity to give and share , you need to be giving and shar@@ ing ."
There is no shor@@ t@@ c@@ ut : it is like s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing by s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing by s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
You cannot learn s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing on a fo@@ am mat@@ t@@ ress and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing by s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing . You learn c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing by c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
"You learn co@@ o@@ king by co@@ o@@ king , having some sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic people around you to e@@ at what you co@@ ok ."
"( Laughter ) And , ther@@ e@@ fore , what I say , you have to f@@ ake it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
My pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately .
"There is no ver@@ b for com@@ passion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for com@@ passion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately .
"But then , how to act com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately if you don &apos;t have com@@ passion ?"
That is where you f@@ ake .
You f@@ ake it and make it . This is the man@@ t@@ ra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You f@@ ake it and make it .
"You act com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately as though you have com@@ passion : gr@@ ind your te@@ et@@ h , take all the sup@@ port system ."
"If you know how to pra@@ y , pra@@ y ."
A@@ s@@ k for com@@ passion .
Let me act com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll disc@@ over com@@ passion and also s@@ low@@ ly a rel@@ ative com@@ passion , and s@@ low@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disc@@ over com@@ passion is a d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ if@@ est@@ ation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ en@@ ess , wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess , and that &apos;s what you are ."

How does the news shap@@ e the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world bas@@ ed on the way it looks — bas@@ ed on l@@ and@@ mass .
And here &apos;s how news shap@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This map — ( Applause ) — this map sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American n@@ et@@ work and c@@ able news organiz@@ ations de@@ dic@@ ated to news stories , by country , in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ ea ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ tle its n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ il@@ ities ."
There was massive f@@ lo@@ od@@ ing in In@@ don@@ es@@ ia .
"And in P@@ aris , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C rel@@ eas@@ ed its study con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing man &apos;s im@@ p@@ act on global war@@ m@@ ing ."
The U.@@ S@@ . ac@@ coun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of tot@@ al news c@@ over@@ age .
"And when we take out the U.@@ S@@ . and look at the re@@ main@@ ing 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of I@@ ra@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined c@@ over@@ age of R@@ us@@ sia , China and India , for example , re@@ ach@@ ed just one percent ."
"When we anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed all the news stories and re@@ mov@@ ed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The death of An@@ na N@@ ic@@ ole S@@ m@@ ith .
"This story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country ex@@ cept I@@ ra@@ q , and re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed 10 times the c@@ over@@ age of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port ."
"And the c@@ y@@ cle contin@@ ues ; as we all know , Brit@@ ney has lo@@ om@@ ed pretty large l@@ ately ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news n@@ et@@ works have reduc@@ ed the number of their for@@ e@@ ign bu@@ re@@ au@@ s by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C min@@ i@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i , New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and M@@ um@@ b@@ ai , there are no n@@ et@@ work news bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in all of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — places that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that c@@ over@@ ing Brit@@ ney is che@@ aper .
And this l@@ ack of global c@@ over@@ age is all the more dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"@@ L@@ oc@@ al T@@ V news lo@@ oms large , and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately only de@@ dic@@ ates 12 percent of its c@@ over@@ age to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the w@@ eb ?
The most popul@@ ar news sit@@ es don &apos;t do much better .
"@@ L@@ ast year , P@@ ew and the C@@ olo@@ m@@ b@@ ia J@@ -@@ S@@ cho@@ ol anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed on G@@ o@@ o@@ gle N@@ e@@ ws &apos; front p@@ age ."
"And they , in fact , c@@ over@@ ed the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , a study in e-@@ cont@@ ent sho@@ wed that much of global news from U.@@ S@@ . news cre@@ at@@ ors is rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed stories from the A@@ P w@@ ire ser@@ vic@@ es and R@@ e@@ ut@@ ers , and don &apos;t put things into a cont@@ ex@@ t that people can understand their connec@@ tion to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college grad@@ u@@ ates , as well as less educ@@ ated Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their coun@@ ter@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interes@@ ted , you would be wrong ."
"In rec@@ ent years , Americ@@ ans who say they clo@@ s@@ ely fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dis@@ t@@ or@@ ted wor@@ ld@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our increas@@ ing@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we af@@ for@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The domin@@ ant kind of s@@ nob@@ ber@@ y that ex@@ ists no@@ w@@ ada@@ ys is job s@@ nob@@ ber@@ y .
I don &apos;t think we are particul@@ arly mater@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite pos@@ itive can have a n@@ as@@ ty k@@ ic@@ k@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , lin@@ ked to something n@@ ice ."
And that makes fa@@ il@@ ure seem much more c@@ r@@ ush@@ ing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating if you &apos;re doing well , and very c@@ r@@ ush@@ ing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody des@@ er@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : acc@@ id@@ ents , acc@@ id@@ ents of bir@@ th , acc@@ id@@ ents of things dro@@ p@@ ping on people &apos;s head@@ s , ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."
I gave them the pl@@ ot@@ line of M@@ ada@@ me B@@ ov@@ ary .
"( Applause ) I@@ n a way , if you like , at one end of the spec@@ tr@@ um of sym@@ pa@@ thy , you &apos;ve got the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper ."
"The other thing about moder@@ n society and why it ca@@ uses this an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , is that we have nothing at its center that is n@@ on@@ -@@ human ."
"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own comp@@ et@@ ition , and our own dra@@ mas ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and fa@@ il@@ ure .
"When we &apos;re told that ban@@ king is a very res@@ pec@@ table profes@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into ban@@ king ."
"When ban@@ king is no longer so res@@ pec@@ table , we lo@@ se inter@@ est in ban@@ king ."
"But what I really want to stress is : by all means , success , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the stran@@ gen@@ ess of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in mat@@ h class , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , P@@ ro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ m@@ ely log@@ ical language ."
"@@ To write a word or a ph@@ ra@@ se or a s@@ ent@@ ence in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic is like cra@@ f@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ m@@ ely prec@@ ise and car@@ ri@@ es a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as W@@ es@@ tern science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and engine@@ ering was really worked out in the first few cent@@ ur@@ ies of the C@@ om@@ mon E@@ ra by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the A@@ ra@@ b@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This incl@@ ud@@ es the little system in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic called al@@ -@@ j@@ eb@@ ra .
And al@@ -@@ j@@ eb@@ r rou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ l@@ ates to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ cil@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate parts . &quot;
A@@ l-@@ j@@ eb@@ r finally came into English as al@@ g@@ eb@@ ra .
One example amo@@ n@@ g many .
The A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic t@@ ex@@ ts con@@ ta@@ ining this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical w@@ is@@ dom finally made their way to Eu@@ rop@@ e — which is to say S@@ pa@@ in — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th cent@@ ur@@ ies .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ oun@@ ds in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic that just don &apos;t make it through a Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an vo@@ ice bo@@ x without lots of prac@@ ti@@ ce .
Tr@@ ust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
"This is the l@@ et@@ ter S@@ H@@ e@@ en , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; s@@ h . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first l@@ et@@ ter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in A@@ ra@@ b@@ ic , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al@@ -@@ sh@@ al@@ an — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that ap@@ pe@@ ars throu@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , such as this 1@@ 0@@ th century der@@ iv@@ ation of pro@@ of@@ s ."
"The problem for the M@@ e@@ di@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ ish s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars who were t@@ asked with trans@@ l@@ ating this material is that the l@@ et@@ ter S@@ H@@ e@@ en and the word sh@@ al@@ an can &apos;t be ren@@ der@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ ish because S@@ pan@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; s@@ h &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ ven@@ tion , they created a rul@@ e in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; c@@ k &quot; &quot; sound , from the clas@@ sic@@ al Gre@@ e@@ k in the form of the l@@ et@@ ter K@@ ai ."
"@@ L@@ ater when this material was trans@@ l@@ ated into a common Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an language , which is to say L@@ ati@@ n , they simply re@@ plac@@ ed the Gre@@ e@@ k K@@ ai with the L@@ ati@@ n X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in L@@ ati@@ n , it form@@ ed the bas@@ is for ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; s@@ h &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th shar@@ ing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter wh@@ ats@@ o@@ ever .
"Th@@ en she se@@ es the other one getting gra@@ p@@ e , and you will see what happens ."
How many times have you used the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ es@@ ome &quot; &quot; today ?

Do you remember what you were descri@@ b@@ ing when you used the word ?
"Now , with that in mind , was your Q@@ u@@ iz@@ no@@ s san@@ d@@ w@@ ich aw@@ es@@ ome ?"
How about that par@@ king space ? W@@ as that aw@@ es@@ ome ?
O@@ r that ga@@ me the other day ? W@@ as that aw@@ es@@ ome ?
"The answer is no , no and no ."
"A san@@ d@@ w@@ ich can be del@@ ici@@ ous , that par@@ king space can be ne@@ ar@@ by , and that ga@@ me can be a b@@ low@@ out , but not everything can be aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"There &apos;s no d@@ y@@ na@@ mic , there &apos;s no high@@ s or lo@@ ws , if everything is aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ dies and gen@@ t@@ l@@ em@@ en , here are 10 things that are tr@@ ul@@ y aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"Y@@ es , so I think I &apos;ll inv@@ ent the whe@@ el ."
"The whe@@ el , la@@ dies and gen@@ t@@ l@@ em@@ en ."

It &apos;s just like that .
"But it &apos;s not like a f@@ lower can just get up and have sex with another f@@ lower , al@@ though that would be aw@@ es@@ ome ."
( Laughter ) B@@ e@@ es are aw@@ es@@ ome . A@@ re you kid@@ ding me ?

I will sa@@ ve you the time .
"I &apos;m D@@ r@@ . D@@ av@@ id H@@ ans@@ on , and I build rob@@ ots with charac@@ ter ."
"And by that , I mean that I devel@@ op rob@@ ots that are charac@@ ters , but also rob@@ ots that will even@@ tually come to em@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with you ."
"So we &apos;re starting with a vari@@ ety of tech@@ nologi@@ es that have con@@ ver@@ g@@ ed into these con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tional charac@@ ter rob@@ ots that can see fac@@ es , make ey@@ e cont@@ act with you , make a ful@@ l ran@@ ge of f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions , understand spe@@ ec@@ h and be@@ gin to mo@@ del how you &apos;re feel@@ ing and who you are , and build a relation@@ ship with you ."
"I develop@@ ed a ser@@ ies of tech@@ nologi@@ es that al@@ lowed the rob@@ ots to make more real@@ is@@ tic f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions than pre@@ vi@@ ously achi@@ ev@@ ed , on lower power , which en@@ ab@@ led the wal@@ king bi@@ ped rob@@ ots , the first an@@ dro@@ id@@ s ."

"One is h@@ ier@@ arch@@ ical por@@ es , and the other is a ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ ar n@@ an@@ os@@ cal@@ e po@@ ro@@ sity in the material ."
There he &apos;s starting to wal@@ k .
This is at the K@@ or@@ e@@ an A@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ced In@@ st@@ it@@ ute of S@@ ci@@ ence and Te@@ ch@@ nolo@@ gy .
I built the head . They built the body .
"So the go@@ al here is to achi@@ eve senti@@ ence in ma@@ chin@@ es , and not just senti@@ ence , but em@@ pa@@ thy ."
We &apos;re working with the M@@ ach@@ ine P@@ er@@ cep@@ tion L@@ ab@@ o@@ rat@@ ory at the U.@@ C@@ . S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go .
"They have this really re@@ mark@@ able f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion technology that reco@@ gni@@ z@@ es f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions , what f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions you &apos;re making ."
"It also reco@@ gni@@ z@@ es where you &apos;re looking , your head ori@@ ent@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re em@@ ul@@ ating all the maj@@ or f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions , and then contro@@ l@@ ling it with the sof@@ tw@@ are that we call the Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter En@@ g@@ ine ."
And here is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s inv@@ ol@@ ved in that .
"In fact , right now — pl@@ u@@ g it from here , and then pl@@ u@@ g it in here , and now let &apos;s see if it gets my f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions ."
O@@ kay . So I &apos;m s@@ mil@@ ing .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;m f@@ ro@@ w@@ ning .
And this is really he@@ av@@ ily bac@@ kl@@ it .
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"O@@ h , it &apos;s so sad ."
"O@@ kay , so you s@@ mil@@ e , f@@ ro@@ w@@ ning ."
So his per@@ cep@@ tion of your emo@@ tional st@@ ates is very important for ma@@ chin@@ es to effec@@ ti@@ vely become em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic .
M@@ ach@@ ines are becom@@ ing dev@@ as@@ t@@ at@@ ing@@ ly cap@@ able of things like k@@ il@@ ling . R@@ ight ?
Th@@ ose ma@@ chin@@ es have no place for em@@ pa@@ thy .
And there is bil@@ lions of dollars being sp@@ ent on that .
Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter rob@@ ot@@ ics could pl@@ ant the se@@ ed for rob@@ ots that actually have em@@ pa@@ thy .
"So , if they achi@@ eve human level intelligence or , quite possi@@ bly , gre@@ ater than human lev@@ els of intelligence , this could be the se@@ ed@@ s of hope for our future ."
"So , we &apos;ve made 20 rob@@ ots in the last eight years , d@@ uring the course of getting my P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ ."
"And then I started H@@ ans@@ on R@@ ob@@ ot@@ ics , which has been develop@@ ing these things for mass man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing ."
This is one of our rob@@ ots that we sho@@ wed at W@@ i@@ red N@@ ext@@ F@@ est a couple of years ago .
"And it se@@ es mul@@ ti@@ ple people in a scen@@ e , remem@@ bers where individ@@ ual people are , and looks from person to person , remem@@ ber@@ ing people ."
"So , we &apos;re inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ing two things ."
"One , the per@@ cep@@ tion of people , and two , the natural inter@@ face , the natural form of the inter@@ face , so that it &apos;s more in@@ tu@@ itive for you to inter@@ act with the rob@@ ot ."
You start to believe that it &apos;s al@@ ive and aw@@ are .
"So one of my fav@@ or@@ ite pro@@ jects was br@@ ing@@ ing all this stuff together in an art@@ is@@ tic dis@@ play of an an@@ dro@@ id port@@ ra@@ it of sci@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ fic@@ tion writ@@ er P@@ h@@ il@@ i@@ p K@@ .

"So we put his writ@@ ings , l@@ et@@ ters , his inter@@ vie@@ ws , cor@@ respon@@ den@@ ces , into a huge da@@ t@@ ab@@ ase of thousands of p@@ ages , and then used some natural language proc@@ ess@@ ing to al@@ low you to actually have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with him ."
"And it was kind of spo@@ o@@ k@@ y , because he would say these things that just s@@ oun@@ ded like they really underst@@ ood you ."
"And this is one of the most exc@@ iting pro@@ jects that we &apos;re develop@@ ing , which is a little charac@@ ter that &apos;s a spo@@ k@@ es@@ b@@ ot for fri@@ end@@ ly ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence , fri@@ end@@ ly machine intelligence ."

There is nothing big@@ ger or ol@@ der than the universe .
"The questions I would like to talk about are : one , where did we come from ?"
How did the universe come into being ?
A@@ re we al@@ one in the universe ?
I@@ s there ali@@ en life out there ?
What is the future of the human ra@@ ce ?
"@@ U@@ p until the 19@@ 20@@ s , everyone thought the universe was essenti@@ ally st@@ ati@@ c and un@@ chang@@ ing in time ."
Th@@ en it was discover@@ ed that the universe was exp@@ anding .
D@@ ist@@ ant galaxies were mov@@ ing away from us .
This me@@ ant they must have been clo@@ s@@ er together in the past .
"If we ex@@ tra@@ pol@@ ate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago ."
"This was the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g , the beginning of the universe ."
But was there anything before the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g ?
"If not , what created the universe ?"
Why did the universe em@@ er@@ ge from the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g the way it did ?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be d@@ ivid@@ ed into two parts .
"F@@ ir@@ st , there were the laws like M@@ ax@@ well &apos;s equ@@ ations and gener@@ al rel@@ ati@@ vity that de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the evolution of the universe , given its state over all of space at one time ."
"And second , there was no question of the in@@ it@@ ial state of the universe ."
"We have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extre@@ me con@@ dit@@ ions ."
"But until rec@@ ently , we have had little idea about the in@@ it@@ ial con@@ dit@@ ions for the universe ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , this div@@ ision into laws of evolution and in@@ it@@ ial con@@ dit@@ ions de@@ pen@@ ds on time and space being se@@ par@@ ate and dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ."
"@@ Un@@ der extre@@ me con@@ dit@@ ions , gener@@ al rel@@ ati@@ vity and quan@@ tum theory al@@ low time to be@@ have like another dimen@@ sion of space ."
"This re@@ mov@@ es the dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also de@@ ter@@ mine the in@@ it@@ ial state ."
The universe can s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously create itself out of nothing .
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , we can cal@@ cul@@ ate a prob@@ ability that the universe was created in different st@@ ates ."
"Th@@ ese predic@@ tions are in ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ag@@ re@@ ement with observ@@ ations by the W@@ M@@ A@@ P sa@@ tel@@ lit@@ e of the co@@ s@@ mic m@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground , which is an im@@ prin@@ t of the very early universe ."
We think we have sol@@ ved the my@@ ster@@ y of cre@@ ation .
Ma@@ ybe we should pat@@ ent the universe and ch@@ arg@@ e everyone ro@@ y@@ al@@ ties for their ex@@ ist@@ ence .
"I now turn to the second big question : are we al@@ one , or is there other life in the universe ?"
"We believe that life ar@@ ose s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously on the Earth , so it must be possible for life to ap@@ pe@@ ar on other su@@ it@@ able plan@@ ets , of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy ."
But we don &apos;t know how life first ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
We have two pi@@ ec@@ es of observ@@ ational evidence on the prob@@ ability of life ap@@ pe@@ aring .
The first is that we have f@@ os@@ s@@ ils of al@@ ga@@ e from 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years ago .
The Earth was form@@ ed 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years ago and was probably too h@@ ot for about the first half billion years .
"So life ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible , which is shor@@ t com@@ par@@ ed to the 1@@ 0-@@ bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ year li@@ fe@@ time of a planet of Earth typ@@ e ."
This su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that the prob@@ ability of life ap@@ pe@@ aring is reas@@ on@@ ably high .
"If it was very low , one would have expec@@ ted it to take most of the ten billion years av@@ a@@ il@@ able ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we don &apos;t seem to have been vis@@ ited by ali@@ ens ."
I am dis@@ coun@@ ting the re@@ por@@ ts of U@@ F@@ O@@ s .
Why would they ap@@ pe@@ ar only to c@@ ran@@ ks and we@@ ir@@ do@@ s ?
"If there is a government con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy to sup@@ pres@@ s the re@@ por@@ ts and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the ali@@ ens bring , it seems to have been a sin@@ gul@@ arly in@@ effec@@ tive pol@@ ic@@ y so far ."
"F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , des@@ p@@ ite an ex@@ ten@@ sive se@@ arch by the S@@ E@@ T@@ I pro@@ ject , we hav@@ en &apos;t heard any ali@@ en tel@@ ev@@ ision qu@@ i@@ z sho@@ ws ."
This probably ind@@ ic@@ ates that there are no ali@@ en civiliz@@ ations at our stage of develop@@ ment within a radi@@ us of a few hundred light years .
This br@@ ings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human ra@@ ce .
"If we are the only intelli@@ gent be@@ ings in the galaxy , we should make sure we surv@@ ive and contin@@ ue ."
But we are en@@ ter@@ ing an increas@@ ing@@ ly dan@@ ger@@ ous peri@@ od of our history .
But our gen@@ e@@ tic cod@@ e still car@@ ri@@ es the sel@@ f@@ ish and ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts that were of surviv@@ al adv@@ ant@@ age in the past .
"O@@ ur only chan@@ ce of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m surviv@@ al is not to re@@ ma@@ in in@@ war@@ d@@ -@@ looking on planet Earth , but to sp@@ read out into space ."
The ans@@ w@@ ers to these big questions show that we have made re@@ mark@@ able progress in the last hundred years .
"But if we want to contin@@ ue be@@ y@@ ond the next hundred years , our future is in space ."
All of my life I have s@@ ou@@ ght to understand the universe and find ans@@ w@@ ers to these questions .
I have been very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y that my disa@@ bility has not been a ser@@ ious h@@ and@@ ic@@ a@@ p .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pur@@ su@@ e the qu@@ est for knowledge ."
"The ul@@ ti@@ mate go@@ al is a complet@@ e theory of the universe , and we are making good progress ."
Thank you for list@@ en@@ ing .
"@@ Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , if you had to gu@@ ess ei@@ ther way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are al@@ one in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , as a civiliz@@ ation of our level of intelligence or high@@ er ?"
"This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an in@@ sight into the incredi@@ ble act of gener@@ os@@ ity this whole talk was for TE@@ D ."
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king : I think it quite likely that we are the only civiliz@@ ation within s@@ ever@@ al hundred light years ; o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise we would have heard radi@@ o w@@ aves .
"The al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive is that civiliz@@ ations don &apos;t last very long , but des@@ tro@@ y themselves ."
"C@@ A : P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or H@@ aw@@ king , th@@ ank you for that answer ."
"We will take it as a sal@@ ut@@ ary war@@ ning , I think , for the rest of our con@@ fer@@ ence this week ."
"P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , we really th@@ ank you for the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ef@@ for@@ t you made to share your questions with us today ."
Thank you very much inde@@ ed .

Here &apos;s a question we need to re@@ think together : What should be the ro@@ le of money and mar@@ ket@@ s in our societies ?
"@@ To@@ day , there are very few things that money can &apos;t buy ."
"If you &apos;re s@@ ent@@ en@@ ced to a j@@ a@@ il ter@@ m in S@@ an@@ ta B@@ ar@@ b@@ ara , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , you should know that if you don &apos;t like the stan@@ dar@@ d ac@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ tions , you can buy a pris@@ on c@@ ell up@@ gra@@ de ."
"It &apos;s true . F@@ or how much , do you think ?"
What would you gu@@ ess ?
F@@ ive hundred dollars ?
It &apos;s not the R@@ it@@ z@@ -@@ C@@ ar@@ l@@ ton . It &apos;s a j@@ a@@ il !
E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ two dollars a night . E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ two dollars a night .
If you go to an am@@ us@@ ement par@@ k
"@@ and don &apos;t want to st@@ and in the long lin@@ es for the popul@@ ar r@@ ides , there is now a solu@@ tion ."
"In many the@@ me par@@ ks , you can pa@@ y extra to j@@ um@@ p to the head of the line ."
They call them F@@ ast Tra@@ c@@ k or V@@ I@@ P tic@@ ket@@ s .
And this isn &apos;t only happening in am@@ us@@ ement par@@ ks .
"In W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , long lin@@ es , qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes form for important Con@@ g@@ res@@ sion@@ al he@@ ar@@ ings ."
"Now some people don &apos;t like to wa@@ it in long qu@@ e@@ ues , maybe over@@ night , even in the ra@@ in ."
"So now , for lob@@ b@@ y@@ ists and others who are very ke@@ en to att@@ end these he@@ ar@@ ings but don &apos;t like to wa@@ it , there are compan@@ ies , lin@@ e-@@ st@@ anding compan@@ ies , and you can go to them ."
"You can pa@@ y them a certain amount of money , they h@@ ire h@@ om@@ el@@ ess people and others who need a job to st@@ and wa@@ iting in the line for as long as it takes , and the lob@@ b@@ y@@ ist , just before the he@@ aring begin@@ s , can take his or her place at the head of the line and a se@@ at in the front of the room ."
P@@ a@@ id line st@@ anding .
"It &apos;s happening , the re@@ course to market me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms and market thinking and market solu@@ tions , in big@@ ger ar@@ en@@ as ."
T@@ ake the way we fi@@ ght our w@@ ars .
"D@@ id you know that , in I@@ ra@@ q and A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , there were more p@@ riv@@ ate mil@@ it@@ ary con@@ trac@@ tors on the ground than there were U.@@ S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary tro@@ op@@ s ?"
"Now this isn &apos;t because we had a public deb@@ ate about whether we wanted to outs@@ our@@ ce war to p@@ riv@@ ate compan@@ ies , but this is what has happened ."
"O@@ ver the past three dec@@ ades , we have liv@@ ed through a qu@@ iet revolu@@ tion ."
We &apos;ve d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted almost without real@@ iz@@ ing it from having a market econom@@ y to becom@@ ing market societies .
"The difference is this : A market econom@@ y is a to@@ ol , a val@@ u@@ able and effec@@ tive to@@ ol , for organiz@@ ing produc@@ tive acti@@ vity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sa@@ le ."
"It &apos;s a way of life , in which market thinking and market val@@ ues be@@ gin to domin@@ ate every as@@ p@@ ect of life : person@@ al rel@@ ations , family life , health , education , polit@@ ics , la@@ w , civ@@ ic life ."
"Now , why wor@@ ry ? Why wor@@ ry about our becom@@ ing market societies ?"
"For two reas@@ ons , I think ."
One of them has to do with in@@ equality .
"The more things money can buy , the more af@@ flu@@ ence , or the l@@ ack of it , mat@@ ters ."
"If the only thing that money de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed was acc@@ ess to y@@ ach@@ ts or f@@ an@@ cy v@@ ac@@ ations or B@@ M@@ W@@ s , then in@@ equality wouldn &apos;t matter very much ."
"But when money comes increas@@ ing@@ ly to gover@@ n acc@@ ess to the essenti@@ als of the good life — de@@ cent health care , acc@@ ess to the best education , political vo@@ ice and in@@ flu@@ ence in cam@@ pa@@ ign@@ s — when money comes to gover@@ n all of those things , in@@ equality mat@@ ters a great de@@ al ."
And so the mar@@ ke@@ ti@@ z@@ ation of everything shar@@ pen@@ s the st@@ ing of in@@ equality and its social and civ@@ ic con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence .
That &apos;s one reason to wor@@ ry .
"There &apos;s a second reason ap@@ art from the wor@@ ry about in@@ equality , and it &apos;s this : with some social go@@ ods and prac@@ tic@@ es , when market thinking and market val@@ ues en@@ ter , they may change the mean@@ ing of those prac@@ tic@@ es and c@@ ro@@ w@@ d out at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es and nor@@ ms wor@@ th car@@ ing about ."
"I &apos;d like to take an example of a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al use of a market me@@ chan@@ ism , a cas@@ h in@@ cen@@ tive , and see what you think about it ."
"M@@ any scho@@ ols st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle with the challenge of mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ating kids , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally kids from disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ ag@@ ed bac@@ k@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , to study hard , to do well in school , to app@@ ly themselves ."
S@@ ome econom@@ ists have pro@@ posed a market solu@@ tion : O@@ f@@ fer cas@@ h in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves to kids for getting good grad@@ es or high test sc@@ or@@ es or for read@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks .
"They &apos;ve tri@@ ed this , actually ."
They &apos;ve done some experim@@ ents in some maj@@ or American c@@ ities .
"In New Y@@ or@@ k , in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , they &apos;ve tri@@ ed this , of@@ fer@@ ing 50 dollars for an A , 3@@ 5 dollars for a B@@ ."
"In D@@ all@@ as , T@@ ex@@ as , they have a program that of@@ fer@@ s e@@ igh@@ t-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds two dollars for each book they read ."
"So let &apos;s see what — S@@ ome people are in fav@@ or , some people are op@@ posed to this cas@@ h in@@ cen@@ tive to mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ate achi@@ ev@@ ement ."
Let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that you are the head of a maj@@ or school system , and someone comes to you with this pro@@ po@@ sal ."
And let &apos;s say it &apos;s a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion . They will pro@@ v@@ ide the fun@@ ds .
You don &apos;t have to take it out of your b@@ ud@@ get .
How many would be in fav@@ or and how many would be op@@ posed to giving it a try ?
Let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
"F@@ ir@@ st , how many think it might at le@@ ast be wor@@ th a try to see if it would work ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"And how many would be op@@ posed ? How many would — So the maj@@ or@@ ity here are op@@ posed , but a si@@ z@@ able min@@ or@@ ity are in fav@@ or ."
Let &apos;s have a disc@@ us@@ sion .
"@@ Let &apos;s start with those of you who object , who would rul@@ e it out even before trying ."
What would be your reason ?
Wh@@ o will get our disc@@ us@@ sion started ? Y@@ es ?
"H@@ e@@ ik@@ e M@@ os@@ es : H@@ el@@ lo everyone , I &apos;m H@@ e@@ ik@@ e , and I think it just k@@ il@@ ls the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation , so in the res@@ p@@ ect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this in@@ cen@@ tive away in just pa@@ ying them , so it just changes behavior ."
M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ an@@ del : T@@ ak@@ es the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c in@@ cen@@ tive away .
"What is , or should be , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation ?"
"H@@ M : Well , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation should be to learn ."
M@@ S : To learn . H@@ M : To get to know the world .
"And then , if you stop pa@@ ying them , what happens then ?"
Th@@ en they stop read@@ ing ?
"M@@ S : Now , let &apos;s see if there &apos;s someone who fav@@ ors , who thin@@ ks it &apos;s wor@@ th trying this ."
"E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h L@@ of@@ t@@ us : I &apos;m E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h L@@ of@@ t@@ us , and you said wor@@ th a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?"
M@@ S : And measure . And what would you measure ?
You &apos;d measure how many — E@@ L : How many bo@@ o@@ ks they read and how many bo@@ o@@ ks they contin@@ u@@ ed to read after you st@@ op@@ ped pa@@ ying them .
"M@@ S : O@@ h , after you st@@ op@@ ped pa@@ ying ."
"A@@ ll right , what about that ?"
"H@@ M : To be fr@@ ank , I just think this is , not to off@@ end any@@ one , a very American way ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) M@@ S : All right . What &apos;s em@@ er@@ g@@ ed from this disc@@ us@@ sion is the fol@@ lowing question : W@@ ill the cas@@ h in@@ cen@@ tive dr@@ ive out or cor@@ ru@@ pt or c@@ ro@@ w@@ d out the high@@ er mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c les@@ son that we hope to con@@ v@@ ey , which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sak@@ es ?"
"And people disa@@ gre@@ e about what the ef@@ fect will be , but that seems to be the question , that some@@ how a market me@@ chan@@ ism or a cas@@ h in@@ cen@@ tive teach@@ es the wrong les@@ son , and if it does , what will become of these children later ?"
I should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experim@@ ents .
"The cas@@ h for good grad@@ es has had very mi@@ x@@ ed results , for the most part has not res@@ ul@@ ted in high@@ er grad@@ es ."
The two dollars for each book did le@@ ad those kids to read more bo@@ o@@ ks .
It also led them to read shor@@ ter bo@@ o@@ ks .
"( Laughter ) But the real question is , what will become of these kids later ?"
"W@@ ill they have learned that read@@ ing is a ch@@ ore , a form of pi@@ ec@@ e@@ work to be done for pa@@ y , that &apos;s the wor@@ ry , or may it le@@ ad them to read maybe for the wrong reason in@@ it@@ i@@ ally but then le@@ ad them to f@@ all in love with read@@ ing for its own sa@@ ke ?"
"Now , what this , even this bri@@ ef deb@@ ate , br@@ ings out is something that many econom@@ ists over@@ look ."
"E@@ con@@ om@@ ists often as@@ su@@ me that mar@@ ket@@ s are in@@ ert , that they do not tou@@ ch or ta@@ in@@ t the go@@ ods they ex@@ change ."
"M@@ ar@@ k@@ et ex@@ change , they as@@ su@@ me , doesn &apos;t change the mean@@ ing or value of the go@@ ods being ex@@ changed ."
"If you s@@ ell me a fl@@ at scre@@ en tel@@ ev@@ ision or give me one as a gi@@ ft , it will be the same good ."
It will work the same ei@@ ther way .
But the same may not be true if we &apos;re talking about n@@ on@@ material go@@ ods and social prac@@ tic@@ es such as teach@@ ing and learning or en@@ gag@@ ing together in civ@@ ic life .
"In those do@@ ma@@ ins , br@@ ing@@ ing market me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms and cas@@ h in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves may under@@ mine or c@@ ro@@ w@@ d out n@@ on@@ market val@@ ues and at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es wor@@ th car@@ ing about ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we see that mar@@ ket@@ s and com@@ mer@@ ce , when ex@@ ten@@ ded be@@ y@@ ond the material do@@ ma@@ in , can change the charac@@ ter of the go@@ ods themselves , can change the mean@@ ing of the social prac@@ tic@@ es , as in the example of teach@@ ing and learning , we have to ask where mar@@ ket@@ s bel@@ ong and where they don &apos;t , where they may actually under@@ mine val@@ ues and at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es wor@@ th car@@ ing about ."
"But to have this deb@@ ate , we have to do something we &apos;re not very good at , and that is to reason together in public about the value and the mean@@ ing of the social prac@@ tic@@ es we pri@@ ze , from our bo@@ dies to family life to person@@ al rel@@ ations to health to teach@@ ing and learning to civ@@ ic life ."
"Now these are contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al questions , and so we t@@ end to sh@@ r@@ ink from them ."
"In fact , d@@ uring the past three dec@@ ades , when market reas@@ on@@ ing and market thinking have ga@@ ther@@ ed force and ga@@ ined pres@@ ti@@ ge , our public dis@@ course d@@ uring this time has become hol@@ lowed out , emp@@ ty of larg@@ er moral mean@@ ing ."
"For fear of disa@@ gre@@ ement , we sh@@ r@@ ink from these questions ."
"But once we see that mar@@ ket@@ s change the charac@@ ter of go@@ ods , we have to deb@@ ate amo@@ n@@ g ourselves these big@@ ger questions about how to value go@@ ods ."
"One of the most cor@@ ro@@ sive effec@@ ts of put@@ ting a pr@@ ice on everything is on com@@ mon@@ ality , the sense that we are all in it together ."
"A@@ ga@@ inst the bac@@ k@@ ground of ris@@ ing in@@ equality , mar@@ ke@@ ti@@ z@@ ing every as@@ p@@ ect of life lead@@ s to a con@@ d@@ ition where those who are af@@ flu@@ ent and those who are of mod@@ est means increas@@ ing@@ ly live se@@ par@@ ate lives ."
We live and work and sho@@ p and play in different places .
O@@ ur children go to different scho@@ ols .
"This isn &apos;t good for democra@@ cy , n@@ or is it a sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying way to live , even for those of us who can af@@ for@@ d to buy our way to the head of the line ."
Here &apos;s why .
"D@@ emo@@ cra@@ cy does not requ@@ ire per@@ fect equality , but what it does requ@@ ire is that c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens share in a common life ."
And this is how we come to care for the common good .
"And so , in the end , the question of mar@@ ket@@ s is not main@@ ly an economic question ."
It &apos;s really a question of how we want to live together .
"@@ Do we want a society where everything is up for sa@@ le , or are there certain moral and civ@@ ic go@@ ods that mar@@ ket@@ s do not h@@ on@@ or and money cannot buy ?"
Thank you very much .

S@@ ome of those re@@ for@@ ms have been good .

We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one in this room has been af@@ fec@@ ted by a teacher or an ad@@ ult .

D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t it feel good to say it out l@@ ou@@ d ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the ro@@ le of social mov@@ em@@ ents in cre@@ ating change in M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ or@@ ity societies ."
"So let me be@@ gin by first of all giving a very , very bri@@ ef history of time , if I may ind@@ ul@@ ge ."
I@@ n medi@@ ev@@ al societies there were defin@@ ed al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces .
A@@ n id@@ ent@@ ity was defin@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily by relig@@ ion .
"In the age of globaliz@@ ation , we mov@@ ed on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re mov@@ ing into a new age , and that age The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es d@@ ub@@ bed rec@@ ently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavior . &quot; &quot; How I defin@@ e the age of behavior is a peri@@ od of trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , where id@@ ent@@ ity is defin@@ ed more so by ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves ."
"But actually it &apos;s my beli@@ ef that the people who &apos;ve been tr@@ ul@@ y cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until rec@@ ent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing most on the age of behavior and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , using dig@@ ital acti@@ vis@@ m and other sor@@ ts of bor@@ der@@ less tech@@ nologi@@ es , those who &apos;ve been ben@@ ef@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mis@@ ts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to el@@ ab@@ o@@ rate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was inv@@ ol@@ ved in an extre@@ me I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist organiz@@ ation ."
"And my story , my person@@ al story , is tr@@ ul@@ y evidence for the age of behavior that I &apos;m at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to el@@ ab@@ o@@ rate u@@ po@@ n here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ sex lad , born and ra@@ ised in E@@ s@@ sex in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ iting people from C@@ am@@ br@@ id@@ ge Un@@ iver@@ sity to this organiz@@ ation ."
"Now that j@@ our@@ ney , and what took me from E@@ s@@ sex all the way across the world — by the way , we were l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing at democra@@ tic acti@@ vis@@ ts ."
We fel@@ t they were from the age of y@@ es@@ ter@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ ma@@ il from the extre@@ mis@@ t organiz@@ ation that I used .
"E@@ ven@@ tually I was det@@ ec@@ ted , of course , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my adv@@ ant@@ age was because I was within an extre@@ mis@@ t organiz@@ ation that was for@@ ced to think be@@ y@@ ond the con@@ fin@@ es of the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the stat@@ us qu@@ o and r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ed it ."
And it &apos;s not just I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ ts that did this .
A form of an@@ ti@@ -@@ I@@ sl@@ am r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic is also on the r@@ ise and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences that this is having is that it &apos;s af@@ fec@@ ting the political cli@@ mate across Eu@@ rop@@ e .
Because the In@@ tern@@ et and connec@@ tion tech@@ nologi@@ es are connec@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , mos@@ qu@@ e min@@ ar@@ ets are being ban@@ ned ."
"In others , ko@@ sh@@ er and hal@@ al me@@ at are being ban@@ ned , as we spe@@ ak ."
"And on the f@@ li@@ p side , we have trans@@ national I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ ts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ c@@ ket@@ s of par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al@@ ism that are being connec@@ ted in a way that makes them feel like they are main@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have fel@@ t is@@ ol@@ ated , until these sor@@ ts of tech@@ nologi@@ es came around and connec@@ ted them in a way that made them feel part of a larg@@ er ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far be@@ h@@ ind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
If any of you remem@@ bers the Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas D@@ ay bom@@ b p@@ lot : there &apos;s a man called An@@ war al@@ -@@ A@@ w@@ l@@ ak@@ i .
"As an American c@@ it@@ iz@@ en , e@@ th@@ n@@ ically a Y@@ em@@ eni , in h@@ id@@ ing curr@@ ently in Y@@ em@@ en , who insp@@ i@@ red a N@@ ig@@ er@@ ian , son of the head of N@@ ig@@ eria &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ ig@@ er@@ ian stud@@ ent stu@@ died in L@@ on@@ don , tra@@ ined in Y@@ em@@ en , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in A@@ m@@ ster@@ da@@ m to att@@ ack America ."
"The O@@ ld m@@ ent@@ ality with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ pres@@ ented by the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ing the power of trans@@ national social mov@@ em@@ ents , got left be@@ h@@ ind ."
And the Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas D@@ ay bom@@ ber almost suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed in att@@ ac@@ king the United States of America .
"A@@ ga@@ in with the example of the far right : that we find , i@@ ron@@ ically , x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ ob@@ ic na@@ tion@@ al@@ ists are ut@@ iliz@@ ing the ben@@ ef@@ its of globaliz@@ ation ."
So why are they suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing ?
And why are democra@@ cy as@@ pir@@ an@@ ts f@@ all@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social mov@@ em@@ ents who understand this .
"And a social mov@@ ement is com@@ pris@@ ed , in my view , it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of four ma@@ in charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
It &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and sym@@ b@@ ols and lead@@ ers .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aw@@ are of , and that &apos;s the example of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately ."
"I@@ n@@ c@@ id@@ ent@@ ally , the difference between ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves : the idea is the cause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the nar@@ ra@@ tive is the way to s@@ ell that cause — the pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da come to your mind im@@ medi@@ ately .
One of their lead@@ ers was k@@ il@@ led in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan rec@@ ently .
And that &apos;s the power of social mov@@ em@@ ents .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to foc@@ us curr@@ ently on P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan , and I ask you to think of the sym@@ b@@ ols and the lead@@ ers for democra@@ cy in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think be@@ y@@ ond perhaps the as@@ sas@@ sin@@ ation of B@@ en@@ az@@ ir B@@ h@@ ut@@ to ."
"Wh@@ ich means , by defin@@ ition , that particular lead@@ er no longer ex@@ ists ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no globaliz@@ ed , y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led , gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots social mov@@ em@@ ents adv@@ oc@@ ating for democra@@ tic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ or@@ ity societies ."
"There is no equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of the A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da , without the ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , for democra@@ cy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ or@@ ity societies ."
So that be@@ gs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s compl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy ."
And that level of compl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy means they don &apos;t feel the need to adv@@ oc@@ ate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness ."
That we have a h@@ es@@ it@@ ation in es@@ po@@ using the univer@@ sal@@ ity of democra@@ tic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the univer@@ sal@@ ity of our val@@ ues — with extre@@ mis@@ ts .
"Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ gh@@ ts , we do say that human ri@@ gh@@ ts are univer@@ sal ."
But actually going out to pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ te that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with ei@@ ther ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ vis@@ m or with I@@ sl@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m .
To go around saying that I believe democra@@ tic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ riv@@ ed at as a form of political organiz@@ ing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extre@@ mis@@ m .
"And then you have a third par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ot@@ e for us ; we &apos;ll est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish a the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a res@@ ult of this is , when those par@@ ties are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they fa@@ il , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they make political mis@@ takes , democra@@ cy takes the bl@@ ame for their political mis@@ takes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tri@@ ed democra@@ cy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s bre@@ ak down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"A@@ nec@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can demon@@ st@@ rate that if pov@@ ert@@ y was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en is from one of the ri@@ ch@@ est famil@@ ies in S@@ au@@ di A@@ ra@@ b@@ ia ."
"H@@ is de@@ put@@ y , A@@ y@@ man al@@ -@@ Z@@ a@@ wa@@ h@@ iri , was a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ ian — not an ill@@ -@@ educ@@ ated man ."
"And what I believe is mis@@ sing is gen@@ u@@ ine gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots acti@@ vis@@ m on the ground , in ad@@ d@@ ition to inter@@ national a@@ id , in ad@@ d@@ ition to education , in ad@@ d@@ ition to health ."
"@@ Not ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive to these things , but in ad@@ d@@ ition to them , is pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ ting a gen@@ u@@ ine de@@ m@@ and for democra@@ cy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ at@@ ism had it up@@ s@@ ide@@ -@@ down .
N@@ e@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ at@@ ism had the philosoph@@ y that you go in with a sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ led appro@@ ach to im@@ pose democra@@ tic val@@ ues from the top down .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I@@ sl@@ am@@ ists and far@@ -@@ right organiz@@ ations , for dec@@ ades , have been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ as@@ s mov@@ em@@ ents in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan have been re@@ pres@@ ented after the A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pris@@ ings main@@ ly by organiz@@ ations cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing for some form of the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy , rather than for a democra@@ tic u@@ pris@@ ing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ par@@ tit@@ ion , they &apos;ve been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ ology on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led mov@@ ement that works to acti@@ vely adv@@ oc@@ ate for the democra@@ tic culture — which is nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is av@@ o@@ id the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where curr@@ ently we have political par@@ ties pres@@ ent@@ ing democra@@ cy as mer@@ ely a political cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ on@@ g@@ side other cho@@ ices such as mil@@ it@@ ary rul@@ e and the@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sl@@ ide here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ot@@ e in an ex@@ is@@ ting democra@@ cy , not for a democra@@ cy ."
"Now to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ g@@ yp@@ t is a good starting point ."
The A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pris@@ ings have demon@@ stra@@ ted that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pris@@ ings and what happened in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t was particul@@ arly ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one step be@@ y@@ ond that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a lead@@ er or rul@@ er or dic@@ t@@ at@@ or .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in P@@ ak@@ is@@ tan with a mov@@ ement called K@@ hu@@ di , where we are working on the ground to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the y@@ ou@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y-@@ in for the democra@@ tic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and th@@ ank you for your time ."
"B@@ ack in New Y@@ or@@ k , I am the head of develop@@ ment for a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood ."
"When I &apos;m not f@@ igh@@ ting pov@@ ert@@ y , I &apos;m f@@ igh@@ ting fir@@ es as the as@@ s@@ ist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fir@@ e compan@@ y ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers sup@@ pl@@ ement a high@@ ly sk@@ il@@ led career st@@ af@@ f , you have to get to the fir@@ e scen@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remember my first fir@@ e .
"I was the second vol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the scen@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real fo@@ ot@@ ra@@ ce against the other vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in ch@@ arg@@ e to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very en@@ gag@@ ing con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the wor@@ st days of her life ."
"@@ Here it was , the middle of the night , she was st@@ anding outside in the po@@ uring ra@@ in , under an um@@ br@@ el@@ la , in her pa@@ j@@ amas , b@@ are@@ fo@@ ot , while her h@@ ou@@ se was in fl@@ am@@ es ."
The other vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ riv@@ ed just before me — let &apos;s call him L@@ ex L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and sa@@ ve the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with j@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"@@ Here was some la@@ w@@ y@@ er or money man@@ ag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a b@@ urn@@ ing building to sa@@ ve a living cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain w@@ av@@ ed me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; B@@ ez@@ os , I need you to go into the h@@ ou@@ se ."
"I need you to go up@@ st@@ air@@ s , past the fir@@ e , and I need you to get this woman a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I s@@ we@@ ar ."
"So , not exactly what I was h@@ op@@ ing for , but off I went — up the st@@ air@@ s , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ f@@ igh@@ ters , who were pretty much done put@@ ting out the fir@@ e at this point , into the ma@@ st@@ er bed@@ room to get a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ri@@ ed my pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ st@@ air@@ s where I me@@ t my n@@ em@@ esis and the pre@@ ci@@ ous do@@ g by the front do@@ or .
"We took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner , where , not sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , his re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed much more at@@ ten@@ tion than did mine ."
"A few weeks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed a l@@ et@@ ter from the ho@@ me@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant ef@@ for@@ t dis@@ pla@@ yed in sav@@ ing her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she not@@ ed ab@@ ove all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
"( Laughter ) I@@ n both my v@@ oc@@ ation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ ghter , I am w@@ it@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ um@@ ental sc@@ ale , but I &apos;m also w@@ it@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gra@@ ce and cou@@ ra@@ ge on an individ@@ ual bas@@ is ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who ei@@ ther have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , re@@ mark@@ able lev@@ els of success , I would of@@ fer this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wa@@ it ."
D@@ on &apos;t wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve food at a s@@ ou@@ p kit@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od par@@ k .
B@@ e a m@@ ent@@ or .
"@@ Not every day is going to of@@ fer us a chan@@ ce to sa@@ ve somebody &apos;s life , but every day of@@ fer@@ s us an opportun@@ ity to af@@ fect one ."
So get in the ga@@ me . S@@ ave the sho@@ es .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ ani : Mar@@ k , Mar@@ k , come back . ( Applause )"
Mar@@ k B@@ ez@@ os : Thank you .
"@@ G@@ ood mor@@ ning everyone . F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s been f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic being here over these past few days ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , I feel it &apos;s a great h@@ on@@ or to kind of w@@ ind up this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ga@@ ther@@ ing of people , these amazing tal@@ ks that we &apos;ve had ."
"I feel that I &apos;ve f@@ it@@ ted in , in many ways , to some of the things that I &apos;ve heard ."
"I came direc@@ tly here from the de@@ ep , de@@ ep tro@@ p@@ ical ra@@ in@@ for@@ est in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , where I was out — you could only get there by a plan@@ e — with in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people with pain@@ t on their fac@@ es and par@@ rot fe@@ a@@ thers on their head@@ d@@ res@@ ses , where these people are f@@ igh@@ ting to try and keep the o@@ il compan@@ ies , and keep the ro@@ ad@@ s , out of their for@@ es@@ ts ."
"They &apos;re f@@ igh@@ ting to devel@@ op their own way of living within the for@@ est in a world that &apos;s c@@ le@@ an , a world that isn &apos;t cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated , a world that isn &apos;t pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ed ."
"And what was so amazing to me , and what f@@ its right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at TE@@ D , is that there , right in the middle of this ra@@ in@@ for@@ est , was some sol@@ ar pan@@ els — the first in that part of E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or — and that was main@@ ly to bring water up by p@@ um@@ p so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down ."
"The water was c@@ le@@ an@@ ed , but because they got a lot of b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies , they were able to stor@@ e a lot of elec@@ tric@@ ity ."
"So every h@@ ou@@ se — and there were , I think , eight h@@ ous@@ es in this little commun@@ ity — could have light for , I think it was about half an h@@ our each even@@ ing ."
"And there is the Ch@@ i@@ ef , in all his re@@ ga@@ l fin@@ er@@ y , with a l@@ ap@@ top computer ."
"( Laughter ) And this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s gone back , and he was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we have su@@ d@@ den@@ ly j@@ um@@ ped into a whole new er@@ a , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with l@@ ap@@ top comput@@ ers , and there are some things we want to learn from the moder@@ n world ."
We want to know about health care .
We want to know about what other people do — we &apos;re interes@@ ted in it .
And we want to learn other langu@@ ages .
"We want to know English and F@@ ren@@ ch and perhaps Ch@@ in@@ ese , and we &apos;re good at langu@@ ages . &quot; &quot; So there he is with his little l@@ ap@@ top computer , but f@@ igh@@ ting against the might of the pres@@ sur@@ es — because of the d@@ ebt , the for@@ e@@ ign d@@ ebt of E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or — f@@ igh@@ ting the pres@@ sure of W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , I@@ M@@ F , and of course the people who want to explo@@ it the for@@ es@@ ts and take out the o@@ il ."
"And so , coming direc@@ tly from there to here ."
"But , of course , my real field of exp@@ ert@@ ise li@@ es in an even different kind of civiliz@@ ation — I can &apos;t really call it a civiliz@@ ation ."
"A different way of life , a different being ."
We &apos;ve tal@@ ked ear@@ li@@ er — this wonderful talk by W@@ ade D@@ av@@ is about the different cul@@ tures of the hum@@ ans around the world — but the world is not com@@ posed only of human be@@ ings ; there are also other an@@ ima@@ l be@@ ings .
"And I pro@@ pose to bring into this TE@@ D con@@ fer@@ ence , as I always do around the world , the vo@@ ice of the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom ."
"@@ To@@ o often we just see a few sl@@ ides , or a bit of fil@@ m , but these be@@ ings have vo@@ ices that mean something ."
"And so , I want to give you a gre@@ et@@ ing , as from a ch@@ impanze@@ e in the for@@ es@@ ts of Tan@@ z@@ ania — O@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh , o@@ oh !@@ "
( Applause ) I &apos;ve been stud@@ ying ch@@ impanze@@ es in Tan@@ z@@ ania since 19@@ 60 .
"D@@ uring that time , there have been moder@@ n tech@@ nologi@@ es that have really trans@@ form@@ ed the way that field bi@@ olog@@ ists do their work ."
"For example , for the first time , a few years ago , by simply col@@ lec@@ ting little fec@@ al sam@@ pl@@ es we were able to have them anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed — to have D@@ N@@ A pro@@ fil@@ ing done — so for the first time , we actually know which mal@@ e ch@@ im@@ ps are the fa@@ thers of each individ@@ ual in@@ f@@ ant ."
Because the ch@@ im@@ ps have a very prom@@ is@@ cu@@ ous mat@@ ing society .
So this op@@ ens up a whole new av@@ en@@ ue of research .
"And we use G@@ S@@ I — ge@@ o@@ graph@@ ic wh@@ at@@ ever it is , G@@ S@@ I — to de@@ ter@@ mine the ran@@ ge of the ch@@ im@@ ps ."
And we &apos;re using — you can see that I &apos;m not really into this kind of stuff — but we &apos;re using sa@@ tel@@ lit@@ e imag@@ er@@ y to look at the de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the are@@ a .
"And of course , there &apos;s develop@@ ments in in@@ fr@@ ar@@ ed , so you can wat@@ ch an@@ im@@ als at night , and equ@@ ip@@ ment for rec@@ or@@ ding by video , and t@@ ap@@ e rec@@ or@@ ding is getting li@@ ghter and better ."
"So in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when I be@@ gan in 19@@ 60 ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally when ch@@ impanze@@ es , and other an@@ im@@ als with large bra@@ ins , are stu@@ died in cap@@ ti@@ vity , moder@@ n technology is hel@@ ping us to se@@ arch for the up@@ per lev@@ els of co@@ gn@@ ition in some of these n@@ on@@ -@@ human an@@ im@@ als ."
"So that we know today , they &apos;re cap@@ able of per@@ for@@ man@@ ces that would have been thought ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely im@@ possible by science when I be@@ gan ."
I think the ch@@ impanze@@ e in cap@@ ti@@ vity who is the most sk@@ il@@ led in intel@@ lec@@ tual per@@ for@@ man@@ ce is one called A@@ i in Jap@@ an — her name means love — and she has a wonder@@ fully sen@@ sit@@ ive par@@ t@@ ner working with her .
"She lo@@ ves her computer — she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her run@@ ning water , and her tre@@ es and everything ."
And she &apos;ll come in to s@@ it at this computer — it &apos;s like a video ga@@ me for a k@@ id ; she &apos;s ho@@ o@@ ked .
"She &apos;s 2@@ 8 , by the way , and she does things with her computer scre@@ en and a tou@@ ch p@@ ad that she can do fas@@ ter than most hum@@ ans ."
"She does very compl@@ ex t@@ as@@ ks , and I hav@@ en &apos;t got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this f@@ em@@ ale is she doesn &apos;t like making mis@@ takes ."
"If she has a bad run , and her sc@@ ore isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and re@@ ach up and ta@@ p on the gl@@ as@@ s — because she can &apos;t see the experim@@ en@@ ter — which is as@@ king to have another go ."
"And her con@@ cent@@ ration — she &apos;s already con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wan@@ ts to do it all over again , just for the sat@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of having done it better ."
"And the food is not important — she does get a tiny re@@ ward , like one ra@@ is@@ in for a cor@@ rec@@ t respon@@ se — but she will do it for nothing , if you tell her be@@ for@@ e@@ hand ."
"So here we are , a ch@@ impanze@@ e using a computer ."
"@@ Ch@@ impanze@@ es , g@@ or@@ ill@@ as , or@@ ang@@ ut@@ ans also learn human si@@ g@@ n language ."
"But the point is that when I was first in G@@ om@@ be in 19@@ 60 — I remember so well , so v@@ ivid@@ ly , as though it was y@@ es@@ ter@@ day — the first time , when I was going through the ve@@ g@@ et@@ ation , the ch@@ impanze@@ es were still run@@ ning away from me , for the most part , al@@ though some were a little bit acc@@ li@@ ma@@ ti@@ z@@ ed — and I saw this dark shap@@ e , h@@ un@@ ched over a ter@@ m@@ ite mo@@ und , and I pe@@ er@@ ed with my bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars ."
"It was , for@@ tun@@ ately , one ad@@ ult mal@@ e wh@@ om I &apos;d n@@ amed D@@ av@@ id Gre@@ y@@ be@@ ard — and by the way , science at that time was telling me that I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t name the ch@@ im@@ ps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , D@@ av@@ id Gre@@ y@@ be@@ ard — and I saw that he was pic@@ king little pi@@ ec@@ es of gra@@ ss and using them to f@@ ish ter@@ mit@@ es from their under@@ ground n@@ est ."
And not only that — he would sometimes pic@@ k a le@@ af@@ y tw@@ i@@ g and st@@ ri@@ p the le@@ aves — mo@@ dif@@ ying an object to make it su@@ it@@ able for a spec@@ if@@ ic pur@@ pose — the beginning of to@@ ol@@ -@@ making .
"The reason this was so exc@@ iting and such a bre@@ ak@@ through is at that time , it was thought that hum@@ ans , and only hum@@ ans , used and made to@@ ols ."
"When I was at school , we were defin@@ ed as man , the to@@ ol@@ mak@@ er ."
"So that when L@@ ou@@ is L@@ e@@ ak@@ ey , my m@@ ent@@ or , heard this news , he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ h , we must now re@@ defin@@ e &apos; man , &apos; re@@ defin@@ e &apos; to@@ ol , &apos; or ac@@ cept ch@@ impanze@@ es as hum@@ ans . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We now know that at G@@ om@@ be al@@ one , there are n@@ ine different ways in which ch@@ impanze@@ es use different ob@@ jects for different pur@@ pos@@ es ."
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , we know that in different parts of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , wh@@ er@@ ever ch@@ im@@ ps have been stu@@ died , there are completely different to@@ ol@@ -@@ using behav@@ i@@ ors ."
"And because it seems that these patterns are pas@@ sed from one gener@@ ation to the next , through observ@@ ation , im@@ it@@ ation and prac@@ ti@@ ce — that is a defin@@ ition of human culture ."
"What we find is that over these 4@@ 0-@@ od@@ d years that I and others have been stud@@ ying ch@@ impanze@@ es and the other great ap@@ es , and , as I say , other ma@@ m@@ m@@ als with compl@@ ex bra@@ ins and social syst@@ ems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a shar@@ p line d@@ ivid@@ ing hum@@ ans from the rest of the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom ."
It &apos;s a very w@@ uz@@ zy line .
"It &apos;s getting w@@ uz@@ z@@ ier all the time as we find an@@ im@@ als doing things that we , in our ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce , used to think was just human ."
"The ch@@ im@@ ps — there &apos;s no time to disc@@ us@@ s their fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating lives — but they have this long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , five years of suc@@ kl@@ ing and s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing with the mother , and then another three , four or five years of emo@@ tional de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce on her , even when the next child is born ."
"The import@@ ance of learning in that time , when behavior is f@@ le@@ x@@ ible — and there &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot to learn in ch@@ impanze@@ e society ."
"The lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m af@@ fec@@ tion@@ ate sup@@ por@@ tive b@@ on@@ ds that devel@@ op throu@@ gh@@ out this long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od with the mother , with the bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters , and which can last through a li@@ fe@@ time , which may be up to 60 years ."
"They can actually live longer than 60 in cap@@ ti@@ vity , so we &apos;ve only done 40 years in the w@@ il@@ d so far ."
And we find ch@@ im@@ ps are cap@@ able of true com@@ passion and al@@ tr@@ u@@ ism .
"We find in their n@@ on@@ -@@ ver@@ b@@ al commun@@ ic@@ ation — this is very r@@ ich — they have a lot of s@@ oun@@ ds , which they use in different cir@@ c@@ um@@ stan@@ ces , but they also use tou@@ ch , pos@@ ture , ges@@ ture , and what do they do ?"
They k@@ is@@ s ; they em@@ bra@@ ce ; they hold hands .
"They p@@ at one another on the back ; they s@@ w@@ ag@@ ger ; they sh@@ ake their f@@ ist — the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of cont@@ ex@@ t ."
They have very soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated co@@ oper@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times they h@@ un@@ t — not that often , but when they h@@ un@@ t , they show soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated co@@ oper@@ ation , and they share the pre@@ y ."
"We find that they show emo@@ tions , si@@ mil@@ ar to — maybe sometimes the same — as those that we descri@@ be in ourselves as happiness , sa@@ d@@ ness , fear , des@@ pa@@ ir ."
They know mental as well as physical suf@@ fer@@ ing .
"And I don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will pro@@ ve some of these things to you , sa@@ ve to say that there are very b@@ right students , in the best univer@@ s@@ ities , stud@@ ying emo@@ tions in an@@ im@@ als , stud@@ ying person@@ alit@@ ies in an@@ im@@ als ."
"We know that ch@@ impanze@@ es and some other cre@@ atures can reco@@ gni@@ ze themselves in mir@@ ro@@ r@@ s — &quot; &quot; self &quot; &quot; as op@@ posed to &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; They have a sense of hu@@ mo@@ r , and these are the kind of things which t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ ally have been thought of as human pr@@ er@@ o@@ ga@@ ti@@ ves ."
"But this teach@@ es us a new res@@ p@@ ect — and it &apos;s a new res@@ p@@ ect not only for the ch@@ impanze@@ es , I su@@ g@@ gest , but some of the other amazing an@@ im@@ als with wh@@ om we share this planet ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we &apos;re pre@@ par@@ ed to ad@@ mit that after all , we &apos;re not the only be@@ ings with person@@ alit@@ ies , min@@ ds and ab@@ ove all feel@@ ings , and then we start to think about ways we use and ab@@ use so many other senti@@ ent , sa@@ pi@@ ent cre@@ atures on this planet , it really giv@@ es cause for de@@ ep sh@@ ame , at le@@ ast for me ."
"So , the sad thing is that these ch@@ impanze@@ es — who &apos;ve perhaps t@@ au@@ ght us , more than any other cre@@ ature , a little hum@@ il@@ ity — are in the w@@ il@@ d , disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring very f@@ ast ."
They &apos;re disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring for the reas@@ ons that all of you in this room know only too well .
"The de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , the growth of human popul@@ ations , need@@ ing more land ."
They &apos;re disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring because some tim@@ ber compan@@ ies go in with c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut@@ ting .
They &apos;re disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring in the heart of their ran@@ ge in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a because the big mul@@ tin@@ ational log@@ ging compan@@ ies have come in and made ro@@ ad@@ s — as they want to do in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or and other parts where the for@@ es@@ ts re@@ ma@@ in un@@ tou@@ ched — to take out o@@ il or tim@@ ber .
"And this has led in Con@@ go bas@@ in , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush@@ -@@ me@@ at tra@@ de ."
"This means that al@@ though for hund@@ re@@ ds , perhaps thousands of years , people have liv@@ ed in those for@@ es@@ ts , or wh@@ at@@ ever h@@ ab@@ it@@ at it is , in har@@ mon@@ y with their world , just k@@ il@@ ling the an@@ im@@ als they need for themselves and their famil@@ ies — now , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , because of the ro@@ ad@@ s , the h@@ un@@ ters can go in from the to@@ w@@ n@@ s ."
"They sho@@ ot everything , every single thing that mov@@ es that &apos;s big@@ ger than a small rat ; they sun@@ -@@ d@@ ry it or smo@@ ke it ."
And now they &apos;ve got trans@@ port ; they take it on the log@@ ging tr@@ uc@@ ks or the min@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks into the to@@ w@@ n@@ s where they s@@ ell it .
"And people will pa@@ y more for bush@@ -@@ me@@ at , as it &apos;s called , than for dom@@ es@@ tic me@@ at — it &apos;s cul@@ tur@@ ally pre@@ fer@@ red ."
"And it &apos;s not su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , and the huge log@@ ging cam@@ ps in the for@@ est are now de@@ man@@ ding me@@ at , so the P@@ y@@ g@@ my h@@ un@@ ters in the Con@@ go bas@@ in who &apos;ve liv@@ ed there with their wonderful way of living for so many hund@@ re@@ ds of years are now cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ted ."
They &apos;re given we@@ a@@ pon@@ s ; they sho@@ ot for the log@@ ging cam@@ ps ; they get money .
"Th@@ e@@ ir culture is being des@@ tro@@ yed , along with the an@@ im@@ als u@@ po@@ n wh@@ om they de@@ p@@ end ."
"So , when the log@@ ging cam@@ p mov@@ es , there &apos;s nothing left ."
"We tal@@ ked already about the lo@@ ss of human cul@@ tu@@ ral d@@ iver@@ sity , and I &apos;ve seen it happening with my own ey@@ es ."
"And the g@@ ri@@ m picture in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a — I love A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and what do we see in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ?"
"We see de@@ for@@ est@@ ation ; we see the des@@ ert sp@@ read@@ ing ; we see massive h@@ un@@ ger ; we see disease and we see population growth in are@@ as where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possi@@ bly sup@@ port , and they &apos;re too po@@ or to buy food from el@@ se@@ where ."
"W@@ ere the people that we heard about y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , on the E@@ as@@ ter I@@ sl@@ and , who c@@ ut down their last t@@ ree — were they st@@ up@@ id ?"
D@@ id@@ n &apos;t they know what was happening ?
"O@@ f course , but if you &apos;ve seen the cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing pov@@ ert@@ y in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s leave the t@@ ree for to@@ mor@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How am I going to fe@@ ed my family today ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe I can get just a few dollars from this last t@@ ree which will keep us going a little bit longer , and then we &apos;ll pra@@ y that something will happen to sa@@ ve us from the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able end . &quot; &quot; So , this is a pretty g@@ ri@@ m picture ."
"The one thing we have , which makes us so different from ch@@ impanze@@ es or other living cre@@ atures , is this soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated spo@@ ken language — a language with which we can tell children about things that ar@@ en &apos;t here ."
"We can talk about the dis@@ t@@ ant past , pl@@ an for the dis@@ t@@ ant future , disc@@ us@@ s ideas with each other , so that the ideas can grow from the acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated w@@ is@@ dom of a group ."
We can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the writ@@ ten word .
"And we are ab@@ using this great power we have to be w@@ ise ste@@ wards , and we &apos;re des@@ tro@@ ying the world ."
"In the develop@@ ed world , in a way , it &apos;s wor@@ se , because we have so much acc@@ ess to knowledge of the st@@ up@@ id@@ ity of what we &apos;re doing ."
"@@ Do you know , we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing little b@@ ab@@ ies into a world where , in many places , the water is po@@ is@@ on@@ ing them ?"
"And the air is har@@ m@@ ing them , and the food that &apos;s gro@@ wn from the cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated land is po@@ is@@ on@@ ing them ."
And that &apos;s not just in the far@@ -@@ away develop@@ ing world ; that &apos;s every@@ where .
Do you know we all have about 50 chem@@ ic@@ als in our bo@@ dies we didn &apos;t have about 50 years ago ?
"And so many of these dis@@ eas@@ es , like as@@ th@@ ma and certain kinds of can@@ c@@ ers , are on the increase around places where our fil@@ thy to@@ x@@ ic was@@ te is d@@ um@@ ped ."
"We &apos;re har@@ m@@ ing ourselves around the world , as well as har@@ m@@ ing the an@@ im@@ als , as well as har@@ m@@ ing nature her@@ self — M@@ other N@@ ature , that b@@ rou@@ ght us into being ; M@@ other N@@ ature , where I believe we need to sp@@ end time , where there &apos;s tre@@ es and f@@ low@@ ers and bir@@ ds for our good psych@@ ological develop@@ ment ."
"And yet , there are hund@@ re@@ ds and hund@@ re@@ ds of children in the develop@@ ed world who never see nature , because they &apos;re gro@@ wing up in con@@ cre@@ te and all they know is vir@@ tual reality , with no opportun@@ ity to go and li@@ e in the su@@ n , or in the for@@ est , with the da@@ p@@ pl@@ ed sun@@ -@@ spec@@ ks coming down from the can@@ op@@ y ab@@ ove ."
"As I was tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing around the world , you know , I had to leave the for@@ est — that &apos;s where I love to be ."
"I had to leave these fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating ch@@ impanze@@ es for my students and field st@@ af@@ f to contin@@ ue stud@@ ying because , fin@@ ding they d@@ w@@ ind@@ led from about two million 100 years ago to about 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 now , I knew I had to leave the for@@ est to do what I could to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess around the world ."
"And the more I tal@@ ked about the ch@@ impanze@@ es &apos; p@@ light , the more I real@@ ized the fact that everything &apos;s inter@@ connec@@ ted , and the problems of the develop@@ ing world so often stem from the gre@@ ed of the develop@@ ed world , and everything was jo@@ ining together , and making — not sense , hope li@@ es in sense , you said — it &apos;s making a n@@ on@@ sense ."
How can we do it ?
S@@ omebody said that y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
"And as I was tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing around , I ke@@ pt me@@ et@@ ing young people who &apos;d lo@@ st hope ."
"They were feel@@ ing des@@ pa@@ ir , they were feel@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; e@@ at , dr@@ ink and be mer@@ ry , for to@@ mor@@ row we die ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is h@@ op@@ el@@ ess — we &apos;re always being told so by the me@@ dia . &quot; &quot; And then I me@@ t some who were an@@ gr@@ y , and an@@ ger that can turn to violence , and we &apos;re all famil@@ i@@ ar with that ."
"And I have three little grand@@ children , and when some of these students would say to me at high school or univer@@ sity , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; We &apos;re fil@@ led with des@@ pa@@ ir , because we feel you &apos;ve comp@@ rom@@ ised our future , and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot; &quot; And I looked in the ey@@ es of my little grand@@ children , and think how much we &apos;ve har@@ m@@ ed this planet since I was their age ."
"I feel this de@@ ep sh@@ ame , and that &apos;s why in 19@@ 9@@ 1 in Tan@@ z@@ ania , I started a program that &apos;s called R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots ."
"There &apos;s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , I be@@ g that you pic@@ k up that bro@@ ch@@ ure ."
And R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots is a program for hope .
R@@ o@@ ots make a fir@@ m f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion .
"S@@ ho@@ ots seem tiny , but to re@@ ach the su@@ n they can bre@@ ak through br@@ ic@@ k w@@ all@@ s ."
S@@ e@@ e the br@@ ic@@ k w@@ all@@ s as all the problems that we &apos;ve in@@ fl@@ ic@@ ted on this planet .
"Th@@ en , you see , it is a mes@@ sa@@ ge of hope ."
"H@@ und@@ re@@ ds and thousands of young people around the world can bre@@ ak through , and can make this a better world ."
And the most important mes@@ sa@@ ge of R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots is that every single individ@@ ual makes a difference .
E@@ very individ@@ ual has a ro@@ le to play .
"E@@ very one of us im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts the world around us every@@ day , and you scient@@ ists know that you can &apos;t actually — even if you st@@ ay in bed all day , you &apos;re bre@@ a@@ thing oxy@@ g@@ en and giving out C@@ O@@ 2 , and probably going to the lo@@ o , and things like that — you &apos;re making a difference in the world ."
"So , the R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots program inv@@ ol@@ ves y@@ ou@@ th in three kinds of pro@@ jects ."
And these are pro@@ jects to make the world around them a better place .
One pro@@ ject to show care and con@@ cer@@ n for your own human commun@@ ity .
"One for an@@ im@@ als , incl@@ ud@@ ing dom@@ es@@ tic an@@ im@@ als — and I have to say , I learned everything I know about an@@ ima@@ l behavior even before I got to G@@ om@@ be and the ch@@ im@@ ps from my do@@ g , R@@ ust@@ y , who was my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od compan@@ ion ."
And the third kind of pro@@ ject : something for the loc@@ al environ@@ ment .
"So what the kids do de@@ pen@@ ds first of all , how old are they — and we go now from pre@@ -@@ school right through univer@@ sity ."
It &apos;s going to de@@ p@@ end whether they &apos;re in@@ ner@@ -@@ c@@ ity or ru@@ ral .
It &apos;s going to de@@ p@@ end if they &apos;re we@@ al@@ thy or im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed .
"It &apos;s going to de@@ p@@ end which part , say , of America they &apos;re in ."
"We &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da are different from the problems in New Y@@ or@@ k ."
"It &apos;s going to de@@ p@@ end on which country they &apos;re in — and we &apos;re already in 6@@ 0-@@ pl@@ us countries , with about 5@@ ,000 ac@@ tive gro@@ ups — and there are gro@@ ups all over the place that I keep he@@ aring about that I &apos;ve never even heard of , because the kids are taking the program and sp@@ read@@ ing it themselves ."
Why ?
"Because they &apos;re bu@@ ying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to dec@@ ide what they &apos;re going to do ."
"It isn &apos;t something that their parents tell them , or their teachers tell them ."
"That &apos;s effec@@ tive , but if they dec@@ ide themselves , &quot; &quot; We want to c@@ le@@ an this riv@@ er and put the f@@ ish back that used to be there ."
We want to c@@ lear away the to@@ x@@ ic so@@ il from this are@@ a and have an organ@@ ic gar@@ den .
We want to go and sp@@ end time with the old people and hear their stories and rec@@ or@@ d their o@@ ral hist@@ or@@ ies .
We want to go and work in a do@@ g sh@@ el@@ ter .
"We want to learn about an@@ im@@ als . We want ... &quot; &quot; You know , it goes on and on , and this is very h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul for me ."
"As I tr@@ av@@ el around the world 3@@ 00 days a year , every@@ where there &apos;s a group of R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots of different ages ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ where there are children with shin@@ ing ey@@ es saying , &quot; L@@ o@@ ok at the difference we &apos;ve made . &quot;"
"And now comes the technology into it , because with this new way of commun@@ ic@@ ating elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ically these kids can commun@@ ic@@ ate with each other around the world ."
"And if any@@ one is interes@@ ted to help us , we &apos;ve got so many ideas but we need help — we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to commun@@ ic@@ ate their exc@@ it@@ ement ."
"But also — and this is so important — to commun@@ ic@@ ate their des@@ pa@@ ir , to say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tri@@ ed this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what sh@@ all we do ? &quot; &quot; And then , lo and be@@ hold , there &apos;s another group ans@@ wer@@ ing these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , saying , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; The philosoph@@ y is very simple ."
We do not believe in violence .
"@@ No violence , no bomb@@ s , no g@@ un@@ s ."
That &apos;s not the way to sol@@ ve problems .
"@@ V@@ i@@ ol@@ ence lead@@ s to violence , at le@@ ast in my view ."
So how do we sol@@ ve ?
The to@@ ols for sol@@ v@@ ing the problems are knowledge and understanding .
"@@ K@@ now the fac@@ ts , but see how they f@@ it in the big picture ."
H@@ ard work and per@@ s@@ ist@@ ence — don &apos;t give up — and love and com@@ passion lead@@ ing to res@@ p@@ ect for all life .
"@@ How many more minutes ? T@@ w@@ o , one ?"
Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : One — one to two .
"@@ J@@ ane G@@ o@@ od@@ all : T@@ w@@ o , two , I &apos;m going to take two ."
( Laughter ) A@@ re you going to come and dra@@ g me off ? ( Laughter )
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way — so basically , R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots is beginning to change young people &apos;s lives ."
It &apos;s what I &apos;m dev@@ ot@@ ing most of my energy to .
"And I believe that a group like this can have a very maj@@ or im@@ p@@ act , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children ."
"And if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good opportun@@ ity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you ."
And it &apos;s been so c@@ lear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .
It &apos;s very en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging .
"But the kids do ask me — and this won &apos;t take more than two minutes , I prom@@ ise — the kids say , &quot; &quot; D@@ r@@ . J@@ ane , do you really have hope for the future ?"
"You tr@@ av@@ el , you see all these hor@@ ri@@ ble things happening . &quot; &quot; F@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , the human brain — I don &apos;t need to say anything about that ."
"Now that we know what the problems are around the world , human bra@@ ins like your@@ s are ris@@ ing to sol@@ ve those problems ."
And we &apos;ve tal@@ ked a lot about that .
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , the res@@ il@@ i@@ ence of nature ."
"We can des@@ tro@@ y a riv@@ er , and we can bring it back to life ."
"We can see a whole are@@ a des@@ ol@@ ated , and it can be b@@ rou@@ ght back to b@@ loo@@ m again , with time or a little help ."
"And thir@@ d@@ ly , the last speak@@ er tal@@ ked about — or the speak@@ er before last , tal@@ ked about the ind@@ om@@ it@@ able human sp@@ ir@@ it ."
We are sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely im@@ possible .
"@@ N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a — I take a little piece of lim@@ est@@ one from R@@ ob@@ b@@ en I@@ sl@@ and P@@ ris@@ on , where he lab@@ ored for 2@@ 7 years , and came out with so little b@@ it@@ ter@@ ness , he could le@@ ad his people from the hor@@ ro@@ r of ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id without a blo@@ od@@ b@@ ath ."
"E@@ ven after the 1@@ 1@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber — and I was in New Y@@ or@@ k and I fel@@ t the fear — n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , there was so much human cou@@ ra@@ ge , so much love and so much com@@ passion ."
"And then as I went around the country after that and fel@@ t the fear — the fear that was lead@@ ing to people feel@@ ing they couldn &apos;t wor@@ ry about the environ@@ ment any more , in case they se@@ em@@ ed not to be pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ic — and I was trying to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , somebody came up with a little quot@@ ation from Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i , &quot; &quot; If you look back through human history , you see that every ev@@ il regi@@ me has been over@@ come by good . &quot; &quot; And just after that a woman b@@ rou@@ ght me this little b@@ ell , and I want to end on this not@@ e ."
"She said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re talking about hope and pe@@ ace , r@@ ing this ."
"This b@@ ell is made from met@@ al from a de@@ f@@ used l@@ and@@ mine , from the k@@ il@@ ling fiel@@ ds of P@@ ol P@@ ot — one of the most ev@@ il re@@ g@@ im@@ es in human history — where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regi@@ me has c@@ r@@ um@@ bl@@ ed ."
"So , y@@ es , there is hope , and where is the hope ?"
I@@ s it out there with the polit@@ ici@@ ans ?
It &apos;s in our hands .
It &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
It &apos;s really up to us .
We &apos;re the ones who can make a difference .
"If we le@@ ad lives where we conscious@@ ly leave the ligh@@ test possible ec@@ ological fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ ts , if we buy the things that are e@@ th@@ ical for us to buy and don &apos;t buy the things that are not , we can change the world over@@ night ."
Thank you .
"M@@ ar@@ k Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ ber@@ g , a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist was as@@ king him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist was as@@ king him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l d@@ ying in your front yar@@ d may be more rel@@ ev@@ ant to your interes@@ ts right now than people d@@ ying in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a W@@ eb bas@@ ed on that idea of rel@@ ev@@ ance might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really ru@@ ral are@@ a in Ma@@ ine , the In@@ tern@@ et me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a connec@@ tion to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democra@@ cy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t pa@@ y at@@ ten@@ tion to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first not@@ ic@@ ed this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok p@@ age .
"I &apos;m progres@@ sive , polit@@ ically — big sur@@ pr@@ ise — but I &apos;ve always gone out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like he@@ aring what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like seeing what they lin@@ k to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was sur@@ pris@@ ed when I not@@ ic@@ ed one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed from my F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok fe@@ ed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok was looking at which lin@@ ks I cl@@ ic@@ ked on , and it was not@@ ic@@ ing that , actually , I was cl@@ ic@@ king more on my liber@@ al friends &apos; lin@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative friends &apos; lin@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ sul@@ ting me about it , it had ed@@ ited them out ."
They disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
"So F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of in@@ vis@@ ible , al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ed@@ iting of the W@@ eb ."
G@@ o@@ o@@ gle &apos;s doing it too .
"If I se@@ arch for something , and you se@@ arch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different se@@ arch results ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no stan@@ dar@@ d G@@ o@@ o@@ gle any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ n@@ y thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your se@@ arch results are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s scre@@ en sh@@ ot .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s scre@@ en sh@@ ot .
"When you put them s@@ ide@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the lin@@ ks to see how different these two p@@ ages are ."
"But when you do read the lin@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mark@@ able ."
D@@ an@@ i@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the pro@@ tes@@ ts in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t at all in his first p@@ age of G@@ o@@ o@@ gle results .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were ful@@ l of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are becom@@ ing .
So it &apos;s not just G@@ o@@ o@@ gle and F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok ei@@ ther .
This is something that &apos;s s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing the W@@ eb .
There are a whole ho@@ st of compan@@ ies that are doing this kind of person@@ aliz@@ ation .
"Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o N@@ e@@ ws , the big@@ gest news s@@ ite on the In@@ tern@@ et , is now person@@ aliz@@ ed — different people get different things ."
"H@@ uf@@ fin@@ g@@ ton P@@ o@@ st , the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton P@@ o@@ st , the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es — all f@@ li@@ rt@@ ing with person@@ aliz@@ ation in vari@@ ous ways ."
"And this mov@@ es us very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly to@@ ward a world in which the In@@ tern@@ et is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these fil@@ ters together , you take all these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , you get what I call a fil@@ ter b@@ ub@@ ble ."
"And your fil@@ ter b@@ ub@@ ble is your own person@@ al , un@@ i@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ line ."
"And what &apos;s in your fil@@ ter b@@ ub@@ ble de@@ pen@@ ds on who you are , and it de@@ pen@@ ds on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t dec@@ ide what gets in .
"And more import@@ an@@ tly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets ed@@ ited out ."
So one of the problems with the fil@@ ter b@@ ub@@ ble was discover@@ ed by some rese@@ arch@@ ers at N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ e@@ ue , they just z@@ i@@ p right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ ro@@ n M@@ an &quot; &quot; z@@ i@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ iting for Su@@ per@@ man &quot; &quot; can wa@@ it for a really long time ."
What they discover@@ ed was that in our N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ ues there &apos;s this ep@@ ic st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle going on between our future as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional selves and our more im@@ pul@@ sive present selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has wat@@ ched &quot; &quot; R@@ ash@@ o@@ mon , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to wat@@ ch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ ent@@ ura &quot; &quot; for the f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h time ."
It giv@@ es us a little bit of J@@ us@@ ti@@ n B@@ i@@ eb@@ er and a little bit of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
It giv@@ es us some information ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les ; it giv@@ es us some information des@@ s@@ ert .
"And the challenge with these kinds of al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic fil@@ ters , these person@@ aliz@@ ed fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you cl@@ ic@@ k on first , it can th@@ row off that bal@@ ance ."
"And instead of a bal@@ an@@ ced information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by information j@@ un@@ k food ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re seeing is more of a pas@@ sing of the t@@ or@@ ch from human ga@@ te@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ones .
And the thing is that the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ bed@@ ded e@@ th@@ ics that the ed@@ it@@ ors did .
"So if al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms are going to cu@@ rate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to dec@@ ide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just k@@ ey@@ ed to rel@@ ev@@ ance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ for@@ table or chall@@ eng@@ ing or important — this is what TE@@ D does — other poin@@ ts of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were s@@ we@@ ating a lot about their civ@@ ic respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ities ."
Th@@ en people not@@ ic@@ ed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a func@@ tion@@ ing democra@@ cy if c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens didn &apos;t get a good f@@ low of information , that the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were c@@ rit@@ ical because they were ac@@ ting as the fil@@ ter , and then j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic e@@ th@@ ics develop@@ ed ."
"It wasn &apos;t per@@ fect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the W@@ eb ."
And we need the new ga@@ te@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to en@@ cod@@ e that kind of respon@@ si@@ bility into the cod@@ e that they &apos;re writ@@ ing .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok and from G@@ o@@ o@@ gle — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ g@@ ey — people who have hel@@ ped build the W@@ eb as it is , and I &apos;m gra@@ te@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have en@@ cod@@ ed in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civ@@ ic respon@@ si@@ bility ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re trans@@ par@@ ent enough that we can see what the rul@@ es are that de@@ ter@@ mine what gets through our fil@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some control so that we can dec@@ ide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the In@@ tern@@ et to be that thing that we all dre@@ amed of it being .
We need it to con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
We need it to in@@ tro@@ duc@@ e us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it le@@ aves us all is@@ ol@@ ated in a W@@ eb of one .
Thank you .

"What you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is k@@ il@@ ling you ."
"M@@ ore than c@@ ars or the In@@ tern@@ et or even that little mo@@ bil@@ e dev@@ ice we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your t@@ us@@ h ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys people are sit@@ ting 9@@ .@@ 3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing , at 7@@ .@@ 7 hours ."
"S@@ it@@ ting is so incredi@@ bly pre@@ val@@ ent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even oc@@ c@@ ur to us that it &apos;s not o@@ kay ."
"In that way , sit@@ ting has become the smo@@ king of our gener@@ ation ."
"O@@ f course there &apos;s health con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences to this , sc@@ ary ones , b@@ es@@ ides the wa@@ ist ."
"Th@@ ings like bre@@ ast cancer and col@@ on cancer are direc@@ tly ti@@ ed to our l@@ ack of physical &#91; acti@@ vity &#93; , T@@ en percent in fact , on both of those ."
"S@@ i@@ x percent for heart disease , seven percent for typ@@ e 2 diab@@ et@@ es , which is what my father died of ."
"Now , any of those stat@@ s should con@@ vin@@ ce each of us to get off our d@@ uff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me mov@@ ing was a social inter@@ action .
"S@@ ome@@ one in@@ vit@@ ed me to a me@@ et@@ ing , but couldn &apos;t man@@ age to f@@ it me in to a re@@ gul@@ ar sort of con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ing , and said , &quot; I have to wal@@ k my do@@ gs to@@ mor@@ row . C@@ ould you come then ? &quot;"
"It se@@ em@@ ed kind of od@@ d to do , and actually , that first me@@ et@@ ing , I remember thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to h@@ uff and p@@ uff d@@ uring this con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e me@@ et@@ ings or flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent@@ -@@ l@@ it con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ings , I ask people to go on a wal@@ king me@@ et@@ ing , to the tun@@ e of 20 to 30 mil@@ es a week ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , s@@ ever@@ al hundred of these wal@@ king me@@ et@@ ings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , there &apos;s this amazing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that lead@@ s to ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s nature or the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise itself , it certain@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ position when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differ@@ ently , whether it &apos;s in govern@@ ance or business or environ@@ mental issu@@ es , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to re@@ fra@@ me those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ talk idea that things bec@@ ame do@@ able and su@@ st@@ ain@@ able and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the t@@ us@@ h , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom line , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be sur@@ pris@@ ed at how f@@ res@@ h air driv@@ es f@@ res@@ h thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ rel@@ y new set of ideas ."

I &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
Why consciousness ?
"Well , it &apos;s a cur@@ i@@ ously ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ted sub@@ ject , both in our scientific and our philosoph@@ ical culture ."
Now why is that cur@@ ious ?
So consciousness is number one .
"The second reason is that when people do get interes@@ ted in it , as I think they should , they t@@ end to say the most app@@ all@@ ing things ."
"And then , even when they &apos;re not saying app@@ all@@ ing things and they &apos;re really trying to do ser@@ ious research , well , it &apos;s been s@@ low . P@@ rog@@ ress has been s@@ low ."
"When I first got interes@@ ted in this , I thought , well , it &apos;s a stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward problem in bi@@ ology ."
"O@@ kay , now why then is this cur@@ ious rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ ce and cur@@ ious ho@@ st@@ il@@ ity to consciousness ?"
"Well , I think it &apos;s a com@@ bin@@ ation of two fe@@ atures of our intel@@ lec@@ tual culture that like to think they &apos;re op@@ pos@@ ing each other but in fact they share a common set of as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
One fe@@ ature is the t@@ rad@@ ition of relig@@ ious d@@ ual@@ ism : Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is not a part of the physical world .
It &apos;s a part of the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual world .
"It bel@@ on@@ gs to the s@@ ou@@ l , and the s@@ ou@@ l is not a part of the physical world ."
"That &apos;s the t@@ rad@@ ition of G@@ od , the s@@ ou@@ l and im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality ."
"E@@ i@@ ther it doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some dam@@ n fo@@ ol thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science ."
And I used to get in an argum@@ ent that really gave me a st@@ o@@ mach@@ ach@@ e .
"S@@ ci@@ ence is ob@@ jec@@ tive , consciousness is sub@@ jec@@ tive , ther@@ e@@ fore there cannot be a science of consciousness ."
"O@@ kay , so these tw@@ in t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions are par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ing us ."
It &apos;s very hard to get out of these tw@@ in t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions .
"And I have only one real mes@@ sa@@ ge in this lec@@ ture , and that is , consciousness is a bi@@ ological ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on like ph@@ ot@@ o@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ esis , dig@@ es@@ tion , mit@@ os@@ is — you know all the bi@@ ological ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena — and once you ac@@ cept that , most , though not all , of the hard problems about consciousness simply ev@@ apo@@ rate ."
And I &apos;m going to go through some of them .
"O@@ kay , now I prom@@ ised you to tell you some of the ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous things said about consciousness ."
One : Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness does not ex@@ ist .
"It &apos;s an ill@@ us@@ ion , like sun@@ s@@ ets ."
S@@ ci@@ ence has sho@@ wn sun@@ s@@ ets and ra@@ in@@ bo@@ ws are ill@@ us@@ ions .
So consciousness is an ill@@ us@@ ion .
"@@ T@@ w@@ o : Well , maybe it ex@@ ists , but it &apos;s really something else ."
It &apos;s a computer program run@@ ning in the brain .
"Th@@ ree : No , the only thing that ex@@ ists is really behavior ."
"It &apos;s em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing how in@@ flu@@ enti@@ al behav@@ i@@ or@@ ism was , but I &apos;ll get back to that ."
"And four : Ma@@ ybe consciousness ex@@ ists , but it can &apos;t make any difference to the world ."
How could sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual@@ ity move anything ?
S@@ ome days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot; &quot; No . It goes up wh@@ en@@ ever I dam@@ n well want it to .
O@@ kay . I &apos;m going to tell you how that &apos;s possible .
"Now , I hav@@ en &apos;t yet given you a defin@@ ition ."
You can &apos;t do this if you don &apos;t give a defin@@ ition .
P@@ eople always say consciousness is very hard to defin@@ e .
I think it &apos;s rather easy to defin@@ e if you &apos;re not trying to give a scientific defin@@ ition .
"We &apos;re not ready for a scientific defin@@ ition , but here &apos;s a com@@ mon@@ -@@ sense defin@@ ition ."
"It begin@@ s in the mor@@ ning when you w@@ ake up from a dre@@ am@@ less s@@ le@@ ep , and it goes on all day until you f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep or die or o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise become un@@ consci@@ ous ."
D@@ re@@ ams are a form of consciousness on this defin@@ ition .
"Now , that &apos;s the com@@ mon@@ -@@ sense defin@@ ition . That &apos;s our t@@ arg@@ et ."
"If you &apos;re not talking about that , you &apos;re not talking about consciousness ."
"But they think , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s it , that &apos;s an aw@@ ful problem ."
"@@ How can such a thing ex@@ ist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; And this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosoph@@ y course , this is known as the f@@ amo@@ us min@@ d@@ -@@ body problem ."
I think that has a simple solu@@ tion too . I &apos;m going to give it to you .
"And here it is : All of our consci@@ ous st@@ ates , without ex@@ cep@@ tion , are ca@@ used by low@@ er@@ -@@ level neu@@ rob@@ i@@ ological proc@@ ess@@ es in the brain , and they are real@@ ized in the brain as high@@ er@@ -@@ level or system fe@@ atures ."
It &apos;s about as my@@ ster@@ ious as the li@@ qu@@ id@@ ity of water .
It &apos;s a con@@ d@@ ition that the system is in .
The f@@ amo@@ us min@@ d@@ -@@ body problem is that simple .
All right ? But now we get into some har@@ der questions .
"@@ Let &apos;s spec@@ if@@ y the ex@@ act fe@@ atures of consciousness , so that we can then answer those four ob@@ jec@@ tions that I made to it ."
"Well , the first fe@@ ature is , it &apos;s real and ir@@ re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble ."
You can &apos;t get ri@@ d of it .
"You see , the dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between reality and ill@@ us@@ ion is the dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between how things conscious@@ ly seem to us and how they really are ."
"It conscious@@ ly seems like there &apos;s — I like the F@@ ren@@ ch &quot; &quot; arc@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ ci@@ el &quot; &quot; — it seems like there &apos;s an arch in the sk@@ y , or it seems like the su@@ n is s@@ etting over the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins ."
"It conscious@@ ly seems to us , but that &apos;s not really happening ."
"But for that dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between how things conscious@@ ly seem and how they really are , you can &apos;t make that dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion for the very ex@@ ist@@ ence of consciousness , because where the very ex@@ ist@@ ence of consciousness is con@@ cer@@ ned , if it conscious@@ ly seems to you that you are consci@@ ous , you are consci@@ ous ."
It &apos;s real and ir@@ re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble .
You cannot get ri@@ d of it by sho@@ wing that it &apos;s an ill@@ us@@ ion in a way that you can with other stan@@ dar@@ d ill@@ us@@ ions .
"O@@ kay , the second fe@@ ature is this one that has been such a s@@ our@@ ce of tro@@ ub@@ le to us , and that is , all of our consci@@ ous st@@ ates have this qu@@ alit@@ ative charac@@ ter to them ."
Ma@@ ybe we &apos;ll be able to build a consci@@ ous machine .
O@@ kay . A@@ no@@ ther fe@@ ature of consciousness is that it comes in un@@ i@@ fied consci@@ ous fiel@@ ds .
"So I don &apos;t just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my vo@@ ice and the we@@ ight of my sho@@ es against the f@@ lo@@ or , but they oc@@ c@@ ur to me as part of one single great consci@@ ous field that stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es for@@ ward and bac@@ k@@ ward ."
That is the k@@ ey to understanding the en@@ or@@ mo@@ us power of consciousness .
And we have not been able to do that in a rob@@ ot .
"The disa@@ p@@ poin@@ t@@ ment of rob@@ ot@@ ics der@@ iv@@ es from the fact that we don &apos;t know how to make a consci@@ ous rob@@ ot , so we don &apos;t have a machine that can do this kind of thing ."
"O@@ kay , the next fe@@ ature of consciousness , after this mar@@ vel@@ ous un@@ i@@ fied consci@@ ous field , is that it func@@ tions c@@ au@@ sal@@ ly in our behavior ."
"I gave you a scientific demon@@ stra@@ tion by ra@@ is@@ ing my hand , but how is that possible ?"
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material ob@@ jects ?
"Well , I &apos;ll tell you the answer ."
"I mean , we don &apos;t know the deta@@ il@@ ed answer , but we know the bas@@ ic part of the answer , and that is , there is a se@@ qu@@ ence of neuro@@ n fir@@ ings , and they ter@@ min@@ ate where the ac@@ et@@ y@@ l@@ ch@@ ol@@ ine is sec@@ re@@ ted at the ax@@ on end@@ -@@ pl@@ ates of the mo@@ tor neurons ."
"Now , think of what I told you ."
"One and the same ev@@ ent , my consci@@ ous dec@@ ision to ra@@ ise my ar@@ m has a level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it has all of these tou@@ ch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual qu@@ alit@@ ies ."
"Now , what that tel@@ ls us is that our t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ar@@ ies for disc@@ us@@ sing these issu@@ es are tot@@ ally ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
"One and the same ev@@ ent has a level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it &apos;s neu@@ rob@@ i@@ ological , and another level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it &apos;s mental , and that &apos;s a single ev@@ ent , and that &apos;s how nature works . That &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to func@@ tion c@@ au@@ sal@@ ly ."
"O@@ kay , now with that in mind , with going through these vari@@ ous fe@@ atures of consciousness , let &apos;s go back and answer some of those early ob@@ jec@@ tions ."
"Well , the first one I said was , consciousness doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist , it &apos;s an ill@@ us@@ ion . Well , I &apos;ve already ans@@ wer@@ ed that ."
I don &apos;t think we need to wor@@ ry about that .
"But the second one had an incredi@@ ble in@@ flu@@ ence , and may still be around , and that is , &quot; &quot; Well , if consciousness ex@@ ists , it &apos;s really something else ."
It &apos;s really a dig@@ ital computer program run@@ ning in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
"You get an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m that you can program in a bin@@ ary cod@@ e , and that &apos;s the defin@@ ing tra@@ it of the computer program ."
But we know that that &apos;s pur@@ ely sy@@ n@@ t@@ ac@@ tical . That &apos;s sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c .
We know that ac@@ tual human consciousness has something more than that .
It &apos;s got a cont@@ ent in ad@@ d@@ ition to the sy@@ n@@ ta@@ x .
It &apos;s got a s@@ em@@ an@@ tics .
"It cre@@ ates a reality of money , pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y , government , marri@@ age , C@@ E@@ R@@ N con@@ fer@@ ences , co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ties and sum@@ m@@ er v@@ ac@@ ations , and all of those are cre@@ ations of consciousness ."
Th@@ e@@ ir ex@@ ist@@ ence is ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ -@@ rel@@ ative .
It &apos;s only rel@@ ative to consci@@ ous ag@@ ents that a piece of p@@ aper is money or that a bun@@ ch of buil@@ din@@ gs is a univer@@ sity .
"Now , ask yourself about comput@@ ation ."
"I@@ s that ab@@ sol@@ ute , like force and mass and grav@@ it@@ ational at@@ trac@@ tion ?"
O@@ r is it ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ -@@ rel@@ ative ?
"Well , some comput@@ ations are in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c ."
I ad@@ d two pl@@ us two to get four .
That &apos;s going on no matter what any@@ body thin@@ ks .
"But when I h@@ au@@ l out my po@@ c@@ k@@ et cal@@ cul@@ at@@ or and do the cal@@ cul@@ ation , the only in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is the elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic cir@@ cu@@ it and its behavior ."
That &apos;s the only ab@@ sol@@ ute ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
C@@ om@@ put@@ ation only ex@@ ists rel@@ ative to consciousness .
"E@@ i@@ ther a consci@@ ous ag@@ ent is car@@ r@@ ying out the comput@@ ation , or he &apos;s got a piece of ma@@ chin@@ er@@ y that ad@@ m@@ its of a comput@@ ational inter@@ pret@@ ation ."
Now that doesn &apos;t mean comput@@ ation is ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary .
I sp@@ ent a lot of money on this har@@ d@@ w@@ are .
That &apos;s a bad p@@ u@@ n on ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity and sub@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity .
"You can make ob@@ jec@@ tive cl@@ a@@ im@@ s about a do@@ ma@@ in that is sub@@ jec@@ tive in its mo@@ de of ex@@ ist@@ ence , and inde@@ ed that &apos;s what neuro@@ log@@ ists do ."
Y@@ our mental st@@ ates are id@@ en@@ tical with your behavior ?
You &apos;re giving up on 3@@ 00 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
Thank you very much .

I gre@@ w up in a very small country to@@ wn in V@@ ic@@ t@@ oria .
"I had a very nor@@ mal , low@@ -@@ k@@ ey kind of up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing ."
"I went to school , I h@@ un@@ g out with my friends , I f@@ ou@@ ght with my youn@@ ger sis@@ ters ."
It was all very nor@@ mal .
"And my parents said , &quot; &quot; H@@ m , that &apos;s really n@@ ice , but there &apos;s kind of one gl@@ aring problem with that ."
"She h@@ as@@ n &apos;t actually achi@@ ev@@ ed anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they were right , you know ."
"Y@@ eah , I know . What a cont@@ rad@@ ic@@ tion ."
"But they were right , you know ."
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that was out of the ordin@@ ary at all .
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that could be consid@@ er@@ ed an achi@@ ev@@ ement if you took disa@@ bility out of the equ@@ ation .
"Y@@ e@@ ars later , I was on my second teach@@ ing ro@@ und in a M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 le@@ ga@@ l studies class when this bo@@ y put up his hand and said , &quot; H@@ ey mis@@ s , when are you going to start doing your spe@@ ec@@ h ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , like , your mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ational speak@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s when it da@@ w@@ ned on me : This k@@ id had only ever experien@@ ced disa@@ bl@@ ed people as ob@@ jects of insp@@ i@@ ration .
"We are not , to this k@@ id — and it &apos;s not his fa@@ ult , I mean , that &apos;s true for many of us ."
"For lots of us , disa@@ bl@@ ed people are not our teachers or our doc@@ tors or our man@@ ic@@ ur@@ ists ."
We &apos;re not real people . We are there to insp@@ ire .
"Well , la@@ dies and gen@@ t@@ l@@ em@@ en , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to disa@@ p@@ point you dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
I am not here to insp@@ ire you .
"It &apos;s a bad thing , and to live with a disa@@ bility makes you ex@@ cep@@ tional ."
"It &apos;s not a bad thing , and it doesn &apos;t make you ex@@ cep@@ tional ."
"And in the past few years , we &apos;ve been able to pro@@ pa@@ ga@@ te this li@@ e even fur@@ ther v@@ ia social me@@ dia ."
You may have seen imag@@ es like this one : &quot; The only disa@@ bility in life is a bad at@@ tit@@ u@@ de . &quot;
O@@ r this one : &quot; &quot; Y@@ our exc@@ use is in@@ val@@ id . &quot; &quot; In@@ de@@ ed .
"O@@ r this one : &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore you qu@@ it , try ! &quot; &quot; These are just a couple of exam@@ pl@@ es , but there are a lot of these imag@@ es out there ."
You might have seen a child run@@ ning on car@@ b@@ on fi@@ ber pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic le@@ gs .
"And these imag@@ es , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call insp@@ i@@ ration por@@ n ."
"( Laughter ) And I use the ter@@ m por@@ n d@@ eli@@ ber@@ ately , because they ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ y one group of people for the ben@@ ef@@ it of another group of people ."
"So in this case , we &apos;re ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ ying disa@@ bl@@ ed people for the ben@@ ef@@ it of n@@ on@@ disa@@ bl@@ ed people ."
"The pur@@ pose of these imag@@ es is to insp@@ ire you , to mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; &quot; Well , ho@@ w@@ ever bad my life is , it could be wor@@ se ."
I could be that person . &quot; &quot; But what if you are that person ?
They were just kind of con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ating me for man@@ ag@@ ing to get up in the mor@@ ning and remember my own name . ( Laughter ) And it is ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ ying .
"Th@@ ese imag@@ es , those imag@@ es ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ y disa@@ bl@@ ed people for the ben@@ ef@@ it of n@@ on@@ disa@@ bl@@ ed people ."
"They are there so that you can look at them and think that things ar@@ en &apos;t so bad for you , to put your wor@@ ri@@ es into per@@ spec@@ tive ."
And life as a disa@@ bl@@ ed person is actually some@@ what difficult .
We do over@@ come some things .
But the things that we &apos;re over@@ coming are not the things that you think they are .
They are not things to do with our bo@@ dies .
"I use the ter@@ m &quot; &quot; disa@@ bl@@ ed people &quot; &quot; quite d@@ eli@@ ber@@ ately , because I sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to what &apos;s called the social mo@@ del of disa@@ bility , which tel@@ ls us that we are more disa@@ bl@@ ed by the society that we live in than by our bo@@ dies and our diagno@@ ses ."
So I have liv@@ ed in this body a long time .
I &apos;m quite fon@@ d of it .
"It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its cap@@ ac@@ ity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pic@@ tures as well ."
They &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordin@@ ary .
They are just using their bo@@ dies to the best of their cap@@ ac@@ ity .
"So is it really fa@@ ir to ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ y them in the way that we do , to share those imag@@ es ?"
"P@@ eople , when they say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re an insp@@ i@@ ration , &quot; &quot; they mean it as a comp@@ li@@ ment ."
And I know why it happens .
"It &apos;s because of the li@@ e , it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been s@@ old this li@@ e that disa@@ bility makes you ex@@ cep@@ tional ."
And it h@@ on@@ es@@ tly doesn &apos;t .
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
"You know , I &apos;m up here b@@ ag@@ ging out insp@@ i@@ ration , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; J@@ e@@ e@@ z , S@@ tel@@ la , ar@@ en &apos;t you insp@@ i@@ red sometimes by some things ? &quot; &quot; And the thing is , I am ."
I learn from other disa@@ bl@@ ed people all the time .
"I &apos;m learning not that I am l@@ uc@@ k@@ ier than them , though ."
G@@ en@@ i@@ us .
"We are learning from each others &apos; str@@ eng@@ th and end@@ ur@@ ance , not against our bo@@ dies and our diagno@@ ses , but against a world that ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ aliz@@ es and ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ ies us ."
I really think that this li@@ e that we &apos;ve been s@@ old about disa@@ bility is the gre@@ at@@ est in@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce .
It makes life hard for us .
"And that quot@@ e , &quot; &quot; The only disa@@ bility in life is a bad at@@ tit@@ u@@ de , &quot; &quot; the reason that that &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ sh@@ it is because it &apos;s just not true , because of the social mo@@ del of disa@@ bility ."
No amount of s@@ mil@@ ing at a f@@ light of st@@ air@@ s has ever made it turn into a ram@@ p .
N@@ ever . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) S@@ mil@@ ing at a tel@@ ev@@ ision scre@@ en isn &apos;t going to make clo@@ sed cap@@ tions ap@@ pe@@ ar for people who are de@@ a@@ f .
No amount of st@@ anding in the middle of a bo@@ o@@ k@@ sho@@ p and radi@@ ating a pos@@ itive at@@ tit@@ u@@ de is going to turn all those bo@@ o@@ ks into bra@@ il@@ le .
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
"I really want to live in a world where disa@@ bility is not the ex@@ cep@@ tion , but the nor@@ m ."
I want to live in a world where a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old gir@@ l sit@@ ting in her bed@@ room wat@@ ch@@ ing &quot; &quot; B@@ uf@@ f@@ y the V@@ am@@ pir@@ e S@@ la@@ y@@ er &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t re@@ fer@@ red to as achi@@ ev@@ ing anything because she &apos;s doing it sit@@ ting down . I want to live in a world
where we don &apos;t have such low expec@@ t@@ ations of disa@@ bl@@ ed people that we are con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ated for getting out of bed and remem@@ ber@@ ing our own nam@@ es in the mor@@ ning .
"I want to live in a world where we value gen@@ u@@ ine achi@@ ev@@ ement for disa@@ bl@@ ed people , and I want to live in a world where a k@@ id in year 11 in a M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school is not one bit sur@@ pris@@ ed that his new teacher is a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ er ."
"D@@ isa@@ bility doesn &apos;t make you ex@@ cep@@ tional , but ques@@ tion@@ ing what you think you know about it does ."

"C@@ ar@@ los , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am v@@ et Mar@@ ine who vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed for three t@@ ours and got sh@@ ot up in every one ."
"In 19@@ 7@@ 1 , he was medic@@ ally re@@ ti@@ red because he had so much sh@@ ra@@ p@@ ne@@ l in his body that he was s@@ etting off met@@ al det@@ ec@@ tors ."
"For the next 4@@ 2 years , he suf@@ fer@@ ed from ni@@ gh@@ t@@ mar@@ es , extre@@ me an@@ x@@ i@@ ety in public , is@@ ol@@ ation , depres@@ sion ."
He self-@@ medic@@ ated with al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
He was marri@@ ed and div@@ or@@ ced three times .
C@@ ar@@ los had pos@@ t-@@ tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic stress dis@@ order .
"And so , we didn &apos;t know what to do ."
We put some v@@ et@@ er@@ ans on he@@ av@@ y dru@@ gs .
"O@@ thers we ho@@ sp@@ it@@ aliz@@ ed and gave gener@@ ic group ther@@ ap@@ y , and others still we simply said to them , &quot; Just go home and try to for@@ get about your experi@@ ences . &quot;"
"Now , making war — this is something that we are good at ."
We hum@@ ans have been making war since before we were even fully human .
"And since then , we have gone from using st@@ one and sin@@ ew to develop@@ ing the most soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated and dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating we@@ apo@@ n syst@@ ems imag@@ in@@ able ."
We are good at making war .
And we are good at tra@@ ining our war@@ ri@@ ors to fi@@ ght .
"Y@@ et , when we consid@@ er the experience of the moder@@ n@@ -@@ day com@@ b@@ at v@@ et@@ er@@ an , we be@@ gin to see that we have not been as good at pre@@ par@@ ing them to come home ."
Why is that ?
"Well , our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors liv@@ ed im@@ mer@@ sed in con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , and they f@@ ou@@ ght right where they liv@@ ed ."
"So until only very rec@@ ently in our evolu@@ tion@@ ary history , there was har@@ d@@ ly a need to learn how to come home from war , because we never really did ."
But just imagine for a moment what this must feel like .
&quot; &quot; M@@ ind@@ f@@ uc@@ k &quot; &quot; is the most common ter@@ m .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the most common ter@@ m I &apos;ve heard to descri@@ be that experience .
"Now , the same hol@@ ds for tra@@ in@@ ing@@ -@@ bas@@ ed treat@@ ments ."
"The first of these treat@@ ments is co@@ gn@@ itive ther@@ ap@@ y , and this is a kind of mental rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ tion ."
"So when you try to over@@ la@@ y that mind fra@@ me on@@ to a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ time environ@@ ment , you get problems ."
You be@@ gin dro@@ w@@ ning in wor@@ ri@@ es about dan@@ g@@ ers that ar@@ en &apos;t present .
You be@@ gin not tr@@ ust@@ ing family or friends .
Wh@@ ich is not to say there are no dan@@ g@@ ers in civ@@ il@@ ian life ; there are .
So we never adv@@ ise v@@ et@@ er@@ ans to turn off c@@ au@@ tion completely .
"We do tra@@ in them , ho@@ w@@ ever , to ad@@ just c@@ au@@ tion ac@@ cor@@ ding to where they are ."
O@@ ut to din@@ ner with family ?
"We tra@@ in v@@ et@@ er@@ ans to be f@@ ier@@ c@@ ely ra@@ tional , to sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tically gau@@ ge the ac@@ tual stat@@ is@@ tical prob@@ ability of en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing , say , an I@@ E@@ D here in pe@@ ac@@ e@@ time America ."
This was the treat@@ ment that he ch@@ ose .
"And , c@@ rit@@ ically — st@@ a@@ ying in these environ@@ ments ."
"Now , at first he was very an@@ x@@ ious ."
"And he wanted to leave , but he didn &apos;t ."
"He remem@@ ber@@ ed his tra@@ ining in the Mar@@ ine C@@ or@@ ps , and he p@@ u@@ shed through his dis@@ com@@ for@@ t ."
"He also list@@ en@@ ed to rec@@ ordin@@ gs of his com@@ b@@ at experi@@ ences , over and over and over ."
He list@@ en@@ ed until those me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es no longer gener@@ ated any an@@ x@@ i@@ ety .
"@@ V@@ et@@ er@@ ans will always remember their tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic experi@@ ences , but with enough prac@@ ti@@ ce , those me@@ mo@@ ri@@ es are no longer as ra@@ w or as pain@@ ful as they once were ."
"They don &apos;t feel emo@@ tion@@ ally like they just happened y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , and that is an im@@ men@@ s@@ ely better place to be ."
"And , like any tra@@ ining , it may not work for everybody ."
And there are tr@@ ust issu@@ es .
"S@@ ome@@ times I &apos;m asked , &quot; If you hav@@ en &apos;t been there , D@@ o@@ c , how can you help me ? &quot;"
"But at the point of re@@ turn@@ ing to civ@@ il@@ ian life , you do not requ@@ ire somebody who &apos;s been there ."
You don &apos;t requ@@ ire tra@@ ining for oper@@ ations on the b@@ att@@ le@@ field ; you requ@@ ire tra@@ ining on how to come home .

I &apos;m just going to play a bri@@ ef video cli@@ p .

Un@@ rel@@ at@@ ed@@ ly — ( Laughter ) Jap@@ an is doing crazy things with to@@ il@@ ets . ( Laughter )

"I s@@ w@@ it@@ ched lan@@ es on the high@@ way and the driv@@ er , this ch@@ ap@@ er@@ one , said , &quot; You know , you were just going 1@@ 10 mil@@ es an h@@ our . &quot;"
"And I had no idea that I was one of those ob@@ no@@ x@@ ious people you oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally see we@@ av@@ ing in and out of tra@@ f@@ fic , because it was just that smo@@ ot@@ h ."
"And if I was a bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e , I would get one ."
( Laughter ) This is a completely gra@@ tu@@ it@@ ous video I &apos;m just going to show of one of the p@@ it@@ f@@ all@@ s of adv@@ an@@ ced technology .
This is Tom C@@ ru@@ ise ar@@ riv@@ ing at the &quot; &quot; M@@ is@@ sion : I@@ m@@ possible I@@ I@@ I &quot; &quot; pre@@ mi@@ ere .
"When he tries to open the do@@ or , you could call it &quot; &quot; M@@ is@@ sion : I@@ m@@ possible I@@ V . &quot; &quot; There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 19@@ 4@@ 7 Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c ."
The &apos; 4@@ 7 Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c is probably the most my@@ th@@ olog@@ ized w@@ ine of the 20@@ th century .
And Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c is kind of an un@@ us@@ ual w@@ ine for B@@ or@@ de@@ au@@ x in having a si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant per@@ cent@@ age of the C@@ ab@@ er@@ n@@ et F@@ ran@@ c gra@@ p@@ e .
"And 19@@ 4@@ 7 was a le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y vin@@ t@@ age , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in the right b@@ ank of B@@ or@@ de@@ au@@ x ."
"And just together , that vin@@ t@@ age and that ch@@ at@@ e@@ a@@ u took on this a@@ ura that even@@ tually kind of gave it this cul@@ t@@ ish fol@@ lowing ."
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
What there is of it left you don &apos;t know if it &apos;s real — it &apos;s consid@@ er@@ ed to be the most f@@ ak@@ ed w@@ ine in the world .
Not that many people are looking to po@@ p open their one re@@ main@@ ing bot@@ tle for a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist .
"So , I &apos;d about given up trying to get my hands on one of these ."
"I &apos;d put out feel@@ ers to re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers , to auc@@ tion@@ e@@ ers , and it was coming up emp@@ ty ."
And then I got an e@@ ma@@ il from a guy n@@ amed B@@ ip@@ in D@@ e@@ sa@@ i .
"B@@ ip@@ in D@@ e@@ sa@@ i is a U.@@ C@@ . R@@ iver@@ side the@@ or@@ e@@ tical physic@@ ist who also happens to be the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent organiz@@ er of r@@ are w@@ ine t@@ as@@ tin@@ gs , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a t@@ as@@ ting coming up where we &apos;re going to ser@@ ve the &apos; 4@@ 7 Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c . &quot; &quot; And it was going to be a d@@ ou@@ ble ver@@ tical — it was going to be 30 vin@@ t@@ ages of Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c , and 30 vin@@ t@@ ages of Y@@ qu@@ e@@ m ."
And it was an in@@ vit@@ ation you do not re@@ f@@ use .
I went .
"It was three days , four me@@ als ."
"And at l@@ un@@ ch on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day , we op@@ en@@ ed the &apos; 4@@ 7 ."
"And you know , it had this fra@@ gr@@ ant sof@@ t@@ ness , and it sm@@ el@@ led a little bit of lin@@ se@@ ed o@@ il ."
"And then I t@@ as@@ ted it , and it , you know , had this kind of un@@ c@@ tu@@ ous , port@@ y ri@@ ch@@ ness , which is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic of that w@@ ine — that it sort of res@@ em@@ bl@@ es port in a lot of ways ."
"There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ."
There were some people who were a little less im@@ pres@@ sed .
And I wasn &apos;t that im@@ pres@@ sed .
"And I don &apos;t — call my p@@ al@@ ate a ph@@ il@@ ist@@ ine p@@ al@@ ate — so it doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily mean something that I wasn &apos;t im@@ pres@@ sed , but I was not the only one there who had that re@@ action ."
And it wasn &apos;t just to that w@@ ine .
"A@@ n@@ y one of the w@@ ines serv@@ ed at this t@@ as@@ ting , if I &apos;d been serv@@ ed it at a din@@ ner par@@ ty , it would have been , you know , the w@@ ine experience of my li@@ fe@@ time , and incredi@@ bly me@@ mo@@ ra@@ ble ."
"But dr@@ in@@ king 60 great w@@ ines over three days , they all just bl@@ ur@@ red together , and it bec@@ ame almost a gr@@ u@@ el@@ ing experience ."
And I just wanted to fin@@ ish by men@@ tion@@ ing a very interesting study which came out ear@@ li@@ er this year from some rese@@ arch@@ ers at S@@ tan@@ for@@ d and C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h .
"And they gave sub@@ jects the same w@@ ine , lab@@ el@@ ed with different pr@@ ice t@@ ag@@ s ."
"A lot of people , you know , said that they li@@ ked the more exp@@ en@@ sive w@@ ine more — it was the same w@@ ine , but they thought it was a different one that was more exp@@ en@@ sive ."
"But what was un@@ expec@@ ted was that these rese@@ arch@@ ers did M@@ R@@ I brain imag@@ ing while the people were dr@@ in@@ king the w@@ ine , and not only did they say they en@@ jo@@ yed the more exp@@ en@@ si@@ vely lab@@ el@@ ed w@@ ine more — their brain actually re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed as experien@@ cing more pl@@ eas@@ ure from the same w@@ ine when it was lab@@ el@@ ed with a high@@ er pr@@ ice ta@@ g ."
Thank you .
How do you ob@@ ser@@ ve something you can &apos;t see ?
This is the bas@@ ic question of somebody who &apos;s interes@@ ted in fin@@ ding and stud@@ ying black hol@@ es .
"Because black hol@@ es are ob@@ jects wh@@ ose pul@@ l of grav@@ ity is so in@@ ten@@ se that nothing can es@@ cap@@ e it , not even light , so you can &apos;t see it direc@@ tly ."
"So , my story today about black hol@@ es is about one particular black hole ."
"I &apos;m interes@@ ted in fin@@ ding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call &quot; &quot; super@@ massive &quot; &quot; black hole at the center of our galaxy ."
And the reason this is interesting is that it giv@@ es us an opportun@@ ity to pro@@ ve whether or not these ex@@ ot@@ ic ob@@ jects really ex@@ ist .
"And second , it giv@@ es us the opportun@@ ity to understand how these super@@ massive black hol@@ es inter@@ act with their environ@@ ment , and to understand how they af@@ fect the forma@@ tion and evolution of the galaxies which they res@@ ide in ."
"So , to be@@ gin with , we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the pro@@ of of a black hole ."
"So , what is a black hole ?"
"Well , in many ways a black hole is an incredi@@ bly simple object , because there are only three charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics that you can descri@@ be : the mass , the sp@@ in , and the ch@@ arg@@ e ."
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
"So , in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple object ."
"But in another sense , it &apos;s an incredi@@ bly compl@@ ic@@ ated object that we need rel@@ ati@@ vely ex@@ ot@@ ic physics to descri@@ be , and in some sense re@@ pres@@ ents the bre@@ ak@@ down of our physical understanding of the universe ."
"But today , the way I want you to understand a black hole , for the pro@@ of of a black hole , is to think of it as an object wh@@ ose mass is con@@ fin@@ ed to z@@ ero v@@ olu@@ me ."
"So , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that I &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s super@@ massive , and I &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size ."
"So , this is a little tric@@ k@@ y ."
"But for@@ tun@@ ately there is a fin@@ ite size that you can see , and that &apos;s known as the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
And that &apos;s n@@ amed after the guy who reco@@ gni@@ z@@ ed why it was such an important radi@@ us .
"This is a vir@@ tual radi@@ us , not reality ; the black hole has no size ."
So why is it so important ?
It &apos;s important because it tel@@ ls us that any object can become a black hole .
"That means you , your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , your cel@@ l@@ ph@@ one , the au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um can become a black hole if you can figure out how to com@@ pres@@ s it down to the size of the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
"A@@ t that point , what &apos;s going to happen ?"
A@@ t that point grav@@ ity w@@ ins .
G@@ rav@@ ity w@@ ins over all other known for@@ ces .
And the object is for@@ ced to contin@@ ue to coll@@ ap@@ se to an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely small object .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
"So , if I were to com@@ pres@@ s the Earth down to the size of a su@@ ga@@ r cu@@ be , it would become a black hole , because the size of a su@@ ga@@ r cu@@ be is its S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
"Now , the k@@ ey here is to figure out what that S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is ."
And it turns out that it &apos;s actually pretty simple to figure out .
It de@@ pen@@ ds only on the mass of the object .
B@@ ig@@ ger ob@@ jects have big@@ ger S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ i .
S@@ m@@ all@@ er ob@@ jects have sm@@ all@@ er S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ i .
"So , if I were to take the su@@ n and com@@ pres@@ s it down to the sc@@ ale of the Un@@ iver@@ sity of O@@ x@@ for@@ d , it would become a black hole ."
"So , now we know what a S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is ."
"And it &apos;s actually quite a us@@ ef@@ ul con@@ cept , because it tel@@ ls us not only when a black hole will form , but it also giv@@ es us the k@@ ey el@@ em@@ ents for the pro@@ of of a black hole ."
I only need two things .
"I need to understand the mass of the object I &apos;m cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing is a black hole , and what its S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is ."
"And since the mass de@@ ter@@ min@@ es the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us , there is actually only one thing I really need to know ."
"So , my job in con@@ vin@@ cing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ed to within its S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
And your job today is to be sk@@ ep@@ tical .
"O@@ kay , so , I &apos;m going to talk about no ordin@@ ary black hole ; I &apos;m going to talk about super@@ massive black hol@@ es ."
"So , I wanted to say a few words about what an ordin@@ ary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordin@@ ary black hole ."
A@@ n ordin@@ ary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star &apos;s life .
"So , if a star star@@ ts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Su@@ n , it &apos;s going to end its life by explo@@ ding and le@@ av@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind these beautiful super@@ no@@ va re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts that we see here ."
And inside that super@@ no@@ va re@@ m@@ n@@ ant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass rou@@ gh@@ ly three times the mass of the Su@@ n .
O@@ n an astro@@ nom@@ ical sc@@ ale that &apos;s a very small black hole .
"Now , what I want to talk about are the super@@ massive black hol@@ es ."
And the super@@ massive black hol@@ es are thought to res@@ ide at the center of galaxies .
And this beautiful picture taken with the H@@ ub@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace Tel@@ esc@@ ope sho@@ ws you that galaxies come in all shap@@ es and si@@ z@@ es .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
A@@ l@@ most every object in that picture there is a galaxy .
And there is a very n@@ ice sp@@ i@@ ral up in the up@@ per left .
"And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy , just to give you a sense of sc@@ ale ."
"And all the light that we see from a typ@@ ical galaxy , which is the kind of galaxies that we &apos;re seeing here , comes from the light from the stars ."
"So , we see the galaxy because of the star light ."
"Now , there are a few rel@@ ati@@ vely ex@@ ot@@ ic galaxies ."
"I like to call these the pri@@ ma don@@ na of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show off@@ s ."
And we call them ac@@ tive gal@@ ac@@ tic n@@ uc@@ le@@ i .
"And we call them that because their n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , or their center , are very ac@@ tive ."
"So , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from ."
"And yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be expla@@ ined by the star@@ light ."
It &apos;s way more ener@@ ge@@ tic .
"In fact , in a few exam@@ pl@@ es it &apos;s like the ones that we &apos;re seeing here ."
There are also j@@ ets em@@ an@@ ating out from the center .
"A@@ ga@@ in , a s@@ our@@ ce of energy that &apos;s very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are com@@ posed of stars ."
"So , what people have thought is that perhaps there are super@@ massive black hol@@ es which matter is f@@ all@@ ing on to ."
"So , you can &apos;t see the black hole itself , but you can con@@ ver@@ t the grav@@ it@@ ational energy of the black hole into the light we see ."
"So , there is the thought that maybe super@@ massive black hol@@ es ex@@ ist at the center of galaxies ."
But it &apos;s a kind of in@@ direc@@ t argum@@ ent .
"@@ N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s given r@@ ise to the not@@ ion that maybe it &apos;s not just these pri@@ ma don@@ nas that have these super@@ massive black hol@@ es , but rather all galaxies might har@@ b@@ or these super@@ massive black hol@@ es at their cen@@ ters ."
And if that &apos;s the case — and this is an example of a nor@@ mal galaxy ; what we see is the star light .
"And if there is a super@@ massive black hole , what we need to as@@ su@@ me is that it &apos;s a black hole on a di@@ et ."
Because that is the way to sup@@ pres@@ s the ener@@ ge@@ tic ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena that we see in ac@@ tive gal@@ ac@@ tic n@@ uc@@ le@@ i .
"If we &apos;re going to look for these ste@@ al@@ th black hol@@ es at the center of galaxies , the best place to look is in our own galaxy , our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay ."
And this is a w@@ ide field picture taken of the center of the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay .
And what we see is a line of stars .
"And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a fl@@ at@@ ten@@ ed , dis@@ k@@ -@@ like structure ."
"And we live in the middle of it , so when we look to@@ wards the center , we see this plan@@ e which defin@@ es the plan@@ e of the galaxy , or line that defin@@ es the plan@@ e of the galaxy ."
"Now , the adv@@ ant@@ age of stud@@ ying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the clo@@ s@@ est example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next clo@@ s@@ est galaxy is 100 times fur@@ ther away ."
"So , we can see far more deta@@ il in our galaxy than any@@ place else ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in a moment , the ability to see deta@@ il is k@@ ey to this experiment ."
"So , how do astro@@ nom@@ ers pro@@ ve that there is a lot of mass inside a small v@@ olu@@ me ?"
Wh@@ ich is the job that I have to show you today .
And the to@@ ol that we use is to wat@@ ch the way stars or@@ bit the black hole .
St@@ ars will or@@ bit the black hole in the very same way that plan@@ ets or@@ bit the su@@ n .
It &apos;s the grav@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l that makes these things or@@ bit .
"If there were no massive ob@@ jects these things would go fl@@ ying off , or at le@@ ast go at a much s@@ lower rate because all that de@@ ter@@ min@@ es how they go around is how much mass is inside its or@@ bit ."
"So , this is great , because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small v@@ olu@@ me ."
"So , if I know how f@@ ast it goes around , I know the mass ."
And if I know the sc@@ ale of the or@@ bit I know the radi@@ us .
"So , I want to see the stars that are as clo@@ se to the center of the galaxy as possible ."
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a regi@@ on as possible .
"So , this means that I want to see a lot of deta@@ il ."
And that &apos;s the reason that for this experiment we &apos;ve used the world &apos;s larg@@ est tel@@ esc@@ ope .
"This is the K@@ ec@@ k observ@@ at@@ ory . It ho@@ st@@ s two tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es with a mir@@ ro@@ r 10 me@@ ters , which is rou@@ gh@@ ly the di@@ ame@@ ter of a ten@@ nis cour@@ t ."
"Now , this is wonderful , because the cam@@ pa@@ ign prom@@ ise of large tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es is that is that the big@@ ger the tel@@ esc@@ ope , the sm@@ all@@ er the deta@@ il that we can see ."
"But it turns out these tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es , or any tel@@ esc@@ ope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this cam@@ pa@@ ign prom@@ ise ."
And that is because of the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here .
A@@ t@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is great for us ; it al@@ lo@@ ws us to surv@@ ive here on Earth .
But it &apos;s rel@@ ati@@ vely chall@@ eng@@ ing for astro@@ nom@@ ers who want to look through the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here to astro@@ nom@@ ical s@@ our@@ ces .
"So , to give you a sense of what this is like , it &apos;s actually like looking at a p@@ eb@@ ble at the bot@@ tom of a stre@@ am ."
"@@ L@@ o@@ o@@ king at the p@@ eb@@ ble on the bot@@ tom of the stre@@ am , the stre@@ am is contin@@ u@@ ously mov@@ ing and tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent , and that makes it very difficult to see the p@@ eb@@ ble on the bot@@ tom of the stre@@ am ."
"@@ V@@ er@@ y much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astro@@ nom@@ ical s@@ our@@ ces , because of the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here that &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ously mov@@ ing by ."
"So , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot of my career working on ways to cor@@ rec@@ t for the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , to give us a c@@ le@@ an@@ er view ."
And that bu@@ ys us about a fac@@ tor of 20 .
"And I think all of you can ag@@ ree that if you can figure out how to impro@@ ve life by a fac@@ tor of 20 , you &apos;ve probably impro@@ ved your lif@@ est@@ y@@ le by a lot , say your sal@@ ary , you &apos;d not@@ ice , or your kids , you &apos;d not@@ ice ."
"And this an@@ ima@@ tion here sho@@ ws you one example of the tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that we use , called ada@@ p@@ tive op@@ tics ."
"You &apos;re seeing an an@@ ima@@ tion that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e — in other words , just a picture that sho@@ ws the stars — and the bo@@ x is cen@@ ter@@ ed on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is ."
"So , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars ."
W@@ ith this technology all of a su@@ d@@ den you can see it .
This technology works by in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing a mir@@ ro@@ r into the tel@@ esc@@ ope op@@ tics system that &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ously chang@@ ing to coun@@ ter@@ act what the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here is doing to you .
"So , it &apos;s kind of like very f@@ an@@ cy e@@ ye@@ gl@@ as@@ ses for your tel@@ esc@@ ope ."
"Now , in the next few sl@@ ides I &apos;m just going to foc@@ us on that little s@@ qu@@ are there ."
"So , we &apos;re only going to look at the stars inside that small s@@ qu@@ are , al@@ though we &apos;ve looked at all of them ."
"So , I want to see how these things have mov@@ ed ."
"And over the course of this experiment , these stars have mov@@ ed a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amount ."
"So , we &apos;ve been doing this experiment for 15 years , and we see the stars go all the way around ."
"Now , most astro@@ nom@@ ers have a fav@@ or@@ ite star , and mine today is a star that &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed up there , S@@ O@@ -@@ 2 ."
A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely my fav@@ or@@ ite star in the world .
And that &apos;s because it goes around in only 15 years .
"And to give you a sense of how shor@@ t that is , the su@@ n takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy ."
"S@@ t@@ ars that we knew about before , that were as clo@@ se to the center of the galaxy as possible , take 5@@ 00 years ."
"And this one , this one goes around in a human li@@ fe@@ time ."
"That &apos;s kind of prof@@ ound , in a way ."
But it &apos;s the k@@ ey to this experiment . The or@@ bit tel@@ ls me how much mass is inside a very small radi@@ us .
"So , next we see a picture here that sho@@ ws you before this experiment the size to which we could con@@ fin@@ e the mass of the center of the galaxy ."
What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the su@@ n inside that cir@@ cle .
"And as you can see , there was a lot of other stuff inside that cir@@ cle ."
You can see a lot of stars .
"So , there was actually lots of al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves to the idea that there was a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there ."
"But with this experiment , we &apos;ve con@@ fin@@ ed that same mass to a much sm@@ all@@ er v@@ olu@@ me that &apos;s 1@@ 0,000 times sm@@ all@@ er ."
"And because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there ."
"@@ To give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our sol@@ ar system ."
"So , we &apos;re c@@ ram@@ m@@ ing four million times the mass of the su@@ n into that small v@@ olu@@ me ."
"Now , tr@@ uth in adv@@ ert@@ is@@ ing . R@@ ight ?"
I have told you my job is to get it down to the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ child radi@@ us .
"And the tr@@ uth is , I &apos;m not quite there ."
But we actually have no al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive today to expla@@ ining this con@@ cent@@ ration of mass .
"And , in fact , it &apos;s the best evidence we have to da@@ te for not only ex@@ ist@@ ence of a super@@ massive black hole at the center of our own galaxy , but any in our universe ."
"So , what next ? I actually think this is about as good as we &apos;re going to do with today &apos;s technology , so let &apos;s move on with the problem ."
"So , what I want to tell you , very bri@@ ef@@ ly , is a few exam@@ pl@@ es of the exc@@ it@@ ement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at le@@ ast we believe , that there is a super@@ massive black hole there ."
"And the fu@@ n ph@@ ase of this experiment is , while we &apos;ve tes@@ ted some of our ideas about the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences of a super@@ massive black hole being at the center of our galaxy , almost every single one has been in@@ con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent with what we actually see ."
And that &apos;s the fu@@ n .
"So , let me give you the two exam@@ pl@@ es ."
"You can ask , &quot; &quot; What do you exp@@ ect for the old stars , stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time , they &apos;ve had pl@@ ent@@ y of time to inter@@ act with the black hole . &quot; &quot; What you exp@@ ect there is that old stars should be very cl@@ ust@@ er@@ ed around the black hole ."
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e@@ w@@ ise , for the young stars , or in con@@ tra@@ st , the young stars , they just should not be there ."
A black hole does not make a kind ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or to a st@@ el@@ l@@ ar n@@ ur@@ ser@@ y .
"@@ To get a star to form , you need a big b@@ all of ga@@ s and d@@ ust to coll@@ ap@@ se ."
And it &apos;s a very fra@@ g@@ ile ent@@ ity .
And what does the big black hole do ?
It st@@ ri@@ ps that ga@@ s cl@@ ou@@ d ap@@ art .
It pul@@ ls much st@@ ron@@ ger on one side than the other and the cl@@ ou@@ d is st@@ ri@@ pped ap@@ art .
"In fact , we an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that star forma@@ tion sh@@ ouldn &apos;t pro@@ ce@@ ed in that environ@@ ment ."
"So , you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t see young stars ."
"So , what do we see ?"
"@@ U@@ sing observ@@ ations that are not the ones I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you today , we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young ."
The old ones are red .
"The young ones are bl@@ ue . And the y@@ el@@ low ones , we don &apos;t know yet ."
"So , you can already see the sur@@ pr@@ ise ."
There is a de@@ arth of old stars .
"There is an ab@@ und@@ ance of young stars , so it &apos;s the ex@@ act op@@ pos@@ ite of the predic@@ tion ."
"So , this is the fu@@ n part ."
"And in fact , today , this is what we &apos;re trying to figure out , this my@@ ster@@ y of how do you get — how do you res@@ ol@@ ve this cont@@ rad@@ ic@@ tion ."
"So , in fact , my grad@@ u@@ ate students are , at this very moment , today , at the tel@@ esc@@ ope , in H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i , making observ@@ ations to get us h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to the next stage , where we can ad@@ d@@ ress this question of why are there so many young stars , and so few old stars ."
To make fur@@ ther progress we really need to look at the or@@ b@@ its of stars that are much fur@@ ther away .
To do that we &apos;ll probably need much more soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated technology than we have today .
"Because , in tr@@ uth , while I said we &apos;re cor@@ rec@@ ting for the Earth &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , we actually only cor@@ rec@@ t for half the er@@ ro@@ r@@ s that are in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed ."
"We do this by sho@@ ot@@ ing a las@@ er up into the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here , and what we think we can do is if we sh@@ ine a few more that we can cor@@ rec@@ t the rest ."
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
"And on a much longer time sc@@ ale , what we hope to do is build even larg@@ er tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es , because , remember , big@@ ger is better in astro@@ no@@ my ."
"So , we want to build a 30 me@@ ter tel@@ esc@@ ope ."
And with this tel@@ esc@@ ope we should be able to see stars that are even clo@@ s@@ er to the center of the galaxy .
"And we hope to be able to test some of E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s the@@ or@@ ies of gener@@ al rel@@ ati@@ vity , some ideas in co@@ smo@@ lo@@ gy about how galaxies form ."
"So , we think the future of this experiment is quite exc@@ iting ."
"So , in con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , I &apos;m going to show you an an@@ ima@@ tion that basically sho@@ ws you how these or@@ b@@ its have been mov@@ ing , in three dimensions ."
"And I hope , if nothing else , I &apos;ve con@@ vin@@ ced you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy ."
"And this means that these things do ex@@ ist in our universe , and we have to cont@@ end with this , we have to explain how you can get these ob@@ jects in our physical world ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , we &apos;ve been able to look at that inter@@ action of how super@@ massive black hol@@ es inter@@ act , and understand , maybe , the ro@@ le in which they play in shap@@ ing what galaxies are , and how they work ."
"And last but not le@@ ast , n@@ one of this would have happened without the adv@@ ent of the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous progress that &apos;s been made on the technology front ."
"And we think that this is a field that is mov@@ ing incredi@@ bly f@@ ast , and hol@@ ds a lot in stor@@ e for the future ."
Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 4@@ 5 ye@@ ar-@@ old love story with the po@@ or , living on less than one doll@@ ar a day ."
"I went to a very el@@ it@@ ist , s@@ nob@@ b@@ ish , exp@@ en@@ sive education in India , and that almost des@@ tro@@ yed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ p@@ lo@@ mat , teacher , doc@@ tor — all la@@ id out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the In@@ dian national s@@ qu@@ as@@ h ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was la@@ id out for me .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st B@@ i@@ h@@ ar fam@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , death , people d@@ ying of h@@ un@@ ger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a com@@ a .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is la@@ id out for you , the best j@@ obs are la@@ id out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best educ@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"@@ No job , no money , no sec@@ ur@@ ity , no pro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ g wel@@ ls for five years ?"
"You went to the most exp@@ en@@ sive school and college in India , and you want to di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t spe@@ ak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ posed to the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary knowledge and sk@@ il@@ ls that very po@@ or people have , which are never b@@ rou@@ ght into the main@@ stre@@ am — which is never id@@ enti@@ fied , res@@ pec@@ ted , app@@ li@@ ed on a large sc@@ ale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — college only for the po@@ or .
What the po@@ or thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ ld@@ ers came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the pol@@ ice ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fa@@ il@@ ed in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at P@@ aris and New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and Z@@ ur@@ ich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the po@@ or ."
What the po@@ or thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted in the college . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ d@@ ers gave me some very sound and prof@@ ound ad@@ vic@@ e .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ gre@@ e and qu@@ ali@@ fic@@ ation into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a M@@ as@@ ter &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a c@@ op@@ -@@ out or a wa@@ sh@@ -@@ out or a dro@@ po@@ ut to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a di@@ gn@@ ity of lab@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can of@@ fer to the commun@@ ity and pro@@ v@@ ide a ser@@ vic@@ e to the commun@@ ity .
"So we started the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed profes@@ sion@@ al@@ ism ."
Wh@@ o is a profes@@ sion@@ al ?
"A profes@@ sion@@ al is someone who has a com@@ bin@@ ation of comp@@ et@@ ence , con@@ f@@ idence and beli@@ ef ."
A water div@@ in@@ er is a profes@@ sion@@ al .
A t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al mid@@ wi@@ fe is a profes@@ sion@@ al .
A t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al b@@ one s@@ et@@ ter is a profes@@ sion@@ al .
These are profes@@ sion@@ als all over the world .
You find them in any in@@ acc@@ es@@ si@@ ble village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the main@@ stre@@ am and show that the knowledge and sk@@ il@@ ls that they have is univer@@ sal .
"It needs to be used , needs to be app@@ li@@ ed , needs to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these knowledge and sk@@ il@@ ls are rel@@ ev@@ ant even today ."
So the college works fol@@ lowing the lif@@ est@@ y@@ le and work@@ st@@ y@@ le of Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"You e@@ at on the f@@ lo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the f@@ lo@@ or , you work on the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ trac@@ ts , no writ@@ ten con@@ trac@@ ts ."
"You can st@@ ay with me for 20 years , go to@@ mor@@ row ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
"Wh@@ at@@ ever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fa@@ il .
"B@@ at@@ ter@@ ed , br@@ u@@ ised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate .
You are c@@ erti@@ fied by the commun@@ ity you ser@@ ve .
You don &apos;t need a p@@ aper to han@@ g on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 1@@ 50 people liv@@ ed there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ h@@ an A@@ ward for A@@ rch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they s@@ us@@ pec@@ ted , they thought there was an arch@@ it@@ ect be@@ h@@ ind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts , but the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts actually con@@ struc@@ ted the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the aw@@ ard for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually cas@@ ting as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia ."
"I asked a for@@ es@@ ter — high@@ -@@ power@@ ed , p@@ ap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied exper@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ il and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
Not even wor@@ th it .
"@@ No water , roc@@ k@@ y so@@ il . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a spo@@ t ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this spo@@ t ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lear out ."
The men should c@@ lear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ ger@@ y , a bit of ur@@ ens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t le@@ ak .
"S@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 8@@ 6 , it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t le@@ ak@@ ed ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied .
All the power comes from the su@@ n .
4@@ 5 kilo@@ wat@@ ts of pan@@ els on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the su@@ n for the next 25 years .
"So long as the su@@ n shin@@ es , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the be@@ aut@@ y is that is was inst@@ all@@ ed by a pri@@ est , a H@@ ind@@ u pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ mar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to college ."
He kno@@ ws more about sol@@ ar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
"F@@ ood , if you come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ ked ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ated that sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ k@@ er are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ate the most soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ k@@ er ."
It &apos;s a par@@ ab@@ oli@@ c S@@ ch@@ ef@@ fl@@ er sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ k@@ er .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , they &apos;re almost half G@@ er@@ man , they &apos;re so prec@@ ise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find In@@ dian women so prec@@ ise .
"A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that co@@ o@@ k@@ er ."
And we have 60 me@@ als tw@@ ice a day of sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ king .
"We have a den@@ t@@ ist — she &apos;s a grand@@ mother , il@@ liter@@ ate , who &apos;s a den@@ t@@ ist ."
"She actually looks after the te@@ et@@ h of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot technology : this was 19@@ 8@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no arch@@ it@@ ect thought of it — but we are col@@ lec@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ of@@ s ."
V@@ er@@ y little water is was@@ ted .
"A@@ ll the ro@@ of@@ s are connec@@ ted under@@ ground to a 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 lit@@ er tan@@ k , and no water is was@@ ted ."
"If we have four years of dro@@ u@@ ght , we still have water on the cam@@ p@@ us , because we coll@@ ect ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after an@@ im@@ als — she@@ ep , go@@ at@@ s — dom@@ es@@ tic ch@@ or@@ es ."
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children .
"Because the night scho@@ ols of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia , over 7@@ 5@@ ,000 children have gone through these night scho@@ ols ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we te@@ ach in these scho@@ ols ?
"D@@ emo@@ cra@@ cy , c@@ it@@ iz@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed , what you should do if your an@@ ima@@ l is sic@@ k ."
This is what we te@@ ach in the night scho@@ ols .
But all the scho@@ ols are sol@@ ar-@@ l@@ it .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"B@@ et@@ ween six to 1@@ 4 ye@@ ar-@@ old children par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in a democra@@ tic process , and they el@@ ect a pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter ."
The pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 go@@ at@@ s in the mor@@ ning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter in the even@@ ing ."
"She has a c@@ ab@@ inet , a min@@ is@@ ter of education , a min@@ is@@ ter for energy , a min@@ is@@ ter for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ it@@ or and super@@ v@@ ise 1@@ 50 scho@@ ols for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"She got the W@@ or@@ ld &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s P@@ ri@@ ze five years ago , and she went to S@@ w@@ ed@@ en ."
F@@ ir@@ st time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever seen S@@ w@@ ed@@ en .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t da@@ z@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en of S@@ w@@ ed@@ en , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you ask this child where she got her con@@ f@@ idence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not da@@ z@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the gir@@ l , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the qu@@ e@@ en stra@@ ight in the ey@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ere the per@@ cent@@ age of il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y is very high , we use p@@ up@@ p@@ et@@ ry ."
P@@ up@@ p@@ ets is the way we commun@@ ic@@ ate .
You have J@@ o@@ kh@@ im Ch@@ ach@@ a who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my p@@ sy@@ cho@@ anal@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
He &apos;s my don@@ or .
"He actually ra@@ is@@ es money , sol@@ ves my dis@@ p@@ utes ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s ten@@ sion in the village , if at@@ ten@@ dan@@ ce at the scho@@ ols goes down and there &apos;s a fr@@ ic@@ tion between the teacher and the par@@ ent , the p@@ up@@ p@@ et call@@ s the teacher and the par@@ ent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ake hands ."
The at@@ ten@@ dan@@ ce must not dro@@ p . &quot; &quot; These p@@ up@@ p@@ ets are made out of rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank re@@ por@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , de@@ my@@ s@@ ti@@ fied appro@@ ach of sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ f@@ ying vill@@ ages , we &apos;ve c@@ over@@ ed all over India from L@@ ada@@ k@@ h up to B@@ h@@ ut@@ an — all sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied vill@@ ages by people who have been tra@@ ined ."
"And we went to L@@ ada@@ k@@ h , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both sid@@ es — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the ben@@ ef@@ it you had from sol@@ ar elec@@ tric@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a min@@ ute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s face in w@@ in@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
One les@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tra@@ in@@ able .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are amb@@ it@@ ious , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely mo@@ bil@@ e , and they all want a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ ll across the glob@@ e , you have this ten@@ den@@ cy of men wan@@ ting a c@@ erti@@ fic@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a c@@ ity , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great solu@@ tion : tra@@ in grand@@ mo@@ thers .
What &apos;s the best way of commun@@ ic@@ ating in the world today ?
Tel@@ ev@@ ision ? No .
Tel@@ e@@ gra@@ p@@ h ? No .
Tel@@ e@@ ph@@ one ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan for the first time , and we pic@@ ked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ m@@ possible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ oms , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ c@@ es@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intelli@@ gent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tra@@ in these women ?"
S@@ ign language .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the writ@@ ten word .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the spo@@ ken word .
You use si@@ g@@ n language .
And in six months they can become sol@@ ar engine@@ ers .
They go back and sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied the first village , set up a work@@ sho@@ p — the first village ever to be sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This w@@ om@@ an@@ "
is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary grand@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied 200 h@@ ous@@ es for me in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan ."
And they hav@@ en &apos;t coll@@ ap@@ sed .
She actually went and spo@@ ke to an engine@@ ering de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tra@@ ined 2@@ 7 more women and sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied 100 vill@@ ages in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan .
"We went to A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and we did the same thing ."
"A@@ ll these women sit@@ ting at one table from eight , n@@ ine countries , all ch@@ at@@ ting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speak@@ ing a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speak@@ ing to each other and actually becom@@ ing sol@@ ar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ ier@@ ra L@@ e@@ one , and there was this min@@ is@@ ter driv@@ ing down in the de@@ ad of night — comes across this village ."
"C@@ om@@ es back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grand@@ mo@@ thers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ and@@ mo@@ thers ? &quot; &quot; The min@@ is@@ ter couldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Wh@@ ere did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent stra@@ ight to the pres@@ id@@ ent .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a sol@@ ar-@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied village in S@@ ier@@ ra L@@ e@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the c@@ ab@@ inet went to see the grand@@ mo@@ thers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he sum@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you tra@@ in me 1@@ 50 grand@@ mo@@ thers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ res@@ id@@ ent ."
But they will . The grand@@ mo@@ thers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot tra@@ ining center in S@@ ier@@ ra L@@ e@@ one .
And 1@@ 50 grand@@ mo@@ thers have been tra@@ ined in S@@ ier@@ ra L@@ e@@ one .
G@@ amb@@ ia : we went to sel@@ ect a grand@@ mother in G@@ amb@@ ia .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The commun@@ ity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ake these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speak@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ if@@ fic@@ ult h@@ us@@ b@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ all@@ ed the h@@ us@@ b@@ and , the h@@ us@@ b@@ and came , s@@ w@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing , polit@@ ician , mo@@ bil@@ e in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an In@@ dian man ? &quot;"
That was his big@@ gest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll r@@ ing you up on the mo@@ bil@@ e . &quot; &quot; She went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and spo@@ ke to the whole pres@@ s as if she was a v@@ et@@ er@@ an .
"She h@@ and@@ led the national pres@@ s , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere &apos;s your h@@ us@@ b@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) S@@ uc@@ c@@ ess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just w@@ ind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solu@@ tions outside .
L@@ o@@ ok for solu@@ tions within .
And list@@ en to people . They have the solu@@ tions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
D@@ on &apos;t even wor@@ ry .
"D@@ on &apos;t list@@ en to the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , list@@ en to the people on the ground ."
They have all the solu@@ tions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quot@@ ation by Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ ir@@ st they ign@@ ore you , then they l@@ au@@ gh at you , then they fi@@ ght you , and then you w@@ in . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"@@ 18 minutes is an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely br@@ ut@@ al time li@@ mit , so I &apos;m going to d@@ ive stra@@ ight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work ."
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
"I &apos;m going to talk about fe@@ asi@@ bility as well , of course ."
I &apos;m going to do that in two ste@@ ps .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
"Now , I want to ask a question ."
H@@ an@@ ds up : any@@ one in the audi@@ ence who is in fav@@ or of mal@@ aria ?
That was easy . O@@ K .
O@@ K . H@@ an@@ ds up : any@@ one in the audi@@ ence who &apos;s not sure whether mal@@ aria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
O@@ K . So we all think mal@@ aria is a bad thing .
And here is that charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
The only real difference is that ag@@ ing k@@ il@@ ls consid@@ er@@ ably more people than mal@@ aria does .
"I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic audi@@ ence here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not enti@@ rel@@ y per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed by this log@@ ic ."
"And this is actually a rather good com@@ par@@ is@@ on , it seems to me ."
"You know , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , c@@ ity bo@@ ys have no business telling us ru@@ ral typ@@ es what to do with our time ."
"It &apos;s a t@@ rad@@ it@@ ion@@ al part of the way of life , and we should be al@@ lowed to car@@ ry on doing it ."
What part of this do people not understand ?
"It &apos;s not just about life , of course — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s about heal@@ thy life , you know — getting fra@@ il and mis@@ er@@ able and de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent is no fu@@ n , whether or not d@@ ying may be fu@@ n ."
"So really , this is how I would like to descri@@ be it ."
It &apos;s a global tr@@ ance .
"But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of pro@@ por@@ tion ."
"You know , these are argum@@ ents ; these are things that would be le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ mate to be con@@ cer@@ ned about ."
"But the question is , are they so dan@@ ger@@ ous — these ris@@ ks of doing something about ag@@ ing — that they ou@@ tw@@ e@@ igh the do@@ w@@ n@@ side of doing the op@@ pos@@ ite , nam@@ ely , le@@ av@@ ing ag@@ ing as it is ?"
"A@@ re these so bad that they ou@@ tw@@ e@@ igh con@@ de@@ m@@ ning 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people a day to an un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily early death ?"
"You know , if you hav@@ en &apos;t got an argum@@ ent that &apos;s that st@@ rong , then just don &apos;t was@@ te my time , is what I say ."
"( Laughter ) Now , there is one argum@@ ent that some people do think really is that st@@ rong , and here it is ."
"I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a dil@@ em@@ ma in this res@@ p@@ ect ."
"We will have to dec@@ ide whether to have a low bir@@ th rate , or a high death rate ."
"And , I say that that &apos;s fin@@ e — the future of hum@@ an@@ ity is ent@@ it@@ led to make that cho@@ ice ."
What &apos;s not fin@@ e is for us to make that cho@@ ice on be@@ half of the future .
And the fundamental answer is that the pro@@ -@@ ag@@ ing tr@@ ance is not as d@@ um@@ b as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sen@@ si@@ ble way of c@@ op@@ ing with the in@@ ev@@ it@@ ability of ag@@ ing .
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , for example , making up these r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous reas@@ ons why ag@@ ing is actually a good thing after all ."
"But of course , that only works when we have both of these com@@ pon@@ ents ."
This pro@@ -@@ ag@@ ing tr@@ ance is what st@@ op@@ s us from ag@@ it@@ ating about these things .
"And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot — ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ ze , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot — in order to get people &apos;s at@@ ten@@ tion , and make people real@@ ize that they are in a tr@@ ance in this re@@ gar@@ d ."
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about fe@@ asi@@ bility .
"And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that ag@@ ing is in@@ ev@@ it@@ able is sum@@ m@@ ed up in a defin@@ ition of ag@@ ing that I &apos;m giving here ."
A very simple defin@@ ition .
"A@@ ging is a side ef@@ fect of being al@@ ive in the first place , which is to say , met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism ."
This is not a completely ta@@ ut@@ ological stat@@ ement ; it &apos;s a reas@@ on@@ able stat@@ ement .
"A@@ ging is basically a process that happens to in@@ an@@ i@@ mate ob@@ jects like c@@ ars , and it also happens to us , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that we have a lot of cl@@ ever self-@@ re@@ pa@@ ir me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms , because those self-@@ re@@ pa@@ ir me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms are not per@@ fect ."
"So basically , met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism , which is defin@@ ed as basically everything that ke@@ e@@ ps us al@@ ive from one day to the next , has side effec@@ ts ."
"And there are really two gam@@ es in to@@ wn , ac@@ cor@@ ding to most people , with re@@ gar@@ d to pos@@ t@@ po@@ ning ag@@ ing ."
"They &apos;re what I &apos;m call@@ ing here the &quot; &quot; ger@@ on@@ t@@ ology appro@@ ach &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; ger@@ i@@ at@@ ric@@ s appro@@ ach . &quot; &quot; The ger@@ i@@ at@@ ric@@ ian will inter@@ ven@@ e l@@ ate in the day , when pa@@ th@@ ology is becom@@ ing ev@@ id@@ ent , and the ger@@ i@@ at@@ ric@@ ian will try and hold back the san@@ ds of time , and stop the acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ation of side effec@@ ts from ca@@ using the pa@@ th@@ ology quite so so@@ on ."
"The ger@@ on@@ t@@ ology appro@@ ach looks much more prom@@ is@@ ing on the sur@@ face , because , you know , pre@@ ven@@ tion is better than c@@ ure ."
But un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism very well .
"So then , what do we do about that ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s a fin@@ e log@@ ic , that s@@ oun@@ ds pretty con@@ vin@@ cing , pretty i@@ ron@@ cl@@ ad , doesn &apos;t it ?"
But it isn &apos;t .
"B@@ e@@ fore I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit into what I &apos;m call@@ ing step two ."
"@@ Just sup@@ pose , as I said , that we do ac@@ qu@@ ire — let &apos;s say we do it today for the sa@@ ke of argum@@ ent — the ability to con@@ fer 30 extra years of heal@@ thy life on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 5@@ 5 ."
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; &quot; rob@@ ust human re@@ j@@ u@@ ven@@ ation . &quot; &quot; O@@ K .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
"There are two sor@@ ts of technolo@@ g@@ ical progress really , for this pur@@ pose ."
"There are fundamental , maj@@ or bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s , and there are incre@@ mental re@@ fin@@ em@@ ents of those bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"Now , they dif@@ fer a great de@@ al in terms of the predic@@ t@@ ability of time f@@ rames ."
"We can think , really , that each one is sort of be@@ y@@ ond the imag@@ in@@ ation of the inv@@ ent@@ or of the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , if you like ."
The incre@@ mental adv@@ an@@ ces have ad@@ ded up to something which is not incre@@ mental any@@ more .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental bre@@ ak@@ through .
And you see it in all sor@@ ts of tech@@ nologi@@ es .
"So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all ."
"That in fact , the people who are young enough to ben@@ ef@@ it from these first ther@@ ap@@ ies that give this moder@@ ate amount of life ex@@ ten@@ sion , even though those people are already mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed when the ther@@ ap@@ ies ar@@ r@@ ive , will be at some sort of c@@ us@@ p ."
They will mo@@ st@@ ly surv@@ ive long enough to re@@ ce@@ ive impro@@ ved treat@@ ments that will give them a fur@@ ther 30 or maybe 50 years .
"In other words , they will be st@@ a@@ ying a@@ head of the ga@@ me ."
The ther@@ ap@@ ies will be impro@@ v@@ ing fas@@ ter than the re@@ main@@ ing im@@ per@@ fec@@ tions in the ther@@ ap@@ ies are cat@@ ch@@ ing up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
"Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predic@@ t that a lot of people al@@ ive today are going to live to 1@@ ,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to inv@@ ent ther@@ ap@@ ies in the next few dec@@ ades that are so th@@ o@@ rou@@ gh@@ ly el@@ im@@ in@@ ating ag@@ ing that those ther@@ ap@@ ies will let us live to 1@@ ,000 or more ."
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 3@@ 00 and 4@@ 00 and so on .
"I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; &quot; lon@@ g@@ ev@@ ity es@@ cap@@ e vel@@ oc@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , it seems to get the point across ."
"So , these tra@@ jec@@ t@@ or@@ ies here are basically how we would exp@@ ect people to live , in terms of re@@ main@@ ing life expec@@ tan@@ cy , as meas@@ ured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these ther@@ ap@@ ies ar@@ r@@ ive ."
"So this is a gen@@ u@@ ine con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion that I come to , that the first 1@@ 5@@ 0-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old — we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these fir@@ st@@ -@@ gener@@ ation ther@@ ap@@ ies ."
"But ir@@ res@@ pec@@ tive of that age , I &apos;m cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing that the first person to live to 1@@ ,000 — sub@@ ject of course , to , you know , global c@@ atas@@ tro@@ ph@@ es — is actually , probably , only about 10 years youn@@ ger than the first 1@@ 5@@ 0-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old ."
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
"A@@ l@@ right , so finally I &apos;m going to sp@@ end the rest of the talk , my last s@@ even@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes , on step one ; nam@@ ely , how do we actually get to this moder@@ ate amount of life ex@@ ten@@ sion that will al@@ low us to get to es@@ cap@@ e vel@@ oc@@ ity ?"
"And in order to do that , I need to talk about m@@ ice a little bit ."
I have a cor@@ respon@@ ding mil@@ est@@ one to rob@@ ust human re@@ j@@ u@@ ven@@ ation .
"I &apos;m call@@ ing it &quot; &quot; rob@@ ust mo@@ use re@@ j@@ u@@ ven@@ ation , &quot; &quot; not very imag@@ in@@ ati@@ vely ."
And this is what it is .
"I say we &apos;re going to take a lon@@ g@@ -@@ liv@@ ed stra@@ in of mo@@ use , which basically means m@@ ice that live about three years on average ."
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
"And then we do a whole bun@@ ch of stuff to them , and with those ther@@ ap@@ ies , we get them to live , on average , to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
"Wh@@ ich we can now , as I &apos;ve expla@@ ined , equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ently call ei@@ ther rob@@ ust human re@@ j@@ u@@ ven@@ ation or lon@@ g@@ ev@@ ity es@@ cap@@ e vel@@ oc@@ ity ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tion of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the m@@ ice ?"
"And thir@@ d@@ ly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?"
"And it seems to me that the first question is enti@@ rel@@ y a bi@@ ology question , and it &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely hard to answer ."
"One has to be very spec@@ ul@@ ative , and many of my colle@@ ag@@ ues would say that we should not do this spec@@ ul@@ ation , that we should simply keep our coun@@ se@@ l until we know more ."
I say that &apos;s n@@ on@@ sense .
I say we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely are ir@@ respon@@ si@@ ble if we st@@ ay sil@@ ent on this .
"We need to give our best gu@@ ess as to the time fra@@ me , in order to give people a sense of pro@@ por@@ tion so that they can as@@ s@@ ess their pri@@ or@@ ities ."
15 years from the rob@@ ust mo@@ use .
The public &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tion will probably be some@@ what better than that .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
"They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much ."
"That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that ag@@ ing is in@@ ev@@ it@@ able in hum@@ ans , since it &apos;s been pos@@ t@@ pon@@ ed so very effec@@ ti@@ vely in m@@ ice ."
"So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very st@@ rong change in people &apos;s at@@ tit@@ ud@@ es , and of course that has en@@ or@@ mo@@ us im@@ plic@@ ations ."
"So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these m@@ ice , I &apos;m going to ad@@ d a little bit to my descri@@ p@@ tion of ag@@ ing ."
But it is not part of met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism itself .
And ger@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ ans try to hold back the san@@ ds of time by st@@ op@@ ping the da@@ mag@@ e con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing into pa@@ th@@ ology .
And the reason it &apos;s a lo@@ sing b@@ at@@ tle is because the da@@ mag@@ e is contin@@ u@@ ing to acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate .
The engine@@ ering appro@@ ach does not inter@@ ven@@ e in any proc@@ ess@@ es .
It does not inter@@ ven@@ e in this process or this one .
"And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a lo@@ sing b@@ at@@ tle , and it &apos;s something that we are within ran@@ ge of being able to do , because it doesn &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve impro@@ v@@ ing on evolution ."
The point about this sl@@ ide is actually the bot@@ tom .
The l@@ ist on the right is also in@@ complet@@ e .
"It &apos;s a l@@ ist of typ@@ es of pa@@ th@@ ology that are ag@@ e-@@ rel@@ ated , and it &apos;s just an in@@ complet@@ e l@@ ist ."
And there are only seven of them .
"They &apos;re cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them ."
"C@@ ell lo@@ ss , m@@ ut@@ ations in ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , m@@ ut@@ ations in the mit@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dr@@ ia and so on ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argum@@ ent for why that l@@ ist is complet@@ e ."
"The answer is : lon@@ g@@ -@@ liv@@ ed mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es , because if a shor@@ t-@@ liv@@ ed mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e under@@ goes da@@ mag@@ e , but then the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e is des@@ tro@@ yed — like by a pro@@ te@@ in being des@@ tro@@ yed by pro@@ te@@ ol@@ y@@ sis — then the da@@ mag@@ e is gone , too ."
It &apos;s got to be lon@@ g@@ -@@ liv@@ ed mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es .
"S@@ ome of them are par@@ ti@@ ally im@@ pl@@ em@@ ented already , the ones at the top ."
"I hav@@ en &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion is that , if we can actually get su@@ it@@ able f@@ und@@ ing for this , then we can probably devel@@ op rob@@ ust mo@@ use re@@ j@@ u@@ ven@@ ation in only 10 years , but we do need to get ser@@ ious about it ."
We do need to really start trying .
"So of course , there are some bi@@ olog@@ ists in the audi@@ ence , and I want to give some ans@@ w@@ ers to some of the questions that you may have ."
"You may have been dis@@ sat@@ is@@ fied with this talk , but fundam@@ ent@@ ally you have to go and read this stuff ."
The deta@@ il is what makes me con@@ f@@ id@@ ent of my rather ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive time f@@ rames that I &apos;m predic@@ ting here .
"So if you think that I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;d better dam@@ n well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong ."
"And of course the ma@@ in thing is that you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t tr@@ ust people who call themselves ger@@ on@@ t@@ olog@@ ists because , as with any rad@@ ical de@@ par@@ ture from pre@@ vi@@ ous thinking within a particular field , you know , you exp@@ ect people in the main@@ stre@@ am to be a bit res@@ ist@@ ant and not really to take it ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"So , you know , this does happen ."
There &apos;s a pro@@ po@@ sal to actually put together an inst@@ it@@ ute .
"But , I mean , look — how long does it take to sp@@ end that on the war in I@@ ra@@ q ?"
Not very long . O@@ K .
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s got to be ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic , because prof@@ its dis@@ trac@@ t bi@@ ot@@ ec@@ h , but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chan@@ ce , I think , of suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing in this ."
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : O@@ K . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chan@@ ce .
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : S@@ in@@ ce you &apos;ve been talking about ag@@ ing and trying to de@@ fe@@ at it , why is it that you make yourself ap@@ pe@@ ar like an old man ?"
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Because I am an old man . I am actually 1@@ 5@@ 8 . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : S@@ pec@@ ies on this planet have evol@@ ved with im@@ mun@@ e syst@@ ems to fi@@ ght off all the dis@@ eas@@ es so that individ@@ ual@@ s live long enough to pro@@ create .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , as far as I know , all the spec@@ ies have evol@@ ved to actually die , so when cells div@@ ide , the tel@@ om@@ er@@ ase get shor@@ ter , and even@@ tually spec@@ ies die ."
"So , why does — evolution has — seems to have sel@@ ec@@ ted against im@@ mo@@ rt@@ ality , when it is so adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ e@@ ous , or is evolution just in@@ complet@@ e ?"
A@@ G : B@@ r@@ il@@ li@@ ant . Thank you for as@@ king a question that I can answer with an un@@ contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al answer .
CA : The gen@@ es don &apos;t care but we do ?
A@@ G : That &apos;s right .
"A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : H@@ el@@ lo . I read some@@ where that in the last 20 years , the average lif@@ es@@ p@@ an of basically any@@ one on the planet has gro@@ wn by 10 years ."
"If I pro@@ ject that , that would make me think that I would live until 1@@ 20 if I don &apos;t cra@@ s@@ h on my mo@@ t@@ or@@ b@@ ik@@ e ."
"That means that I &apos;m one of your sub@@ jects to become a 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old ?"
A@@ G : If you lo@@ se a bit of we@@ ight .
( Laughter ) Y@@ our numbers are a bit out .
"If that is inde@@ ed true , bi@@ olog@@ ically are there im@@ plic@@ ations in the world of re@@ j@@ u@@ ven@@ ation ?"
"If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as op@@ posed to a typ@@ ical , you know , couple of months ?"
What I said about there being no n@@ on@@ -@@ ag@@ ing spec@@ ies ear@@ li@@ er on was a little bit of an over@@ simp@@ li@@ fic@@ ation .
"Now , India is a country in@@ f@@ amo@@ us for its sc@@ or@@ ch@@ ing he@@ at and hum@@ id@@ ity ."
"For me , the only rel@@ i@@ ef from this he@@ at is to dr@@ ink pl@@ ent@@ y of water ."
"Now , while in India , my parents always re@@ mind me to only dr@@ ink bo@@ il@@ ed or bot@@ t@@ led water , because un@@ like here in America , where I can just turn on a ta@@ p and eas@@ ily get c@@ le@@ an , po@@ table water , in India , the water is often cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I so@@ on real@@ ized that not everyone is for@@ tun@@ ate enough to en@@ jo@@ y the c@@ le@@ an water we did ."
"I even saw children , who looked the same age as me , fil@@ ling up these c@@ lear pl@@ as@@ tic bot@@ t@@ les with d@@ ir@@ ty water from stre@@ ams on the ro@@ ad@@ side ."
"I wanted to know why these kids l@@ ac@@ ked water , a sub@@ st@@ ance that is essenti@@ al for life ."
"Now , this may seem sur@@ pris@@ ing , as 7@@ 5 percent of our planet is c@@ over@@ ed in water , but only 2@@ .@@ 5 percent of that is fre@@ sh@@ water , and less than one percent of Earth &apos;s fre@@ sh@@ water sup@@ p@@ ly is av@@ a@@ il@@ able for human con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion ."
"W@@ ith ris@@ ing popul@@ ations , ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al develop@@ ment and economic growth , our de@@ m@@ and for c@@ le@@ an water is increas@@ ing , yet our fre@@ sh@@ water resour@@ ces are ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly de@@ pl@@ et@@ ing ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to the W@@ or@@ ld H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation , 6@@ 60 million people in our world l@@ ack acc@@ ess to a c@@ le@@ an water s@@ our@@ ce ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ c@@ tually , at first I con@@ v@@ ert@@ ed my kit@@ ch@@ en into a labo@@ rat@@ ory , but my parents didn &apos;t really appro@@ ve and k@@ ic@@ ked me out ."
"In S@@ O@@ D@@ I@@ S , c@@ lear pl@@ as@@ tic bot@@ t@@ les are fil@@ led with cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated water and then ex@@ posed to sun@@ light for six to eight hours ."
So what exactly is this ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ sis ?
"@@ Let &apos;s bre@@ ak it down : &quot; &quot; ph@@ ot@@ o &quot; &quot; means from the su@@ n , and a cat@@ al@@ y@@ st is something that spe@@ ed@@ s up a re@@ action ."
So what ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ sis is doing is it &apos;s just spe@@ ed@@ ing up this sol@@ ar dis@@ in@@ fec@@ tion process .
"But un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , there are s@@ ever@@ al disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ ages to the way ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ tic S@@ O@@ D@@ I@@ S is curr@@ ently de@@ p@@ lo@@ yed ."
"S@@ e@@ e , what they do is they take the c@@ lear pl@@ as@@ tic bot@@ t@@ les and they co@@ at the inside with this ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ tic co@@ ating ."
But ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s like tit@@ an@@ i@@ um di@@ ox@@ ide are actually com@@ mon@@ ly used in sun@@ scre@@ ens to bloc@@ k U@@ V radi@@ ation .
The com@@ pos@@ ite com@@ bin@@ es tit@@ an@@ i@@ um di@@ ox@@ ide with c@@ ement .
"For example , you could create a ro@@ d that can eas@@ ily be plac@@ ed inside water bot@@ t@@ les for individ@@ ual use or you could create a po@@ ro@@ us fil@@ ter that can fil@@ ter water for famil@@ ies ."
You can even co@@ at the inside of an ex@@ is@@ ting water tan@@ k to pur@@ if@@ y larg@@ er amoun@@ ts of water for commun@@ ities over a longer peri@@ od of time .
"You know , I didn &apos;t have acc@@ ess to a soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated labo@@ rat@@ ory ."
"S@@ e@@ e , water isn &apos;t just the univer@@ sal sol@@ v@@ ent ."
W@@ ater is a univer@@ sal human right .

Thank you .

B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many fel@@ low in@@ mat@@ es who had big plan@@ s for the future .
"He had a vis@@ ion . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to leave the d@@ ope ga@@ me for good and f@@ ly stra@@ ight , and he was actually working on mer@@ ging his two pas@@ sions into one vis@@ ion ."
"He &apos;d sp@@ ent 1@@ 0,000 dollars to buy a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite that ex@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely fe@@ at@@ ured women having sex on top of or inside of l@@ u@@ x@@ ury s@@ por@@ ts c@@ ars . ( Laughter ) It was my first week in f@@ ed@@ er@@ al pris@@ on , and I was learning qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with s@@ mart , amb@@ it@@ ious men wh@@ ose business inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts were in many cas@@ es as shar@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and din@@ ed me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ris@@ ing star in the M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ ri S@@ en@@ ate ."
"Now , 9@@ 5 percent of the gu@@ ys that I was loc@@ ked up with had been dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ers on the outside , but when they tal@@ ked about what they did , they tal@@ ked about it in a different j@@ arg@@ on , but the business con@@ cep@@ ts that they tal@@ ked about wer@@ en &apos;t un@@ like those that you &apos;d learn in a first year M@@ B@@ A class at Wh@@ art@@ on : pro@@ mo@@ tional in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , you never ch@@ arg@@ e a fir@@ st@@ -@@ time us@@ er , foc@@ us@@ -@@ gro@@ up@@ ing new produc@@ t la@@ un@@ ch@@ es , ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al ex@@ pan@@ sion ."
But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time rel@@ iv@@ ing the gl@@ ory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to surv@@ ive ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pa@@ y , ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers don &apos;t pa@@ y , for your life when you &apos;re in pris@@ on . You &apos;ve got to pa@@ y for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to pa@@ y for your so@@ a@@ p , your de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h , to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"F@@ ir@@ st , everything &apos;s mar@@ ked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d pa@@ y on the stre@@ et , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed tr@@ uc@@ ks . That was my ful@@ l-@@ time job , un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks at a food w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se , for $ 5@@ .@@ 25 , not an h@@ our , but per mon@@ th ."
So how do you surv@@ ive ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les .
You pa@@ y everything in st@@ am@@ ps . Th@@ ose are the cur@@ ren@@ cy .
You ch@@ arg@@ e another in@@ mate to c@@ le@@ an his c@@ ell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les , like you run a bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p out of your c@@ ell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les : You run a t@@ at@@ too par@@ lo@@ r out of your own c@@ ell .
"And there &apos;s very il@@ le@@ ga@@ l hu@@ st@@ les , which you sm@@ u@@ g@@ gle in , you get sm@@ u@@ g@@ gl@@ ed in , dru@@ gs , por@@ no@@ graph@@ y , c@@ ell ph@@ ones , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a ris@@ k@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the ris@@ k@@ ier the en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise , the more prof@@ it@@ able it can po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally be ."
You want a ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te in pris@@ on ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d@@ -@@ f@@ ash@@ ion@@ ed c@@ ell ph@@ one that you f@@ li@@ p open and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred b@@ uc@@ ks .
You want a d@@ ir@@ ty ma@@ gaz@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ pec@@ ts of pris@@ on life is in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting del@@ ici@@ ous me@@ als from st@@ ol@@ en sc@@ ra@@ ps from the w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se , sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s ha@@ ir with to@@ en@@ a@@ il cli@@ p@@ per@@ s , or con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ igh@@ ts from b@@ ou@@ ld@@ ers in la@@ und@@ ry b@@ ag@@ s ti@@ ed on to t@@ ree lim@@ b@@ s , pris@@ on@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , bar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , person@@ al tra@@ ining bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"But there &apos;s no tra@@ ining , nothing to pre@@ p@@ are them for that , no re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ation at all in pris@@ on , no one to help them write a business pl@@ an , figure out a way to trans@@ l@@ ate the business con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ it@@ iv@@ ely gra@@ s@@ p into le@@ ga@@ l en@@ ter@@ pris@@ es , no acc@@ ess to the In@@ tern@@ et , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most st@@ ates don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ h@@ ib@@ iting emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers from dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating against people with a bac@@ k@@ ground ."
So n@@ one of us should be sur@@ pris@@ ed that two out of three ex@@ -@@ of@@ fen@@ d@@ ers re@@ -@@ off@@ end within five years .
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok , I li@@ ed to the F@@ ed@@ s . I lo@@ st a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I vo@@ wed that I was going to do wh@@ at@@ ever I could to make sure that gu@@ ys like the ones I was loc@@ ked up with didn &apos;t have to was@@ te any more of their life than they already had ."
So I hope that you &apos;ll think about hel@@ ping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is figure out ways to n@@ ur@@ ture the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ial sp@@ ir@@ it and the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous un@@ t@@ app@@ ed po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al in our pris@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new sk@@ il@@ ls that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important mes@@ sa@@ ge : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for success .
"And it was found clo@@ se to here , S@@ tan@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id , &quot; &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y , I am going to leave you here with a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; To tell a f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old k@@ id to wa@@ it 15 minutes for something that they like , is equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you co@@ f@@ fe@@ e in two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ x@@ act equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ."
So what happened when the prof@@ ess@@ or left the room ?
A@@ s so@@ on as the do@@ or clo@@ sed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
"F@@ ive secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome las@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wa@@ it .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would play with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and pan@@ ts .
"That child already , at four , underst@@ ood the most important princi@@ ple for success , which is the ability to del@@ ay gra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 1@@ 4 or 15 years later , fol@@ low@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their plan@@ s .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing fin@@ e .
"A great per@@ cent@@ age of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , they were in tro@@ ub@@ le ."
They did not make it to univer@@ sity .
They had bad grad@@ es . S@@ ome of them dro@@ pped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ; one out of three did not ."
This little gir@@ l was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into ban@@ king , for example , or work at a cas@@ h re@@ g@@ is@@ ter ."
But she will be success@@ ful .
And this app@@ li@@ es for everything . E@@ ven in sa@@ les .
"If the sa@@ les person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a second ."
I end with — the K@@ or@@ e@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over K@@ or@@ ea .
They are teach@@ ing these kids exactly this princi@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that princi@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big d@@ ebt ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , j@@ e@@ e@@ z , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of success@@ ful people !@@ "
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t s@@ mart enough .
And there &apos;s no mag@@ ic to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
I want to disc@@ us@@ s with you this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on why you &apos;re going to fa@@ il to have a great career .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m an econom@@ ist .
I do dis@@ mal .
"E@@ nd of the day , it &apos;s ready for dis@@ mal re@@ mar@@ ks ."
I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career .
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career .
"You &apos;re going to fa@@ il , too ."
"( Laughter ) Because — go@@ od@@ ness , you &apos;re all che@@ er@@ y about fa@@ il@@ ing . ( Laughter )"
"C@@ an@@ a@@ dian group , und@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ed@@ ly . ( Laughter )"
"Th@@ ose trying to have good care@@ ers are going to fa@@ il , because , really , good j@@ obs are now disa@@ p@@ pe@@ aring ."
"F@@ ir@@ st reason is that no matter how many times people tell you , &quot; &quot; If you want a great career , you have to pur@@ su@@ e your passion , you have to pur@@ su@@ e your dre@@ ams , you have to pur@@ su@@ e the gre@@ at@@ est fas@@ c@@ in@@ ation in your life , &quot; &quot; you hear it again and again , and then you dec@@ ide not to do it ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter how many times you do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad St@@ even J@@ . &apos; s S@@ tan@@ for@@ d com@@ men@@ c@@ ement ad@@ d@@ ress , you still look at it and dec@@ ide not to do it ."
I &apos;m not quite sure why you dec@@ ide not to do it .
You &apos;re too l@@ az@@ y to do it . It &apos;s too hard .
They are St@@ even J@@ .
I &apos;m not a gen@@ i@@ us .
"When I was five , I thought I was a gen@@ i@@ us , but my prof@@ ess@@ ors have be@@ at@@ en that idea out of my head long since . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And now I know I am completely comp@@ et@@ ent . &quot;"
"Now , you see , if this was 19@@ 50 , being completely comp@@ et@@ ent — that would have given you a great career ."
But gu@@ ess what ?
"This is almost 20@@ 12 , and saying to the world , &quot; I am tot@@ ally , completely comp@@ et@@ ent , &quot; is dam@@ ning yourself with the fa@@ in@@ test of pra@@ ise ."
"And then , of course , another exc@@ use : &quot; &quot; Well , I would do this , I would do this , but , but — well , after all , I &apos;m not we@@ ir@@ d ."
A little stran@@ ge .
H@@ m@@ m ? H@@ m@@ m ? O@@ kay ?
"You know , a fin@@ e line between mad@@ ness and gen@@ i@@ us ."
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not we@@ ir@@ d . I &apos;ve read St@@ even J@@ . &apos; s bio@@ graph@@ y .
O@@ h my go@@ od@@ ness — I &apos;m not that person . I am n@@ ice .
I am nor@@ mal .
"I &apos;m a n@@ ice , nor@@ mal person , and n@@ ice , nor@@ mal people — don &apos;t have passion . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; A@@ h , but I still want a great career ."
"I &apos;m not pre@@ par@@ ed to pur@@ su@@ e my passion , so I know what I &apos;m going to do , because I have a solu@@ tion ."
I have a stra@@ te@@ gy .
It &apos;s the one M@@ om@@ my and D@@ ad@@ d@@ y told me about .
"M@@ om@@ my and D@@ ad@@ d@@ y told me that if I worked hard , I &apos;d have a good career ."
"So , if you work hard and have a good career , if you work really , really , really hard , you &apos;ll have a great career ."
"D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t that , like , ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically make sense ? &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m . Not ."
"You know what ? Here &apos;s a little sec@@ ret : You want to work ? You want to work really , really , really hard ?"
You know what ? You &apos;ll suc@@ ce@@ ed .
"The world will give you the opportun@@ ity to work really , really , really , really hard ."
"But , are you so sure that that &apos;s going to give you a great career , when all the evidence is to the con@@ tr@@ ary ?"
So let &apos;s de@@ al with those of you who are trying to find your passion .
"You actually understand that you really had better do it , never mind the exc@@ uses ."
You found something you &apos;re interes@@ ted in .
&quot; I have an inter@@ est ! I have an inter@@ est ! &quot;
You tell me .
"You say , &quot; &quot; I have an inter@@ est ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s wonderful !@@ "
"And what are you trying to tell me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I have an inter@@ est . &quot;"
"I say , &quot; &quot; Do you have passion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an inter@@ est , &quot; &quot; you say ."
&quot; Y@@ our inter@@ est is com@@ par@@ ed to what ? &quot;
"&quot; Well , I &apos;m interes@@ ted in this . &quot;"
&quot; And what about the rest of hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s acti@@ vit@@ ies ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not interes@@ ted in them . &quot;
"&quot; You &apos;ve looked at them all , have you ? &quot;"
&quot; No . Not exactly . &quot;
P@@ as@@ sion is your gre@@ at@@ est love .
P@@ as@@ sion is the thing that will help you create the high@@ est ex@@ pres@@ sion of your tal@@ ent .
"P@@ as@@ sion , inter@@ est — it &apos;s not the same thing ."
"A@@ re you really going to go to your s@@ wee@@ ti@@ e and say , &quot; Mar@@ ry me ! You &apos;re interesting . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ on &apos;t happen .
"W@@ on &apos;t happen , and you will die al@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) What you want , what you want , what you want , is passion ."
It is be@@ y@@ ond inter@@ est .
"You need 20 interes@@ ts , and then one of them , one of them might gra@@ b you , one of them might en@@ ga@@ ge you more than anything else , and then you may have found your gre@@ at@@ est love , in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to all the other things that inter@@ est you , and that &apos;s what passion is ."
"I have a fri@@ end , pro@@ posed to his s@@ wee@@ ti@@ e ."
He was an econom@@ ically ra@@ tional person .
"He said to his s@@ wee@@ ti@@ e , &quot; &quot; Let us mar@@ ry ."
"@@ Let us mer@@ ge our interes@@ ts . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Y@@ es , he did ."
"&quot; &quot; I love you tr@@ ul@@ y , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I love you de@@ ep@@ ly ."
I love you more than any other woman I &apos;ve ever en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
"I love you more than M@@ ary , J@@ ane , S@@ us@@ i@@ e , P@@ en@@ el@@ ope , In@@ g@@ ri@@ d , G@@ ert@@ ru@@ de , Gre@@ te@@ l — I was on a G@@ er@@ man ex@@ change program then ."
I love you more than — &quot; &quot; All right .
"A@@ f@@ ter he got over his sur@@ pr@@ ise at being , you know , turned down , he con@@ cl@@ ud@@ ed he &apos;d had a nar@@ row es@@ cap@@ e from mar@@ r@@ ying an ir@@ ra@@ tional person ."
"A@@ l@@ though , he did make a not@@ e to h@@ im@@ self that the next time he pro@@ posed , it was perhaps not nec@@ ess@@ ary to en@@ um@@ er@@ ate all of the women he had au@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed for the part ."
( Laughter ) But the point stan@@ ds .
"You must look for al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves so that you find your des@@ tiny , or are you af@@ ra@@ id of the word &quot; &quot; des@@ tiny &quot; &quot; ?"
D@@ o@@ es the word &quot; &quot; des@@ tiny &quot; &quot; sc@@ are you ?
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
"And if you don &apos;t find the high@@ est ex@@ pres@@ sion of your tal@@ ent , if you s@@ et@@ tle for &quot; &quot; interesting , &quot; &quot; what the h@@ ell ever that means , do you know what will happen at the end of your long life ?"
One was a great career .
One was a mis@@ sed opportun@@ ity .
"But then , there are some of you who , in sp@@ ite of all these exc@@ uses , you will find , you will find your passion ."
And you &apos;ll still fa@@ il .
"You &apos;re going to fa@@ il , because — because you &apos;re not going to do it , because you will have inv@@ ented a new exc@@ use , any exc@@ use to fa@@ il to take action , and this exc@@ use , I &apos;ve heard so many times : &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , I would pur@@ su@@ e a great career , but , I value human relation@@ shi@@ ps — ( Laughter ) more than ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment ."
I want to be a great fri@@ end .
I want to be a great spo@@ use .
"I want to be a great par@@ ent , and I will not sa@@ cri@@ f@@ ice them on the al@@ t@@ ar of great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What do you want me to say ?"
"Now , do you really want me to say now , tell you , &quot; R@@ e@@ ally , I s@@ we@@ ar I don &apos;t k@@ ic@@ k children . &quot;"
( Laughter ) L@@ o@@ ok at the wor@@ ld@@ view you &apos;ve given yourself .
You &apos;re a her@@ o no matter what .
I don &apos;t h@@ ate children . I don &apos;t k@@ ic@@ k them .
"( Laughter ) C@@ our@@ se , I had to tell him the building was for ad@@ ults only , and to get out ."
"He m@@ um@@ bl@@ ed something about his mother , and I told him she &apos;d probably find him outside any@@ way ."
"@@ L@@ ast time I saw him , he was on the st@@ air@@ s c@@ r@@ ying ."
( Laughter ) What a w@@ im@@ p . ( Laughter )
But what do you mean ? That &apos;s what you exp@@ ect me to say .
Do you really think it &apos;s appro@@ pri@@ ate that you should actually take children and use them as a shi@@ el@@ d ?
"You know what will happen some@@ day , you ide@@ al par@@ ent , you ?"
"The k@@ id will come to you some@@ day and say , &quot; &quot; I know what I want to be ."
I know what I &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot; &quot; You are so happy .
"It &apos;s the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion a par@@ ent wan@@ ts to hear , because your k@@ id &apos;s good in mat@@ h , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next ."
"S@@ a@@ ys your k@@ id , &quot; &quot; I have decided I want to be a mag@@ ician ."
I want to per@@ form mag@@ ic tric@@ ks on the stage . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And what do you say ?
"You say , you say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ris@@ k@@ y , k@@ id ."
"M@@ ight fa@@ il , k@@ id . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , k@@ id ."
"I don &apos;t know , k@@ id , you should think about that again , k@@ id ."
And what are you going to say ?
You know what you &apos;re going to say ?
"&quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok k@@ id . I had a dre@@ am once , too , but — But — &quot; &quot; So how are you going to fin@@ ish the s@@ ent@@ ence with your &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; ?"
"&quot; But . I had a dre@@ am too , once , k@@ id , but I was af@@ ra@@ id to pur@@ su@@ e it . &quot;"
"O@@ r are you going to tell him this : &quot; &quot; I had a dre@@ am once , k@@ id ."
"But then , you were born . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Do you really want to use your family , do you really ever want to look at your spo@@ use and your k@@ id , and see your j@@ a@@ il@@ ers ?"
"There was something you could have said to your k@@ id , when he or she said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; You could have said — looked the k@@ id in the face and said , &quot; &quot; G@@ o for it , k@@ id !@@ "
"@@ Just like I did . &quot; &quot; But you won &apos;t be able to say that , because you didn &apos;t ."
So you can &apos;t .
( Laughter ) And so the sin@@ s of the parents are vis@@ ited on the po@@ or children .
Why will you see@@ k re@@ fu@@ ge in human relation@@ shi@@ ps as your exc@@ use not to find and pur@@ su@@ e your passion ?
You know why .
"In your heart of he@@ ar@@ ts , you know why , and I &apos;m being de@@ ad@@ ly ser@@ ious ."
You know why you would get all war@@ m and f@@ uz@@ zy and w@@ ra@@ p yourself up in human relation@@ shi@@ ps .
It is because you are — you know what you are .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id to pur@@ su@@ e your passion .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id to look r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id to try .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id you may fa@@ il .
"@@ Gre@@ at fri@@ end , great spo@@ use , great par@@ ent , great career ."
I@@ s that not a p@@ ac@@ k@@ age ? I@@ s that not who you are ?
How can you be one without the other ?
But you &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great career .
"@@ Un@@ less — &quot; &quot; un@@ less , &quot; &quot; that most ev@@ oc@@ ative of all English words — &quot; un@@ less . &quot;"

Un@@ less — Un@@ less .

"M@@ ar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he insp@@ i@@ red the civ@@ il ri@@ gh@@ ts mov@@ em@@ ents ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every maj@@ or bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ing fil@@ m of rec@@ ent times , ne@@ arly all of its vis@@ ions for hum@@ an@@ ity are apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ."
"I think this fil@@ m is one of the har@@ d@@ est wat@@ ch@@ es of moder@@ n times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is des@@ ol@@ ate , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to surv@@ ive , wal@@ king along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement of which I am a part of has been compl@@ icit in cre@@ ating this vis@@ ion of the future .
"For too long , we have p@@ ed@@ d@@ led a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ mar@@ ish vis@@ ion of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have foc@@ used on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o .
We have foc@@ used on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solu@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s at@@ ten@@ tion ."
And any psych@@ olog@@ ist will tell you that fear in the organ@@ ism is lin@@ ked to f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light me@@ chan@@ ism , that when an an@@ ima@@ l is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er fre@@ ez@@ es very , very still , po@@ ised to run away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re as@@ king people to en@@ ga@@ ge with our ag@@ en@@ da around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ da@@ tion and cli@@ mate change .
P@@ eople are fre@@ ez@@ ing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be impro@@ v@@ ing the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the market in terms of progress is a fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al defin@@ ition of what progress is , an economic defin@@ ition of what progress is — that some@@ how , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the st@@ oc@@ k market , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic growth , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fear — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . I@@ n the W@@ es@@ tern world , we have enough ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the wel@@ f@@ are of na@@ tions .
"In fact , the arch@@ it@@ ect of our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system , S@@ i@@ mon K@@ uz@@ n@@ ets , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A na@@ tion &apos;s wel@@ f@@ are can sc@@ arc@@ ely be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national ac@@ coun@@ ting system which is fir@@ m@@ ly bas@@ ed on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , this is probably hist@@ or@@ ical , and it had its time ."
"In the second W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , we needed to produc@@ e a lot of stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , we were so success@@ ful at produc@@ ing certain typ@@ es of stuff that we des@@ tro@@ yed a lot of Eu@@ rop@@ e , and we had to reb@@ u@@ il@@ d it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system bec@@ ame fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can produc@@ e .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vis@@ ion@@ ary man , R@@ ob@@ ert K@@ en@@ ne@@ d@@ y , at the start of his ill@@ -@@ f@@ ated pres@@ id@@ enti@@ al cam@@ pa@@ ign , gave the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent de@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of gro@@ ss national produc@@ t that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ i@@ shed his talk with the ph@@ ra@@ se , that , &quot; &quot; The gro@@ ss national produc@@ t meas@@ ures everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How crazy is that ? That our measure of progress , our domin@@ ant measure of progress in society , is meas@@ uring everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if K@@ en@@ ne@@ d@@ y was al@@ ive today , he would be as@@ king stat@@ is@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans such as my@@ self to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be as@@ king us to re@@ des@@ ign our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system to be bas@@ ed u@@ po@@ n such important things as social j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability and people &apos;s well-@@ being ."
"And actually , social scient@@ ists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global surv@@ ey .
"It &apos;s as@@ king people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their famil@@ ies , their children , their commun@@ ities ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is s@@ ligh@@ tly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be lo@@ ved in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as health .
We want to be heal@@ thy and live a ful@@ l life .
These seem to be natural human as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
Why are stat@@ is@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans not meas@@ uring these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the progress of na@@ tions in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my ad@@ ult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-@@ being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental lim@@ its ."
"And we created , at the organiz@@ ation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ om@@ ics F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ ti@@ mate ou@@ t@@ come of a na@@ tion is how success@@ ful is it at cre@@ ating happy and heal@@ thy lives for its c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
That should be the go@@ al of every na@@ tion on the planet .
"But we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resour@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ ti@@ mate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And econom@@ ics is very interes@@ ted in sc@@ arc@@ ity .
"When it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce that it wan@@ ts to turn into a des@@ i@@ ra@@ ble ou@@ t@@ come , it thin@@ ks in terms of ef@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy ."
It thin@@ ks in terms of how much ban@@ g do we get for our b@@ uc@@ k .
And this is a measure of how much well-@@ being we get for our plan@@ et@@ ary resour@@ ce use .
It is an ef@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy measure .
"And probably the eas@@ i@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this gra@@ p@@ h ."
"R@@ un@@ ning hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ ally along the gra@@ p@@ h , is &quot; &quot; ec@@ ological fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resour@@ ces we use and how much pres@@ sure we put on the planet ."
M@@ ore is bad .
"R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ tically up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-@@ being of na@@ tions ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ed li@@ fe@@ -@@ expec@@ tan@@ cy .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and qu@@ ant@@ ity of life in na@@ tions .
"And the y@@ el@@ low dot there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a huge ar@@ ra@@ y of na@@ tions around that global average ."
"@@ To the top right of the gra@@ p@@ h , are countries which are doing reas@@ on@@ ably well and produc@@ ing well-@@ being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.@@ S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other W@@ es@@ tern countries going across in those tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es and a few G@@ ul@@ f st@@ ates in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ s@@ ely , at the bot@@ tom left of the gra@@ p@@ h , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well-@@ being — t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ."
"In H@@ ob@@ b@@ es@@ ian terms , life is shor@@ t and br@@ ut@@ ish there ."
The average life expec@@ tan@@ cy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"M@@ al@@ aria , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are k@@ il@@ ling a lot of people in these regi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ el@@ low tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es , that are doing better than global average , that are head@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the gra@@ p@@ h ."
This is an as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tional gra@@ p@@ h .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the e@@ arth ."
They &apos;re L@@ ati@@ n American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I hav@@ en &apos;t been to .
Ma@@ ybe some of you have .
C@@ o@@ st@@ a R@@ ic@@ a .
C@@ o@@ st@@ a R@@ ic@@ a — average life expec@@ tan@@ cy is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the l@@ at@@ est G@@ all@@ up world po@@ ll , the happ@@ i@@ est na@@ tion on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
They are doing that on a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces that are used t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; W@@ es@@ tern world — a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ o@@ st@@ a R@@ ic@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their elec@@ tric@@ ity comes from ren@@ e@@ w@@ able resour@@ ces .
Th@@ e@@ ir government is one of the first to com@@ mit to be car@@ b@@ on ne@@ ut@@ ral by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They ab@@ oli@@ shed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they inv@@ es@@ ted in social program@@ s — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ ac@@ y rat@@ es in L@@ ati@@ n America and in the world .
"And they have that L@@ ati@@ n vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connec@@ t@@ ed@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that possi@@ bly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be Nor@@ th American , might not be W@@ es@@ tern Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an ."
It might be L@@ ati@@ n American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pul@@ l the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pul@@ l countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pul@@ l countries from the right of the gra@@ p@@ h ."
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ no@@ ther way of looking at it is looking at time tr@@ ends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the ri@@ ch@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tr@@ end in well-@@ being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tr@@ end in ec@@ ological fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t ."
"And so in str@@ ic@@ t happ@@ y-@@ planet me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ lo@@ gy , we &apos;ve become less ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent at turn@@ ing our ul@@ ti@@ mate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce into the ou@@ t@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child en@@ ter@@ ing school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dis@@ t@@ ant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . government t@@ arg@@ et on car@@ b@@ on and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se em@@ is@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not business as us@@ ual ."
That is chang@@ ing our business .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organiz@@ ations , we do our government pol@@ ic@@ y and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on increas@@ ing well-@@ being ."
No one can go to the pol@@ ls and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to reduc@@ e .
"@@ N@@ one of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of hum@@ an@@ ity to keep on increas@@ ing .
And I think this is where cli@@ mate change sk@@ ep@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep increas@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to en@@ ga@@ ge them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase ef@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to dra@@ w graph@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a le@@ a@@ f out of syst@@ ems theory , syst@@ ems engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings are very mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a s@@ mart me@@ ter in your home , and you see how much elec@@ tric@@ ity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s co@@ st@@ ing you , your kids go around and turn the ligh@@ ts off pretty qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the radi@@ o news every even@@ ing , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the doll@@ ar po@@ und ra@@ ti@@ o — I don &apos;t even know which way the doll@@ ar po@@ und ra@@ ti@@ o should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy Brit@@ ain used y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , or American used y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ?"
D@@ id we me@@ et our three percent an@@ n@@ ual t@@ arg@@ et on reduc@@ ing car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a col@@ lec@@ tive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the me@@ dia and start thinking about it .
"And we need pos@@ itive fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s for increas@@ ing well-@@ being A@@ t a government level , they might create national ac@@ coun@@ ts of well-@@ being ."
"A@@ t a business level , you might look at the well-@@ being of your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , which we know is really lin@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is lin@@ ked to in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"A@@ t a person@@ al level , we need these n@@ ud@@ g@@ es too ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ d@@ ers ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a st@@ rong public health mes@@ sa@@ ge on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les a day and how much ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happ@@ ier ?
"We did a pro@@ ject for the G@@ over@@ n@@ ment O@@ f@@ f@@ ice of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big program called the F@@ or@@ es@@ ight program — lots and lots of people — inv@@ ol@@ ved lots of exp@@ erts — everything evidence bas@@ ed — a huge to@@ me ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five pos@@ itive ac@@ tions can you do to impro@@ ve well-@@ being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the sec@@ re@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will f@@ low out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to con@@ n@@ ect , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of your life ."
"@@ Do you inv@@ est the time with your lo@@ ved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep building them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fas@@ test way out of a bad mo@@ od : step outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the radi@@ o on and dan@@ ce ."
B@@ e@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our pos@@ itive mo@@ od .
The third one is take not@@ ice .
"@@ How aw@@ are are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you not@@ ice what &apos;s b@@ ub@@ bl@@ ing up for you and trying to em@@ er@@ ge ?
"B@@ as@@ ed on a lot of evidence for min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , co@@ gn@@ itive behav@@ io@@ ral ther@@ ap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; st@@ rong for our well being ."
The f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h is keep learning and keep is important — learning throu@@ gh@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cur@@ ious , they have much better health ou@@ t@@ comes than those who start to clo@@ se down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be forma@@ l learning ; it &apos;s not knowledge bas@@ ed .
It &apos;s more cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to co@@ ok a new dis@@ h , pic@@ king up an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fin@@ al one is that most an@@ ti@@ -@@ economic of acti@@ vit@@ ies , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tr@@ u@@ ism , our com@@ passion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward me@@ chan@@ ism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two gro@@ ups of people a hundred dollars in the mor@@ ning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and sp@@ ent on other people are much happ@@ ier that those that sp@@ ent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these h@@ and@@ y pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the e@@ arth ."
They don &apos;t have any car@@ b@@ on cont@@ ent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ ods to be sat@@ is@@ fied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite fe@@ asi@@ ble that happiness does not cost the e@@ arth .
"Now , Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , on the eve of his death , gave an incredi@@ ble spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are chall@@ eng@@ es a@@ head , there may be tro@@ ub@@ le a@@ head , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the mo@@ un@@ tain top , and I have seen the P@@ rom@@ ised L@@ and . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a pre@@ ach@@ er , but I believe the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement and , in fact , the business commun@@ ity , government , needs to go to the top of the mo@@ un@@ tain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the P@@ rom@@ ised L@@ and , or the land of prom@@ ise , and it needs to have a vis@@ ion of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a Gre@@ at Trans@@ ition to get there , and we need to p@@ ave that great trans@@ ition with good things ."
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings want to be happy .
P@@ ave them with the five ways .
And we need to have sign@@ pos@@ ts ga@@ ther@@ ing people together and poin@@ ting them — something like the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the e@@ arth ."

"But his bro@@ ther , G@@ an@@ esh@@ a , simply wal@@ ked around his parents once , tw@@ ice , th@@ r@@ ice , and said , &quot; &quot; I won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How come ? &quot; &quot; said K@@ ar@@ ti@@ k@@ ey@@ a ."
"And G@@ an@@ esh@@ a said , &quot; &quot; You went around &apos; the world . &apos; I went around &apos; my world . &apos; &quot; &quot; What mat@@ ters more ?"
"If you understand the difference between &apos; the world &apos; and &apos; my world , &apos; you understand the difference between lo@@ go@@ s and my@@ th@@ os ."
"@@ &apos;@@ The world &apos; is ob@@ jec@@ tive , log@@ ical , univer@@ sal , fac@@ tual , scientific ."

It &apos;s emo@@ tional . It &apos;s person@@ al .
"It &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tions , thou@@ gh@@ ts , feel@@ ings , dre@@ ams ."
It is the beli@@ ef system that we car@@ ry .
It &apos;s the my@@ th that we live in .
"@@ &apos;@@ The world &apos; tel@@ ls us how the world func@@ tions , how the su@@ n ris@@ es , how we are born ."
"@@ &apos;@@ My world &apos; tel@@ ls us why the su@@ n ris@@ es , why we were born ."
E@@ very culture is trying to understand itself : &quot; Why do we ex@@ ist ? &quot;
"And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life , its own cu@@ st@@ omi@@ z@@ ed ver@@ sion of my@@ th@@ ology ."
"C@@ ul@@ ture is a re@@ action to nature , and this understanding of our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors is trans@@ mit@@ ted gener@@ ation from gener@@ ation in the form of stories , sym@@ b@@ ols and rit@@ ual@@ s , which are always in@@ different to ra@@ tion@@ ality ."
"And so , when you study it , you real@@ ize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world ."
D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent people see things differ@@ ently — different vie@@ w@@ poin@@ ts .
"There is my world and there is your world , and my world is always better than your world , because my world , you see , is ra@@ tional and your@@ s is super@@ st@@ ition ."

India . In@@ d@@ us .
"A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er , a young M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ian , me@@ t there what he called a &quot; &quot; g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; the nak@@ ed , w@@ ise man . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know who he was ."

"O@@ r perhaps he was just a yo@@ gi who was sit@@ ting on a roc@@ k , star@@ ing at the sk@@ y and the su@@ n and the mo@@ on ."
"A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er asked , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ? &quot; &quot; and the g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist ans@@ wer@@ ed , &quot; I &apos;m experien@@ cing no@@ thin@@ g@@ ness . &quot;"

"@@ and A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er said , &quot; &quot; I am con@@ qu@@ ering the world . &quot; &quot; And they both l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed ."
E@@ ach one thought that the other was a fo@@ ol .
"The g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist said , &quot; &quot; Why is he con@@ qu@@ ering the world ?"
"It &apos;s poin@@ t@@ less . &quot; &quot; And A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er thought , &quot; &quot; Why is he sit@@ ting around , doing nothing ?"
"What a was@@ te of a life . &quot; &quot; To understand this difference in vie@@ w@@ poin@@ ts , we have to understand the sub@@ jec@@ tive tr@@ uth of A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er — his my@@ th , and the my@@ th@@ ology that con@@ struc@@ ted it ."
"A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er &apos;s mother , his parents , his teacher A@@ r@@ ist@@ ot@@ le told him the story of H@@ om@@ er &apos;s &quot; &quot; I@@ li@@ ad . &quot; &quot; They told him of a great her@@ o called A@@ chil@@ les , who , when he par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in b@@ at@@ tle , vic@@ t@@ ory was as@@ su@@ red , but when he with@@ dre@@ w from the b@@ at@@ tle , de@@ fe@@ at was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able ."
"&quot; &quot; A@@ chil@@ les was a man who could shap@@ e history , a man of des@@ tiny , and this is what you should be , A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what he heard ."

But these are not the stories that the g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist heard .
He heard a very different story .
"He heard of a man called B@@ har@@ at , after wh@@ om India is called B@@ h@@ ā@@ rata ."
B@@ har@@ at also con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed the world .
And then he went to the t@@ op@@ -@@ most pe@@ ak of the gre@@ at@@ est mo@@ un@@ tain of the center of the world called M@@ er@@ u .
"And he wanted to ho@@ ist his fl@@ a@@ g to say , &quot; I was here first . &quot;"
"But when he re@@ ach@@ ed the mo@@ un@@ tain pe@@ ak , he found the pe@@ ak c@@ over@@ ed with coun@@ t@@ less fl@@ ag@@ s of wor@@ ld@@ -@@ con@@ qu@@ er@@ ors before him , each one cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing &quot; &quot; &apos; I was here first &apos; ..@@ ."
"@@ that &apos;s what I thought until I came here . &quot; &quot; And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , in this can@@ v@@ as of in@@ fin@@ ity , B@@ har@@ at fel@@ t in@@ si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ."
This was the my@@ th@@ ology of the g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist .
"You see , he had her@@ o@@ es , like R@@ am — R@@ agh@@ up@@ ati R@@ am and K@@ ri@@ sh@@ na , G@@ ov@@ inda H@@ ari ."
But they were not two charac@@ ters on two different adv@@ ent@@ ures .
They were two li@@ fe@@ times of the same her@@ o .

"When R@@ am dies , K@@ ri@@ sh@@ na is born ."
"When K@@ ri@@ sh@@ na dies , even@@ tually he will be back as R@@ am ."
"You see , the In@@ di@@ ans also had a riv@@ er that se@@ par@@ ates the land of the living from the land of the de@@ ad ."
But you don &apos;t c@@ ross it once .
You go to and f@@ ro end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly .
It was called the V@@ a@@ it@@ ar@@ ani .
You go again and again and again .
"Because , you see , nothing las@@ ts for@@ ever in India , not even death ."
"And so , you have these gr@@ and rit@@ ual@@ s where great imag@@ es of mother g@@ od@@ des@@ ses are built and wor@@ shi@@ ped for 10 days ..@@ ."
And what do you do at the end of 10 days ?
You d@@ un@@ k it in the riv@@ er .
Because it has to end .
"And next year , she will come back ."
"What goes around always comes around , and this rul@@ e app@@ li@@ es not just to man , but also the g@@ ods ."
"You see , the g@@ ods have to come back again and again and again as R@@ am , as K@@ ri@@ sh@@ na ."
"@@ Not only do they live in@@ fin@@ ite lives , but the same life is liv@@ ed in@@ fin@@ ite times t@@ ill you get to the point of it all ."
&quot; G@@ ro@@ und@@ ho@@ g D@@ ay . &quot;
( Laughter ) T@@ w@@ o different my@@ th@@ ologi@@ es .
Wh@@ ich is right ?
"@@ T@@ w@@ o different my@@ th@@ ologi@@ es , two different ways of looking at the world ."
"One lin@@ e@@ ar , one c@@ y@@ cl@@ ical ."
One beli@@ ev@@ es this is the one and only life .
The other beli@@ ev@@ es this is one of many lives .
"And so , the den@@ om@@ in@@ at@@ or of A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er &apos;s life was one ."
"So , the value of his life was the su@@ m tot@@ al of his achi@@ ev@@ em@@ ents ."
The den@@ om@@ in@@ at@@ or of the g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist &apos;s life was in@@ fin@@ ity .
"So , no matter what he did , it was always z@@ ero ."
And I believe it is this my@@ th@@ ological par@@ a@@ dig@@ m that insp@@ i@@ red In@@ dian ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans to disc@@ over the number z@@ ero .
Wh@@ o kno@@ ws ?
And that br@@ ings us to the my@@ th@@ ology of business .
"If A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er &apos;s beli@@ ef in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced his behavior , if the g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist &apos;s beli@@ ef in@@ flu@@ ences his behavior , then it was b@@ ound to in@@ flu@@ ence the business they were in ."
"You see , what is business but the res@@ ult of how the market behav@@ es and how the organiz@@ ation behav@@ es ?"
"And if you look at cul@@ tures around the world , all you have to do is understand the my@@ th@@ ology and you will see how they be@@ have and how they do business ."
T@@ ake a look .
"If you live only once , in on@@ e-@@ life cul@@ tures around the world , you will see an ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion with bin@@ ary log@@ ic , ab@@ sol@@ ute tr@@ uth , stan@@ dar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ en@@ ess , lin@@ e@@ ar patterns in des@@ ign ."
"But if you look at cul@@ tures which have c@@ y@@ cl@@ ical and bas@@ ed on in@@ fin@@ ite lives , you will see a com@@ for@@ t with f@@ uz@@ zy log@@ ic , with op@@ in@@ ion , with cont@@ ex@@ tual thinking , with everything is rel@@ ative , sort of — ( Laughter ) mo@@ st@@ ly . ( Laughter )"
"You look at art . L@@ o@@ ok at the b@@ all@@ er@@ ina , how lin@@ e@@ ar she is in her per@@ for@@ man@@ ce ."
"And then look at the In@@ dian clas@@ sic@@ al dan@@ cer , the K@@ u@@ ch@@ ip@@ u@@ di dan@@ cer , the B@@ har@@ at@@ an@@ at@@ y@@ am dan@@ cer , cur@@ v@@ ac@@ e@@ ous ."
( Laughter ) And then look at business .
"S@@ tan@@ dar@@ d business mo@@ del : vis@@ ion , mis@@ sion , val@@ ues , proc@@ ess@@ es ."
"S@@ oun@@ ds very much like the j@@ our@@ ney through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to the prom@@ ised land , with the com@@ man@@ d@@ ments hel@@ d by the lead@@ er ."
"And if you comp@@ ly , you will go to he@@ aven ."
But in India there is no &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; prom@@ ised land .
"There are many prom@@ ised lan@@ ds , de@@ pen@@ ding on your st@@ ation in society , de@@ pen@@ ding on your stage of life ."
"You see , bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es are not run as inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions , by the id@@ io@@ sy@@ n@@ cra@@ si@@ es of individ@@ ual@@ s ."
It &apos;s always about t@@ as@@ te .
It &apos;s always about my t@@ as@@ te .
"You see , In@@ dian mus@@ ic , for example , does not have the con@@ cept of har@@ mon@@ y ."
There is no or@@ ch@@ est@@ ra conduc@@ tor .
"There is one per@@ form@@ er st@@ anding there , and everybody fol@@ lo@@ ws ."
And you can never re@@ plic@@ ate that per@@ for@@ man@@ ce tw@@ ice .
It is not about doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ation and con@@ trac@@ t .
It &apos;s about con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion and fa@@ ith .
"It &apos;s not about comp@@ li@@ ance . It &apos;s about s@@ etting , getting the job done , by ben@@ ding or bre@@ ak@@ ing the rul@@ es — just look at your In@@ dian people around here , you &apos;ll see them s@@ mil@@ e ; they know what it is ."
"( Laughter ) And then look at people who have done business in India , you &apos;ll see the ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation on their fac@@ es . ( Laughter )"
"( Applause ) You see , this is what India is today . The ground reality is bas@@ ed on a c@@ y@@ cl@@ ical world view ."
"So , it &apos;s ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly chang@@ ing , high@@ ly d@@ iver@@ se , cha@@ ot@@ ic , amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous , un@@ predic@@ table ."
And people are o@@ kay with it .
And then globaliz@@ ation is taking place .
The de@@ man@@ ds of moder@@ n inst@@ it@@ u@@ tional thinking is coming in .
Wh@@ ich is ro@@ ot@@ ed in on@@ e-@@ life culture .
"And a clas@@ h is going to take place , like on the ban@@ ks of the In@@ d@@ us ."
It is b@@ ound to happen .

I wanted to learn my@@ th@@ ology . But there is no@@ where you can study .
"So , I had to te@@ ach it to my@@ self ."
"And my@@ th@@ ology does not pa@@ y , well , until now ."
"( Laughter ) So , I had to take up a job . And I worked in the ph@@ ar@@ ma ind@@ u@@ str@@ y ."
And I worked in the heal@@ th@@ care ind@@ u@@ str@@ y .
"And I worked as a mar@@ ket@@ ing guy , and a sa@@ les guy , and a knowledge guy , and a cont@@ ent guy , and a tra@@ ining guy ."
"I even was a business con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant , doing stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es and t@@ ac@@ tics ."
"And I would see the ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation between my American and Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an colle@@ ag@@ ues , when they were de@@ al@@ ing with India ."

How do you put it in a n@@ ice little sof@@ tw@@ are ? You can &apos;t .
I would give my vie@@ w@@ poin@@ ts to people .
"But nob@@ ody was interes@@ ted in list@@ en@@ ing to it , you see , until I me@@ t K@@ i@@ shor@@ e B@@ iy@@ ani of the F@@ ut@@ ure group ."
"You see , he has est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed the larg@@ est re@@ ta@@ il cha@@ in , called B@@ i@@ g B@@ az@@ a@@ ar ."
"And there are more than 200 forma@@ ts , across 50 c@@ ities and to@@ w@@ n@@ s of India ."
And he was de@@ al@@ ing with d@@ iver@@ se and d@@ y@@ na@@ mic mar@@ ket@@ s .
"And he knew very in@@ tu@@ it@@ iv@@ ely , that best prac@@ tic@@ es , develop@@ ed in Jap@@ an and China and Eu@@ rop@@ e and America will not work in India ."
He knew that inst@@ it@@ u@@ tional thinking doesn &apos;t work in India . In@@ d@@ ivid@@ ual thinking does .
He had an in@@ tu@@ itive understanding of the my@@ th@@ ic structure of India .
"So , he had asked me to be the Ch@@ i@@ ef B@@ eli@@ ef O@@ f@@ fic@@ er , and said , &quot; All I want to do is al@@ ign beli@@ ef . &quot;"
S@@ oun@@ ds so simple .
But beli@@ ef is not meas@@ ura@@ ble .
You can &apos;t measure it . You can &apos;t man@@ age it .
"So , how do you con@@ struc@@ t beli@@ ef ?"
How do you en@@ h@@ ance the sen@@ sit@@ iv@@ ity of people to In@@ di@@ an@@ -@@ ness .
"E@@ ven if you are In@@ dian , it is not very ex@@ pl@@ icit , it is not very ob@@ vi@@ ous ."
"So , I tri@@ ed to work on the stan@@ dar@@ d mo@@ del of culture , which is , devel@@ op stories , sym@@ b@@ ols and rit@@ ual@@ s ."
And I will share one of the rit@@ ual@@ s with you .
You see it is bas@@ ed on the H@@ ind@@ u rit@@ ual of D@@ ar@@ sh@@ an .
H@@ ind@@ us don &apos;t have the con@@ cept of com@@ man@@ d@@ ments .
"So , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life ."
"So , you &apos;re not really sure how you st@@ and in front of G@@ od ."
"So , when you go to the tem@@ ple , all you see@@ k is an audi@@ ence with G@@ od ."
You want to see G@@ od .
"And you want G@@ od to see you , and h@@ ence the g@@ ods have very large ey@@ es , large un@@ bl@@ in@@ king ey@@ es , sometimes made of sil@@ ver , so they look at you ."
"Because you don &apos;t know whether you &apos;re right or wrong , and so all you see@@ k is div@@ ine em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"&quot; Just know where I came from , why I did the J@@ u@@ ga@@ ad . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Why did I do the s@@ etting , why I don &apos;t care for the proc@@ ess@@ es . Just understand me , pl@@ ease . &quot; &quot; And bas@@ ed on this , we created a rit@@ ual for lead@@ ers ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a lead@@ er complet@@ es his tra@@ ining and is about to take over the stor@@ e , we bl@@ ind@@ f@@ old him , we sur@@ ro@@ und him with the st@@ ak@@ e@@ hol@@ d@@ ers , the cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , his family , his te@@ am , his bo@@ ss ."
"You read out his K@@ R@@ A , his K@@ P@@ I , you give him the ke@@ ys , and then you re@@ move the bl@@ ind@@ f@@ old ."
"And inv@@ ari@@ ably , you see a te@@ ar , because the pen@@ n@@ y has dro@@ pped ."
"He real@@ iz@@ es that to suc@@ ce@@ ed , he does not have to be a &quot; &quot; profes@@ sion@@ al , &quot; &quot; he does not have to c@@ ut out his emo@@ tions , he has to incl@@ u@@ de all these people in his world to suc@@ ce@@ ed , to make them happy , to make the bo@@ ss happy , to make everyone happy ."
"The cu@@ st@@ om@@ er is happy , because the cu@@ st@@ om@@ er is G@@ od ."
"That sen@@ sit@@ iv@@ ity is what we need . O@@ n@@ ce this beli@@ ef en@@ ters , behavior will happen , business will happen ."
And it has .
"So , then we come back to A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ er and to the g@@ y@@ m@@ no@@ soph@@ ist ."
"And everybody as@@ ks me , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ich is the better way , this way or that way ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very dan@@ ger@@ ous question , because it lead@@ s you to the pat@@ h of fundam@@ ent@@ al@@ ism and violence ."
"So , I will not answer the question ."

"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) D@@ e@@ pen@@ ding on the cont@@ ex@@ t , de@@ pen@@ ding on the ou@@ t@@ come , cho@@ ose your par@@ a@@ dig@@ m ."

A@@ re we ra@@ is@@ ing them for now instead of yet ?
How can we build that br@@ id@@ ge to yet ?
There are other ways to re@@ ward yet .
"In this ga@@ me , students were re@@ war@@ ded for ef@@ for@@ t , stra@@ te@@ gy and progress ."
So the N@@ ative kids ou@@ t@@ did the M@@ ic@@ ro@@ sof@@ t kids .
That &apos;s when they &apos;re getting s@@ mar@@ ter .
Do you remember the story of O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us and the S@@ ir@@ ens from high school or j@@ un@@ ior high school ?
"There was this her@@ o , O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us , who &apos;s head@@ ing back home after the Tro@@ j@@ an W@@ ar ."
"And he &apos;s st@@ anding on the dec@@ k of his ship , he &apos;s talking to his first mate , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; To@@ mor@@ row , we will sa@@ il past those roc@@ ks , and on those roc@@ ks s@@ it some beautiful women called S@@ ir@@ ens ."
"And these women sing an en@@ chan@@ ting son@@ g , a son@@ g so all@@ uring that all sa@@ il@@ ors who hear it cra@@ s@@ h into the roc@@ ks and die . &quot; &quot; Now you would exp@@ ect , given that , that they would cho@@ ose an al@@ tern@@ ate ro@@ ute around the S@@ ir@@ ens , but instead O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us says , &quot; &quot; I want to hear that son@@ g ."
"And so what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to po@@ ur wa@@ x in the e@@ ars of you and all the men — st@@ ay with me — so that you can &apos;t hear the son@@ g , and then I &apos;m going to have you ti@@ e me to the ma@@ st so that I can list@@ en and we can all sa@@ il by un@@ af@@ fec@@ ted . &quot; &quot; So this is a cap@@ tain put@@ ting the life of every single person on the ship at ris@@ k so that he can hear a son@@ g ."
"And I &apos;d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have re@@ he@@ ars@@ ed it a few times ."
"O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us would have said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , let &apos;s do a d@@ ry run ."
"You ti@@ e me to the ma@@ st , and I &apos;m going to be@@ g and pl@@ e@@ ad ."
"And no matter what I say , you cannot un@@ ti@@ e me from the ma@@ st ."
"A@@ ll right , so ti@@ e me to the ma@@ st . &quot; &quot; And the first mate takes a rop@@ e and ties O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us to the ma@@ st in a n@@ ice k@@ not ."
"And O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us does his best job pla@@ y@@ ac@@ ting and says , &quot; &quot; Un@@ ti@@ e me . Un@@ ti@@ e me ."
I want to hear that son@@ g . Un@@ ti@@ e me . &quot; &quot; And the first mate w@@ is@@ ely res@@ ists and doesn &apos;t un@@ ti@@ e O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us .
"And then O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us says , &quot; &quot; I see that you can get it ."
"A@@ ll right , un@@ ti@@ e me now and we &apos;ll get some din@@ ner . &quot; &quot; And the first mate h@@ es@@ it@@ ates ."
"He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this still the re@@ he@@ ar@@ sal , or should I un@@ ti@@ e him ? &quot; &quot; And the first mate thin@@ ks , &quot; Well , I gu@@ ess at some point the re@@ he@@ ar@@ sal has to end . &quot;"
"So he un@@ ties O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us , and O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us f@@ li@@ ps out ."
"He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You id@@ iot . You mo@@ ro@@ n ."
"If you do that to@@ mor@@ row , I &apos;ll be de@@ ad , you &apos;ll be de@@ ad , every single one of the men will be de@@ ad ."
Now just don &apos;t un@@ ti@@ e me no matter what . &quot; &quot; He th@@ ro@@ ws the first mate to the ground .
"This re@@ pe@@ at@@ s itself through the night — re@@ he@@ ar@@ sal , t@@ ying to the ma@@ st , con@@ ning his way out of it , be@@ ating the po@@ or first mate up mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly ."
H@@ il@@ ar@@ ity en@@ su@@ es .
T@@ ying yourself to a ma@@ st is perhaps the ol@@ d@@ est writ@@ ten example of what psych@@ olog@@ ists call a com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ice .
A com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ice is a dec@@ ision that you make with a co@@ ol head to b@@ ind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something re@@ gre@@ t@@ table when you have a h@@ ot head .
Because there &apos;s two head@@ s inside one person when you think about it .
S@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars have long inv@@ o@@ ked this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or of two selves when it comes to questions of tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation .
"There is first , the present self ."
This is like O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us when he &apos;s he@@ aring the son@@ g .
He just wan@@ ts to get to the front row .
He just thin@@ ks about the here and now and the im@@ medi@@ ate gra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation .
"But then there &apos;s this other self , the future self ."
This is O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us as an old man who wan@@ ts nothing more than to re@@ ti@@ re in a sun@@ n@@ y vil@@ la with his wi@@ fe P@@ en@@ el@@ ope outside of I@@ th@@ ac@@ a — the other one .
So why do we need com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices ?
"Well res@@ is@@ ting tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation is hard , as the 19@@ th century English econom@@ ist N@@ as@@ sa@@ u W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ en@@ ior said , &quot; &quot; To ab@@ st@@ ain from the en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment which is in our power , or to see@@ k dis@@ t@@ ant rather than im@@ medi@@ ate results , are amo@@ n@@ g the most pain@@ ful ex@@ er@@ tions of the human will . &quot; &quot; If you set go@@ als for yourself and you &apos;re like a lot of other people , you probably real@@ ize it &apos;s not that your go@@ als are physic@@ ally im@@ possible that &apos;s ke@@ ep@@ ing you from achi@@ ev@@ ing them , it &apos;s that you l@@ ack the self-@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine to s@@ tic@@ k to them ."
It &apos;s physic@@ ally possible to lo@@ se we@@ ight .
It &apos;s physic@@ ally possible to ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise more .
But res@@ is@@ ting tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation is hard .
The other reason that it &apos;s difficult to res@@ ist tem@@ p@@ t@@ ation is because it &apos;s an un@@ equ@@ al b@@ at@@ tle between the present self and the future self .
"I mean , let &apos;s face it , the present self is present ."
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
"It has these st@@ rong , her@@ o@@ ic ar@@ ms that can li@@ ft d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut@@ s into your mo@@ uth ."
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s we@@ ak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a la@@ w@@ y@@ er present .
There &apos;s nob@@ ody to s@@ tic@@ k up for the future self .
And so the present self can tro@@ un@@ ce all over its dre@@ ams .
"So there &apos;s this b@@ at@@ tle between the two selves that &apos;s being f@@ ou@@ ght , and we need com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices to level the pla@@ ying field between the two ."
Now I &apos;m a big f@@ an of com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices actually .
"@@ T@@ ying yourself to the ma@@ st is the ol@@ d@@ est one , but there are other ones such as loc@@ king a cre@@ dit c@@ ard away with a k@@ ey or not br@@ ing@@ ing j@@ un@@ k food into the h@@ ou@@ se so you won &apos;t e@@ at it or un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ging your In@@ tern@@ et connec@@ tion so you can use your computer ."
I was cre@@ ating com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices of my own long before I knew what they were .
"So when I was a star@@ v@@ ing pos@@ t-@@ do@@ c at C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ ia Un@@ iver@@ sity , I was de@@ ep in a publi@@ sh@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ per@@ ish ph@@ ase of my career ."
I had to write five p@@ ages a day to@@ wards p@@ ap@@ ers or I would have to give up five dollars .
"And when you try to ex@@ ec@@ ute these com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices , you real@@ ize the dev@@ il is really in the deta@@ ils ."
Because it &apos;s not that easy to get ri@@ d of five dollars .
"I mean , you can &apos;t bur@@ n it ; that &apos;s il@@ le@@ ga@@ l ."
"And I thought , well I could give it to a char@@ ity or give it to my wi@@ fe or something like that ."
"But then I thought , oh , I &apos;m sen@@ ding my@@ self mi@@ x@@ ed mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es ."
"Because not writ@@ ing is bad , but giving to char@@ ity is good ."
So then I would kind of j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y not writ@@ ing by giving a gi@@ ft .
"And then I kind of f@@ li@@ pped that around and thought , well I could give it to the ne@@ o@@ -@@ N@@ az@@ is ."
"But then I was like , that &apos;s more bad than writ@@ ing is good , and so that wouldn &apos;t work ."
"So ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , I just decided I would leave it in an en@@ vel@@ ope on the sub@@ way ."
"S@@ ome@@ times a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it ."
"O@@ n average , it was just a completely poin@@ t@@ less ex@@ change of money that I would re@@ gre@@ t ."
( Laughter ) S@@ uch it is with com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices .
"But des@@ p@@ ite my like for them , there &apos;s two n@@ ag@@ ging con@@ cer@@ n@@ s that I &apos;ve always had about com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself ."
"So the first is , when you &apos;ve got one of these dev@@ ices going , such as this con@@ trac@@ t to write every@@ day or pa@@ y , it &apos;s just a con@@ st@@ ant re@@ min@@ der that you have no self-@@ control ."
"You &apos;re just telling yourself , &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out you , com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ice , I am nothing , I have no self-@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; And then when you &apos;re ever in a sit@@ u@@ ation where you don &apos;t have a com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ice in place — like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , that person &apos;s of@@ fer@@ ing me a d@@ ou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut , and I have no de@@ fen@@ se me@@ chan@@ ism , &quot; &quot; — you just e@@ at it ."
So I don &apos;t like the way that they take the power away from you .
"I think self-@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine is something , it &apos;s like a mus@@ cle ."
"The more you ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise it , the st@@ ron@@ ger it gets ."
The other problem with com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices is that you can always we@@ as@@ el your way out of them .
"You say , &quot; &quot; Well , of course I can &apos;t write today , because I &apos;m giving a TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ k and I have five me@@ dia inter@@ vie@@ ws , and then I &apos;m going to a co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ty and then I &apos;ll be d@@ run@@ k after that ."
"And so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot; &quot; So in ef@@ fect , you are like O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ us and the first mate in one person ."
"You &apos;re put@@ ting yourself , you &apos;re b@@ ind@@ ing yourself , and you &apos;re we@@ as@@ el@@ ing your way out of it , and then you &apos;re be@@ ating yourself up af@@ ter@@ wards ."
So I &apos;ve been working for about a dec@@ ade now on fin@@ ding other ways to change people &apos;s relation@@ ship to the future self without using com@@ mit@@ ment dev@@ ices .
"In particular , I &apos;m interes@@ ted in the relation@@ ship to the future fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al self ."
And this is a tim@@ ely issue .
I &apos;m talking about the t@@ op@@ ic of sav@@ ing .
Now sav@@ ing is a clas@@ si@@ c two selves problem .
The present self does not want to sa@@ ve at all .
It wan@@ ts to con@@ su@@ me .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the future self wan@@ ts the present self to sa@@ ve .
So this is a tim@@ ely problem .
We look at the sa@@ vin@@ gs rate and it has been de@@ cl@@ ining since the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
"A@@ t the same time , the R@@ e@@ ti@@ re@@ ment R@@ is@@ k In@@ de@@ x , the chan@@ ce of not being able to me@@ et your needs in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , has been increas@@ ing ."
"And we &apos;re at a sit@@ u@@ ation now where for every three b@@ ab@@ y bo@@ om@@ ers , the M@@ c@@ K@@ in@@ se@@ y G@@ lob@@ al In@@ st@@ it@@ ute predic@@ ts that two will not be able to me@@ et their pre@@ -@@ re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment needs while they &apos;re in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
So what can we do about this ?
"There &apos;s a philosoph@@ er , D@@ er@@ e@@ k P@@ ar@@ f@@ it , who said some words that were insp@@ ir@@ ing to my co@@ au@@ th@@ ors and I@@ ."
"He said that , &quot; &quot; We might ne@@ gl@@ ect our future selves because of some fa@@ il@@ ure of beli@@ ef or imag@@ in@@ ation . &quot; &quot; That is to say , we some@@ how might not believe that we &apos;re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we &apos;re going to get old some day ."
"O@@ n the one hand , it s@@ oun@@ ds r@@ id@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous ."
"O@@ f course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old ."
But ar@@ en &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
"So my co@@ au@@ th@@ ors and I have used comput@@ ers , the gre@@ at@@ est to@@ ol of our time , to as@@ s@@ ist people &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future ."
And I &apos;ll show you some of these to@@ ols right here .
The first is called the dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion buil@@ der .
It sho@@ ws people what the future might be like by sho@@ wing them a hundred equ@@ ally prob@@ able ou@@ t@@ comes that might be ob@@ ta@@ ined in the future .
"E@@ ach ou@@ t@@ come is sho@@ wn by one of these mark@@ ers , and each s@@ its on a row that re@@ pres@@ ents a level of we@@ al@@ th and re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
B@@ e@@ ing up at the top means that you &apos;re en@@ jo@@ ying a high income in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
B@@ e@@ ing down at the bot@@ tom means that you &apos;re st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to make ends me@@ et .
"When you make an inv@@ est@@ ment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; I ac@@ cept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and de@@ ter@@ mine my we@@ al@@ th . &quot; &quot; Now you can try to move your ou@@ t@@ comes around ."
"You can try to man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate your f@@ ate , like this person is doing , but it co@@ st@@ s you something to do it ."
It means that you have to sa@@ ve more today .
"O@@ n@@ ce you find an inv@@ est@@ ment that you &apos;re happy with , what people do is they cl@@ ic@@ k &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; and the mark@@ ers be@@ gin to disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar , s@@ low@@ ly , one by one ."
It sim@@ ul@@ ates what it is like to inv@@ est in something and to wat@@ ch that inv@@ est@@ ment p@@ an out .
"A@@ t the end , there will only be one mark@@ er left st@@ anding and it will de@@ ter@@ mine our we@@ al@@ th in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
"Y@@ es , this person re@@ ti@@ red at 1@@ 50 percent of their working income in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
They &apos;re making more money while re@@ ti@@ red than they were making while they were working .
"If you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of el@@ ation and jo@@ y — just to think about making 50 percent more money in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment than before ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , had you en@@ ded up on the very bot@@ tom , it might have given you a s@@ light sense of dre@@ ad and / or na@@ us@@ ea thinking about st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing to get by in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
"B@@ y using this to@@ ol over and over and sim@@ ul@@ ating ou@@ t@@ come after ou@@ t@@ come , people can understand that the inv@@ est@@ ments and sa@@ vin@@ gs that they und@@ ert@@ ake today de@@ ter@@ mine their well-@@ being in the future ."
"Now people are mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated through emo@@ tions , but different people find different things mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ating ."
"This is a sim@@ ul@@ ation that uses graph@@ ics , but other people find mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ating what money can buy , not just numbers ."
"So here I made a dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion buil@@ der where instead of sho@@ wing num@@ er@@ ical ou@@ t@@ comes , I show people what those ou@@ t@@ comes will get you , in particular ap@@ art@@ ments that you can af@@ for@@ d if you &apos;re re@@ ti@@ r@@ ing on 3@@ ,000 , 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 , 2@@ ,000 dollars per mon@@ th and so on ."
"As you move down the l@@ ad@@ der of ap@@ art@@ ments , you see that they get wor@@ se and wor@@ se ."
S@@ ome of them look like places I liv@@ ed in as a grad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"And as you get to the very bot@@ tom , you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate reality that if you don &apos;t sa@@ ve anything for re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , you won &apos;t be able to af@@ for@@ d any h@@ ous@@ ing at all ."
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tual pic@@ tures of ac@@ tual ap@@ art@@ ments r@@ ent@@ ing for that amount as adv@@ ert@@ ised on the In@@ tern@@ et .
"The last thing I &apos;ll show you , the last behav@@ io@@ ral time machine , is something that I created with H@@ al H@@ er@@ sh@@ field , who was in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed to me by my co@@ au@@ th@@ or on a pre@@ vi@@ ous pro@@ ject , B@@ ill S@@ har@@ p@@ e ."
And what it is is an explo@@ ration into vir@@ tual reality .
"So what we do is we take pic@@ tures of people — in this case , colle@@ ge@@ -@@ age people — and we use sof@@ tw@@ are to age them and show these people what they &apos;ll look like when they &apos;re 60 , 7@@ 0 , 80 years old ."
And we try to test whether actually as@@ sis@@ ting your imag@@ in@@ ation by looking at the face of your future self can change you inv@@ est@@ ment behavior .
So this is one of our experim@@ ents .
Here we see the face of the young sub@@ ject on the left .
He &apos;s given a control that al@@ lo@@ ws him to ad@@ just his sa@@ vin@@ gs rate .
"As he mov@@ es his sa@@ vin@@ gs rate down , it means that he &apos;s sav@@ ing z@@ ero when it &apos;s all the way here at the left ."
"You can see his curr@@ ent an@@ n@@ ual income — this is the per@@ cent@@ age of his pa@@ y@@ ch@@ ec@@ k that he can take home today — is quite high , 9@@ 1 percent , but his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment income is quite low ."
He &apos;s going to re@@ ti@@ re on 4@@ 4 percent of what he ear@@ ned while he was working .
"If he sa@@ ves the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um le@@ ga@@ l amount , his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment income goes up , but he &apos;s un@@ happy because now he has less money on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side to sp@@ end today ."
O@@ ther con@@ dit@@ ions show people the future self .
"And from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in re@@ ver@@ se ."
"If you sa@@ ve very little , the future self is un@@ happy living on 4@@ 4 percent of the income ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as if the present self sa@@ ves a lot , the future self is del@@ igh@@ ted , where the income is clo@@ se up ne@@ ar 100 percent ."
"@@ To bring this to a w@@ id@@ er audi@@ ence , I &apos;ve been working with H@@ al and A@@ l@@ lian@@ z to create something we call the behav@@ io@@ ral time machine , in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated emo@@ tional re@@ ac@@ tions to different lev@@ els of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment we@@ al@@ th ."
"So for inst@@ ance , here is somebody using the to@@ ol ."
And just wat@@ ch the f@@ aci@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions as they move the sl@@ id@@ er .
"The youn@@ ger face gets happ@@ ier and happ@@ ier , sav@@ ing nothing ."
The ol@@ der face is mis@@ er@@ able .
"And s@@ low@@ ly , s@@ low@@ ly we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing it up to a moder@@ ate sa@@ vin@@ gs rate ."
And then it &apos;s a high sa@@ vin@@ gs rate .
The youn@@ ger face is getting un@@ happy .
The ol@@ der face is quite pl@@ eas@@ ed with the dec@@ ision .
We &apos;re going to see if this has an ef@@ fect on what people do .
"And what &apos;s n@@ ice about it is it &apos;s not something that bi@@ as@@ ing people actually , because as one face s@@ mil@@ es , the other face f@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ s ."
"It &apos;s not telling you which way to put the sl@@ id@@ er , it &apos;s just re@@ min@@ ding you that you are connec@@ ted to and le@@ g@@ ally ti@@ ed to this future self ."
Y@@ our dec@@ is@@ ions today are going to de@@ ter@@ mine its well-@@ being .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s easy to for@@ get .
This use of vir@@ tual reality is not just good for making people look ol@@ der .
"There are program@@ s you can get to see how people might look if they smo@@ ke , if they get too much ex@@ pos@@ ure to the su@@ n , if they ga@@ in we@@ ight and so on ."
"And what &apos;s good is , un@@ like in the experim@@ ents that H@@ al and my@@ self ra@@ n with R@@ us@@ s S@@ m@@ ith , you don &apos;t have to program these by yourself in order to see the vir@@ tual reality ."
There are ap@@ plic@@ ations you can get on s@@ mart@@ ph@@ ones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
"This is actually a picture of H@@ al , my co@@ au@@ th@@ or ."
You might reco@@ gni@@ ze him from the pre@@ vi@@ ous demo@@ s .
"And just for k@@ ic@@ ks we ra@@ n his picture through the bal@@ ding , ag@@ ing and we@@ ight ga@@ in sof@@ tw@@ are to see how he would look ."
"H@@ al is here , so I think we o@@ we it to him as well as yourself to di@@ sab@@ use you of that last imag@@ e ."
And I &apos;ll clo@@ se it there .
"O@@ n be@@ half of H@@ al and my@@ self , I w@@ ish all the best to your present and future selves ."
Thank you .

A few months ago the N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ ams of astro@@ nom@@ ers for a discover@@ y that has been ha@@ il@@ ed as one of the most important astro@@ nom@@ ical observ@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ ef@@ ly descri@@ b@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al fra@@ me@@ work for expla@@ ining their discover@@ y , nam@@ ely the possi@@ bility that way be@@ y@@ ond the Earth , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dis@@ t@@ ant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a v@@ ast compl@@ ex of univer@@ ses that we call the mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ."
Now the idea of a mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se is a stran@@ ge one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ ised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with for@@ e@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old dau@@ ghter has heard me spe@@ ak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was hol@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ op@@ h@@ ia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ d@@ y , universe or mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But bar@@ r@@ ing such an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , it is stran@@ ge to imagine other real@@ ms se@@ par@@ ate from ours , most with fundam@@ ent@@ ally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ gh@@ tly be called univer@@ ses of their own ."
"And yet , spec@@ ul@@ ative though the idea sur@@ ely is , I a@@ im to con@@ vin@@ ce you that there &apos;s reason for taking it ser@@ i@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze@@ -@@ w@@ in@@ ning results and to high@@ light a prof@@ ound my@@ ster@@ y which those results re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll of@@ fer a solu@@ tion to that my@@ ster@@ y ."
"It &apos;s bas@@ ed on an appro@@ ach called str@@ ing theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se will come into the story ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a co@@ smo@@ log@@ ical theory called in@@ fl@@ ation , which will pul@@ l all the pi@@ ec@@ es of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great astro@@ nom@@ er E@@ d@@ w@@ in H@@ ub@@ ble real@@ ized that the dis@@ t@@ ant galaxies were all r@@ ush@@ ing away from us , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ing , it &apos;s exp@@ anding ."
Now this was revolu@@ tion@@ ary .
The pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing w@@ is@@ dom was that on the larg@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es the universe was st@@ ati@@ c .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The ex@@ pan@@ sion must be s@@ lowing down ."
"That , much as the grav@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ cent of an app@@ le to@@ s@@ sed up@@ ward , the grav@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l of each galaxy on every other must be s@@ lowing the ex@@ pan@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fas@@ t-@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ ams of astro@@ nom@@ ers I men@@ tion@@ ed at the outs@@ et were insp@@ i@@ red by this reas@@ on@@ ing to measure the rate at which the ex@@ pan@@ sion has been s@@ lowing .
"And they did this by pa@@ inst@@ ak@@ ing observ@@ ations of num@@ er@@ ous dis@@ t@@ ant galaxies , al@@ lowing them to ch@@ art how the ex@@ pan@@ sion rate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the sur@@ pr@@ ise : They found that the ex@@ pan@@ sion is not s@@ lowing down .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad they found that it &apos;s spe@@ ed@@ ing up , going fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter ."
That &apos;s like to@@ s@@ sing an app@@ le up@@ ward and it goes up fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter .
"Now if you saw an app@@ le do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s p@@ ush@@ ing on it ?
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the astro@@ nom@@ ers &apos; results are sur@@ ely well-@@ des@@ er@@ v@@ ing of the N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze , but they ra@@ ised an anal@@ og@@ ous question ."
What force is driv@@ ing all galaxies to r@@ us@@ h away from every other at an ever@@ -@@ qu@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ ing spe@@ ed ?
Well the most prom@@ is@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to grav@@ ity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jects together ."
"But in E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s theory of grav@@ ity , his gener@@ al theory of rel@@ ati@@ vity , grav@@ ity can also p@@ us@@ h things ap@@ art ."
"@@ How ? Well ac@@ cor@@ ding to E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s mat@@ h , if space is un@@ i@@ form@@ ly fil@@ led with an in@@ vis@@ ible energy , sort of like a un@@ i@@ form , in@@ vis@@ ible mis@@ t , then the grav@@ ity gener@@ ated by that mis@@ t would be re@@ pul@@ sive , re@@ pul@@ sive grav@@ ity , which is just what we need to explain the observ@@ ations ."
"Because the re@@ pul@@ sive grav@@ ity of an in@@ vis@@ ible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it smo@@ k@@ ey white here so you can see it — its re@@ pul@@ sive grav@@ ity would cause each galaxy to p@@ us@@ h against every other , driv@@ ing ex@@ pan@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ pres@@ ents great progress .
But I prom@@ ised you a my@@ ster@@ y here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astro@@ nom@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ f@@ using space to ac@@ coun@@ t for the co@@ s@@ mic spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ pres@@ sed in the rel@@ ev@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly small ."
And the my@@ ster@@ y is to explain this pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar number .
"We want this number to em@@ er@@ ge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe expla@@ ining this number is just a te@@ chn@@ ical issue , a te@@ chn@@ ical deta@@ il of inter@@ est to exp@@ erts , but of no rel@@ ev@@ ance to any@@ body else ."
"Well it sur@@ ely is a te@@ chn@@ ical deta@@ il , but some deta@@ ils really matter ."
"S@@ ome deta@@ ils pro@@ v@@ ide w@@ indo@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted real@@ ms of reality , and this pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only appro@@ ach that &apos;s so far made head@@ way to explain it inv@@ o@@ k@@ es the possi@@ bility of other univer@@ ses — an idea that nat@@ ur@@ ally em@@ er@@ g@@ es from str@@ ing theory , which takes me to part two : str@@ ing theory ."
So hold the my@@ ster@@ y of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three k@@ ey things about str@@ ing theory .
"F@@ ir@@ st off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an appro@@ ach to real@@ ize E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s dre@@ am of a un@@ i@@ fied theory of physics , a single over@@ arch@@ ing fra@@ me@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the cent@@ ral idea of str@@ ing theory is quite stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you exam@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es and then you &apos;ll find at@@ oms and sub@@ at@@ omi@@ c partic@@ les ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be sm@@ all@@ er , much sm@@ all@@ er than we can with ex@@ is@@ ting technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these partic@@ les — a little tiny vibra@@ ting fil@@ am@@ ent of energy , a little tiny vibra@@ ting str@@ ing ."
"And just like the str@@ ings on a viol@@ in , they can vi@@ b@@ rate in different patterns produc@@ ing different mus@@ ical not@@ es ."
"Th@@ ese little fundamental str@@ ings , when they vi@@ b@@ rate in different patterns , they produc@@ e different kinds of partic@@ les — so elec@@ t@@ rons , qu@@ ar@@ ks , ne@@ ut@@ r@@ in@@ os , ph@@ ot@@ ons , all other partic@@ les would be un@@ ited into a single fra@@ me@@ work , as they would all ar@@ ise from vibra@@ ting str@@ ings ."
"It &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling picture , a kind of co@@ s@@ mic sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , where all the ri@@ ch@@ ness that we see in the world around us em@@ er@@ g@@ es from the mus@@ ic that these little , tiny str@@ ings can play ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this el@@ e@@ gan@@ t un@@ i@@ fic@@ ation , because years of research have sho@@ wn that the mat@@ h of str@@ ing theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ n@@ al in@@ con@@ s@@ ist@@ en@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we al@@ low for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ famil@@ i@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the us@@ ual three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as he@@ ight , w@@ id@@ th and de@@ p@@ th ."
"But str@@ ing theory says that , on f@@ ant@@ as@@ tically small sc@@ al@@ es , there are ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al dimensions c@@ r@@ um@@ pl@@ ed to a tiny size so small that we have not det@@ ec@@ ted them ."
"But even though the dimensions are h@@ id@@ den , they would have an im@@ p@@ act on things that we can ob@@ ser@@ ve because the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions con@@ stra@@ ins how the str@@ ings can vi@@ b@@ rate ."
"And in str@@ ing theory , vibra@@ tion de@@ ter@@ min@@ es everything ."
"So partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the str@@ eng@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most import@@ an@@ tly , the amount of dark energy would be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cul@@ ate the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions .
All we have is a l@@ ist of can@@ di@@ da@@ te shap@@ es al@@ lowed by the mat@@ h .
"Now when these ideas were first develop@@ ed , there were only about five different can@@ di@@ da@@ te shap@@ es , so you can imagine anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ one to de@@ ter@@ mine if any y@@ i@@ el@@ d the physical fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
But over time the l@@ ist gre@@ w as rese@@ arch@@ ers found other can@@ di@@ da@@ te shap@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hund@@ re@@ ds and then the thousands — A large , but still man@@ ag@@ e@@ able , col@@ lec@@ tion to anal@@ y@@ ze , since after all , grad@@ u@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the l@@ ist contin@@ u@@ ed to grow into the mil@@ lions and the bil@@ lions , until today ."
The l@@ ist of can@@ di@@ da@@ te shap@@ es has so@@ ar@@ ed to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some rese@@ arch@@ ers lo@@ st heart , con@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing that was so many can@@ di@@ da@@ te shap@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving r@@ ise to different physical fe@@ atures , str@@ ing theory would never make defin@@ itive , t@@ est@@ able predic@@ tions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possi@@ bility of a mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
Ma@@ ybe each of these shap@@ es is on an equ@@ al fo@@ ot@@ ing with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many univer@@ ses , each with a different shap@@ e , for the extra dimensions ."
And this rad@@ ical pro@@ po@@ sal has a prof@@ ound im@@ p@@ act on this my@@ ster@@ y : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze@@ -@@ w@@ in@@ ning results .
"Because you see , if there are other univer@@ ses , and if those univer@@ ses each have , say , a different shap@@ e for the extra dimensions , then the physical fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Wh@@ ich means that the my@@ ster@@ y of expla@@ ining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now meas@@ ured would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different charac@@ ter .
"In this cont@@ ex@@ t , the laws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Wh@@ ich means we have been as@@ king the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ ured instead of any of the other possi@@ bil@@ ities that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make head@@ way .
"Because those univer@@ ses that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tries to cl@@ um@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive p@@ us@@ h of the dark energy is so st@@ rong that it blo@@ ws the cl@@ um@@ p ap@@ art and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those univer@@ ses that have much less dark energy , well they coll@@ ap@@ se back on themselves so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no plan@@ ets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to ex@@ ist in those other univer@@ ses ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ ured simply because our universe has con@@ dit@@ ions ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ ster@@ y sol@@ ved , mul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ itive ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re observ@@ ing can and does take on a w@@ ide vari@@ ety of different val@@ ues across the w@@ id@@ er l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular value is simply mis@@ gu@@ ided ."
A@@ n early example comes from the great astro@@ nom@@ er J@@ o@@ han@@ nes K@@ e@@ pl@@ er who was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with understanding a different number — why the Su@@ n is 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away from the Earth .
"And he worked for dec@@ ades trying to explain this number , but he never suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed , and we know why ."
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er was as@@ king the wrong question .
We now know that there are many plan@@ ets at a w@@ ide vari@@ ety of different dis@@ tan@@ ces from their ho@@ st stars .
"So h@@ op@@ ing that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es , well that is simply w@@ ron@@ gh@@ e@@ ad@@ ed ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find ourselves on a planet at this particular dis@@ tan@@ ce , instead of any of the other possi@@ bil@@ ities ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose plan@@ ets which are much clo@@ s@@ er to a star like the Su@@ n would be so h@@ ot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And those plan@@ ets that are much far@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so c@@ old that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular dis@@ tan@@ ce simply because it y@@ i@@ el@@ ds con@@ dit@@ ions vit@@ al to our form of life .
"And when it comes to plan@@ ets and their dis@@ tan@@ ces , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"The point is , when it comes to univer@@ ses and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"One k@@ ey difference , of course , is we know that there are other plan@@ ets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only spec@@ ul@@ ated on the possi@@ bility that there might be other univer@@ ses ."
"So to pul@@ l it all together , we need a me@@ chan@@ ism that can actually gener@@ ate other univer@@ ses ."
"And that takes me to my fin@@ al part , part three ."
Because such a me@@ chan@@ ism has been found by co@@ smo@@ log@@ ists trying to understand the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g .
"You see , when we spe@@ ak of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g , we often have an imag@@ e of a kind of co@@ s@@ mic explo@@ sion that created our universe and set space r@@ ush@@ ing ou@@ tw@@ ard ."
But there &apos;s a little sec@@ ret .
"The B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g le@@ aves out something pretty important , the B@@ an@@ g ."
"It tel@@ ls us how the universe evol@@ ved after the B@@ an@@ g , but giv@@ es us no in@@ sight into what would have power@@ ed the B@@ an@@ g itself ."
And this ga@@ p was finally fil@@ led by an en@@ han@@ ced ver@@ sion of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g theory .
"It &apos;s called in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary co@@ smo@@ lo@@ gy , which id@@ enti@@ fied a particular kind of fu@@ el that would nat@@ ur@@ ally gener@@ ate an ou@@ tw@@ ard r@@ us@@ h of space ."
"The fu@@ el is bas@@ ed on something called a quan@@ tum field , but the only deta@@ il that mat@@ ters for us is that this fu@@ el pro@@ ves to be so ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent that it &apos;s vir@@ tually im@@ possible to use it all up , which means in the in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary theory , the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g giving r@@ ise to our universe is likely not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad the fu@@ el not only gener@@ ated our B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g , but it would also gener@@ ate coun@@ t@@ less other B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ gs , each giving r@@ ise to its own se@@ par@@ ate universe with our universe becom@@ ing but one b@@ ub@@ ble in a gr@@ and co@@ s@@ mic b@@ ub@@ ble b@@ ath of univer@@ ses ."
"And now , when we mel@@ d this with str@@ ing theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these univer@@ ses has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a w@@ ide vari@@ ety of different shap@@ es .
The different shap@@ es y@@ i@@ el@@ d different physical fe@@ atures .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the comp@@ el@@ ling but high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the w@@ id@@ er co@@ smo@@ s that c@@ ut@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ edge observ@@ ation and theory have now led us to ser@@ i@@ ously consid@@ er .
"One big re@@ main@@ ing question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fir@@ m the ex@@ ist@@ ence of other univer@@ ses ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary theory already has st@@ rong observ@@ ational sup@@ port .
"Because the theory predic@@ ts that the B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ g would have been so in@@ ten@@ se that as space ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly exp@@ and@@ ed , tiny quan@@ tum j@@ it@@ ters from the m@@ ic@@ ro world would have been stre@@ t@@ ched out to the ma@@ c@@ ro world , y@@ i@@ el@@ ding a dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tive fin@@ ger@@ prin@@ t , a pat@@ tern of s@@ ligh@@ tly h@@ ot@@ ter spo@@ ts and s@@ ligh@@ tly col@@ der spo@@ ts , across space , which power@@ ful tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es have now observ@@ ed ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing fur@@ ther , if there are other univer@@ ses , the theory predic@@ ts that every so often those univer@@ ses can coll@@ ide ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that coll@@ ision would gener@@ ate an ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al sub@@ tle pat@@ tern of tem@@ per@@ ature vari@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to det@@ ect ."
"And so ex@@ ot@@ ic as this picture is , it may one day be gro@@ und@@ ed in observ@@ ations , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing the ex@@ ist@@ ence of other univer@@ ses ."
I &apos;ll con@@ cl@@ u@@ de with a st@@ ri@@ king im@@ plic@@ ation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not st@@ ati@@ c , that space is exp@@ anding , that that ex@@ pan@@ sion is spe@@ ed@@ ing up and that there might be other univer@@ ses all by care@@ fully exam@@ ining fa@@ in@@ t p@@ in@@ poin@@ ts of star@@ light coming to us from dis@@ t@@ ant galaxies ."
"But because the ex@@ pan@@ sion is spe@@ ed@@ ing up , in the very far future , those galaxies will r@@ us@@ h away so far and so f@@ ast that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of technolo@@ g@@ ical li@@ mit@@ ations , but because of the laws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies em@@ it , even tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing at the fas@@ test spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to over@@ come the ever@@ -@@ w@@ id@@ en@@ ing gul@@ f between us ."
"So astro@@ nom@@ ers in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an end@@ less stre@@ t@@ ch of st@@ ati@@ c , in@@ k@@ y , black st@@ ill@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that the universe is st@@ ati@@ c and un@@ chang@@ ing and popul@@ ated by a single cent@@ ral o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ h@@ ab@@ it — a picture of the co@@ smo@@ s that we defin@@ it@@ iv@@ ely know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astro@@ nom@@ ers will have rec@@ or@@ ds h@@ and@@ ed down from an ear@@ li@@ er er@@ a , like ours , att@@ es@@ ting to an exp@@ anding co@@ smo@@ s te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future astro@@ nom@@ ers believe such an@@ ci@@ ent knowledge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , st@@ ati@@ c emp@@ ty universe that their own stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art observ@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect the l@@ at@@ ter .
Wh@@ ich means that we are living through a re@@ mark@@ ably p@@ riv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed er@@ a when certain de@@ ep tr@@ u@@ ths about the co@@ smo@@ s are still within re@@ ach of the human sp@@ ir@@ it of explo@@ ration .
It ap@@ pe@@ ars that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s astro@@ nom@@ ers , by turn@@ ing power@@ ful tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es to the sk@@ y , have cap@@ tu@@ red a h@@ and@@ ful of star@@ k@@ ly informa@@ tive ph@@ ot@@ ons — a kind of co@@ s@@ mic tel@@ eg@@ ram bil@@ lions of years in trans@@ it ."
and the mes@@ sa@@ ge e@@ cho@@ ing across the ages is c@@ lear .
S@@ ome@@ times nature gu@@ ar@@ ds her sec@@ re@@ ts with the un@@ bre@@ ak@@ able g@@ ri@@ p of physical la@@ w .
S@@ ome@@ times the true nature of reality bec@@ k@@ ons from just be@@ y@@ ond the hor@@ iz@@ on .

A@@ re we in the middle of something un@@ us@@ ual hist@@ or@@ ically in your op@@ in@@ ion ?
B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astro@@ nom@@ ers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain de@@ ep , c@@ rit@@ ical fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our ability to understand because of how co@@ smo@@ lo@@ gy evol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spec@@ tive , maybe we will always be as@@ king questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."

Ma@@ ybe some of these con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions can contin@@ ue .
"Th@@ ank you . Thank you , B@@ ri@@ an . ( B@@ G : My pl@@ eas@@ ure . ) ( Applause )"
"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vir@@ tually un@@ known G@@ er@@ man ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , n@@ amed Th@@ e@@ od@@ or K@@ al@@ uz@@ a su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted a very b@@ old and , in some ways , a very biz@@ ar@@ re idea ."
He pro@@ posed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aw@@ are of .
"That is in ad@@ d@@ ition to left , right , back , for@@ th and up , down , K@@ al@@ uz@@ a pro@@ posed that there might be ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a b@@ old and biz@@ ar@@ re idea , sometimes that &apos;s all it is — b@@ old and biz@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , ho@@ w@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll disc@@ us@@ s experim@@ ents which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a maj@@ or im@@ p@@ act on physics in the last century and contin@@ ues to in@@ form a lot of c@@ ut@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ edge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
To be@@ gin we need a little bit of back story . G@@ o to 19@@ 0@@ 7 .
"This is a year when E@@ inste@@ in is bas@@ king in the g@@ low of having discover@@ ed the spec@@ ial theory of rel@@ ati@@ vity and dec@@ ides to take on a new pro@@ ject , to try to understand fully the gr@@ and , per@@ v@@ as@@ ive force of grav@@ ity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that pro@@ ject had already been res@@ ol@@ ved ."
"@@ N@@ e@@ w@@ ton had given the world a theory of grav@@ ity in the l@@ ate 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0s that works well , descri@@ b@@ es the mo@@ tion of plan@@ ets , the mo@@ tion of the mo@@ on and so for@@ th , the mo@@ tion of apo@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ ph@@ al of ap@@ pl@@ es f@@ all@@ ing from tre@@ es , h@@ it@@ ting people on the head ."
All of that could be descri@@ bed using N@@ e@@ w@@ ton &apos;s work .
"But E@@ inste@@ in real@@ ized that N@@ e@@ w@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even N@@ e@@ w@@ ton had writ@@ ten that al@@ though he underst@@ ood how to cal@@ cul@@ ate the ef@@ fect of grav@@ ity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to figure out how it really works ."
"@@ How is it that the Su@@ n , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it af@@ fec@@ ts the mo@@ tion of the Earth ?"
How does the Su@@ n re@@ ach out across emp@@ ty in@@ ert space and ex@@ ert in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a t@@ ask to which E@@ inste@@ in set h@@ im@@ self — to figure out how grav@@ ity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So E@@ inste@@ in found that the medi@@ um that trans@@ m@@ its grav@@ ity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ st@@ rate of all there is .
"E@@ inste@@ in said space is n@@ ice and fl@@ at , if there &apos;s no matter present ."
"But if there is matter in the environ@@ ment , such as the Su@@ n , it ca@@ uses the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that commun@@ ic@@ ates the force of grav@@ ity .
E@@ ven the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is ke@@ pt in or@@ bit , ac@@ cor@@ ding to these ideas , because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ le@@ y in the cur@@ ved environ@@ ment that the Su@@ n and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vir@@ tu@@ e of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a ful@@ l-@@ fra@@ me view of this .
The Earth itself is ke@@ pt in or@@ bit because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ le@@ y in the environ@@ ment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Su@@ n &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how grav@@ ity actually works .
"Now , this idea was tes@@ ted in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through astro@@ nom@@ ical observ@@ ations ."
It really works . It descri@@ b@@ es the data .
And this ga@@ ined E@@ inste@@ in prom@@ in@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got K@@ al@@ uz@@ a thinking .
"He , like E@@ inste@@ in , was in se@@ arch of what we call a un@@ i@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of princi@@ pl@@ es , one ma@@ st@@ er equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So K@@ al@@ uz@@ a said to h@@ im@@ self , E@@ inste@@ in has been able to descri@@ be grav@@ ity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more prec@@ ise ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe I can play the same ga@@ me with the other known force , which was , at that time , known as the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force — we know of others today , but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about ."
"You know , the force respon@@ si@@ ble for elec@@ tric@@ ity and mag@@ ne@@ tic at@@ trac@@ tion and so for@@ th ."
"So K@@ al@@ uz@@ a says , maybe I can play the same ga@@ me and descri@@ be elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ ised a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ inste@@ in had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be grav@@ ity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So K@@ al@@ uz@@ a said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"So he imag@@ ined that the world had four dimensions of space , not three , and imag@@ ined that elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism was war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in that f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h dimen@@ sion . Now here &apos;s the thing : when he w@@ ro@@ te down the equ@@ ations descri@@ b@@ ing war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in a universe with four space dimensions , not three , he found the old equ@@ ations that E@@ inste@@ in had already der@@ iv@@ ed in three dimensions — those were for grav@@ ity — but he found one more equ@@ ation because of the one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scient@@ ists had long known to descri@@ be the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force ."
A@@ maz@@ ing — it just po@@ pped out .
"He was so exc@@ ited by this real@@ iz@@ ation that he ra@@ n around his h@@ ou@@ se scre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; V@@ ic@@ t@@ ory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the un@@ i@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , K@@ al@@ uz@@ a was a man who took theory very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ w@@ im , he read a book , a treat@@ ise on s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing — ( Laughter ) — then d@@ ove into the oc@@ e@@ an ."
This is a man who would ris@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more prac@@ tically min@@ ded , two questions im@@ medi@@ ately ar@@ ise from his observ@@ ation ."
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in deta@@ il , when you try to app@@ ly it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a fel@@ low n@@ amed O@@ sk@@ ar K@@ le@@ in ."
"He su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted that dimensions might come in two vari@@ eties — there might be big , eas@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ see dimensions , but there might also be tiny , cur@@ l@@ ed@@ -@@ up dimensions , cur@@ led up so small , even though they &apos;re all around us , that we don &apos;t see them ."
Let me show you that one vis@@ u@@ ally .
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a c@@ able sup@@ port@@ ing a tra@@ f@@ fic light ."
"It &apos;s in M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan . You &apos;re in C@@ ent@@ ral P@@ ar@@ k — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant — but the c@@ able looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al from a dis@@ t@@ ant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we zo@@ om in and take the per@@ spec@@ tive of , say , a little ant wal@@ king around — little an@@ ts are so small that they can acc@@ ess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise , coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise direc@@ tion ."
And I hope you app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these an@@ ts to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this ill@@ ust@@ rat@@ es the fact that dimensions can be of two sor@@ ts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can eas@@ ily see , but there might be ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the cir@@ cul@@ ar part of that c@@ able , so small that they have so far re@@ main@@ ed in@@ vis@@ ible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"So , if we take a look , say , at space itself — I can only show , of course , two dimensions on a scre@@ en ."
"S@@ ome of you gu@@ ys will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not fl@@ at on a scre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , and way down in the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic de@@ p@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ dit@@ ion@@ al cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shap@@ e of a cir@@ cle — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ t@@ ra m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic ant wal@@ king around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the g@@ ri@@ d part — but you could also acc@@ ess the tiny cur@@ l@@ ed@@ -@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the nak@@ ed ey@@ e or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equ@@ ip@@ ment ."
"But de@@ ep@@ ly t@@ uc@@ ked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
Now that &apos;s an ex@@ plan@@ ation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see .
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to app@@ ly it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that E@@ inste@@ in and K@@ al@@ uz@@ a and many others worked on trying to re@@ fin@@ e this fra@@ me@@ work and app@@ ly it to the physics of the universe as was underst@@ ood at the time , and , in deta@@ il , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In deta@@ il , for inst@@ ance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the elec@@ tro@@ n to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , certain@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this stran@@ ge but very comp@@ el@@ ling idea of how to un@@ if@@ y the laws of physics had gone away ."
Un@@ til something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our er@@ a , a new appro@@ ach to un@@ if@@ y the laws of physics is being pur@@ su@@ ed by physic@@ ists such as my@@ self , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ str@@ ing theory , as you were ind@@ ic@@ ating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ str@@ ing theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ str@@ ing theory , we find that it resur@@ rec@@ ts the idea in a s@@ par@@ kl@@ ing , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Su@@ per@@ str@@ ing theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the bas@@ ic , fundamental , ind@@ iv@@ is@@ ible , un@@ c@@ ut@@ table con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a famil@@ i@@ ar object , just a c@@ and@@ le in a hol@@ der , and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a j@@ our@@ ney de@@ ep inside the object and exam@@ ine the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go suf@@ fic@@ i@@ ently far down , you have at@@ oms ."
We also all know that at@@ oms are not the end of the story .
They have little elec@@ t@@ rons that s@@ war@@ m around a cent@@ ral n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with ne@@ ut@@ rons and pro@@ t@@ ons .
E@@ ven the ne@@ ut@@ rons and pro@@ t@@ ons have sm@@ all@@ er partic@@ les inside of them known as qu@@ ar@@ ks .
That is where con@@ ven@@ tional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of str@@ ing theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these partic@@ les , there is something else ."
This something else is this dan@@ cing fil@@ am@@ ent of energy .
"It looks like a vibra@@ ting str@@ ing — that &apos;s where the idea , str@@ ing theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibra@@ ting str@@ ings that you just saw in a cel@@ lo can vi@@ b@@ rate in different patterns , these can also vi@@ b@@ rate in different patterns ."
They don &apos;t produc@@ e different mus@@ ical not@@ es .
"R@@ a@@ ther , they produc@@ e the different partic@@ les making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ rec@@ t , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny fil@@ am@@ ents of vibra@@ ting energy , vibra@@ ting in different f@@ requ@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different f@@ requ@@ en@@ ci@@ es produc@@ e the different partic@@ les .
The different partic@@ les are respon@@ si@@ ble for all the ri@@ ch@@ ness in the world around us .
"And there you see un@@ i@@ fic@@ ation , because matter partic@@ les , elec@@ t@@ rons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , radi@@ ation partic@@ les , ph@@ ot@@ ons , grav@@ it@@ ons , are all built up from one ent@@ ity ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the r@@ ub@@ ri@@ c of vibra@@ ting str@@ ings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a un@@ i@@ fied theory .
Now here is the cat@@ ch .
"When you study the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of str@@ ing theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , n@@ or five , n@@ or six ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It lead@@ s us right back to this idea of K@@ al@@ uz@@ a and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when appro@@ pri@@ ately descri@@ bed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ led up , ye@@ ah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civiliz@@ ation of gre@@ en people wal@@ king around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them ei@@ ther . That is true ."
"One of the other predic@@ tions of str@@ ing theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of str@@ ing theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ is@@ es the question : are we just trying to h@@ ide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ main@@ ing time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ ep@@ est question in the@@ or@@ e@@ tical physics , the@@ or@@ e@@ tical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scient@@ ists have done for the last hundred years , there ap@@ pe@@ ar to be about 20 numbers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"Th@@ ese are numbers like the mass of the partic@@ les , like elec@@ t@@ rons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , the str@@ eng@@ th of grav@@ ity , the str@@ eng@@ th of the elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force — a l@@ ist of about 20 numbers that have been meas@@ ured with incredi@@ ble prec@@ ision , but nob@@ ody has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the numbers have the particular val@@ ues that they do ."
"Now , does str@@ ing theory of@@ fer an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the val@@ ues they do may rel@@ y on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other val@@ ues than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those numbers so fin@@ ely tun@@ ed to al@@ low stars to sh@@ ine and plan@@ ets to form , when we reco@@ gni@@ ze that if you f@@ id@@ dle with those numbers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and f@@ id@@ dle with those numbers , almost any f@@ id@@ d@@ ling makes the universe disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And str@@ ing theory su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in str@@ ing theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the ol@@ der ideas of K@@ al@@ uz@@ a and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what str@@ ing theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very r@@ ich , in@@ t@@ ert@@ w@@ ined ge@@ ome@@ try ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ al@@ ab@@ i@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shap@@ e — name isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions f@@ old in on themselves and in@@ t@@ ert@@ w@@ ine in a very interesting shap@@ e , interesting structure ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of our universe all around us would look like this on the tin@@ i@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be mov@@ ing around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical im@@ plic@@ ation , though , rel@@ ev@@ ant to those 20 numbers ?"
"C@@ on@@ sid@@ er this . If you look at the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent , a F@@ ren@@ ch hor@@ n , not@@ ice that the vibra@@ tions of the air@@ stre@@ ams are af@@ fec@@ ted by the shap@@ e of the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent ."
"Now in str@@ ing theory , all the numbers are re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tions of the way str@@ ings can vi@@ b@@ rate ."
"So just as those air@@ stre@@ ams are af@@ fec@@ ted by the tw@@ ists and turns in the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent , str@@ ings themselves will be af@@ fec@@ ted by the vibra@@ tional patterns in the ge@@ ome@@ try within which they are mov@@ ing ."
So let me bring some str@@ ings into the story .
"And if you wat@@ ch these little fel@@ lo@@ ws vibra@@ ting around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , not@@ ice that they way they vi@@ b@@ rate is af@@ fec@@ ted by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate the al@@ lowed not@@ es , the al@@ lowed vibra@@ tional patterns ."
"And if we could cal@@ cul@@ ate the al@@ lowed vibra@@ tional patterns , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ cul@@ ations ag@@ re@@ es with the val@@ ues of those numbers that have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed through deta@@ il@@ ed and prec@@ ise experim@@ ent@@ ation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more direc@@ tly ?"
"I@@ s this just an interesting ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure that might be able to explain some pre@@ vi@@ ously un@@ expla@@ ined fe@@ atures of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?"
"And we think — and this is , I think , very exc@@ iting — that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the ex@@ ist@@ ence of these extra dimensions ."
"@@ Here &apos;s how it goes . I@@ n C@@ E@@ R@@ N , G@@ en@@ eva , S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land , a machine is being built called the L@@ arg@@ e H@@ ad@@ ro@@ n C@@ ol@@ lid@@ er ."
"It &apos;s a machine that will sen@@ d partic@@ les around a tun@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so often those partic@@ les will be a@@ im@@ ed at each other , so there &apos;s a head@@ -@@ on coll@@ ision ."
"The hope is that if the coll@@ ision has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the deb@@ ris from the coll@@ ision from our dimensions , for@@ cing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the coll@@ ision , comp@@ are it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the coll@@ ision than before , this will be evidence that the energy has d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it d@@ ri@@ f@@ ts away in the right pat@@ tern that we can cal@@ cul@@ ate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea vis@@ u@@ ally .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a grav@@ it@@ on — that &apos;s the kind of deb@@ ris we exp@@ ect to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these partic@@ les . You sl@@ am them together .
"You sl@@ am them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that coll@@ ision will go into deb@@ ris that f@@ li@@ es off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ars f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ jec@@ ted by not@@ ic@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we be@@ gan , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"And to me this is a really re@@ mark@@ able story , and a re@@ mark@@ able opportun@@ ity . G@@ o@@ ing back to N@@ e@@ w@@ ton with ab@@ sol@@ ute space — didn &apos;t pro@@ v@@ ide anything but an ar@@ ena , a stage in which the ev@@ ents of the universe take place ."
"E@@ inste@@ in comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what grav@@ ity is ."
"And now str@@ ing theory comes along and says , y@@ es , grav@@ ity , quan@@ tum me@@ chan@@ ics , elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism , all together in one p@@ ac@@ k@@ age , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ maz@@ ing possi@@ bility .
Thank you very much .

Let me ask you all a question .
O@@ K . And how about this min@@ ib@@ us ?
All right .
So she didn &apos;t grow up he@@ aring a lot about n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s .
"For J@@ as@@ mine , a f@@ all@@ out sh@@ el@@ ter is an ap@@ p in the An@@ dro@@ id stor@@ e ."
We have so@@ li@@ d evidence that ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ ts are trying to get a@@ hold of them .
"But at that time , R@@ us@@ si@@ an P@@ res@@ id@@ ent B@@ oris Y@@ el@@ tsin came within five minutes of la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing a ful@@ l-@@ sc@@ ale re@@ tal@@ i@@ at@@ ory n@@ uc@@ lear att@@ ack against the United States ."
"So , most of the world &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear na@@ tions have com@@ mit@@ ted to getting ri@@ d of these we@@ a@@ pon@@ s of mass des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion ."
He gave us a challenge that would have been incredi@@ ble just a few years ear@@ li@@ er .
"And with that challenge , he insp@@ i@@ red scient@@ ists and mar@@ ket@@ ers , astro@@ na@@ ut@@ s and scho@@ ol@@ teachers ."
He gave us a vis@@ ion .
"And ap@@ par@@ ently , N@@ ik@@ it@@ a K@@ h@@ r@@ ush@@ che@@ v , the S@@ ov@@ iet P@@ re@@ mier , ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"But before that co@@ oper@@ ation could be real@@ ized , K@@ en@@ ne@@ d@@ y was as@@ sas@@ sin@@ ated , and that part of the vis@@ ion was de@@ fer@@ red ."
But the prom@@ ise of jo@@ in@@ t in@@ no@@ v@@ ation between these two n@@ uc@@ lear super@@ po@@ w@@ ers wasn &apos;t tot@@ ally ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ i@@ shed .
"They called it , &quot; &quot; M@@ e@@ ga@@ t@@ ons to M@@ e@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So the res@@ ult is that for over 20 years , our two na@@ tions had a program that me@@ ant that one in 10 ligh@@ t@@ b@@ ul@@ b@@ s in the United States was essenti@@ ally fu@@ el@@ ed by form@@ er R@@ us@@ si@@ an war@@ head@@ s ."
"So , together these two na@@ tions did something tr@@ ul@@ y au@@ da@@ ci@@ ous ."
"But the good news is , the global commun@@ ity has the chan@@ ce to do something just as au@@ da@@ ci@@ ous today ."
"@@ To get ri@@ d of n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s and to end the sup@@ p@@ ly of the mater@@ i@@ als requ@@ i@@ red to produc@@ e them , some exp@@ erts tell me would take 30 years ."
"It would take a ren@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce of sor@@ ts , the kinds of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation that , for better or wor@@ se , under@@ p@@ in@@ ned both the M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ tan P@@ ro@@ ject , which gave r@@ ise to n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s , and the M@@ e@@ ga@@ t@@ ons to M@@ e@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts program ."
It would take des@@ ign con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
"Th@@ ese are fundamental to cre@@ ati@@ vity , things like a pl@@ at@@ form for inter@@ national col@@ labo@@ ration ; a da@@ te certain , which is a for@@ cing me@@ chan@@ ism ; and a pos@@ itive vis@@ ion that insp@@ ir@@ es action ."
It would take us to 20@@ 4@@ 5 .
"Now , 20@@ 4@@ 5 happens to be the 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ th an@@ n@@ iver@@ s@@ ary of the bir@@ th of n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s in the New M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o des@@ ert ."
But it &apos;s also an important da@@ te for another reason .
"It &apos;s predic@@ ted to be the adv@@ ent of the sin@@ gul@@ ar@@ ity , a new moment in human develop@@ ment , where the lin@@ es between ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence and human intelligence bl@@ ur , where comput@@ ing and consciousness become almost in@@ dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish@@ able and adv@@ an@@ ced tech@@ nologi@@ es help us sol@@ ve the 2@@ 1@@ st century &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est problems : h@@ un@@ ger , energy , pov@@ ert@@ y , ush@@ ering in an er@@ a of ab@@ und@@ ance ."
And we all get to go to space on our way to becom@@ ing a mul@@ ti@@ -@@ plan@@ et@@ ary spec@@ ies .
"Now , the people who really believe this vis@@ ion are the first to say they don &apos;t yet know prec@@ is@@ ely how we &apos;re going to get there ."
But the val@@ ues be@@ h@@ ind their vis@@ ion and the w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to ask &quot; &quot; How might we ? &quot; &quot; have insp@@ i@@ red a gener@@ ation of in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors .
"They &apos;re working bac@@ k@@ ward from the ou@@ t@@ comes they want , using the cre@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ v@@ ing me@@ th@@ ods of col@@ labo@@ ra@@ tive des@@ ign ."
They &apos;re bu@@ st@@ ing through ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les .
They &apos;re re@@ defin@@ ing what we all consid@@ er possible .
"It has to be about stra@@ te@@ gi@@ es for m@@ ut@@ u@@ ally as@@ su@@ red pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity or , at the very le@@ ast , m@@ ut@@ u@@ ally as@@ su@@ red surviv@@ al ."
"Now , every day , I get to me@@ et people who are real pi@@ on@@ e@@ ers in the field of n@@ uc@@ lear thre@@ at@@ s ."
It &apos;s as if there &apos;s a t@@ ab@@ o@@ o .
"@@ No problem of human des@@ tiny , he said , is be@@ y@@ ond human be@@ ings ."
I believe that .
"And I b@@ et a lot of you here believe that , too ."
And I know G@@ ener@@ ation P@@ os@@ si@@ ble beli@@ ev@@ es it .
So it &apos;s time to com@@ mit to a da@@ te .
Let &apos;s end the n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s ch@@ ap@@ ter on the 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ th an@@ n@@ iver@@ s@@ ary of its in@@ cep@@ tion .
"A@@ f@@ ter all , by 20@@ 4@@ 5 , we will have hel@@ d bil@@ lions of people ho@@ stage to the thre@@ at of n@@ uc@@ lear an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ation ."
"S@@ ur@@ ely , 100 years will have been enough ."
"S@@ ur@@ ely , if ever there was a global mo@@ on sh@@ ot wor@@ th sup@@ port@@ ing , this is it ."
"Now , in the face of real thre@@ at@@ s — for inst@@ ance , Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ ea &apos;s rec@@ ent n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s tes@@ ts , which f@@ ly in the face of san@@ c@@ tions — reas@@ on@@ able people disa@@ gre@@ e about whether we should main@@ tain some number of n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s to de@@ ter ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion ."
But the question is : What &apos;s the mag@@ ic number ?
I@@ s it a thou@@ s@@ and ?
I@@ s it a hundred ? T@@ en ?
And then we have to ask : Wh@@ o should be respon@@ si@@ ble for them ?
"I think we can ag@@ ree , ho@@ w@@ ever , that having 1@@ 5@@ ,000 of them re@@ pres@@ ents a gre@@ ater global thre@@ at to J@@ as@@ mine &apos;s gener@@ ation than a prom@@ ise ."
"It &apos;s time we pl@@ edge our resour@@ ces as lead@@ ers across the spec@@ tr@@ um to work on this old problem in new ways , to ask , &quot; &quot; How might we ? &quot; &quot; How might we make good on a prom@@ ise of gre@@ ater sec@@ ur@@ ity for J@@ as@@ mine &apos;s gener@@ ation in a world be@@ y@@ ond n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ a@@ pon@@ s ?"
I tr@@ ul@@ y hope you will jo@@ in us .

"I am a che@@ f and a food pol@@ ic@@ y guy , but I come from a whole family of teachers ."
My sis@@ ter is a spec@@ ial ed teacher in Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
My father just re@@ ti@@ red after 25 years teach@@ ing fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de .
My a@@ un@@ t and un@@ cle were prof@@ ess@@ ors .
My cou@@ sin@@ s all te@@ ach .
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body in my family , basically , teach@@ es ex@@ cept for me ."
They t@@ au@@ ght me that the only way to get the right ans@@ w@@ ers is to ask the right questions .
So what are the right questions when it comes to impro@@ v@@ ing the educ@@ ational ou@@ t@@ comes for our children ?
"There &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ously many important questions , but I think the fol@@ lowing is a good place to start : What do we think the connec@@ tion is between a child &apos;s gro@@ wing mind and their gro@@ wing body ?"
What can we exp@@ ect our kids to learn if their di@@ ets are ful@@ l of su@@ ga@@ r and emp@@ ty of n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents ?
What can they possi@@ bly learn if their bo@@ dies are liter@@ ally going h@@ un@@ gr@@ y ?
"And with all the resour@@ ces that we are po@@ uring into scho@@ ols , we should stop and ask ourselves : A@@ re we really s@@ etting our kids up for success ?"
"Now , a few years ago , I was a j@@ ud@@ ge on a co@@ o@@ king comp@@ et@@ ition called &quot; &quot; Ch@@ op@@ ped . &quot; &quot; F@@ our ch@@ ef@@ s comp@@ et@@ e with my@@ ster@@ y in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents to see who can co@@ ok the best di@@ sh@@ es ."
E@@ x@@ cept for this ep@@ is@@ od@@ e — it was a very spec@@ ial one .
"Now , I know it &apos;s been a long time since most of you have had a school l@@ un@@ ch , and we &apos;ve made a lot of progress on n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion , but qu@@ in@@ oa still is not a st@@ ap@@ le in most school c@@ af@@ et@@ er@@ ias ."
But the dis@@ h that I will never for@@ get was co@@ o@@ ked by a woman n@@ amed Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l B@@ ar@@ b@@ ara .
She co@@ o@@ ked this del@@ ici@@ ous pas@@ ta .
"It was del@@ ici@@ ous , like , re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ an@@ t-@@ qu@@ ality good , ex@@ cept — she basically just thre@@ w the qu@@ in@@ oa , pretty much un@@ co@@ o@@ ked , into the dis@@ h ."
"It was a stran@@ ge cho@@ ice , and it was sup@@ er c@@ run@@ ch@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) So I took on the T@@ V ac@@ cu@@ sat@@ ory j@@ ud@@ ge thing that you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do , and I asked her why she did that ."
"@@ Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l respon@@ ded , &quot; &quot; Well , first , I don &apos;t know what qu@@ in@@ oa is . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; But I do know that it &apos;s a M@@ on@@ day , and that in my school , at H@@ igh S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ om@@ mun@@ ity , I always co@@ ok pas@@ ta . &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ e , Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l expla@@ ined that for many of her kids , there were no me@@ als on the we@@ ek@@ ends ."
No me@@ als on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day .
"@@ No me@@ als on S@@ un@@ day , ei@@ ther ."
So she co@@ o@@ ked pas@@ ta because she wanted to make sure she co@@ o@@ ked something she knew her children would e@@ at .
"S@@ ome@@ thing that would s@@ tic@@ k to their ri@@ b@@ s , she said ."
S@@ ome@@ thing that would f@@ ill them up .
"@@ Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l tal@@ ked about how , by the time M@@ on@@ day came , her kids &apos; h@@ un@@ ger pan@@ gs were so in@@ ten@@ se that they couldn &apos;t even be@@ gin to think about learning ."
F@@ ood was the only thing on their mind .
The only thing .
"And un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the stat@@ s — they tell the same story ."
"So , let &apos;s put this into the cont@@ ex@@ t of a child ."
M@@ e@@ et A@@ l@@ l@@ is@@ on .
"She &apos;s 12 years old , she &apos;s s@@ mart as a wh@@ i@@ p and she wan@@ ts to be a physic@@ ist when she gro@@ ws up ."
"H@@ er chan@@ ces of getting a n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ious me@@ al , one with f@@ ru@@ it and mil@@ k , one lower in su@@ ga@@ r and sal@@ t , dra@@ ma@@ tically increase ."
A@@ l@@ l@@ is@@ on will have a lower rate of ob@@ es@@ ity than the average k@@ id .
She &apos;ll have to vis@@ it the n@@ ur@@ se less .
She &apos;ll have lower lev@@ els of an@@ x@@ i@@ ety and depres@@ sion .
She &apos;ll have better behavior .
"She &apos;ll have better at@@ ten@@ dan@@ ce , and she &apos;ll show up on time more often ."
Why ?
"Well , because there &apos;s a good me@@ al wa@@ iting for her at school ."
"O@@ ver@@ all , A@@ l@@ l@@ is@@ on is in much better health than the average school k@@ id ."
So what about that k@@ id who doesn &apos;t have a n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ious bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast wa@@ iting for him ?
He &apos;s also 12 . He &apos;s a wonderful k@@ id .
He wan@@ ts to be a doc@@ tor .
"B@@ y the time T@@ om@@ my is in kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , he &apos;s already under@@ per@@ form@@ ing in mat@@ h ."
"B@@ y the time he &apos;s in third gra@@ de , he &apos;s got lower mat@@ h and read@@ ing sc@@ or@@ es ."
"B@@ y the time he &apos;s 11 , it &apos;s more likely that T@@ om@@ my will have to have re@@ pe@@ ated a gra@@ de ."
So how w@@ id@@ es@@ pre@@ ad is this problem ?
"Well , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s per@@ v@@ as@@ ive ."
"In this c@@ ity al@@ one , in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity , 4@@ 7@@ 4@@ ,000 kids under the age of 18 face h@@ un@@ ger every year ."
It &apos;s crazy .
"O@@ n the other hand , di@@ et and n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion is the number one cause of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able death and disease in this country , by far ."
And fully a third of the kids that we &apos;ve been talking about t@@ on@@ ight are on trac@@ k to have diab@@ et@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time .
"Now , what &apos;s hard to put together but is true is that , many times , these are the same children ."
So they f@@ ill up on the un@@ heal@@ thy and che@@ a@@ p cal@@ or@@ ies that sur@@ ro@@ und them in their commun@@ ities and that their famil@@ ies can af@@ for@@ d .
"But we should be able to sol@@ ve this problem , right ?"
We know what the ans@@ w@@ ers are .
"This program has been incredi@@ bly success@@ ful , because it hel@@ ped us over@@ come a very difficult bar@@ ri@@ er when it came to getting kids a n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ious bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
And that was the bar@@ ri@@ er of s@@ ti@@ g@@ ma .
"S@@ e@@ e , scho@@ ols ser@@ ve bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast before school , and it was only av@@ a@@ il@@ able for the po@@ or kids ."
So everybody knew who was po@@ or and who needed government help .
"Now , all kids , no matter how much or how little their parents make , have a lot of pr@@ ide ."
So what happened ?
"Well , the scho@@ ols that have im@@ pl@@ em@@ ented this program saw an increase in mat@@ h and read@@ ing sc@@ or@@ es by 1@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent . 1@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent ."
"And research sho@@ ws that when kids have a con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent , n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ious bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ,"
their chan@@ ces of grad@@ u@@ ating increase by 20 percent . 20 percent .
"When we give our kids the n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment they need ,"
"@@ we give them the chan@@ ce to th@@ r@@ ive , both in the clas@@ s@@ room and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"Now , you don &apos;t have to tr@@ ust me on this , but you should talk to D@@ on@@ na Mar@@ ti@@ n ."
I love D@@ on@@ na Mar@@ ti@@ n .
"D@@ on@@ na Mar@@ ti@@ n is the school n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion direc@@ tor at B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty in W@@ ay@@ n@@ es@@ bor@@ o , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia ."
"B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty is one of the po@@ or@@ est dis@@ tric@@ ts in the fi@@ f@@ th@@ -@@ po@@ or@@ est state in the country , and about 100 percent of D@@ on@@ na &apos;s students live at or bel@@ ow the pov@@ ert@@ y line ."
"A few years ago , D@@ on@@ na decided to get out a@@ head of the new stan@@ dar@@ ds that were coming , and over@@ h@@ au@@ l her n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion stan@@ dar@@ ds ."
She impro@@ ved and ad@@ ded f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les and whole gra@@ ins .
She serv@@ ed bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast in the clas@@ s@@ room to all of her kids .
And she im@@ pl@@ em@@ ented a din@@ ner program .
Why ?
"Well , many of her kids didn &apos;t have din@@ ner when they went home ."
So how did they res@@ po@@ nd ?
"Well , the kids lo@@ ved the food ."
"They lo@@ ved the better n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion , and they lo@@ ved not being h@@ un@@ gr@@ y ."
But D@@ on@@ na &apos;s big@@ gest sup@@ por@@ ter came from an un@@ expec@@ ted place .
"H@@ is name from E@@ ri@@ c P@@ ar@@ k@@ er , and he was the head fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all co@@ ach for the B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty B@@ e@@ ars ."
"Now , C@@ o@@ ach P@@ ar@@ k@@ er had co@@ ach@@ ed medi@@ oc@@ re te@@ ams for years ."
The B@@ e@@ ars often en@@ ded in the middle of the p@@ ack — a big disa@@ p@@ poin@@ t@@ ment in one of the most pas@@ sion@@ ate fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all st@@ ates in the U@@ ni@@ on .
"( Laughter ) And C@@ o@@ ach P@@ ar@@ k@@ er , he cre@@ d@@ ited that ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ship to D@@ on@@ na Mar@@ ti@@ n ."
"When we give our kids the bas@@ ic n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment , they &apos;re going to th@@ r@@ ive ."
It &apos;s on all of us .
And fe@@ ed@@ ing our kids the bas@@ ic n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion is just the starting point .
What I &apos;ve la@@ id out is really a mo@@ del for so many of the most pres@@ sing issu@@ es that we face .
"If we foc@@ us on the simple go@@ al of pro@@ per@@ ly n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ourselves , we could see a world that is more st@@ able and sec@@ ure ; we could dra@@ ma@@ tically impro@@ ve our economic produc@@ ti@@ vity ; we could trans@@ form our health care and we could go a long way in en@@ sur@@ ing that the Earth can pro@@ v@@ ide for gener@@ ations to come ."
F@@ ood is that place where our col@@ lec@@ tive ef@@ for@@ ts can have the gre@@ at@@ est im@@ p@@ act .
So we have to ask ourselves : What is the right question ?
What would be the im@@ p@@ act ?
"@@ Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l B@@ ar@@ b@@ ara , D@@ on@@ na Mar@@ ti@@ n , C@@ o@@ ach P@@ ar@@ k@@ er and the B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty B@@ e@@ ars — I think they know the answer ."
Thank you gu@@ ys so very much .

"M@@ ich@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o had this el@@ e@@ gan@@ t way of descri@@ b@@ ing it when he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very bloc@@ k of st@@ one has a stat@@ ue inside of it , and it &apos;s the t@@ ask of the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tor to disc@@ over it . &quot; &quot; But what if he worked in the op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tion ?"
I know that &apos;s an ab@@ sur@@ d not@@ ion .
It &apos;s probably im@@ possible .
The only way you get a stat@@ ue from a p@@ ile of d@@ ust is if the stat@@ ue built itself — if some@@ how we could com@@ pe@@ l mil@@ lions of these partic@@ les to come together to form the stat@@ ue .
"I don &apos;t build with st@@ one , I build with n@@ an@@ o@@ mater@@ i@@ als ."
"They &apos;re these just im@@ possi@@ bly small , fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating little ob@@ jects ."
There were scientific bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s happening all the time .
"The con@@ fer@@ ences were bu@@ z@@ z@@ ing , there was t@@ ons of money po@@ uring in from f@@ und@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
We were trying to make bl@@ az@@ ing f@@ ast comput@@ ers using n@@ an@@ o@@ mater@@ i@@ als .
The same thing that makes them so interesting — their small size — also makes them im@@ possible to work with .
It &apos;s liter@@ ally like trying to build a stat@@ ue out of a p@@ ile of d@@ ust .
And we just don &apos;t have the to@@ ols that are small enough to work with them .
"But even if we did , it wouldn &apos;t really matter , because we couldn &apos;t one by one place mil@@ lions of partic@@ les together to build a technology ."
"So because of that , all of the prom@@ ise and all of the exc@@ it@@ ement has re@@ main@@ ed just that : prom@@ ise and exc@@ it@@ ement ."
We &apos;ve built enti@@ re economi@@ es on this idea .
It &apos;s ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al .
And we o@@ we it to ourselves to keep this progress going .
"We want to say the same thing 10 , 20 , 30 years from now : look what we &apos;ve done over the last 30 years ."
Y@@ et we know this progress may not last for@@ ever .
"So if we want to keep this par@@ ty going , we have to do what we &apos;ve always been able to do , and that is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate ."
They are just like they sound .
"And the science tel@@ ls us if we could emp@@ lo@@ y them in comput@@ ing , we could see up to a ten times impro@@ v@@ ement in per@@ for@@ man@@ ce ."
It &apos;s like sk@@ ip@@ ping through s@@ ever@@ al technology gener@@ ations in just one step .
So there we have it .
"The science is scre@@ am@@ ing at us , &quot; This is what you should be doing to sol@@ ve your problem . &quot;"
"So , all right , let &apos;s get started , let &apos;s do this ."
But you just run right back into that d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ ed@@ g@@ ed s@@ word .
This &quot; &quot; ide@@ al solu@@ tion &quot; &quot; con@@ ta@@ ins a material that &apos;s im@@ possible to work with .
I &apos;d have to ar@@ ran@@ ge bil@@ lions of them just to make one single computer ch@@ i@@ p .
"It &apos;s that same con@@ und@@ ru@@ m , it &apos;s like this und@@ ying problem ."
"What are we not doing that needs to be done ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like in &quot; &quot; The G@@ od@@ father , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"When F@@ re@@ do bet@@ ra@@ ys his bro@@ ther M@@ i@@ cha@@ el , we all know what needs to be done ."
( Laughter ) But M@@ i@@ cha@@ el — he put@@ s it off .
"F@@ ine , I get it ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir mother &apos;s still al@@ ive , it would make her up@@ set ."
"We just said , &quot; What &apos;s the F@@ re@@ do in our problem ? &quot;"
"We have to find a way , some@@ how , to com@@ pe@@ l , to con@@ vin@@ ce bil@@ lions of these partic@@ les to as@@ s@@ em@@ ble themselves into the technology ."
We can &apos;t do it for them . They have to do it for themselves .
"And it &apos;s the hard way , and this is not tr@@ iv@@ ial , but in this case , it &apos;s the only way ."
"Now , as it turns out , this is not that ali@@ en of a problem ."
We just don &apos;t build anything this way .
P@@ eople don &apos;t build anything this way .
But if you look around — and there &apos;s exam@@ pl@@ es every@@ where — M@@ other N@@ ature buil@@ ds everything this way .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is built from the bot@@ tom up .
"You can go to the be@@ ach , you &apos;ll find these simple organ@@ is@@ ms that use pro@@ te@@ ins — basically mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es — to tem@@ pl@@ ate what is essenti@@ ally s@@ and , just pl@@ uc@@ king it from the se@@ a and building these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary arch@@ it@@ ec@@ tures with extre@@ me d@@ iver@@ sity ."
She &apos;s been there for hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ lions of years .
We &apos;re the ones that are l@@ ate to the par@@ ty .
"So we decided that we &apos;re going to use the same to@@ ol that nature uses , and that &apos;s chem@@ is@@ try ."
Ch@@ em@@ is@@ try is the mis@@ sing to@@ ol .
"We &apos;ve develop@@ ed chem@@ is@@ try that goes into the p@@ ile of d@@ ust , into the p@@ ile of n@@ an@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ les , and pul@@ ls out exactly the ones we need ."
"Now , comput@@ ing is just one example ."
"It &apos;s the one that I &apos;m interes@@ ted in , that my group is really inv@@ es@@ ted in , but there are others in ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , in medic@@ ine , in struc@@ tu@@ ral mater@@ i@@ als , where the science is going to tell you to move to@@ wards the n@@ an@@ o ."
That &apos;s where the big@@ gest ben@@ ef@@ it is .
And they will need chem@@ is@@ try . That &apos;s the point .
"The be@@ aut@@ y of science is that once you devel@@ op these new to@@ ols , they &apos;re out there ."
Thank you so much for your time . I app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate it .

"We are now going through an amazing and un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented moment where the power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics between men and women are shi@@ f@@ ting very ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly , and in many of the places where it coun@@ ts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything ."
"In my mother &apos;s day , she didn &apos;t go to college ."
Not a lot of women did .
"And now , for every two men who get a college de@@ gre@@ e , three women will do the same ."
"W@@ omen , for the first time this year , bec@@ ame the maj@@ or@@ ity of the American work@@ force ."
"And they &apos;re starting to domin@@ ate lots of profes@@ sions — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , ban@@ k@@ ers , ac@@ coun@@ tan@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver 50 percent of man@@ ag@@ ers are women these days , and in the 15 profes@@ sions pro@@ jec@@ ted to grow the most in the next dec@@ ade , all but two of them are domin@@ ated by women ."
"So the global econom@@ y is becom@@ ing a place where women are more success@@ ful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly af@@ fect our culture — what our rom@@ an@@ tic co@@ me@@ dies look like , what our marri@@ ages look like , what our da@@ ting lives look like , and our new set of super@@ her@@ o@@ es ."
"For a long time , this is the imag@@ e of American man@@ ho@@ od that domin@@ ated — t@@ ough , ru@@ g@@ g@@ ed , in control of his own environ@@ ment ."
"A few years ago , the Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o M@@ an was re@@ ti@@ red and re@@ plac@@ ed by this much less im@@ pres@@ sive spec@@ im@@ en , who is a par@@ ody of American man@@ ho@@ od , and that &apos;s what we have in our com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als today ."
The ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; fir@@ st@@ -@@ born son &quot; &quot; is so de@@ ep@@ ly in@@ gra@@ ined in our consciousness that this stat@@ is@@ tic al@@ one sh@@ oc@@ ked me .
"In American f@@ ert@@ il@@ ity cl@@ in@@ ics , 7@@ 5 percent of cou@@ pl@@ es are re@@ ques@@ ting girls and not bo@@ ys ."
"And in places where you wouldn &apos;t think , such as S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ ea , India and China , the very str@@ ic@@ t pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al societies are starting to bre@@ ak down a little , and famil@@ ies are no longer st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly pre@@ fer@@ r@@ ing fir@@ st@@ -@@ born s@@ ons ."
"If you think about this , if you just open your ey@@ es to this possi@@ bility and start to con@@ n@@ ect the d@@ ots , you can see the evidence every@@ where ."
"You can see it in college grad@@ u@@ ation patterns , in job pro@@ jec@@ tions , in our marri@@ age stat@@ is@@ tics , you can see it in the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c elec@@ tions , which you &apos;ll hear about later , and you can see it on S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ an sur@@ ve@@ ys on son pre@@ fer@@ ence , that something amazing and un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented is happening with women ."
C@@ ert@@ ain@@ ly this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had great progress with women .
The &apos; 20@@ s and the &apos; 6@@ 0s also come to mind .
"But the difference is that , back then , it was driv@@ en by a very pas@@ sion@@ ate f@@ em@@ in@@ ist mov@@ ement that was trying to pro@@ ject its own des@@ ir@@ es , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as this time , it &apos;s not about passion , and it &apos;s not about any kind of mov@@ ement ."
This is really just about the fac@@ ts of this economic moment that we live in .
"The 200@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ year peri@@ od in which men have been top do@@ g is tr@@ ul@@ y coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why I talk about the &quot; &quot; end of men . &quot; &quot; Now all you men out there , this is not the moment where you tun@@ e out or th@@ row some to@@ ma@@ to@@ es , because the point is that this is happening to all of us ."
I my@@ self have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and and a father and two s@@ ons wh@@ om I de@@ arly love .
"And this is why I like to talk about this , because if we don &apos;t ac@@ knowledge it , then the trans@@ ition will be pretty pain@@ ful ."
"But if we do take ac@@ coun@@ t of it , then I think it will go much more smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly ."
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago .
"I was read@@ ing head@@ lin@@ es about the rec@@ es@@ sion just like any@@ one else , and I started to not@@ ice a dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t pat@@ tern — that the rec@@ es@@ sion was af@@ fec@@ ting men much more de@@ ep@@ ly than it was af@@ fec@@ ting women ."
"And I remem@@ ber@@ ed back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Su@@ sa@@ n F@@ al@@ u@@ di called &quot; &quot; S@@ ti@@ f@@ f@@ ed : The B@@ et@@ ra@@ y@@ al of the American M@@ an , &quot; &quot; in which she descri@@ bed how hard the rec@@ es@@ sion had h@@ it men , and I started to think about whether it had g@@ ot@@ ten wor@@ se this time around in this rec@@ es@@ sion ."
And I real@@ ized that two things were different this time around .
The first was that these were no longer just tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ its that the rec@@ es@@ sion was giving men — that this was re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting a de@@ ep@@ er under@@ l@@ ying shi@@ ft in our global econom@@ y .
"And second , that the story was no longer just about the c@@ ris@@ is of men , but it was also about what was happening to women ."
And now look at this second set of sl@@ ides .
These are head@@ lin@@ es about what &apos;s been going on with women in the next few years .
These are things we never could have imag@@ ined a few years ago .
"W@@ omen , a maj@@ or@@ ity of the work@@ place ."
And lab@@ or stat@@ is@@ tics : women take up most man@@ ag@@ er@@ ial j@@ obs .
This second set of head@@ lin@@ es — you can see that famil@@ ies and marri@@ ages are starting to shi@@ ft .
And look at that last head@@ line — young women ear@@ ning more than young men .
That particular head@@ line comes to me from a market research fir@@ m .
They were basically asked by one of their cli@@ ents who was going to buy h@@ ous@@ es in that ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in the future .
"And they expec@@ ted that it would be young famil@@ ies , or young men , just like it had always been ."
"But in fact , they found something very sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"It was young , single women who were the maj@@ or pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ers of h@@ ous@@ es in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And so they decided , because they were in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this fin@@ ding , to do a na@@ tion@@ w@@ ide surv@@ ey ."
"So they sp@@ read out all the cen@@ su@@ s data , and what they found , the guy descri@@ bed to me as a sh@@ oc@@ k@@ er , which is that in 1@@ ,@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 out of 2@@ ,000 commun@@ ities , women , young women , were making more money than young men ."
So here you have a gener@@ ation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more power@@ ful ear@@ n@@ ers than the young men around them .
"Now , I &apos;ve just la@@ id out the picture for you , but I still hav@@ en &apos;t expla@@ ined to you why this is happening ."
"And in a moment , I &apos;m going to show you a gra@@ p@@ h , and what you &apos;ll see on this gra@@ p@@ h — it begin@@ s in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , just before women start f@@ lo@@ od@@ ing the work@@ force , and it br@@ ings us up to our curr@@ ent day ."
And basically what you &apos;ll see is what econom@@ ists talk about as the pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation of the econom@@ y .
Now what does that mean ?
"It means that the econom@@ y is d@@ ivid@@ ing into high@@ -@@ sk@@ ill , high@@ -@@ w@@ age j@@ obs and low@@ -@@ sk@@ ill , low@@ -@@ w@@ age j@@ obs — and that the middle , the mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ sk@@ ill j@@ obs , and the mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ ear@@ ning j@@ obs , are starting to dro@@ p out of the econom@@ y ."
This has been going on for 40 years now .
But this process is af@@ fec@@ ting men very differ@@ ently than it &apos;s af@@ fec@@ ting women .
"You &apos;ll see the women in red , and you &apos;ll see the men in bl@@ ue ."
"You &apos;ll wat@@ ch them both dro@@ p out of the middle class , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men ."
There we go .
So wat@@ ch that . You see them both dro@@ p out of the middle class .
W@@ at@@ ch what happens to the women . W@@ at@@ ch what happens to the men .
"The men sort of st@@ ag@@ n@@ ate there , while the women zo@@ om up in those high@@ -@@ sk@@ ill j@@ obs ."
So what &apos;s that about ?
"It looks like women got some power bo@@ o@@ st on a video ga@@ me , or like they s@@ n@@ uc@@ k in some sec@@ ret ser@@ um into their bir@@ th@@ -@@ control p@@ il@@ ls that l@@ ets them sho@@ ot up high ."
"But of course , it &apos;s not about that ."
What it &apos;s about is that the econom@@ y has changed a lot .
"We used to have a man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing econom@@ y , which was about building go@@ ods and produc@@ ts , and now we have a ser@@ vic@@ e econom@@ y and an information and cre@@ ative econom@@ y ."
"Th@@ ose two economi@@ es requ@@ ire very different sk@@ il@@ ls , and as it happens , women have been much better at ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the new set of sk@@ il@@ ls than men have been ."
"It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn &apos;t have a college de@@ gre@@ e , but you had a spec@@ if@@ ic set of sk@@ il@@ ls , and with the help of a un@@ ion , you could make yourself a pretty good mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ class life ."
But that really isn &apos;t true any@@ more .
"This new econom@@ y is pretty in@@ different to size and str@@ eng@@ th , which is what &apos;s hel@@ ped men along all these years ."
What the econom@@ y requ@@ ir@@ es now is a whole different set of sk@@ il@@ ls .
"You basically need intelligence , you need an ability to s@@ it still and foc@@ us , to commun@@ ic@@ ate op@@ en@@ ly , to be able to list@@ en to people and to oper@@ ate in a work@@ place that is much more flu@@ id than it used to be , and those are things that women do extre@@ m@@ ely well , as we &apos;re seeing ."
"If you look at man@@ ag@@ ement theory these days , it used to be that our ide@@ al lead@@ er s@@ oun@@ ded something like G@@ ener@@ al P@@ at@@ ton , right ?"
You would be issu@@ ing or@@ d@@ ers from ab@@ ove .
You would be very h@@ ier@@ arch@@ ical .
You would tell everyone bel@@ ow you what to do .
But that &apos;s not what an ide@@ al lead@@ er is like now .
"If you read man@@ ag@@ ement bo@@ o@@ ks now , a lead@@ er is somebody who can fo@@ st@@ er cre@@ ati@@ vity , who can get his — get the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es — see , I still say &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; — who can get the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es to talk to each other , who can basically build te@@ ams and get them to be cre@@ ative ."
And those are all things that women do very well .
"And then on top of that , that &apos;s created a kind of cas@@ c@@ ad@@ ing ef@@ fect ."
"W@@ omen en@@ ter the work@@ place at the top , and then at the working class , all the new j@@ obs that are created are the kinds of j@@ obs that w@@ iv@@ es used to do for f@@ ree at home ."
"So that &apos;s chil@@ d@@ care , el@@ der care and food pre@@ par@@ ation ."
"So those are all the j@@ obs that are gro@@ wing , and those are j@@ obs that women t@@ end to do ."
"Now one day it might be that mo@@ thers will h@@ ire an ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ work , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed , form@@ er ste@@ el@@ work@@ er guy to wat@@ ch their children at home , and that would be good for the men , but that h@@ as@@ n &apos;t quite happened yet ."
"@@ To see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the work@@ force that is now , you have to look at our future work@@ force ."
And here the story is fa@@ ir@@ ly simple .
W@@ omen are getting college de@@ gre@@ es at a fas@@ ter rate than men .
Why ? This is a real my@@ ster@@ y .
"P@@ eople have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to college , to commun@@ ity college , say , and re@@ to@@ ol themselves , learn a new set of sk@@ il@@ ls ?"
Well it turns out that they &apos;re just very un@@ com@@ for@@ table doing that .
"They &apos;re used to thinking of themselves as pro@@ vid@@ ers , and they can &apos;t seem to build the social n@@ et@@ works that al@@ low them to get through college ."
So for some reason men just don &apos;t end up going back to college .
And what &apos;s even more dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing is what &apos;s happening with youn@@ ger bo@@ ys .
"There &apos;s been about a dec@@ ade of research about what people are call@@ ing the &quot; &quot; bo@@ y c@@ ris@@ is . &quot; &quot; Now the bo@@ y c@@ ris@@ is is this idea that very young bo@@ ys , for wh@@ at@@ ever reason , are doing wor@@ se in school than very young girls , and people have the@@ or@@ ies about that ."
"I@@ s it because we have an exc@@ es@@ si@@ vely ver@@ b@@ al cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um , and little girls are better at that than little bo@@ ys ?"
"O@@ r that we requ@@ ire kids to s@@ it still too much , and so bo@@ ys in@@ it@@ i@@ ally feel like fa@@ il@@ ures ?"
"And some people say it &apos;s because , in 9@@ th gra@@ de , bo@@ ys start dro@@ p@@ ping out of school ."
"Because I &apos;m writ@@ ing a book about all this , I &apos;m still looking into it , so I don &apos;t have the answer ."
"But in the mean time , I &apos;m going to call on the wor@@ ld@@ w@@ ide education exper@@ t , who &apos;s my 1@@ 0-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old dau@@ ghter , N@@ oa , to talk to you about why the bo@@ ys in her class do wor@@ se ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ oa : The girls are ob@@ vi@@ ously s@@ mar@@ ter .
I mean they have much larg@@ er v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
They learn much fas@@ ter .
They are more contro@@ l@@ led .
"O@@ n the bo@@ ard today for lo@@ sing rec@@ ess to@@ mor@@ row , only bo@@ ys ."
H@@ an@@ na R@@ os@@ in : And why is that ?
N@@ oa : Why ? They were just not list@@ en@@ ing to the class while the girls sa@@ t there very n@@ ic@@ ely .
H@@ R : So there you go .
This whole th@@ esis really came home to me when I went to vis@@ it a college in K@@ an@@ sas C@@ ity — wor@@ kin@@ g@@ -@@ class college .
"C@@ ert@@ ain@@ ly , when I was in college , I had certain expec@@ t@@ ations about my life — that my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and I would both work , and that we would equ@@ ally ra@@ ise the children ."
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and would maybe have a job , but that mo@@ st@@ ly he would be at home taking care of the kid@@ dies ."
And this was kind of a sh@@ oc@@ k@@ er to me .
And then here &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite quot@@ e from one of the girls : &quot; M@@ en are the new b@@ all and cha@@ in . &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now you l@@ au@@ gh , but that quot@@ e has kind of a st@@ ing to it , right ?"
"And I think the reason it has a st@@ ing is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t re@@ ver@@ se themselves without a lot of pa@@ in , and that &apos;s why I talk about us all going through this together ."
"The night after I tal@@ ked to these college girls , I also went to a men &apos;s group in K@@ an@@ sas , and these were exactly the kind of vic@@ tim@@ s of the man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing econom@@ y which I spo@@ ke to you about ear@@ li@@ er ."
"They were men who had been con@@ trac@@ tors , or they had been building h@@ ous@@ es and they had lo@@ st their j@@ obs after the h@@ ous@@ ing bo@@ om , and they were in this group because they were fa@@ il@@ ing to pa@@ y their child sup@@ port ."
And the in@@ struc@@ tor was up there in the class expla@@ ining to them all the ways in which they had lo@@ st their id@@ ent@@ ity in this new age .
"He was telling them they no longer had any moral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , that nob@@ ody needed them for emo@@ tional sup@@ port any@@ more , and they were not really the pro@@ vid@@ ers ."
So who were they ?
And this was very di@@ she@@ ar@@ ten@@ ing for them .
"And what he did was he w@@ ro@@ te down on the bo@@ ard &quot; $ 8@@ 5@@ ,000 , &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s her sal@@ ary , &quot; &quot; and then he w@@ ro@@ te down &quot; &quot; $ 1@@ 2@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your sal@@ ary ."
So who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; &quot; he asked them .
&quot; &quot; Wh@@ o &apos;s the dam@@ n man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot; &quot; And that really s@@ ent a sh@@ ud@@ der through the room .
"And that &apos;s part of the reason I like to talk about this , because I think it can be pretty pain@@ ful , and we really have to work through it ."
And the other reason it &apos;s kind of ur@@ gent is because it &apos;s not just happening in the U.@@ S@@ .
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
"In India , po@@ or women are learning English fas@@ ter than their mal@@ e coun@@ ter@@ parts in order to st@@ af@@ f the new call cen@@ ters that are gro@@ wing in India ."
"In China , a lot of the op@@ en@@ ing up of p@@ riv@@ ate ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship is happening because women are starting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , small bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , fas@@ ter than men ."
"And here &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite example , which is in S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ ea ."
"O@@ ver s@@ ever@@ al dec@@ ades , S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ ea built one of the most pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al societies we know about ."
They basically en@@ sh@@ r@@ ined the secon@@ d@@ -@@ class stat@@ us of women in the civ@@ il cod@@ e .
"And if women fa@@ il@@ ed to bir@@ th mal@@ e children , they were basically tre@@ ated like dom@@ es@@ tic serv@@ an@@ ts ."
And sometimes family would pra@@ y to the sp@@ ir@@ its to k@@ ill off a gir@@ l child so they could have a mal@@ e child .
"But over the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s , the S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ ea government decided they wanted to ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ ali@@ ze , and so what they did was , they started to p@@ us@@ h women into the work@@ force ."
Now they &apos;ve been as@@ king a question since 19@@ 8@@ 5 : &quot; How st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly do you pre@@ fer a fir@@ st@@ -@@ born son ? &quot;
And now look at the ch@@ art .
That &apos;s from 19@@ 8@@ 5 to 200@@ 3 .
How much do you pre@@ fer a fir@@ st@@ -@@ born son ?
So you can see that these economic changes really do have a st@@ rong ef@@ fect on our culture .
"Now because we hav@@ en &apos;t fully proc@@ ess@@ ed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our po@@ p culture in these kind of we@@ ir@@ d and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ways , where you can see that the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es are chang@@ ing ."
"And so we have on the mal@@ e side what one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues lik@@ es to call the &quot; &quot; ome@@ g@@ a mal@@ es &quot; &quot; po@@ p@@ ping up , who are the mal@@ es who are rom@@ an@@ tically chall@@ eng@@ ed lo@@ s@@ ers who can &apos;t find a job ."
And they come up in lots of different for@@ ms .
So we have the per@@ p@@ et@@ ual ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent .
We have the char@@ m@@ less mis@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ e .
Th@@ en we have our B@@ u@@ d L@@ ight guy who &apos;s the happy cou@@ ch po@@ ta@@ to .
"And then here &apos;s a sh@@ oc@@ k@@ er : even America &apos;s most s@@ ex@@ i@@ est man al@@ ive , the s@@ ex@@ i@@ est man al@@ ive gets rom@@ an@@ tically pla@@ yed these days in a movi@@ e ."
"And then on the f@@ em@@ ale side , you have the op@@ pos@@ ite , in which you have these crazy super@@ her@@ o women ."
You &apos;ve got L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a .
"You &apos;ve got our new J@@ am@@ es B@@ ond , who &apos;s An@@ g@@ el@@ ina J@@ oli@@ e ."
"And it &apos;s not just for the young , right ?"
E@@ ven H@@ el@@ en M@@ ir@@ re@@ n can hold a gu@@ n these days .
And so it fe@@ els like we have to move from this place where we &apos;ve got these ub@@ er@@ -@@ ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated imag@@ es into something that fe@@ els a little more nor@@ mal .
"So for a long time in the economic sp@@ here , we &apos;ve liv@@ ed with the ter@@ m &quot; &quot; gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing . &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;ve never really li@@ ked this ter@@ m ."
"For one thing , it put@@ s men and women in a really ant@@ agon@@ is@@ tic relation@@ ship with one another , because the men are these dev@@ ious tric@@ k@@ st@@ ers up there who &apos;ve put up this gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And we &apos;re always bel@@ ow the gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing , the women ."
"And we have a lot of sk@@ ill and experience , but it &apos;s a tric@@ k , so how are you sup@@ posed to pre@@ p@@ are to get through that gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing ?"
"And also , &quot; &quot; sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing the gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing &quot; &quot; is a ter@@ ri@@ ble ph@@ ra@@ se ."
What crazy person would po@@ p their head through a gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing ?
"So the imag@@ e that I like to think of , instead of gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing , is the high br@@ id@@ ge ."
"It &apos;s defin@@ it@@ ely ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying to st@@ and at the fo@@ ot of a high br@@ id@@ ge , but it &apos;s also pretty ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating , because it &apos;s beautiful up there , and you &apos;re looking out on a beautiful view ."
And the great thing is there &apos;s no tric@@ k like with the gl@@ as@@ s ce@@ il@@ ing .
There &apos;s no man or woman st@@ anding in the middle about to c@@ ut the c@@ ab@@ les .
There &apos;s no hole in the middle that you &apos;re going to f@@ all through .
And the great thing is that you can take any@@ one along with you .
You can bring your h@@ us@@ b@@ and along .
"You can bring your friends , or your colle@@ ag@@ ues , or your b@@ ab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter to wal@@ k along with you ."
"And h@@ us@@ ban@@ ds can dra@@ g their w@@ iv@@ es across , if their w@@ iv@@ es don &apos;t feel ready ."
"But the point about the high br@@ id@@ ge is that you have to have the con@@ f@@ idence to know that you des@@ er@@ ve to be on that br@@ id@@ ge , that you have all the sk@@ il@@ ls and experience you need in order to wal@@ k across the high br@@ id@@ ge , but you just have to make the dec@@ ision to take the first step and do it ."
Th@@ an@@ ks very much .

"A@@ t every stage of our lives we make dec@@ is@@ ions that will prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly in@@ flu@@ ence the lives of the people we &apos;re going to become , and then when we become those people , we &apos;re not always th@@ r@@ il@@ led with the dec@@ is@@ ions we made ."
So young people pa@@ y good money to get t@@ at@@ to@@ os re@@ mov@@ ed that te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers pa@@ id good money to get .
M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed people ru@@ shed to div@@ or@@ ce people who young ad@@ ults ru@@ shed to mar@@ ry .
O@@ l@@ der ad@@ ults work hard to lo@@ se what mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed ad@@ ults worked hard to ga@@ in .
O@@ n and on and on .
"The question is , as a psych@@ olog@@ ist , that fas@@ c@@ in@@ ates me is , why do we make dec@@ is@@ ions that our future selves so often re@@ gre@@ t ?"
"Now , I think one of the reas@@ ons — I &apos;ll try to con@@ vin@@ ce you today — is that we have a fundamental mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tion about the power of time ."
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the rate of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human lif@@ es@@ p@@ an , that your children seem to change by the min@@ ute but your parents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the name of this mag@@ ical point in life where change su@@ d@@ den@@ ly goes from a gal@@ lo@@ p to a cra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ en@@ age years ? I@@ s it middle age ?
"I@@ s it old age ? The answer , it turns out , for most people , is now , wh@@ er@@ ever now happens to be ."
"What I want to con@@ vin@@ ce you today is that all of us are wal@@ king around with an ill@@ us@@ ion , an ill@@ us@@ ion that history , our person@@ al history , has just come to an end , that we have just rec@@ ently become the people that we were always me@@ ant to be and will be for the rest of our lives ."
Let me give you some data to back up that cl@@ a@@ im .
Here &apos;s three val@@ ues .
So how does it do so ?
"Well , we asked thousands of people ."
"We asked half of them to predic@@ t for us how much their val@@ ues would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their val@@ ues had changed in the last 10 years ."
"And this en@@ ab@@ led us to do a really interesting kind of anal@@ y@@ sis , because it al@@ lowed us to comp@@ are the predic@@ tions of people , say , 18 years old , to the re@@ por@@ ts of people who were 2@@ 8 , and to do that kind of anal@@ y@@ sis throu@@ gh@@ out the lif@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
Here &apos;s what we found .
"A@@ t every age , from 18 to 6@@ 8 in our data set , people v@@ as@@ tly under@@ es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed how much change they would experience over the next 10 years ."
We call this the &quot; &quot; end of history &quot; &quot; ill@@ us@@ ion .
"@@ To give you an idea of the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of this ef@@ fect , you can con@@ n@@ ect these two lin@@ es , and what you see here is that 18@@ -@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate chang@@ ing only as much as 5@@ 0-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds actually do ."
Now it &apos;s not just val@@ ues . It &apos;s all sor@@ ts of other things .
"For example , person@@ ality ."
"M@@ any of you know that psych@@ olog@@ ists now cl@@ a@@ im that there are five fundamental dimensions of person@@ ality : neuro@@ tic@@ ism , op@@ en@@ ness to experience , ag@@ re@@ e@@ ab@@ l@@ en@@ ess , ex@@ tr@@ aver@@ sion , and consci@@ enti@@ ous@@ ness ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , we asked people how much they expec@@ ted to change over the next 10 years , and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years , and what we found , well , you &apos;re going to get used to seeing this diag@@ ram over and over , because once again the rate of change does s@@ low as we age , but at every age , people under@@ es@@ ti@@ mate how much their person@@ alit@@ ies will change in the next dec@@ ade ."
And it isn &apos;t just e@@ ph@@ em@@ er@@ al things like val@@ ues and person@@ ality .
"You can ask people about their lik@@ es and dis@@ lik@@ es , their bas@@ ic pre@@ fer@@ ences ."
"For example , name your best fri@@ end , your fav@@ or@@ ite kind of v@@ ac@@ ation , what &apos;s your fav@@ or@@ ite h@@ ob@@ by , what &apos;s your fav@@ or@@ ite kind of mus@@ ic ."
P@@ eople can name these things .
"We ask half of them to tell us , &quot; Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years ? &quot;"
"@@ and half of them to tell us , &quot; D@@ id that change over the last 10 years ? &quot;"
D@@ o@@ es any of this matter ?
I@@ s this just a form of mis@@ -@@ predic@@ tion that doesn &apos;t have con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ?
"@@ No , it mat@@ ters quite a bit , and I &apos;ll give you an example of why ."
It bed@@ ev@@ ils our dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making in important ways .
B@@ r@@ ing to mind right now for yourself your fav@@ or@@ ite mus@@ ician today and your fav@@ or@@ ite mus@@ ician 10 years ago .
I put mine up on the scre@@ en to help you along .
"And yet , when we asked them how much they would pa@@ y to see the person who was their fav@@ or@@ ite 10 years ago per@@ form today , they say only 80 dollars ."
"Now , in a per@@ fec@@ tly ra@@ tional world , these should be the same number , but we over@@ pa@@ y for the opportun@@ ity to ind@@ ul@@ ge our curr@@ ent pre@@ fer@@ ences because we over@@ es@@ ti@@ mate their st@@ ability ."
"Wh@@ y does this happen ? We &apos;re not enti@@ rel@@ y sure , but it probably has to do with the ease of remem@@ ber@@ ing ver@@ su@@ s the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of imag@@ ining ."
"M@@ o@@ st of us can remember who we were 10 years ago , but we find it hard to imagine who we &apos;re going to be , and then we mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly think that because it &apos;s hard to imagine , it &apos;s not likely to happen ."
"S@@ or@@ ry , when people say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re us@@ u@@ ally talking about their own l@@ ack of imag@@ in@@ ation , and not about the un@@ lik@@ eli@@ ho@@ od of the ev@@ ent that they &apos;re descri@@ b@@ ing ."
"The bot@@ tom line is , time is a power@@ ful force ."
It trans@@ for@@ ms our pre@@ fer@@ ences .
It re@@ shap@@ es our val@@ ues .
It al@@ ters our person@@ alit@@ ies .
"We seem to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate this fact , but only in re@@ tro@@ sp@@ ect ."
O@@ n@@ ly when we look bac@@ k@@ wards do we real@@ ize how much change happens in a dec@@ ade .
It &apos;s a wat@@ er@@ shed on the tim@@ el@@ ine .
It &apos;s the moment at which we finally become ourselves .
H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings are works in progress that mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly think they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed .
"The person you are right now is as tr@@ an@@ si@@ ent , as f@@ le@@ et@@ ing and as tem@@ por@@ ary as all the people you &apos;ve ever been ."
The one con@@ st@@ ant in our life is change .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We &apos;ve been told to go out on a lim@@ b and say something sur@@ pris@@ ing .
"So I &apos;ll try and do that , but I want to start with two things that everyone already kno@@ ws ."
"And the first one , in fact , is something that has been known for most of rec@@ or@@ ded history , and that is , that the planet Earth , or the sol@@ ar system , or our environ@@ ment or wh@@ at@@ ever , is un@@ i@@ qu@@ ely su@@ ited to su@@ st@@ ain our evolution — or cre@@ ation , as it used to be thought — and our present ex@@ ist@@ ence , and most important , our future surviv@@ al ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys , this idea has a dra@@ ma@@ tic name : S@@ p@@ ac@@ e@@ ship Earth ."
"And the idea there is that outside the sp@@ ac@@ e@@ ship , the universe is im@@ plac@@ ably ho@@ st@@ ile , and inside is all we have , all we de@@ p@@ end on , and we only get the one chan@@ ce : if we m@@ ess up our sp@@ ac@@ e@@ ship , we &apos;ve got no@@ where else to go ."
"Now , the second thing that everyone already kno@@ ws is that , con@@ tr@@ ary to what was beli@@ ev@@ ed for most of human history , human be@@ ings are not , in fact , the hu@@ b of ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
"As S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king f@@ amo@@ us@@ ly said , we &apos;re just a chem@@ ical sc@@ um on the sur@@ face of a typ@@ ical planet that &apos;s in or@@ bit around a typ@@ ical star , which is on the outs@@ k@@ ir@@ ts of a typ@@ ical galaxy , and so on ."
"Now , the first of those two things that everyone kno@@ ws is kind of saying that we &apos;re at a very un@@ -@@ typ@@ ical place , un@@ i@@ qu@@ ely su@@ ited and so on , and the second one is saying that we &apos;re at a typ@@ ical place ."
But that doesn &apos;t pre@@ v@@ ent them from both being completely f@@ al@@ se .
( Laughter ) And they are .
"So let me start with the second one : &quot; &quot; Ty@@ p@@ ical . &quot; &quot; Well , is this a typ@@ ical place ?"
"Well , let &apos;s look around , you know , look in a ran@@ dom direc@@ tion , and we see a w@@ all , and chem@@ ical sc@@ um — ( Laughter ) and that &apos;s not typ@@ ical of the universe at all ."
"A@@ ll you &apos;ve got to do is go a few hundred mil@@ es in that same direc@@ tion and look back , and you won &apos;t see any w@@ all@@ s or chem@@ ical sc@@ um at all — all you see is a bl@@ ue planet ."
"And if you go fur@@ ther than that , you &apos;ll see the Su@@ n , the sol@@ ar system and the stars and so on , but that &apos;s still not typ@@ ical of the universe , because stars come in galaxies ."
"So let &apos;s go out fur@@ ther , t@@ ill we &apos;re outside the galaxy , and look back , and ye@@ ah , there &apos;s the huge galaxy with sp@@ i@@ ral ar@@ ms la@@ id out in front of us ."
"And at this point , we &apos;ve come 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 ligh@@ t-@@ years from here ."
But we &apos;re still no@@ where ne@@ ar a typ@@ ical place in the universe .
"@@ To get to a typ@@ ical place , you &apos;ve got to go 1@@ ,000 times as far as that , into inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space ."
"And so , what does that look like — &quot; &quot; typ@@ ical ? &quot; &quot; What does a &quot; &quot; typ@@ ical &quot; &quot; place in the universe look like ?"
"Well , at en@@ or@@ mo@@ us exp@@ en@@ se , TE@@ D has ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ed a high@@ -@@ res@@ olu@@ tion im@@ mer@@ sion vir@@ tual reality ren@@ der@@ ing of the view from inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space ."
"C@@ an we have the ligh@@ ts off , pl@@ ease , so we can see it ?"
"Well , not quite , not quite per@@ fect ."
"You see , inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space is completely dark , p@@ it@@ ch dark ."
"It &apos;s so dark , that if you were to be looking at the ne@@ ar@@ est star to you , and that star were to explo@@ de as a super@@ no@@ va , and you were to be star@@ ing direc@@ tly at it at the moment when its light re@@ ach@@ ed you , you still wouldn &apos;t be able to see even a g@@ lim@@ m@@ er ."
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
"And that &apos;s des@@ p@@ ite the fact that a super@@ no@@ va is so b@@ right , so br@@ il@@ li@@ ant an ev@@ ent , that it would k@@ ill you st@@ one de@@ ad at a ran@@ ge of s@@ ever@@ al ligh@@ t-@@ years ."
"( Laughter ) And yet , from inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , it &apos;s so far away you wouldn &apos;t even see it ."
It &apos;s also very c@@ old out there — less than three de@@ gre@@ es ab@@ ove ab@@ sol@@ ute z@@ ero .
And it &apos;s very emp@@ ty .
The v@@ ac@@ u@@ um there is one million times less den@@ se than the high@@ est v@@ ac@@ u@@ um that our best technology on Earth can curr@@ ently create .
So that &apos;s how different a typ@@ ical place is from this place .
And that is how un@@ -@@ typ@@ ical this place is .
So can we have the ligh@@ ts back on pl@@ ease ? Thank you .
"Now , how do we know about an environ@@ ment that &apos;s so far away and so different and so ali@@ en from anything we &apos;re used to ?"
"Well , the Earth — our environ@@ ment , in the form of us — is cre@@ ating knowledge ."
"Well , what does that mean ?"
"Well , look out even fur@@ ther than we &apos;ve just been — I mean from here , with a tel@@ esc@@ ope — and you &apos;ll see things that look like stars , they &apos;re called qu@@ as@@ ars ."
"&quot; Q@@ u@@ as@@ ars &quot; or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally me@@ ant &quot; qu@@ asi@@ -@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ar object , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; things that look a bit like stars . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But they &apos;re not stars ."
And we know what they are .
"B@@ il@@ lions of years ago and bil@@ lions of ligh@@ t-@@ years away , the material at the center of a galaxy coll@@ ap@@ sed to@@ wards a super@@ -@@ massive black hole ."
"Now , the physics of the human brain could har@@ d@@ ly be more un@@ like the physics of such a j@@ et ."
We couldn &apos;t surv@@ ive for an inst@@ ant in it .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age bre@@ ak@@ s down when trying to descri@@ be what it would be like in one of those j@@ ets .
"( Laughter ) And yet , that j@@ et happened in prec@@ is@@ ely such a way that bil@@ lions of years later , on the other side of the universe , some bit of chem@@ ical sc@@ um could ac@@ cu@@ rat@@ ely descri@@ be and mo@@ del and predic@@ t and explain , ab@@ ove all — there &apos;s your re@@ fer@@ ence — what was happening there , in reality ."
"@@ Not just a super@@ fic@@ ial imag@@ e of it , though it con@@ ta@@ ins that as well , but an ex@@ plan@@ at@@ ory mo@@ del , em@@ b@@ od@@ ying the same ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical relation@@ shi@@ ps and the same c@@ au@@ sal structure ."
"Now , that is knowledge ."
"And if that wer@@ en &apos;t amazing enough , the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful@@ ness with which the one structure res@@ em@@ bl@@ es the other is increas@@ ing with time ."
That is the growth of knowledge .
"So , the laws of physics have this spec@@ ial pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y , that physical ob@@ jects as un@@ like each other as they could possi@@ bly be , can n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess em@@ body the same ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical and c@@ au@@ sal structure and to do it more and more so over time ."
So we are a chem@@ ical sc@@ um that is different .
This chem@@ ical sc@@ um has univer@@ sal@@ ity .
"I@@ ts structure con@@ ta@@ ins , with ever@@ -@@ increas@@ ing prec@@ ision , the structure of everything ."
"This place , and not other places in the universe , is a hu@@ b which con@@ ta@@ ins within itself the struc@@ tu@@ ral and c@@ au@@ sal ess@@ ence of the whole of the rest of physical reality ."
"And so , far from being in@@ si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , the fact that the laws of physics al@@ low this or even man@@ da@@ te that this can happen , is one of the most important things about the physical world ."
"Now how does the sol@@ ar system — our environ@@ ment , in the form of us — ac@@ qu@@ ire this spec@@ ial relation@@ ship with the rest of the universe ?"
"Well , one thing that &apos;s true about S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king &apos;s re@@ mar@@ k — I mean , it is true , but it &apos;s the wrong em@@ ph@@ as@@ is ."
"One thing that &apos;s true about it is that it doesn &apos;t do it with any spec@@ ial physics , there &apos;s no spec@@ ial dis@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion , no mi@@ ra@@ cl@@ es inv@@ ol@@ ved ."
It does it simply with three things that we have here in ab@@ und@@ ance .
"One of them is matter , because the growth of knowledge is a form of information proc@@ ess@@ ing ."
"I@@ n@@ forma@@ tion proc@@ ess@@ ing is comput@@ ation , comput@@ ation requ@@ ir@@ es a computer — there &apos;s no known way of making a computer without matter ."
"We also need energy to make the computer , and most important , to make the me@@ dia , in ef@@ fect , on@@ to which we rec@@ or@@ d the knowledge that we disc@@ over ."
"And then thir@@ d@@ ly , less tan@@ gi@@ ble but just as essenti@@ al for the op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded cre@@ ation of knowledge , of ex@@ plan@@ ations , is evidence ."
"Now , our environ@@ ment is in@@ un@@ da@@ ted with evidence ."
"But the evidence that we used to do that was f@@ all@@ ing down on every s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter of the Earth for bil@@ lions of years before that , and will contin@@ ue to f@@ all for bil@@ lions of years af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And the same is true for all the other sci@@ ences .
"As far as we know , evidence to disc@@ over the most fundamental tr@@ u@@ ths of all the sci@@ ences is here just for the taking , on our planet ."
O@@ ur loc@@ ation is sa@@ tu@@ ra@@ ted with evidence and also with matter and energy .
"O@@ ut in inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , those three pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ it@@ es for the op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded cre@@ ation of knowledge are at their low@@ est possible sup@@ p@@ ly — as I said , it &apos;s emp@@ ty , it &apos;s c@@ old and it &apos;s dark out there ."
O@@ r is it ?
"Now actually , that &apos;s just another par@@ o@@ ch@@ ial mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) Because imagine a cu@@ be out there in inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , the same size as our home , the sol@@ ar system ."
"Now that cu@@ be is very emp@@ ty by human stan@@ dar@@ ds , but that still means that it con@@ ta@@ ins over a million t@@ ons of matter ."
"And a million t@@ ons is enough to make , say , a self-@@ con@@ ta@@ ined space st@@ ation , on which there &apos;s a col@@ on@@ y of scient@@ ists that are dev@@ ot@@ ed to cre@@ ating an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded stre@@ am of knowledge , and so on ."
"But the thing is , in a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble universe , if something isn &apos;t for@@ b@@ id@@ den by the laws of physics , then what could possi@@ bly pre@@ v@@ ent us from doing it , other than kno@@ wing how ?"
"In other words , it &apos;s a matter of knowledge , not resour@@ ces ."
"If we could do that , we &apos;d aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically have an energy sup@@ p@@ ly , because this trans@@ m@@ ut@@ ation would be a f@@ us@@ ion re@@ ac@@ tor ."
And evidence ?
"Well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human sen@@ ses , but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a tel@@ esc@@ ope , even one of pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day des@@ ign , look out , and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here ."
"And with a more power@@ ful tel@@ esc@@ ope , you &apos;ll be able to see stars and plan@@ ets in those galaxies , you &apos;ll be able to do astro@@ physics and learn the laws of physics ."
"And loc@@ ally there you could build partic@@ le ac@@ cel@@ er@@ at@@ ors , and learn el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ le physics and chem@@ is@@ try , and so on ."
P@@ rob@@ ably the har@@ d@@ est science to do would be bi@@ ology field tri@@ ps — ( Laughter ) because it would take s@@ ever@@ al hundred million years to get to the ne@@ ar@@ est li@@ fe@@ -@@ be@@ aring planet and back .
"But I have to tell you — and sor@@ ry , R@@ ich@@ ard — but I never did like bi@@ ology field tri@@ ps much , ( Laughter ) and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years . ( Laughter )"
"So in fact , inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space does con@@ tain all the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ it@@ es for the op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded cre@@ ation of knowledge ."
"A@@ n@@ y such cu@@ be any@@ where in the universe could become the same kind of hu@@ b that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there ."
"So , we &apos;re not in a un@@ i@@ qu@@ ely ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able place ."
"If inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space is cap@@ able of cre@@ ating an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded stre@@ am of ex@@ plan@@ ations , then so is almost every other environ@@ ment , so is the Earth ."
So is a pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ed Earth .
"And the li@@ mit@@ ing fac@@ tor , there and here , is not resour@@ ces , because they &apos;re pl@@ enti@@ ful , but knowledge , which is sc@@ ar@@ ce ."
Now this co@@ s@@ mic knowl@@ ed@@ ge@@ -@@ bas@@ ed view may — and I think ou@@ ght to — make us feel very spec@@ ial .
"But it should also make us feel v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able , because it means that without the spec@@ if@@ ic knowledge that &apos;s needed to surv@@ ive the on@@ going chall@@ eng@@ es of the universe , we won &apos;t surv@@ ive them ."
"A@@ ll it takes is for a super@@ no@@ va to go off a few ligh@@ t-@@ years away , and we &apos;ll all be de@@ ad !@@ "
"M@@ ar@@ ti@@ n R@@ e@@ es has rec@@ ently writ@@ ten a book about our v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability to all sor@@ ts of things , from astro@@ physics , to scientific experim@@ ents gone wrong , and most import@@ an@@ tly , to ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m with we@@ a@@ pon@@ s of mass des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion ."
And he thin@@ ks that civiliz@@ ation has only a 50 percent chan@@ ce of surviv@@ ing this century .
I think he &apos;s going to talk about that later in the con@@ fer@@ ence .
"Now , I don &apos;t think that prob@@ ability is the right cat@@ eg@@ ory to disc@@ us@@ s this issue in , but I do ag@@ ree with him about this : We can surv@@ ive and we can fa@@ il to surv@@ ive ."
"But it de@@ pen@@ ds not on chan@@ ce , but on whether we create the rel@@ ev@@ ant knowledge in time ."
The dan@@ ger is not at all un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented .
S@@ pec@@ ies go ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t all the time .
C@@ iv@@ iliz@@ ations end .
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing maj@@ or@@ ity of all spec@@ ies and all civiliz@@ ations that have ever ex@@ is@@ ted are now history .
"And if we want to be the ex@@ cep@@ tion to that , then log@@ ically , our only hope is to make use of the one fe@@ ature that dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish@@ es our spec@@ ies and civiliz@@ ation from all the others — nam@@ ely , our spec@@ ial relation@@ ship with the laws of physics , our ability to create new ex@@ plan@@ ations , new knowledge — to be a hu@@ b of ex@@ ist@@ ence ."
"Now , I &apos;m a physic@@ ist , but I &apos;m not the right kind of physic@@ ist ."
"In re@@ gar@@ d to global war@@ m@@ ing , I &apos;m just a la@@ y@@ man ."
And the ra@@ tional thing for a la@@ y@@ man to do is to take ser@@ i@@ ously the pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing scientific theory .
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to that theory , it &apos;s already too l@@ ate to av@@ o@@ id a disa@@ st@@ er , because if it &apos;s true that our best op@@ tion at the moment is to pre@@ v@@ ent C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ sions with something like the K@@ y@@ ot@@ o P@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l , with its con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts on economic acti@@ vity and its en@@ or@@ mo@@ us cost of hund@@ re@@ ds of bil@@ lions of dollars , or wh@@ at@@ ever it is , then that is already a disa@@ st@@ er by any reas@@ on@@ able measure ."
"And the ac@@ tions that are adv@@ oc@@ ated are not even pur@@ port@@ ed to sol@@ ve the problem , mer@@ ely to pos@@ t@@ pon@@ e it by a little ."
"It was probably already too l@@ ate in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , when the best av@@ a@@ il@@ able scientific theory was telling us that ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al em@@ is@@ sions were about to pre@@ ci@@ p@@ it@@ ate a new ice age , in which bil@@ lions would die ."
"Now , the les@@ son of that seems c@@ lear to me , and I don &apos;t know why it isn &apos;t in@@ form@@ ing public deb@@ ate ."
It is that we can &apos;t always know .
"When we know of an im@@ pen@@ ding disa@@ st@@ er , and how to sol@@ ve it at a cost less than the cost of the disa@@ st@@ er itself , then there &apos;s not going to be much argum@@ ent , really ."
But no prec@@ au@@ tions and no prec@@ au@@ tion@@ ary princi@@ ple can av@@ o@@ id problems that we do not yet for@@ es@@ e@@ e .
"H@@ ence , we need a st@@ ance of problem@@ -@@ fi@@ x@@ ing , not just problem@@ -@@ av@@ o@@ id@@ ance ."
"If you &apos;ve been p@@ un@@ ched on the no@@ se , then the science of medic@@ ine does not con@@ s@@ ist of teach@@ ing you how to av@@ o@@ id p@@ un@@ ch@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) If me@@ d@@ ical science st@@ op@@ ped see@@ king c@@ ures and con@@ cent@@ ra@@ ted on pre@@ ven@@ tion only , then it would achi@@ eve very little of ei@@ ther ."
The world is bu@@ z@@ z@@ ing at the moment with plan@@ s to force reduc@@ tions in ga@@ s em@@ is@@ sions at all co@@ st@@ s .
"It ou@@ ght to be bu@@ z@@ z@@ ing with plan@@ s to reduc@@ e the tem@@ per@@ ature , and with plan@@ s to live at the high@@ er tem@@ per@@ ature — and not at all co@@ st@@ s , but ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ently and che@@ ap@@ ly ."
"A@@ t the moment , these things are fr@@ in@@ ge research ; they &apos;re not cent@@ ral to the human ef@@ for@@ t to face this problem , or problems in gener@@ al ."
"And with problems that we are not aw@@ are of yet , the ability to put right — not the she@@ er good l@@ uc@@ k of av@@ o@@ id@@ ing in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely — is our only hope , not just of sol@@ v@@ ing problems , but of surviv@@ al ."
"So take two st@@ one t@@ ab@@ l@@ ets , and car@@ ve on them ."
"O@@ n one of them , car@@ ve : &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ l@@ ems are sol@@ ub@@ le . &quot; &quot; And on the other one , car@@ ve : &quot; &quot; P@@ rob@@ l@@ ems are in@@ ev@@ it@@ able . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
They need to be part of the p@@ ack .
"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use dig@@ ital technology , as I &apos;ve done d@@ uring my first five TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I have progres@@ sed , and I am , today , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing a br@@ and new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x con@@ ta@@ ins one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people ."
"In the develop@@ ing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they liv@@ ed away then .
There was a big ga@@ p between the one billion in the ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed world and the two billion in the develop@@ ing world .
"In the ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ aliz@@ ed world , people were heal@@ thy , educ@@ ated , r@@ ich , and they had small famil@@ ies ."
And their as@@ pi@@ ration was to buy a c@@ ar .
"And in 19@@ 60 , all S@@ w@@ ed@@ es were sav@@ ing to try to buy a V@@ ol@@ v@@ o like this ."
This was the economic level at which S@@ w@@ ed@@ en was .
"But in con@@ tra@@ st to this , in the develop@@ ing world , far away , the as@@ pi@@ ration of the average family there was to have food for the day ."
They were sav@@ ing to be able to buy a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es .
There was an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us ga@@ p in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this ga@@ p between the W@@ est and the rest has created a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing W@@ or@@ ld . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s over@@ d@@ ue to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of compan@@ ies have happened to grow the econom@@ y , so the W@@ es@@ tern population mov@@ ed over to here ."
And now their as@@ pi@@ ration is not only to have a c@@ ar .
Now they want to have a ho@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ mo@@ te des@@ tin@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most success@@ ful of the develop@@ ing countries , they have mov@@ ed on , you know , and they have become em@@ er@@ ging economi@@ es , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ ying c@@ ars .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ in@@ ese compan@@ y , G@@ e@@ ely , they ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red the V@@ ol@@ v@@ o compan@@ y , and then finally the S@@ w@@ ed@@ es underst@@ ood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y is that the two billion over here that is st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing for food and sho@@ es , they are still almost as po@@ or as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the big@@ gest p@@ ile of bil@@ lions , the three bil@@ lions here , which are also becom@@ ing em@@ er@@ ging economi@@ es , because they are quite heal@@ thy , rel@@ ati@@ vely well-@@ educ@@ ated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; ri@@ ch@@ er also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ pi@@ ration now is , of course , to buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle , and then later on they would like to have a mo@@ t@@ or@@ b@@ ik@@ e also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any ga@@ p ."
"But the dis@@ tan@@ ce from the po@@ or@@ est here , the very po@@ or@@ est , to the very ri@@ ch@@ est over here is w@@ id@@ er than ever ."
"But there is a contin@@ u@@ ous world from wal@@ king , b@@ ik@@ ing , driv@@ ing , fl@@ ying — there are people on all lev@@ els , and most people t@@ end to be some@@ where in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to pro@@ ject into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ han@@ gh@@ ai rec@@ ently , and I list@@ en@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will cat@@ ch up , just as Jap@@ an did ."
All the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start fl@@ ying .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the em@@ er@@ ging income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards econom@@ ically ."
"And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can av@@ o@@ id s@@ ev@@ ere cli@@ mate change , and energy can still be rel@@ ati@@ vely che@@ a@@ p — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy elec@@ tri@@ c c@@ ars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the po@@ or@@ est two billion ?
What about the po@@ or@@ est two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; amo@@ n@@ g em@@ er@@ ging economi@@ es &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ id@@ ely used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"@@ Here &#91; amo@@ n@@ g the po@@ or@@ est &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; po@@ or@@ est &#93; two billion will , in the next dec@@ ades , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a n@@ uc@@ lear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the po@@ or@@ est &#93; get out of pov@@ ert@@ y , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child surviv@@ al , they can buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle and a c@@ ell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and sho@@ es because then we get contin@@ u@@ ed population growth .
And let me show you why by con@@ v@@ ert@@ ing back to the ol@@ d@@ -@@ time dig@@ ital technology .
Here I have on the scre@@ en my country b@@ ub@@ bl@@ es .
E@@ very b@@ ub@@ ble is a country . The size is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ el@@ low on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark bl@@ ue is A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ; bro@@ wn is Eu@@ rop@@ e ; gre@@ en is the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast and this light bl@@ ue is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ sia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . S@@ ize is population .
"@@ Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big famil@@ ies , small famil@@ ies ."
The year is 19@@ 60 .
"And down here , child surviv@@ al , the per@@ cent@@ age of children surviv@@ ing chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od up to starting school : 60 percent , 7@@ 0 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and heal@@ th@@ i@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion W@@ es@@ tern world here — high chil@@ d@@ -@@ surviv@@ al , small famil@@ ies — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develop@@ ing countries , with very large famil@@ ies and po@@ or child surviv@@ al ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years pas@@ s by , child surviv@@ al is increas@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ a@@ p , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , v@@ acc@@ in@@ ation , pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ am@@ ily size is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0-@@ percent child surviv@@ al , then famil@@ ies de@@ cre@@ ase , and most of the A@@ ra@@ b countries in the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast is f@@ all@@ ing down there &#91; to small famil@@ ies &#93; ."
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok , B@@ an@@ gl@@ ad@@ esh cat@@ ch@@ ing up with India ."
"The whole em@@ er@@ ging world jo@@ ins the W@@ es@@ tern world with good child surviv@@ al and small family size , but we still have the po@@ or@@ est billion ."
"C@@ an you see the po@@ or@@ est billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ x@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child surviv@@ al of only 7@@ 0 to 80 percent , mean@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at le@@ ast four who surv@@ ive to the next gener@@ ation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one gener@@ ation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve child surviv@@ al to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why inv@@ est@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and a@@ id organiz@@ ations , together with national government in the po@@ or@@ est countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to re@@ ach a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able population size of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
Ch@@ il@@ d surviv@@ al is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child surviv@@ al that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mis@@ t , nei@@ ther am I a p@@ es@@ sim@@ ist ."
"I &apos;m a very ser@@ ious &quot; &quot; possi@@ bil@@ ist . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new cat@@ eg@@ ory where we take emo@@ tion ap@@ art , and we just work anal@@ y@@ tically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"W@@ ith gre@@ en technology and with inv@@ est@@ ments to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate pov@@ ert@@ y , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old W@@ est .
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber when this bl@@ ue bo@@ x was all al@@ one , lead@@ ing the world , living its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion of the moder@@ n world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

S@@ up@@ pose that two American friends are tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing together in I@@ tal@@ y .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him B@@ ill — is trans@@ fi@@ x@@ ed by em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ment , at star@@ ing at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two gu@@ ys was more likely to have v@@ ot@@ ed for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , which for A@@ l G@@ ore ?"
"And in this case , the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a maj@@ or person@@ ality tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"P@@ eople low on it like things that are famil@@ i@@ ar , that are sa@@ fe and de@@ pen@@ da@@ ble ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at Ap@@ pl@@ eb@@ e@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also tel@@ ls us a lot about polit@@ ics .
This tra@@ it also tel@@ ls us a lot about the kinds of gro@@ ups people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the W@@ eb .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to ra@@ ise your hand , whether you are liber@@ al , left of center — on social issu@@ es , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ mar@@ ily — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a third op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of li@@ b@@ ert@@ ari@@ ans in the audi@@ ence ."
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re li@@ b@@ ert@@ arian .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And pl@@ ease ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to see@@ k a de@@ ep@@ er understanding of the world , our gener@@ al l@@ ack of moral d@@ iver@@ sity here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share val@@ ues , when people all share moral@@ s , they become a te@@ am , and once you en@@ ga@@ ge the psych@@ ology of te@@ ams , it sh@@ ut@@ s down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the liber@@ al te@@ am lo@@ ses , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other te@@ am .
"We think they must be bl@@ ind@@ ed by relig@@ ion , or by simple st@@ up@@ id@@ ity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ ot@@ es R@@ e@@ pub@@ l@@ ic@@ an because they are bl@@ ind@@ ed in this way , then my mes@@ sa@@ ge to you is that you &apos;re tra@@ pped in a moral mat@@ ri@@ x , in a particular moral mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pic@@ ked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psych@@ ology and see where it takes us .
What is moral@@ ity and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psych@@ ology is the idea that the mind is a bl@@ ank sl@@ ate at bir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ it@@ ial organiz@@ ation of the brain does not de@@ p@@ end that much on experience ."
It giv@@ es us very st@@ rong feel@@ ings about those who cause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion under@@ li@@ es about 7@@ 0 percent of the moral stat@@ em@@ ents I &apos;ve heard here at TE@@ D .
The third f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is in@@ -@@ group / lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
You do find gro@@ ups in the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom — you do find co@@ oper@@ ative gro@@ ups — but these gro@@ ups are always ei@@ ther very small or they &apos;re all si@@ bl@@ ings .
"It &apos;s only amo@@ n@@ g hum@@ ans that you find very large gro@@ ups of people who are able to co@@ oper@@ ate , jo@@ in together into gro@@ ups , but in this case , gro@@ ups that are un@@ ited to fi@@ ght other gro@@ ups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tri@@ b@@ al living , of tri@@ b@@ al psych@@ ology ."
( Laughter ) S@@ por@@ ts is to war as por@@ no@@ graph@@ y is to sex .
"We get to ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent driv@@ es ."
The f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is au@@ th@@ or@@ ity / res@@ p@@ ect .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive g@@ est@@ ures from two mem@@ bers of very clo@@ s@@ ely rel@@ ated spec@@ ies .
"It &apos;s bas@@ ed on more vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary de@@ fer@@ ence , and even el@@ em@@ ents of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is pur@@ ity / san@@ c@@ t@@ ity .
"This pain@@ ting is called &quot; &quot; The A@@ l@@ le@@ g@@ ory O@@ f Ch@@ as@@ t@@ ity , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about sup@@ pres@@ sing f@@ em@@ ale s@@ ex@@ ual@@ ity ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"@@ Here are the results from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens ."
"They give high end@@ or@@ s@@ ement of these sor@@ ts of stat@@ em@@ ents all across the bo@@ ard , but as you also see , liber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the line s@@ lo@@ p@@ es down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just f@@ li@@ p through a few other sl@@ ides .
"@@ N@@ ot@@ ice also that on all of these graph@@ s , the s@@ lo@@ p@@ e is ste@@ ep@@ er on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , pur@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ich sho@@ ws that within any country , the disa@@ gre@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fa@@ ir@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first pan@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll is or@@ der@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and an@@ im@@ als are doing what they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be doing , where they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be ."
"But then , given the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing wh@@ at@@ ever he wan@@ ts , with every ap@@ ert@@ ure of every other person and every other an@@ ima@@ l ."
S@@ ome of you might reco@@ gni@@ ze this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably giv@@ es way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the c@@ ut@@ tin@@ gs of the ap@@ ert@@ ures h@@ ur@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ t@@ y@@ ch , these three pan@@ els port@@ ra@@ y the tim@@ el@@ ess tr@@ uth that order ten@@ ds to dec@@ ay ."
The tr@@ uth of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first ro@@ und , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people ar@@ en &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a suc@@ k@@ er . I &apos;m not going to co@@ oper@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so co@@ oper@@ ation qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly dec@@ a@@ ys from reas@@ on@@ ably good , down to clo@@ se to z@@ ero ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tric@@ k — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ ach@@ ter said , on the s@@ ev@@ ent@@ h ro@@ und , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New rul@@ e ."
Because I think that the gre@@ at@@ est won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of roc@@ k , and then a lot of water and w@@ ind , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that compl@@ ic@@ ated .
"This is an ab@@ sol@@ ute mi@@ ra@@ cle , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the disa@@ gre@@ ement between liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an relig@@ ions have at@@ ta@@ ined .
Th@@ ink about y@@ in and y@@ an@@ g .
You find the same thing in H@@ ind@@ u@@ ism .
There are many high g@@ ods in H@@ ind@@ u@@ ism .
"@@ T@@ w@@ o of them are V@@ ishn@@ u , the pres@@ er@@ ver , and S@@ h@@ iv@@ a , the des@@ tro@@ y@@ er ."
This imag@@ e actually is both of those g@@ ods shar@@ ing the same body .
"You have the mar@@ kin@@ gs of V@@ ishn@@ u on the left , so we could think of V@@ ishn@@ u as the con@@ serv@@ ative go@@ d ."
"You have the mar@@ kin@@ gs of S@@ h@@ iv@@ a on the right , S@@ h@@ iv@@ a &apos;s the liber@@ al go@@ d . And they work together ."
"Th@@ ese two stan@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ ep@@ est in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts that have ever been at@@ ta@@ ined into moral psych@@ ology ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en ma@@ st@@ er S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; If you want the tr@@ uth to st@@ and c@@ lear before you , never be for or against ."
"The st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , it &apos;s a disease that has been c@@ au@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lead@@ ers ."
"But before you feel super@@ ior to G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , before you th@@ row a st@@ one , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ p@@ ping out of the b@@ at@@ tle of good and ev@@ il ?
C@@ an you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I telling you to not str@@ ive ?
"A@@ m I telling you to em@@ bra@@ ce S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle of for and against ?"
"@@ No , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a P@@ o@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gi@@ o V@@ i@@ e@@ ir@@ a de M@@ el@@ lo , you can &apos;t just go ch@@ arg@@ ing in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that requ@@ ire us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ or@@ mo@@ us moral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity of the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ am@@ a — and it comes from his moral hum@@ il@@ ity .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TE@@ D — is that this is a group that is pas@@ sion@@ ately en@@ gag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
P@@ eople here are pas@@ sion@@ ately en@@ gag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tr@@ uth .
And so I think that the answer is to use that pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tr@@ uth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything un@@ i@@ qu@@ e about human be@@ ings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with fully develop@@ ed moral senti@@ ments .
We &apos;re ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with moral@@ ity as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I person@@ ally am ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with moral@@ ity .
"It was all d@@ ue to this woman , S@@ is@@ ter M@@ ary M@@ aras@@ tel@@ a , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an al@@ t@@ ar bo@@ y , I bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed in a lot of in@@ cen@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ ra@@ ses in L@@ ati@@ n , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s t@@ op@@ -@@ down moral@@ ity app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were relig@@ ious and n@@ on@@ -@@ relig@@ ious were equ@@ ally ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with moral@@ ity .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly bas@@ is for moral dec@@ is@@ ions ."
But I wanted to go fur@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a chem@@ is@@ try of moral@@ ity . I want to know
if there was a moral mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experim@@ ents , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I b@@ rou@@ ght some with me .
This little sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge con@@ ta@@ ins the moral mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e found only in ma@@ m@@ m@@ als .
"In ro@@ dents , it was known to make mo@@ thers care for their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , and in some cre@@ atures , al@@ lowed for t@@ ol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ mat@@ es ."
"But in hum@@ ans , it was only known to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate bir@@ th and b@@ reas@@ t@@ fe@@ ed@@ ing in women , and is rel@@ eas@@ ed by both s@@ ex@@ es d@@ uring sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e .
I did what most of us do — I tri@@ ed it on some colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ au@@ l , that is the world &apos;s st@@ up@@ id@@ ist idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a f@@ em@@ ale mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I coun@@ ter@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a st@@ up@@ id idea ."
But it was t@@ est@@ ably st@@ up@@ id .
"In other words , I thought I could des@@ ign an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ urn@@ s out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e ."
"B@@ as@@ el@@ ine lev@@ els are ne@@ ar z@@ ero , without some s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us to cause its rel@@ ease ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ min@@ ute hal@@ f-@@ life , and de@@ grad@@ es ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly at room tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it f@@ ast and keep it c@@ old ."
I think I can do that .
"Now l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the blo@@ od , so I could do this experiment without learning neuro@@ sur@@ ger@@ y ."
Th@@ en I had to measure moral@@ ity .
So taking on M@@ or@@ ality with a cap@@ ital M is a huge pro@@ ject .
So I started sm@@ all@@ er .
I stu@@ died one single vir@@ tu@@ e : tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 200@@ 0s that countries with a high@@ er pro@@ por@@ tion of tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thy people are more pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic tr@@ an@@ sac@@ tions oc@@ c@@ ur and more we@@ al@@ th is created , all@@ ev@@ i@@ ating pov@@ ert@@ y ."
So po@@ or countries are by and large low tr@@ ust countries .
"So if I underst@@ ood the chem@@ is@@ try of tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate pov@@ ert@@ y ."
But I &apos;m also a sk@@ ep@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ ag@@ u@@ ire appro@@ ach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so vir@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we tem@@ pt people with vir@@ tu@@ e and vic@@ e by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ struc@@ tion , and we never ever de@@ ce@@ ive them ."
Th@@ en we mat@@ ch them in pa@@ ir@@ s by computer .
"And in that pa@@ ir , one person gets a mes@@ sa@@ ge saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tric@@ k is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now wh@@ at@@ ever you give up gets tri@@ pl@@ ed in the other person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ th@@ ier .
And they get a mes@@ sa@@ ge by computer saying person one s@@ ent you this amount of money .
"@@ Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to sen@@ d some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for min@@ ute .
You &apos;re going to s@@ it on these hard cha@@ ir@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome mad scient@@ ist is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a need@@ le and take four t@@ ub@@ es of blo@@ od .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stran@@ ger ?
So this was the bir@@ th of vam@@ pir@@ e econom@@ ics .
M@@ ake a dec@@ ision and give me some blo@@ od .
"So in fact , experim@@ ental econom@@ ists had run this test around the world , and for much high@@ er st@@ ak@@ es , and the con@@ sen@@ su@@ s view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of tr@@ ust , and the trans@@ fer from the second person back to the first meas@@ ured tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , econom@@ ists were fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ sum@@ ed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 90 percent of the first dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ mak@@ ers s@@ ent money , and of those who re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ turned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by meas@@ uring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ard , the more money they re@@ turned ."
So we have a bi@@ ology of tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wa@@ it . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ w@@ o things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in is@@ ol@@ ation .
"So we meas@@ ured n@@ ine other mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any ef@@ fect ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ direc@@ t relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin ca@@ used tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate oxytocin direc@@ tly ."
I used everything shor@@ t of a dr@@ ill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a na@@ sal in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ ag@@ ues in Z@@ ur@@ ich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or plac@@ eb@@ o , had that same tr@@ ust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only sho@@ wed more tr@@ ust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who s@@ ent all their money to a stran@@ ger — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or co@@ gn@@ ition ."
"So oxytocin is the tr@@ ust mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e , but is it the moral mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e ?"
"@@ U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we ra@@ n more studies ."
We sho@@ wed that oxytocin in@@ f@@ us@@ ion increas@@ es gener@@ os@@ ity in un@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ fer@@ s by 80 percent .
We sho@@ wed it increas@@ es don@@ ations to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ ted n@@ on@@ -@@ ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ olog@@ ic ways to ra@@ ise oxytocin .
"Th@@ ese incl@@ u@@ de mas@@ sa@@ ge , dan@@ cing and pra@@ ying ."
"Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise oxytocin , people w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ly open up their w@@ all@@ ets and share money with str@@ ang@@ ers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is f@@ lo@@ od@@ ed with oxytocin ?
"@@ To inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ te this question , we ra@@ n an experiment where we had people wat@@ ch a video of a father and his four ye@@ ar-@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain cancer ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they wat@@ ched the video , we had them rate their feel@@ ings and took blo@@ od before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of em@@ pa@@ thy .
So it &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us con@@ n@@ ect to other people .
It &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s em@@ pa@@ thy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known philosoph@@ er n@@ amed A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith w@@ ro@@ te a book in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The Th@@ e@@ ory of M@@ o@@ ral S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; I@@ n this book , S@@ m@@ ith arg@@ u@@ ed that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a t@@ op@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ t@@ om@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the emo@@ tions of others ."
"So if I do something that h@@ ur@@ ts you , I feel that pa@@ in ."
So I t@@ end to av@@ o@@ id that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your jo@@ y ."
So I t@@ end to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith who , 1@@ 7 years later , would write a little book called &quot; &quot; The W@@ e@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ oun@@ ding doc@@ um@@ ent of econom@@ ics ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral philosoph@@ er , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e be@@ h@@ ind it .
"But kno@@ wing that mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ e is val@@ u@@ able , because it tel@@ ls us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it tel@@ ls us why we see im@@ moral@@ ity ."
"So to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ te im@@ moral@@ ity , let me bring you back now to 19@@ 80 ."
"I &apos;m working at a ga@@ s st@@ ation on the outs@@ k@@ ir@@ ts of S@@ an@@ ta B@@ ar@@ b@@ ara , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
"You s@@ it in a ga@@ s st@@ ation all day , you see lots of moral@@ ity and im@@ moral@@ ity , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ un@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my c@@ ash@@ ier &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ pen@@ s it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lo@@ st and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very val@@ u@@ able .
"We have to find the ow@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to dec@@ ide what to do with this , and the ph@@ one r@@ ings ."
"And a man says very exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly , &quot; &quot; I was in your ga@@ s st@@ ation a while ago , and I b@@ ou@@ ght this j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry for my wi@@ fe , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re sav@@ ing my life . Here &apos;s my ph@@ one number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wa@@ it half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , rel@@ a@@ x ."
"@@ G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ ena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ ga@@ in he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so n@@ ice , let &apos;s s@@ pl@@ it the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a clas@@ si@@ c c@@ on called the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on dro@@ p , and I was the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on ."
"So the way many con@@ s work is not that the con@@ man gets the vic@@ ti@@ m to tr@@ ust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tr@@ ust@@ s the vic@@ ti@@ m ."
Now we know what happens .
"The vic@@ ti@@ m &apos;s brain rel@@ eas@@ es oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing up your w@@ all@@ et or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate our oxytocin syst@@ ems ?
"We found , tes@@ ting thousands of individ@@ ual@@ s , that five percent of the population don &apos;t rel@@ ease oxytocin on s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us ."
"So if you tr@@ ust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t rel@@ ease oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a te@@ chn@@ ical word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them bas@@ t@@ ar@@ ds .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes of psych@@ op@@ a@@ ths .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ h@@ ib@@ ited .
One is through impro@@ per n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing .
"So we &apos;ve stu@@ died s@@ ex@@ u@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t rel@@ ease oxytocin on s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us ."
You need enough n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing for this system to devel@@ op pro@@ per@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high stress in@@ h@@ ib@@ its oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really st@@ res@@ sed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ h@@ ib@@ ited , which is interesting — through the action of tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one ."
"So we , in experim@@ ents , have ad@@ min@@ is@@ ter@@ ed tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one to men ."
"And instead of shar@@ ing money , they become sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"But interes@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , high tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one mal@@ es are also more likely to use their own money to p@@ un@@ ish others for being sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bi@@ ology , we have the y@@ in and y@@ an@@ g of moral@@ ity ."
"We have oxytocin that connec@@ ts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one that makes us want to p@@ un@@ ish people who be@@ have im@@ mor@@ ally ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or government telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful labo@@ rat@@ ory experim@@ ents , do they really app@@ ly to real life ?"
"Y@@ eah , I &apos;ve been wor@@ r@@ ying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve gone out of the la@@ b to see if this really hol@@ ds in our da@@ ily lives .
"So last sum@@ m@@ er , I at@@ ten@@ ded a w@@ ed@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Engl@@ and ."
200 people in this beautiful V@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ ian man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I dro@@ ve up in my r@@ ented V@@ au@@ x@@ h@@ all .
And I took out a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and d@@ ry ice and need@@ les and t@@ ub@@ es .
And I took blo@@ od from the br@@ ide and the gro@@ om and the w@@ ed@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the friends before and im@@ medi@@ ately after the vo@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And gu@@ ess what ?
"W@@ ed@@ din@@ gs cause a rel@@ ease of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the center of the w@@ ed@@ ding sol@@ ar system ?
The br@@ ide .
She had the big@@ gest increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lo@@ ves the w@@ ed@@ ding almost as much as the br@@ ide ?
"H@@ er mother , that &apos;s right ."
H@@ er mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends — ar@@ ra@@ yed around the br@@ ide like plan@@ ets around the Su@@ n ."
"So I think it tel@@ ls us that we &apos;ve des@@ ign@@ ed this rit@@ ual to con@@ n@@ ect us to this new couple , con@@ n@@ ect us emo@@ tion@@ ally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be success@@ ful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ate the spec@@ ies .
I also wor@@ ri@@ ed that my tr@@ ust experim@@ ents with small amoun@@ ts of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how often we actually tr@@ ust our lives to str@@ ang@@ ers .
"So even though I have a fear of he@@ igh@@ ts , I rec@@ ently stra@@ pped my@@ self to another human being and ste@@ pped out of an air@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my blo@@ od before and after , and I had a huge sp@@ ik@@ e of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can con@@ n@@ ect to people .
"For example , through social me@@ dia ."
M@@ any people are T@@ we@@ et@@ ing right now .
So we inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ ted the ro@@ le of social me@@ dia and found the using social me@@ dia produc@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ dig@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I ra@@ n this experiment rec@@ ently for the K@@ or@@ e@@ an B@@ ro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting S@@ y@@ stem .
And they had the re@@ por@@ ters and their produc@@ ers par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
"And one of these gu@@ ys , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 1@@ 50 percent sp@@ ik@@ e in oxytocin ."
"I mean , as@@ t@@ oun@@ ding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social me@@ dia in p@@ riv@@ ate .
"When I w@@ ro@@ te my re@@ port to the K@@ or@@ e@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my gu@@ ess was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They ch@@ ec@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok p@@ age .
There you go . That &apos;s connec@@ tion .
"So there &apos;s t@@ ons of ways that we can con@@ n@@ ect to other people , and it seems to be univer@@ sal ."
"@@ T@@ w@@ o weeks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New G@@ u@@ in@@ ea where I went up to the high@@ lan@@ ds — very is@@ ol@@ ated tri@@ b@@ es of sub@@ s@@ ist@@ ence far@@ m@@ ers living as they have liv@@ ed for mil@@ l@@ en@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different langu@@ ages in the high@@ lan@@ ds .
These are the most pri@@ mit@@ ive people in the world .
And they inde@@ ed also rel@@ ease oxytocin .
So oxytocin connec@@ ts us to other people .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to rel@@ ease oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fav@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the eas@@ i@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . G@@ ive me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my pen@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ g@@ ging other people has ear@@ ned me the n@@ ic@@ k@@ name D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who rel@@ ease more oxytocin are happ@@ ier .
And they &apos;re happ@@ ier because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all typ@@ es .
D@@ r@@ . L@@ ove says eight hu@@ gs a day .
E@@ ight hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be happ@@ ier and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to tou@@ ch people , I can always sh@@ ove this up your no@@ se ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
Ma@@ ybe you remember .
"E@@ very day , we heard dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating re@@ por@@ ts from the war in I@@ ra@@ q ."
There were w@@ aves of ter@@ ro@@ r ro@@ l@@ ling across the glob@@ e .
It se@@ em@@ ed like hum@@ an@@ ity was sp@@ in@@ ning out of control .
"We were living through a time of t@@ ec@@ t@@ on@@ ic shi@@ f@@ ts in ide@@ ologi@@ es , in polit@@ ics , in relig@@ ion , in popul@@ ations ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing fel@@ t so prec@@ ari@@ ous .
"And I remember thinking , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , what kind of world did we bring this child into ?"
"And as we en@@ ter@@ ed the 2@@ 1@@ st century , it was very c@@ lear that relig@@ ious extre@@ mis@@ m was once again on the r@@ ise ."
"And even when relig@@ ion@@ -@@ rel@@ ated extre@@ mis@@ m does not le@@ ad to violence , it is still used as a political w@@ edge issue , c@@ y@@ n@@ ically lead@@ ing people to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y the sub@@ ordin@@ ation of women , the s@@ ti@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ z@@ ation of L@@ G@@ B@@ T people , ra@@ c@@ ism , I@@ sl@@ amo@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia and an@@ ti@@ -@@ S@@ em@@ it@@ ism ."
We need to call this what it is : a great fa@@ il@@ ure of relig@@ ion .
"But the thing is , this isn &apos;t even the only challenge that relig@@ ion fac@@ es today ."
Let me explain what I mean like this .
"One of the great bl@@ es@@ sin@@ gs of being a ra@@ b@@ b@@ i is st@@ anding under the ch@@ up@@ pa@@ h , under the w@@ ed@@ ding can@@ op@@ y , with a couple , and hel@@ ping them pro@@ cl@@ a@@ im pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ly and make ho@@ ly the love that they found for one another ."
"That &apos;s when we find ourselves in end@@ less , min@@ d@@ less re@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ ions of words that don &apos;t mean anything to us , ris@@ ing and being se@@ ated because someone has asked us to , hol@@ ding on@@ to j@@ e@@ al@@ ously gu@@ ar@@ ded doc@@ tr@@ ine that &apos;s completely and w@@ il@@ d@@ ly out of step with our con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary reality , en@@ gag@@ ing in per@@ func@@ t@@ ory prac@@ ti@@ ce simply because that &apos;s the way things have always been done ."
R@@ el@@ ig@@ ion is wan@@ ing in the United States .
"Now , we had no money , no space , no ga@@ me pl@@ an , but we did have e@@ ma@@ il ."
So my fri@@ end M@@ el@@ is@@ sa and I sa@@ t down and we w@@ ro@@ te an e@@ ma@@ il which we s@@ ent out to a few friends and colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"It basically said this : &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore you ba@@ il on relig@@ ion , why don &apos;t we come together this F@@ ri@@ day night and see what we might make of our own J@@ e@@ w@@ ish in@@ her@@ it@@ ance ? &quot; &quot; We h@@ op@@ ed maybe 20 people would show up ."
It turned out 1@@ 3@@ 5 people came .
"They were c@@ y@@ n@@ ics and se@@ ek@@ ers , a@@ the@@ ists and ra@@ b@@ b@@ is ."
M@@ any people said that night that it was the first time that they had a mean@@ ing@@ ful relig@@ ious experience in their enti@@ re lives .
"There are J@@ e@@ w@@ ish and Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an and M@@ us@@ li@@ m and C@@ a@@ th@@ oli@@ c relig@@ ious lead@@ ers , many of them women , by the way , who have set out to re@@ cl@@ a@@ im the heart of our t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions , who fir@@ m@@ ly believe that now is the time for relig@@ ion to be part of the solu@@ tion ."
"And while the the@@ ologi@@ es and the prac@@ tic@@ es v@@ ary very much between these inde@@ pen@@ d@@ ent commun@@ ities , what we can see are some common , con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent th@@ read@@ s between them ."
I &apos;m going to share with you four of those com@@ mit@@ ments now .
The first is w@@ ak@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
We live in a time today in which we have un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented acc@@ ess to information about every global tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y that happens on every cor@@ ner of this Earth .
We all saw this picture .
We saw this picture of a f@@ iv@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ old child pul@@ led out of the r@@ ub@@ ble of his building in A@@ le@@ p@@ p@@ o .
"And once we see these imag@@ es , we are called to a certain kind of action ."
This is extre@@ m@@ ely difficult to do .
"P@@ sych@@ olog@@ ists tell us that the more we learn about what &apos;s bro@@ ken in our world , the less likely we are to do anything ."
"The second princi@@ ple is hope , and I want to say this about hope ."
"H@@ ope is not na@@ ive , and hope is not an op@@ i@@ ate ."
&quot; &quot; I need you . You need me .
"It &apos;s sup@@ posed to be about giving people back a sense of pur@@ pose , a sense of hope , a sense that they and their dre@@ ams fundam@@ ent@@ ally matter in this world that tel@@ ls them that they don &apos;t matter at all ."
The third princi@@ ple is the princi@@ ple of migh@@ tin@@ ess .
There &apos;s a ra@@ b@@ bin@@ ic t@@ rad@@ ition that we are to wal@@ k around with two s@@ li@@ ps of p@@ aper in our po@@ c@@ ket@@ s .
"One says , &quot; &quot; I am but d@@ ust and ash@@ es . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not all about me ."
"I can &apos;t control everything , and I cannot do this on my own ."
"The other s@@ li@@ p of p@@ aper says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or my sa@@ ke the world was created . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ich is to say it &apos;s true that I can &apos;t do everything , but I can sur@@ ely do something ."
I can for@@ give .
I can love .
I can show up .
I can pro@@ test .
I can be a part of this con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion .
It &apos;s a si@@ g@@ n of tot@@ al sub@@ mis@@ sion .
"Now in our commun@@ ity , when we get up off the ground , we st@@ and with our hands ra@@ ised to the he@@ av@@ ens , and we say , &quot; &quot; I am st@@ rong , I am migh@@ ty , and I am wor@@ thy ."
The f@@ ou@@ rt@@ h and fin@@ al is inter@@ connec@@ t@@ ed@@ ness .
"He took a picture of it and pos@@ ted it up on social me@@ dia , and a Jap@@ an@@ ese te@@ en@@ ag@@ er cont@@ ac@@ ted him ."
How small our world has become .
It &apos;s so hard for us to remember how inter@@ connec@@ ted we all are as human be@@ ings .
Let me tell you how this works .
"And gu@@ ess what ? T@@ ran@@ sp@@ h@@ ob@@ ia and I@@ sl@@ amo@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia and ra@@ c@@ ism of all for@@ ms , those are also all of our problems ."
And so too is an@@ ti@@ -@@ S@@ em@@ it@@ ism all of our problems .
Because E@@ m@@ ma L@@ az@@ ar@@ us was right .
"O@@ ur he@@ ar@@ ts h@@ ur@@ t from the fa@@ il@@ ed relig@@ ion of extre@@ mis@@ m , and we des@@ er@@ ve more than the fa@@ il@@ ed relig@@ ion of ro@@ ut@@ in@@ e-@@ ism ."
"It is time for relig@@ ious lead@@ ers and relig@@ ious commun@@ ities to take the le@@ ad in the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual and cul@@ tu@@ ral shi@@ ft that this country and the world so des@@ per@@ ately needs — a shi@@ ft to@@ ward love , to@@ ward j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , to@@ ward equality and to@@ ward di@@ gn@@ ity for all ."
I believe that our children des@@ er@@ ve no less than that .
Thank you .

"In the W@@ est , we make a c@@ olo@@ s@@ sal mis@@ take taking it for gr@@ an@@ ted ."
"We see democra@@ cy not as the most fra@@ g@@ ile of f@@ low@@ ers that it really is , but we see it as part of our society &apos;s f@@ urn@@ it@@ ure ."
We t@@ end to think of it as an in@@ tr@@ an@@ si@@ gent given .
We mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly believe that cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism be@@ gets in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably democra@@ cy .
It doesn &apos;t .

"@@ Ton@@ ight , here , I want to present to you an economic case for an au@@ th@@ en@@ tic democra@@ cy ."
"And without democra@@ cy , our societies will be n@@ as@@ ti@@ er , our future b@@ le@@ ak and our great , new tech@@ nologi@@ es was@@ ted ."
"S@@ pe@@ ak@@ ing of was@@ te , al@@ low me to point out an interesting par@@ ad@@ o@@ x that is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ing our economi@@ es as we spe@@ ak ."
I call it the tw@@ in pe@@ ak@@ s par@@ ad@@ o@@ x .
We all reco@@ gni@@ ze the mo@@ un@@ tain of deb@@ ts .
But few people disc@@ er@@ n its tw@@ in .
"A mo@@ un@@ tain of id@@ le cas@@ h bel@@ on@@ ging to r@@ ich sa@@ ver@@ s and to cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions , too ter@@ ri@@ fied to inv@@ est it into the produc@@ tive acti@@ vit@@ ies that can gener@@ ate the in@@ comes from which you can ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish the mo@@ un@@ tain of deb@@ ts and which can produc@@ e all those things that hum@@ an@@ ity des@@ per@@ ately needs , like gre@@ en energy ."
Now let me give you two numbers .
"O@@ ver the last three months , in the United States , in Brit@@ ain and in the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one , we have inv@@ es@@ ted , col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vely , 3@@ .@@ 4 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars on all the we@@ al@@ th@@ -@@ produc@@ ing go@@ ods — things like ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al plan@@ ts , ma@@ chin@@ er@@ y , off@@ ice bloc@@ ks , scho@@ ols , ro@@ ad@@ s , ra@@ il@@ ways , ma@@ chin@@ er@@ y , and so on and so for@@ th ."
"So a mo@@ un@@ tain of d@@ ebt and a mo@@ un@@ tain of id@@ le cas@@ h form tw@@ in pe@@ ak@@ s , fa@@ il@@ ing to can@@ c@@ el each other out through the nor@@ mal oper@@ ation of the mar@@ ket@@ s ."
"And con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , low ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te de@@ m@@ and , which in a n@@ ever@@ -@@ en@@ ding c@@ y@@ cle , re@@ in@@ for@@ ces the p@@ es@@ sim@@ ism of the inv@@ est@@ ors , who , fe@@ aring low de@@ m@@ and , re@@ produc@@ e it by not inv@@ es@@ ting — exactly like O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us &apos; father , who , ter@@ ri@@ fied by the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of the o@@ ra@@ cle that his son would grow up to k@@ ill him , un@@ w@@ it@@ tin@@ g@@ ly engine@@ er@@ ed the con@@ dit@@ ions that en@@ su@@ red that O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us , his son , would k@@ ill him ."
This is my qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism .
A@@ m I right in beli@@ ev@@ ing that democra@@ cy might be the answer ?
"I believe so , but before we move on , what do we mean by democra@@ cy ?"
"Now , of course A@@ th@@ en@@ ian democra@@ cy ex@@ cl@@ ud@@ ed too many ."
"W@@ omen , mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts and , of course , the sl@@ aves ."
But it would be a mis@@ take to dis@@ mis@@ s the si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ en@@ ian democra@@ cy on the bas@@ is of wh@@ om it ex@@ cl@@ ud@@ ed .
"Now , of course , A@@ th@@ en@@ ian democra@@ cy didn &apos;t last long ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e a c@@ and@@ le that b@@ urn@@ s bri@@ gh@@ tly , it b@@ urn@@ ed out qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"And inde@@ ed , our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es today do not have their ro@@ ots in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens ."
"They have their ro@@ ots in the M@@ ag@@ na C@@ ar@@ ta , in the 1@@ 6@@ 8@@ 8 G@@ l@@ ori@@ ous R@@ evolution , inde@@ ed in the American con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as A@@ th@@ en@@ ian democra@@ cy was foc@@ using on the ma@@ ster@@ less c@@ it@@ iz@@ en and em@@ power@@ ing the working po@@ or , our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es are f@@ oun@@ ded on the M@@ ag@@ na C@@ ar@@ ta t@@ rad@@ ition , which was , after all , a char@@ ter for ma@@ st@@ ers ."
"And inde@@ ed , liber@@ al democra@@ cy only sur@@ fac@@ ed when it was possible to se@@ par@@ ate fully the political sp@@ here from the economic sp@@ here , so as to con@@ fin@@ e the democra@@ tic process fully in the political sp@@ here , le@@ av@@ ing the economic sp@@ here — the cor@@ po@@ rate world , if you want — as a democra@@ c@@ y-@@ f@@ ree z@@ one ."
"Now , in our democra@@ ci@@ es today , this se@@ par@@ ation of the economic from the political sp@@ here , the moment it started happening , it gave r@@ ise to an in@@ ex@@ o@@ ra@@ ble , ep@@ ic st@@ ru@@ g@@ gle between the two , with the economic sp@@ here col@@ on@@ iz@@ ing the political sp@@ here , e@@ ating into its power ."
H@@ ave you wonder@@ ed why polit@@ ici@@ ans are not what they used to be ?
It &apos;s not because their D@@ N@@ A has de@@ gener@@ ated .
"( Laughter ) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has mi@@ gra@@ ted from the political to the economic sp@@ here , which is se@@ par@@ ate ."
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , I spo@@ ke about my qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism ."
"If you think about it , it is a little bit like a population of pre@@ da@@ tors , that are so success@@ ful in de@@ ci@@ mat@@ ing the pre@@ y that they must fe@@ ed on , that in the end they star@@ ve ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the economic sp@@ here has been col@@ on@@ iz@@ ing and can@@ ni@@ b@@ aliz@@ ing the political sp@@ here to such an ext@@ ent that it is under@@ min@@ ing itself , ca@@ using economic c@@ ris@@ is ."
"C@@ or@@ po@@ rate power is increas@@ ing , political go@@ ods are dev@@ al@@ u@@ ing , in@@ equality is ris@@ ing , ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ te de@@ m@@ and is f@@ all@@ ing and C@@ E@@ O@@ s of cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions are too sc@@ ar@@ ed to inv@@ est the cas@@ h of their cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions ."
"Now , this is not an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al idea ."
"The Mar@@ x@@ ist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well , did it ?"
"The les@@ son that we learned from the S@@ ov@@ iet deb@@ ac@@ le is that only by a mi@@ ra@@ cle will the working po@@ or be re@@ em@@ power@@ ed , as they were in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , without cre@@ ating new for@@ ms of br@@ ut@@ ality and was@@ te ."
But there is a solu@@ tion : el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the working po@@ or .
"C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ ism &apos;s doing it by re@@ plac@@ ing low@@ -@@ w@@ age work@@ ers with aut@@ o@@ mat@@ a , an@@ dro@@ id@@ s , rob@@ ots ."
"The problem is that as long as the economic and the political sp@@ her@@ es are se@@ par@@ ate , aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tion makes the tw@@ in pe@@ ak@@ s t@@ all@@ er , the was@@ te lo@@ f@@ ti@@ er and the social con@@ fl@@ ic@@ ts de@@ ep@@ er , incl@@ ud@@ ing — so@@ on , I believe — in places like China ."
"So we need to re@@ con@@ figure , we need to re@@ un@@ ite the economic and the political sp@@ her@@ es , but we &apos;d better do it by democra@@ ti@@ z@@ ing the re@@ un@@ i@@ fied sp@@ here , l@@ est we end up with a sur@@ ve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce@@ -@@ mad hy@@ per@@ aut@@ oc@@ ra@@ cy that makes The M@@ at@@ ri@@ x , the movi@@ e , look like a doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary ."
( Laughter ) So the question is not whether cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism will surv@@ ive the technolo@@ g@@ ical in@@ no@@ v@@ ations it is sp@@ aw@@ ning .
"The more interesting question is whether cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism will be suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed by something res@@ em@@ bl@@ ing a M@@ at@@ ri@@ x d@@ y@@ st@@ op@@ ia or something much clo@@ s@@ er to a St@@ ar T@@ re@@ k@@ -@@ like society , where ma@@ chin@@ es ser@@ ve the hum@@ ans and the hum@@ ans exp@@ end their energi@@ es ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the universe and ind@@ ul@@ ging in long deb@@ ates about the mean@@ ing of life in some an@@ ci@@ ent , A@@ th@@ en@@ ian@@ -@@ like , high t@@ ec@@ h ag@@ or@@ a ."
I think we can af@@ for@@ d to be op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic .
"In prac@@ tical terms , al@@ low me to share just bri@@ ef@@ ly , a couple of exam@@ pl@@ es ."
"A@@ t the level of the en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise , imagine a cap@@ ital market , where you ear@@ n cap@@ ital as you work , and where your cap@@ ital fol@@ lo@@ ws you from one job to another , from one compan@@ y to another , and the compan@@ y — wh@@ ich@@ ever one you happen to work at at that time — is sol@@ ely ow@@ ned by those who happen to work in it at that moment ."
"Th@@ en all income st@@ ems from cap@@ ital , from prof@@ its , and the very con@@ cept of w@@ age lab@@ or becom@@ es ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
"@@ No more se@@ par@@ ation between those who own but do not work in the compan@@ y and those who work but do not own the compan@@ y ; no more tu@@ g@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ war between cap@@ ital and lab@@ or ; no great ga@@ p between inv@@ est@@ ment and sav@@ ing ; inde@@ ed , no to@@ wer@@ ing tw@@ in pe@@ ak@@ s ."
"A@@ t the level of the global political econom@@ y , imagine for a moment that our national cur@@ ren@@ ci@@ es have a fre@@ e-@@ f@@ lo@@ ating ex@@ change rate , with a univer@@ sal , global , dig@@ ital cur@@ ren@@ cy , one that is issu@@ ed by the In@@ ter@@ national M@@ on@@ et@@ ary F@@ und , the G@@ -@@ 20 , on be@@ half of all hum@@ an@@ ity ."
"And imagine fur@@ ther that all inter@@ national tra@@ de is den@@ om@@ in@@ ated in this cur@@ ren@@ cy — let &apos;s call it &quot; &quot; the co@@ smo@@ s , &quot; &quot; in un@@ its of co@@ smo@@ s — with every government ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing to be pa@@ ying into a common fun@@ d a su@@ m of co@@ smo@@ s un@@ its pro@@ por@@ tional to the country &apos;s tra@@ de de@@ fic@@ it , or inde@@ ed to a country &apos;s tra@@ de sur@@ pl@@ us ."
"And imagine that that fun@@ d is ut@@ iliz@@ ed to inv@@ est in gre@@ en tech@@ nologi@@ es , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in parts of the world where inv@@ est@@ ment f@@ und@@ ing is sc@@ ar@@ ce ."
This is not a new idea .
"It &apos;s what , effec@@ ti@@ vely , J@@ o@@ h@@ n M@@ ay@@ n@@ ard K@@ ey@@ nes pro@@ posed in 19@@ 4@@ 4 at the B@@ re@@ t@@ ton W@@ o@@ ods Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"The problem is that back then , they didn &apos;t have the technology to im@@ pl@@ ement it ."
"Now we do , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a re@@ un@@ i@@ fied polit@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ economic sp@@ here ."
"The world that I am descri@@ b@@ ing to you is sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously li@@ b@@ ert@@ arian , in that it pri@@ or@@ it@@ iz@@ es em@@ power@@ ed individ@@ ual@@ s , Mar@@ x@@ ist , since it will have con@@ fin@@ ed to the d@@ ust@@ b@@ in of history the div@@ ision between cap@@ ital and lab@@ or , and K@@ ey@@ n@@ es@@ ian , global K@@ ey@@ n@@ es@@ ian ."
"But ab@@ ove all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an au@@ th@@ en@@ tic democra@@ cy ."
W@@ ill such a world da@@ wn ?
O@@ r sh@@ all we des@@ c@@ end into a M@@ at@@ ri@@ x@@ -@@ like d@@ y@@ st@@ op@@ ia ?
The answer li@@ es in the political cho@@ ice that we sh@@ all be making col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vely .
"It is our cho@@ ice , and we &apos;d better make it democra@@ tically ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
It was you who descri@@ bed yourself in your bi@@ os as a li@@ b@@ ert@@ arian Mar@@ x@@ ist .
What is the rel@@ ev@@ ance of Mar@@ x &apos;s anal@@ y@@ sis today ?

"But so is H@@ a@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a li@@ b@@ ert@@ arian Mar@@ x@@ ist , and so is K@@ ey@@ nes , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m tot@@ ally con@@ f@@ used ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ G : In@@ de@@ ed , and possi@@ bly we are too , now . ( Laughter )"
"( Applause ) Y@@ V : If you are not con@@ f@@ used , you are not thinking , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ G : That &apos;s a very , very Gre@@ e@@ k philosoph@@ er kind of thing to say — Y@@ V : That was E@@ inste@@ in , actually — B@@ G : D@@ uring your talk you men@@ tion@@ ed S@@ in@@ ga@@ po@@ re and China , and last night at the speak@@ er din@@ ner , you ex@@ pres@@ sed a pretty st@@ rong op@@ in@@ ion about how the W@@ est looks at China ."
W@@ ould you like to share that ?
"Y@@ V : Well , there &apos;s a great de@@ gre@@ e of hy@@ po@@ c@@ ris@@ y ."
"In our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es , we have a s@@ em@@ bl@@ ance of democra@@ cy ."
"In a sense , if I am al@@ lowed to be pro@@ v@@ oc@@ ative , China today is clo@@ s@@ er to Brit@@ ain in the 19@@ th century ."
"@@ L@@ ib@@ er@@ al@@ ism , liber@@ al , it &apos;s like J@@ o@@ h@@ n S@@ tu@@ art M@@ ill ."
J@@ o@@ h@@ n S@@ tu@@ art M@@ ill was particul@@ arly sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democra@@ tic process .
"So what you are seeing now in China is a very si@@ mil@@ ar process to the one that we had in Brit@@ ain d@@ uring the In@@ d@@ ust@@ ri@@ al R@@ evolution , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally the trans@@ ition from the first to the second ."
"And to be cas@@ ti@@ ga@@ ting China for doing that which the W@@ est did in the 19@@ th century , s@@ ma@@ c@@ ks of hy@@ po@@ c@@ ris@@ y ."
B@@ G : I am sure that many people here are wonder@@ ing about your experience as the F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of Gre@@ ece ear@@ li@@ er this year .
Y@@ V : I knew this was coming .
"B@@ G : S@@ i@@ x months after , how do you look back at the first half of the year ?"
"Y@@ V : E@@ x@@ tre@@ m@@ ely exc@@ iting , from a person@@ al point of view , and very disa@@ p@@ poin@@ ting , because we had an opportun@@ ity to reb@@ o@@ ot the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one ."
"@@ Not just Gre@@ ece , the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one ."
"@@ To move away from the compl@@ ac@@ en@@ cy and the con@@ st@@ ant den@@ ial that there was a massive — and there is a massive arch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ ral fa@@ ult line going through the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one , which is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ing , mas@@ si@@ vely , the whole of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on process ."
"And , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the po@@ w@@ ers in the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one , in the Eu@@ rog@@ ro@@ up , ch@@ ose to main@@ tain den@@ ial ."
But you know what happens .
This is the experience of the S@@ ov@@ iet U@@ ni@@ on .
B@@ G : What kind of change are you for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ ing ?
"Y@@ V : Well , there &apos;s no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that if we don &apos;t change the arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one , the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one has no future ."
B@@ G : D@@ id you make any mis@@ takes when you were F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ is@@ ter ?
Y@@ V : E@@ very day .
"If there &apos;s any M@@ in@@ is@@ ter of F@@ in@@ ance , or of anything else for that matter , who tel@@ ls you after six months in a job , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in such a st@@ res@@ s@@ ful sit@@ u@@ ation , that they have made no mis@@ take , they &apos;re dan@@ ger@@ ous people ."
O@@ f course I made mis@@ takes .
I was imag@@ ining that there was a gen@@ u@@ ine inter@@ est on the side of the cre@@ dit@@ ors to find common ground .
And there wasn &apos;t .
We lo@@ st on@@ e-@@ third of our no@@ min@@ al G@@ D@@ P .
This is wor@@ se than the Gre@@ at D@@ e@@ pres@@ sion .
Y@@ V : A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely .
"@@ L@@ o@@ ok , my c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism of the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on and the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one comes from a person who lives and bre@@ a@@ th@@ es Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
My gre@@ at@@ est fear is that the Eu@@ ro@@ z@@ one will not surv@@ ive .
"Because if it doesn &apos;t , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ga@@ l for@@ ces that will be un@@ le@@ a@@ shed will be demon@@ ic , and they will des@@ tro@@ y the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on ."
And that will be c@@ atas@@ tro@@ ph@@ ic not just for Eu@@ rop@@ e but for the whole global econom@@ y .
"And if we al@@ low ourselves to f@@ all into a ro@@ ute of the pos@@ t@@ moder@@ n 19@@ 30 &apos;s , which seems to me to be what we are doing , then that will be de@@ tri@@ mental to the future of Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans and n@@ on@@ -@@ Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans al@@ ik@@ e ."
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to sum@@ m@@ er cam@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
And I just wa@@ ited for the time that I could go off and read my bo@@ o@@ ks .
And I always sen@@ sed de@@ ep down that this was wrong and that in@@ tro@@ v@@ erts were pretty ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent just as they were .
"And at the ris@@ k of s@@ oun@@ ding gr@@ an@@ di@@ ose , it is the world &apos;s lo@@ ss ."
"Because when it comes to cre@@ ati@@ vity and to lead@@ er@@ ship , we need in@@ tro@@ v@@ erts doing what they do best ."
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
"So even if you &apos;re an ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ t yourself , I &apos;m talking about your co@@ work@@ ers and your spo@@ uses and your children and the person sit@@ ting next to you right now — all of them sub@@ ject to this bi@@ as that is pretty de@@ ep and real in our society ."
"Now , to see the bi@@ as c@@ lear@@ ly , you need to understand what in@@ tro@@ ver@@ sion is ."
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ hy@@ ness is about fear of social j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment .
"I@@ n@@ tro@@ ver@@ sion is more about , how do you res@@ po@@ nd to s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ation , incl@@ ud@@ ing social s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ation ."
"O@@ ur most important inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions , our scho@@ ols and our work@@ places , they are des@@ ign@@ ed mo@@ st@@ ly for ex@@ tro@@ v@@ erts and for ex@@ tro@@ v@@ erts &apos; need for lots of s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ation ."
"We sa@@ t in ro@@ ws of des@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty aut@@ on@@ o@@ mo@@ us@@ ly ."
And kids are working in coun@@ t@@ less group as@@ sign@@ ments .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , same thing is true in our work@@ places ."
"Now , most of us work in open pl@@ an of@@ fic@@ es , without w@@ all@@ s , where we are sub@@ ject to the con@@ st@@ ant no@@ ise and ga@@ ze of our co@@ work@@ ers ."
"And what I &apos;m saying is that cul@@ tur@@ ally , we need a much better bal@@ ance ."
"And in fact , we have known for cent@@ ur@@ ies about the trans@@ cen@@ d@@ ent power of sol@@ it@@ u@@ de ."
It &apos;s only rec@@ ently that we &apos;ve str@@ ang@@ ely be@@ gu@@ n to for@@ get it .
"This is no sur@@ pr@@ ise , though , if you look at the in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts of con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary psych@@ ology ."
"It turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without inst@@ in@@ c@@ ti@@ vely mir@@ ro@@ r@@ ing , mi@@ m@@ ic@@ king their op@@ in@@ ions ."
And do you really want to leave it up to chan@@ ce ?
"W@@ es@@ tern societies , and in particular the U.@@ S@@ . , have always fav@@ ored the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ation ."
"So , quite underst@@ an@@ dab@@ ly , qu@@ alit@@ ies like mag@@ n@@ et@@ ism and char@@ is@@ ma su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to seem really important ."
"Now n@@ one of this is to say that social sk@@ il@@ ls are un@@ important , and I &apos;m also not call@@ ing for the ab@@ oli@@ sh@@ ing of te@@ am@@ work at all ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
So I pre@@ par@@ ed for mo@@ ments like these as best I could .
It &apos;s great for in@@ tro@@ v@@ erts and it &apos;s great for ex@@ tro@@ v@@ erts .
"We need to be teach@@ ing kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teach@@ ing them how to work on their own ."
"B@@ e like B@@ ud@@ d@@ h@@ a , have your own re@@ vel@@ ations ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it is , I hope you take these things out every chan@@ ce you get and gra@@ ce us with your energy and your jo@@ y ."
"H@@ i , my name is Mar@@ cin — far@@ m@@ er , technolo@@ g@@ ist ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.@@ S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ p@@ en S@@ our@@ ce E@@ c@@ ology .
"We &apos;ve id@@ enti@@ fied the 50 most important ma@@ chin@@ es that we think it takes for moder@@ n life to ex@@ ist — things from trac@@ tors , bre@@ ad ov@@ ens , cir@@ cu@@ it mak@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an open s@@ our@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and main@@ tain at a fra@@ c@@ tion of the cost ."
We call this the G@@ lob@@ al V@@ ill@@ age Con@@ struc@@ tion S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ i@@ shed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in f@@ us@@ ion energy , and I discover@@ ed I was us@@ el@@ ess ."
I had no prac@@ tical sk@@ il@@ ls .
"The world pres@@ ented me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I gu@@ ess you can call it the con@@ sum@@ er lif@@ est@@ y@@ le .
So I started a far@@ m in M@@ is@@ s@@ ou@@ ri and learned about the econom@@ ics of far@@ m@@ ing .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a trac@@ tor — then it bro@@ ke .
I pa@@ id to get it re@@ pa@@ i@@ red — then it bro@@ ke again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was bro@@ ke too ."
"I real@@ ized that the tr@@ ul@@ y appro@@ pri@@ ate , low@@ -@@ cost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able far@@ m and s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ement just didn &apos;t ex@@ ist yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were rob@@ ust , mod@@ ul@@ ar , high@@ ly ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed , low@@ -@@ cost , made from loc@@ al and rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed mater@@ i@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not des@@ ign@@ ed for ob@@ sol@@ esc@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them my@@ self .
So I did just that .
And I tes@@ ted them .
And I found that ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al produc@@ ti@@ vity can be achi@@ ev@@ ed on a small sc@@ ale .
"So then I published the 3@@ D des@@ ign@@ s , s@@ che@@ ma@@ tics , in@@ struc@@ tional vide@@ os and b@@ ud@@ gets on a w@@ ik@@ i ."
"Th@@ en con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ors from all over the world be@@ gan sho@@ wing up , pro@@ tot@@ yp@@ ing new ma@@ chin@@ es d@@ uring de@@ dic@@ ated pro@@ ject vis@@ its ."
"So far , we have pro@@ tot@@ y@@ ped eight of the 50 ma@@ chin@@ es ."
And now the pro@@ ject is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that open s@@ our@@ ce has suc@@ ce@@ ed@@ ed with to@@ ols for man@@ ag@@ ing knowledge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is starting to happen with har@@ d@@ w@@ are too .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on har@@ d@@ w@@ are because it is har@@ d@@ w@@ are that can change people &apos;s lives in such tan@@ gi@@ ble material ways .
"If we can lower the bar@@ ri@@ ers to far@@ m@@ ing , building , man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just massive amoun@@ ts of human po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al ."
That &apos;s not only in the develop@@ ing world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American far@@ m@@ er , buil@@ der , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur , mak@@ er ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of exc@@ it@@ ement from these people , who can now start a con@@ struc@@ tion business , parts man@@ uf@@ ac@@ tur@@ ing , organ@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ ling power back to the g@@ ri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published des@@ ign@@ s so c@@ lear , so complet@@ e , that a single b@@ urn@@ ed D@@ V@@ D is effec@@ ti@@ vely a civiliz@@ ation star@@ ter k@@ it ."
I &apos;ve plan@@ ted a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve pres@@ sed 5@@ ,000 br@@ ic@@ ks in one day from the d@@ ir@@ t ben@@ e@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a trac@@ tor in six days ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is tr@@ ul@@ y sound , then the im@@ plic@@ ations are si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ."
"A gre@@ ater dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally sound sup@@ p@@ ly cha@@ ins , and a ne@@ w@@ ly rel@@ ev@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y mak@@ er culture can hope to trans@@ c@@ end ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial sc@@ arc@@ ity ."
We &apos;re ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the lim@@ its of what we all can do to make a better world with open har@@ d@@ w@@ are technology .

"( M@@ us@@ ic ) R@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 4@@ 3@@ ,000 years ago , a young c@@ ave be@@ ar died in the ro@@ l@@ ling h@@ il@@ ls on the nor@@ th@@ w@@ est bor@@ der of moder@@ n day S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia ."
"A thou@@ s@@ and years later , a ma@@ m@@ mo@@ th died in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n G@@ er@@ many ."
"A few cent@@ ur@@ ies after that , a g@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also died in the same vic@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these an@@ im@@ als me@@ t their de@@ a@@ ths , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mark@@ able f@@ ate ."
"A@@ f@@ ter their de@@ a@@ ths , a b@@ one from each of their sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons was cra@@ f@@ ted by human hands into a fl@@ ute ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the fl@@ ute , a to@@ ol that created us@@ el@@ ess vibra@@ tions in air mo@@ lec@@ ul@@ es ."
But that is exactly what our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors did .
Now this turns out to be sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly common in the history of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation .
"But just as often , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fu@@ n ."
"And here &apos;s the really stran@@ ge thing : many of those pla@@ y@@ ful but se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly f@@ riv@@ ol@@ ous inv@@ en@@ tions en@@ ded up s@@ par@@ king mom@@ ent@@ ous trans@@ forma@@ tions in science , in polit@@ ics and society ."
T@@ ake what may be the most important inv@@ en@@ tion of moder@@ n times : program@@ ma@@ ble comput@@ ers .
"S@@ ome@@ one came up with the br@@ il@@ li@@ ant idea of tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds by pres@@ sing small lev@@ ers with our fin@@ g@@ ers , inv@@ ent@@ ing the first mus@@ ical k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ard ."
"Now , k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds evol@@ ved from organs to cl@@ av@@ ich@@ or@@ ds to har@@ p@@ sich@@ or@@ ds to the pi@@ an@@ o , until the middle of the 19@@ th century , when a bun@@ ch of inv@@ ent@@ ors finally h@@ it on the idea of using a k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ard to tri@@ g@@ ger not s@@ oun@@ ds but l@@ et@@ ters ."
"In fact , the very first t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er was or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally called &quot; &quot; the writ@@ ing har@@ p@@ sich@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ l@@ utes and mus@@ ic led to even more power@@ ful bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a thou@@ s@@ and years ago , at the he@@ ight of the I@@ s@@ la@@ mic R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce , three bro@@ thers in B@@ agh@@ dad des@@ ign@@ ed a dev@@ ice that was an aut@@ o@@ mat@@ ed or@@ gan ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent that pla@@ ys itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ str@@ um@@ ent was basically a gi@@ ant mus@@ ic bo@@ x ."
The or@@ gan could be tra@@ ined to play vari@@ ous son@@ gs by using in@@ struc@@ tions en@@ cod@@ ed by plac@@ ing p@@ ins on a ro@@ t@@ ating c@@ y@@ l@@ ind@@ er .
"And if you wanted the machine to play a different son@@ g , you just s@@ w@@ app@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ l@@ ind@@ er in with a different cod@@ e on it ."
This in@@ str@@ um@@ ent was the first of its kind .
It was program@@ ma@@ ble .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a massive le@@ a@@ p for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ w@@ are and sof@@ tw@@ are becom@@ es thin@@ k@@ able for the first time with this inv@@ en@@ tion .
"And that incredi@@ bly power@@ ful con@@ cept didn &apos;t come to us as an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent of war or of con@@ qu@@ est , or nec@@ ess@@ ity at all ."
It came from the stran@@ ge d@@ eli@@ ght of wat@@ ch@@ ing a machine play mus@@ ic .
"In fact , the idea of program@@ ma@@ ble ma@@ chin@@ es was ex@@ cl@@ us@@ iv@@ ely ke@@ pt al@@ ive by mus@@ ic for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0s , mus@@ ic@@ -@@ making ma@@ chin@@ es bec@@ ame the pla@@ y@@ things of the P@@ ar@@ is@@ ian el@@ ite ."
"S@@ ho@@ w@@ men used the same cod@@ ed c@@ y@@ l@@ ind@@ ers to control the physical mov@@ em@@ ents of what were called aut@@ o@@ mat@@ a , an early kind of rob@@ ot ."
"And as de V@@ auc@@ ans@@ on was des@@ ig@@ ning his rob@@ ot mus@@ ician , he had another idea ."
"If you could program a machine to make pl@@ eas@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds , why not program it to we@@ ave del@@ igh@@ t@@ ful patterns of c@@ olo@@ r out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new pat@@ tern for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just program@@ m@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ l@@ ind@@ er ."
This was the first program@@ ma@@ ble loo@@ m .
P@@ aper turned out to be much che@@ aper and more f@@ le@@ x@@ ible as a way of program@@ m@@ ing the dev@@ ice .
"That p@@ un@@ ch c@@ ard system insp@@ i@@ red V@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ ian inv@@ ent@@ or Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ ab@@ b@@ age to create his anal@@ y@@ tical eng@@ ine , the first true program@@ ma@@ ble computer ever des@@ ign@@ ed ."
So ask yourself this question : what really made the moder@@ n computer possible ?
"Y@@ es , the mil@@ it@@ ary inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement is an important part of the story , but inv@@ ent@@ ing a computer also requ@@ i@@ red other building bloc@@ ks : mus@@ ic bo@@ x@@ es , to@@ y rob@@ ot fl@@ ute pla@@ y@@ ers , har@@ p@@ sich@@ or@@ d k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful patterns w@@ ov@@ en into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
"There &apos;s a long l@@ ist of wor@@ ld@@ -@@ chang@@ ing ideas and tech@@ nologi@@ es that came out of play : public mus@@ e@@ um@@ s , r@@ ub@@ ber , prob@@ ability theory , the in@@ sur@@ ance business and many more ."
N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ity isn &apos;t always the mother of inv@@ en@@ tion .
"The pla@@ y@@ ful state of mind is fundam@@ ent@@ ally explo@@ rat@@ ory , see@@ king out new possi@@ bil@@ ities in the world around us ."
And that see@@ king is why so many experi@@ ences that started with simple d@@ eli@@ ght and am@@ us@@ ement even@@ tually led us to prof@@ ound bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
"Now , I think this has im@@ plic@@ ations for how we te@@ ach kids in school and how we en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge in@@ no@@ v@@ ation in our work@@ sp@@ ac@@ es , but thinking about play and d@@ eli@@ ght this way also hel@@ ps us det@@ ect what &apos;s coming next ."
"Th@@ ink about it : if you were sit@@ ting there in 1@@ 7@@ 50 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19@@ th , the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ ies , aut@@ o@@ mat@@ ed ma@@ chin@@ es , comput@@ ers , ar@@ ti@@ fic@@ ial intelligence , a program@@ ma@@ ble fl@@ ute ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ing the P@@ ar@@ is@@ ian el@@ ite would have been as power@@ ful a cl@@ ue as anything else at the time ."
You &apos;ll find the future wh@@ er@@ ever people are having the most fu@@ n .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one needs a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ er , a ten@@ nis pla@@ y@@ er , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or a br@@ id@@ ge pla@@ y@@ er ."
"( Laughter ) My br@@ id@@ ge co@@ ach , S@@ har@@ on O@@ s@@ ber@@ g , says there are more pic@@ tures of the back of her head than any@@ one else &apos;s in the world . ( Laughter ) S@@ or@@ ry , S@@ har@@ on . Here you go ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we impro@@ ve .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ obs better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ obs in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ inda and I learned how little us@@ ef@@ ul fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were blo@@ wn away ."
"@@ Un@@ til rec@@ ently , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"If all my br@@ id@@ ge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; sat@@ is@@ fac@@ t@@ ory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hope of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differ@@ ently ?
"@@ To@@ day , dis@@ tric@@ ts are re@@ vam@@ ping the way they ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them impro@@ ve their prac@@ ti@@ ce ."
O@@ ur teachers des@@ er@@ ve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fa@@ ir to them .
"It &apos;s not fa@@ ir to students , and it &apos;s put@@ ting America &apos;s global lead@@ er@@ ship at ris@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for impro@@ v@@ ement they want and des@@ er@@ ve .
Let &apos;s start by as@@ king who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king t@@ ab@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back syst@@ ems ."
"So I looked at the countries wh@@ ose students per@@ form well ac@@ ade@@ m@@ ically , and looked at what they &apos;re doing to help their teachers impro@@ ve ."
Con@@ sid@@ er the ran@@ kin@@ gs for read@@ ing pro@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy .
The U.@@ S@@ . isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ cel@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the places that do better than the U.@@ S@@ . in read@@ ing , how many of them have a forma@@ l system for hel@@ ping teachers impro@@ ve ?"
E@@ l@@ even out of 1@@ 4 .
"The U.@@ S@@ . is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in mat@@ h ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fa@@ il@@ ing to give our teachers the help they need to devel@@ op their sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best ac@@ ade@@ mic per@@ form@@ er : the pro@@ vin@@ ce of S@@ han@@ gh@@ ai , China ."
"Now , they r@@ ank number one across the bo@@ ard , in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science , and one of the ke@@ ys to S@@ han@@ gh@@ ai &apos;s incredi@@ ble success is the way they help teachers keep impro@@ v@@ ing ."
They made sure that youn@@ ger teachers get a chan@@ ce to wat@@ ch ma@@ st@@ er teachers at work .
"They have we@@ ek@@ ly study gro@@ ups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even requ@@ ire each teacher to ob@@ ser@@ ve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much vari@@ ation in the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more effec@@ tive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers throu@@ gh@@ out the country who are hel@@ ping their students make ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ga@@ ins ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be b@@ lowing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion has been working with 3@@ ,000 teachers in dis@@ tric@@ ts across the country on a pro@@ ject called M@@ eas@@ ures of E@@ f@@ fec@@ tive Te@@ ach@@ ing ."
We had ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s wat@@ ch vide@@ os of teachers in the clas@@ s@@ room and rate how they did on a ran@@ ge of prac@@ tic@@ es .
"For example , did they ask their students chall@@ eng@@ ing questions ?"
D@@ id they find mul@@ ti@@ ple ways to explain an idea ?
"We also had students f@@ ill out sur@@ ve@@ ys with questions like , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ es your teacher know when the class underst@@ an@@ ds a les@@ son ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you learn to cor@@ rec@@ t your mis@@ takes ? &quot;"
And what we found is very exc@@ iting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the teachers who did well on these observ@@ ations had far better stud@@ ent ou@@ t@@ comes ."
So it tel@@ ls us we &apos;re as@@ king the right questions .
"And second , teachers in the program told us that these vide@@ os and these sur@@ ve@@ ys from the students were very hel@@ p@@ ful diagno@@ s@@ tic to@@ ols , because they poin@@ ted to spec@@ if@@ ic places where they can impro@@ ve ."
I want to show you what this video com@@ pon@@ ent of M@@ E@@ T looks like in action .
( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ ara@@ h B@@ ro@@ wn W@@ ess@@ ling : G@@ ood mor@@ ning everybody .
Let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s going on today .
"@@ To get started , we &apos;re doing a pe@@ er re@@ view day , o@@ kay ?"
"A pe@@ er re@@ view day , and our go@@ al by the end of class is for you to be able to de@@ ter@@ mine whether or not you have mov@@ es to pro@@ ve in your es@@ says ."
My name is S@@ ara@@ h B@@ ro@@ wn W@@ ess@@ ling .
"I am a high school English teacher at J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ st@@ on H@@ igh S@@ cho@@ ol in J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ st@@ on , I@@ ow@@ a ."
T@@ ur@@ n to somebody next to you .
T@@ ell them what you think I mean when I talk about mov@@ es to pro@@ ve . I &apos;ve talk about — I think that there is a difference for teachers between the ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t of how we see our prac@@ ti@@ ce and then the con@@ cre@@ te reality of it .
"O@@ kay , so I would like you to pl@@ ease bring up your p@@ ap@@ ers ."
I think what video of@@ fer@@ s for us is a certain de@@ gre@@ e of reality .
"You can &apos;t really dis@@ p@@ ute what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profes@@ sion when we actually get to see this ."
I just have a f@@ li@@ p c@@ amer@@ a and a little tri@@ po@@ d and inv@@ es@@ ted in this tiny little w@@ ide@@ -@@ an@@ gle l@@ ens .
"A@@ t the beginning of class , I just per@@ ch it in the back of the clas@@ s@@ room . It &apos;s not a per@@ fect sh@@ ot ."
It doesn &apos;t cat@@ ch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
But I can hear the sound . I can see a lot .
And I &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
So it really has been a simple but power@@ ful to@@ ol in my own re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a look at the long one first , o@@ kay ?"
"O@@ n@@ ce I &apos;m fin@@ i@@ shed t@@ ap@@ ing , then I put it in my computer , and then I &apos;ll s@@ can it and take a pe@@ e@@ k at it ."
"If I don &apos;t write things down , I don &apos;t remember them ."
"So having the not@@ es is a part of my thinking process , and I disc@@ over what I &apos;m seeing as I &apos;m writ@@ ing ."
"I really have used it for my own person@@ al growth and my own person@@ al re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion on teach@@ ing stra@@ te@@ gy and me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ lo@@ gy and clas@@ s@@ room man@@ ag@@ ement , and just all of those different fac@@ ets of the clas@@ s@@ room ."
"I &apos;m gl@@ ad that we &apos;ve actually done the process before so we can kind of comp@@ are what works , what doesn &apos;t ."
"I think that video ex@@ pos@@ es so much of what &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand , and then help our bro@@ ad@@ er commun@@ ities understand what this compl@@ ex work is really all about ."
"I think it is a way to ex@@ emp@@ lif@@ y and ill@@ ust@@ rate things that we cannot con@@ v@@ ey in a les@@ son pl@@ an , things you cannot con@@ v@@ ey in a stan@@ dar@@ d , things that you cannot even sometimes con@@ v@@ ey in a book of pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy ."
"A@@ l@@ ri@@ gh@@ ty , everybody , have a great we@@ ek@@ end ."
I &apos;ll see you later .
"@@ &#91; E@@ very clas@@ s@@ room could look like that &#93; ( Applause ) B@@ ill G@@ ates : One day , we &apos;d like every clas@@ s@@ room in America to look something like that ."
But we still have more work to do .
D@@ i@@ ag@@ no@@ sing are@@ as where a teacher needs to impro@@ ve is only half the b@@ at@@ tle .
We also have to give them the to@@ ols they need to act on the diagno@@ sis .
"If you learn that you need to impro@@ ve the way you te@@ ach fra@@ c@@ tions , you should be able to wat@@ ch a video of the best person in the world teach@@ ing fra@@ c@@ tions ."
So building this complet@@ e teacher fe@@ ed@@ back and impro@@ v@@ ement system won &apos;t be easy .
"For example , I know some teachers ar@@ en &apos;t im@@ medi@@ ately com@@ for@@ table with the idea of a c@@ amer@@ a in the clas@@ s@@ room ."
"That &apos;s underst@@ an@@ da@@ ble , but our experience with M@@ E@@ T su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts that if teachers man@@ age the process , if they coll@@ ect video in their own clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , and they pic@@ k the l@@ ess@@ ons they want to sub@@ mit , a lot of them will be e@@ ag@@ er to par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate ."
B@@ u@@ il@@ ding this system will also requ@@ ire a consid@@ er@@ able inv@@ est@@ ment .
O@@ ur f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es that it could cost up to five billion dollars .
"Now that &apos;s a big number , but to put it in per@@ spec@@ tive , it &apos;s less than two percent of what we sp@@ end every year on teacher sal@@ ar@@ ies ."
The im@@ p@@ act for teachers would be ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
"We would finally have a way to give them fe@@ ed@@ back , as well as the means to act on it ."
But this system would have an even more important ben@@ ef@@ it for our country .
"It would put us on a pat@@ h to making sure all our students get a great education , find a career that &apos;s ful@@ fil@@ ling and re@@ war@@ ding , and have a chan@@ ce to live out their dre@@ ams ."
This wouldn &apos;t just make us a more success@@ ful country .
"It would also make us a more fa@@ ir and just one , too ."
I &apos;m exc@@ ited about the opportun@@ ity to give all our teachers the sup@@ port they want and des@@ er@@ ve .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .

Let &apos;s just get started here .
"O@@ kay , just a moment ."
( Wh@@ ir@@ r@@ ing ) All right .

"A year ago , I spo@@ ke to you about a book that I was just in the process of complet@@ ing , that has come out in the inter@@ im , and I would like to talk to you today about some of the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es that that book insp@@ i@@ red ."
"The book is called &quot; &quot; The B@@ l@@ ank S@@ l@@ ate , &quot; &quot; bas@@ ed on the popul@@ ar idea that the human mind is a bl@@ ank sl@@ ate , and that all of its structure comes from soci@@ aliz@@ ation , culture , par@@ ent@@ ing , experience ."
The &quot; &quot; bl@@ ank sl@@ ate &quot; &quot; was an in@@ flu@@ enti@@ al idea in the 20@@ th century .
"@@ Here are a few quot@@ es ind@@ ic@@ ating that : &quot; &quot; M@@ an has no nature , &quot; &quot; from the hist@@ or@@ ian J@@ ose O@@ r@@ te@@ g@@ a y G@@ as@@ set ; &quot; &quot; M@@ an has no inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts , &quot; &quot; from the an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ ist A@@ sh@@ le@@ y M@@ on@@ t@@ ag@@ u ; &quot; &quot; The human brain is cap@@ able of a ful@@ l ran@@ ge of behav@@ i@@ ors and pre@@ dis@@ posed to n@@ one , &quot; &quot; from the l@@ ate scient@@ ist S@@ te@@ ph@@ en J@@ ay G@@ ould ."
"There are a number of reas@@ ons to d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the human mind is a bl@@ ank sl@@ ate , and some of them just come from common sense ."
"As many people have told me over the years , any@@ one who &apos;s had more than one child kno@@ ws that kids come into the world with certain tem@@ per@@ am@@ ents and tal@@ ents ; it doesn &apos;t all come from the outside ."
And any@@ one who &apos;s ever been in a h@@ et@@ er@@ os@@ ex@@ ual relation@@ ship kno@@ ws that the min@@ ds of men and the min@@ ds of women are not in@@ dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish@@ able .
"There are also , I think , increas@@ ing results from the scientific study of hum@@ ans that , inde@@ ed , we &apos;re not born bl@@ ank sl@@ ates ."
"One of them , from an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ lo@@ gy , is the study of human univer@@ sa@@ ls ."
"If you &apos;ve ever taken an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ lo@@ gy , you know that it &apos;s a — kind of an oc@@ c@@ up@@ ational pl@@ eas@@ ure of an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ ists to show how ex@@ ot@@ ic other cul@@ tures can be , and that there are places out there where , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , everything is the op@@ pos@@ ite to the way it is here ."
"But if you instead look at what is common to the world &apos;s cul@@ tures , you find that there is an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us@@ ly r@@ ich set of behav@@ i@@ ors and emo@@ tions and ways of con@@ st@@ ru@@ ing the world that can be found in all of the world &apos;s 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ od@@ d cul@@ tures ."
"The an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ ist D@@ on@@ al@@ d B@@ ro@@ wn has tri@@ ed to l@@ ist them all , and they ran@@ ge from a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , af@@ fec@@ tion and age stat@@ uses all the way down to we@@ an@@ ing , we@@ a@@ pon@@ s , we@@ a@@ ther , at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to control , the c@@ olo@@ r white and a wor@@ ld@@ view ."
"A@@ l@@ so , gen@@ e@@ tics and neuro@@ science are increas@@ ing@@ ly sho@@ wing that the brain is in@@ tric@@ ately struc@@ tu@@ red ."
"This is a rec@@ ent study by the neu@@ rob@@ i@@ olog@@ ist P@@ au@@ l Th@@ om@@ p@@ son and his colle@@ ag@@ ues in which they — using M@@ R@@ I — meas@@ ured the dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of gra@@ y matter — that is , the ou@@ ter la@@ y@@ er of the cor@@ te@@ x — in a large sam@@ ple of pa@@ ir@@ s of people ."
"They cod@@ ed cor@@ rel@@ ations in the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of gra@@ y matter in different parts of the brain using a f@@ al@@ se c@@ olo@@ r s@@ che@@ me , in which no difference is cod@@ ed as pur@@ ple , and any c@@ olo@@ r other than pur@@ ple ind@@ ic@@ ates a stat@@ is@@ tically si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant cor@@ rel@@ ation ."
"Well , this is what happens when you pa@@ ir people up at ran@@ dom ."
"B@@ y defin@@ ition , two people pic@@ ked at ran@@ dom can &apos;t have cor@@ rel@@ ations in the dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of gra@@ y matter in the cor@@ te@@ x ."
This is what happens in people who share half of their D@@ N@@ A — fra@@ tern@@ al tw@@ ins .
"And as you can see , large amoun@@ ts of the brain are not pur@@ ple , sho@@ wing that if one person has a th@@ ic@@ k@@ er bit of cor@@ te@@ x in that regi@@ on , so does his fra@@ tern@@ al tw@@ in ."
And you can see huge are@@ as of cor@@ te@@ x where there are massive cor@@ rel@@ ations in the dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion of gra@@ y matter .
"Now , these ar@@ en &apos;t just differ@@ ences in an@@ at@@ om@@ y , like the shap@@ e of your e@@ ar lob@@ es , but they have con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences in thought and behavior that are well ill@@ u@@ stra@@ ted in this f@@ amo@@ us car@@ to@@ on by Ch@@ ar@@ les A@@ d@@ dam@@ s : &quot; S@@ e@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th , the M@@ al@@ li@@ fer@@ t tw@@ ins me@@ et acc@@ id@@ ent@@ ally . &quot;"
"As you can see , there are two inv@@ ent@@ ors with id@@ en@@ tical con@@ tra@@ p@@ tions in their la@@ p , me@@ et@@ ing in the wa@@ iting room of a pat@@ ent att@@ or@@ ney ."
"Now , the car@@ to@@ on is not such an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation , because studies of id@@ en@@ tical tw@@ ins who were se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th and then tes@@ ted in ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood show that they have as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ities ."
And this happens in every pa@@ ir of id@@ en@@ tical tw@@ ins se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th ever stu@@ died — but much less so with fra@@ tern@@ al tw@@ ins se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite example is a pa@@ ir of tw@@ ins , one of wh@@ om was b@@ rou@@ ght up as a C@@ a@@ th@@ oli@@ c in a N@@ az@@ i family in G@@ er@@ many , the other b@@ rou@@ ght up in a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish family in Tr@@ in@@ i@@ dad ."
"Now — the story might seem to good to be true , but when you ad@@ min@@ is@@ ter b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies of psych@@ ological tes@@ ts , you get the same results — nam@@ ely , id@@ en@@ tical tw@@ ins se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th show quite as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ities ."
"Now , given both the common sense and scientific data call@@ ing the doc@@ tr@@ ine of the bl@@ ank sl@@ ate into question , why should it have been such an ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing not@@ ion ?"
"Well , there are a number of political reas@@ ons why people have found it con@@ gen@@ ial ."
"The for@@ e@@ most is that if we &apos;re bl@@ ank sl@@ ates , then , by defin@@ ition , we are equ@@ al , because z@@ ero equ@@ als z@@ ero equ@@ als z@@ ero ."
"But if something is writ@@ ten on the sl@@ ate , then some people could have more of it than others , and ac@@ cor@@ ding to this line of thinking , that would j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation and in@@ equality ."
"A@@ no@@ ther political fear of human nature is that if we are bl@@ ank sl@@ ates , we can per@@ fect man@@ kind — the ag@@ e-@@ old dre@@ am of the per@@ fec@@ ti@@ bility of our spec@@ ies through social engine@@ ering ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if we &apos;re born with certain inst@@ in@@ c@@ ts , then perhaps some of them might con@@ de@@ m@@ n us to sel@@ fi@@ shn@@ ess , pre@@ j@@ ud@@ ice and violence ."
"Well , in the book , I arg@@ ue that these are , in fact , n@@ on se@@ qu@@ it@@ urs ."
"And just to make a long story shor@@ t : first of all , the con@@ cept of fa@@ ir@@ ness is not the same as the con@@ cept of sam@@ en@@ ess ."
"And so when Th@@ o@@ mas J@@ ef@@ fer@@ son w@@ ro@@ te in the D@@ ec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation of In@@ de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce , &quot; &quot; We hold these tr@@ u@@ ths to be self-@@ ev@@ id@@ ent , that all men are created equ@@ al , &quot; &quot; he did not mean &quot; &quot; We hold these tr@@ u@@ ths to be self-@@ ev@@ id@@ ent , that all men are cl@@ ones . &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ ther , that all men are equ@@ al in terms of their ri@@ gh@@ ts , and that every person ou@@ ght to be tre@@ ated as an individ@@ ual , and not pre@@ j@@ ud@@ g@@ ed by the stat@@ is@@ tics of particular gro@@ ups that they may bel@@ ong to ."
"A@@ l@@ so , even if we were born with certain ig@@ nob@@ le mo@@ ti@@ ves , they don &apos;t aut@@ o@@ ma@@ tically le@@ ad to ig@@ nob@@ le behavior ."
"That is because the human mind is a compl@@ ex system with many parts , and some of them can in@@ h@@ ib@@ it others ."
"For example , there &apos;s ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent reason to believe that vir@@ tually all hum@@ ans are born with a moral sense , and that we have co@@ gn@@ itive abil@@ ities that al@@ low us to prof@@ it from the l@@ ess@@ ons of history ."
"So even if people did have im@@ pul@@ ses to@@ wards sel@@ fi@@ shn@@ ess or gre@@ ed , that &apos;s not the only thing in the sk@@ ul@@ l , and there are other parts of the mind that can coun@@ ter@@ act them ."
"In the book , I go over contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es such as this one , and a number of other h@@ ot b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons , h@@ ot z@@ ones , Ch@@ er@@ nob@@ y@@ ls , third ra@@ ils , and so on — incl@@ ud@@ ing the ar@@ ts , cl@@ on@@ ing , cri@@ me , f@@ ree will , education , evolution , gen@@ der differ@@ ences , G@@ od , ho@@ mos@@ ex@@ ual@@ ity , in@@ f@@ an@@ tic@@ ide , in@@ equality , Mar@@ x@@ ism , moral@@ ity , N@@ az@@ ism , par@@ ent@@ ing , polit@@ ics , ra@@ ce , ra@@ p@@ e , relig@@ ion , resour@@ ce de@@ pl@@ e@@ tion , social engine@@ ering , technolo@@ g@@ ical ris@@ k and war ."
"And need@@ less to say , there were certain ris@@ ks in taking on these sub@@ jects ."
"When I w@@ ro@@ te a first dra@@ ft of the book , I cir@@ cul@@ ated it to a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues for com@@ ments , and here are some of the re@@ ac@@ tions that I got : &quot; B@@ et@@ ter get a sec@@ ur@@ ity c@@ amer@@ a for your h@@ ou@@ se . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t exp@@ ect to get any more a@@ wards , job of@@ fer@@ s or pos@@ it@@ ions in s@@ ch@@ ol@@ arly societies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ell your publi@@ sh@@ er not to l@@ ist your ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn in your au@@ th@@ or bi@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you have ten@@ ure ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Well , the book came out in O@@ c@@ t@@ ob@@ er , and nothing ter@@ ri@@ ble has happened ."
"I — I like — There was inde@@ ed reason to be nerv@@ ous , and there were mo@@ ments in which I did feel nerv@@ ous , kno@@ wing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al stan@@ ds or discover@@ ed dis@@ qu@@ i@@ et@@ ing fin@@ din@@ gs in the behav@@ io@@ ral sci@@ ences ."
"There are many cas@@ es , some of which I talk about in the book , of people who have been sl@@ and@@ er@@ ed , called N@@ az@@ is , physic@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed with cri@@ min@@ al pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tion for st@@ um@@ bl@@ ing across or arg@@ u@@ ing about contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al fin@@ din@@ gs ."
And you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these bo@@ ob@@ y tra@@ ps .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite example is a pa@@ ir of psych@@ olog@@ ists who did research on le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and@@ ers , and published some data sho@@ wing that le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and@@ ers are , on average , more s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to disease , more pro@@ ne to acc@@ id@@ ents and have a shor@@ ter lif@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
"It &apos;s not c@@ lear , by the way , since then , whether that is an ac@@ cu@@ rate gener@@ aliz@@ ation , but the data at the time se@@ em@@ ed to sup@@ port that ."
"Well , pretty so@@ on they were bar@@ ra@@ g@@ ed with en@@ ra@@ g@@ ed l@@ et@@ ters , death thre@@ at@@ s , b@@ an on the t@@ op@@ ic in a number of scientific j@@ our@@ n@@ als , coming from i@@ rate le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and@@ ers and their adv@@ oc@@ ates , and they were liter@@ ally af@@ ra@@ id to open their ma@@ il because of the ven@@ om and vit@@ u@@ per@@ ation that they had in@@ adv@@ ert@@ ently insp@@ i@@ red . Well ,"
"@@ the night is young , but the book has been out for half a year , and nothing ter@@ ri@@ ble has happened ."
N@@ one of the d@@ ire profes@@ sion@@ al con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences has taken place — I hav@@ en &apos;t been ex@@ il@@ ed from the c@@ ity of C@@ am@@ br@@ id@@ ge .
But what I wanted to talk about are two of these h@@ ot b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons that have ar@@ ous@@ ed the st@@ ron@@ gest respon@@ se in the 8@@ 0-@@ od@@ d re@@ vie@@ ws that The B@@ l@@ ank S@@ l@@ ate has re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed .
"I &apos;ll just put that l@@ ist up for a few secon@@ ds , and see if you can gu@@ ess which two — I would es@@ ti@@ mate that probably two of these t@@ op@@ ics insp@@ i@@ red probably 90 percent of the re@@ action in the vari@@ ous re@@ vie@@ ws and radi@@ o inter@@ vie@@ ws ."
"It &apos;s not violence and war , it &apos;s not ra@@ ce , it &apos;s not gen@@ der , it &apos;s not Mar@@ x@@ ism , it &apos;s not N@@ az@@ ism ."
They are : the ar@@ ts and par@@ ent@@ ing .
"( Laughter ) So let me tell you what ar@@ ous@@ ed such i@@ rate respon@@ ses , and I &apos;ll let you dec@@ ide if whether they — the cl@@ a@@ im@@ s are really that ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous ."
Let me start with the ar@@ ts .
I not@@ e that amo@@ n@@ g the long l@@ ist of human univer@@ sa@@ ls that I pres@@ ented a few sl@@ ides ago are art .
There is no society ever discover@@ ed in the re@@ mo@@ test cor@@ ner of the world that has not had something that we would consid@@ er the ar@@ ts .
V@@ is@@ ual ar@@ ts — de@@ co@@ ration of sur@@ fac@@ es and bo@@ dies — ap@@ pe@@ ars to be a human univer@@ sal .
"The telling of stories , mus@@ ic , dan@@ ce , po@@ et@@ ry — found in all cul@@ tures , and many of the mo@@ ti@@ f@@ s and them@@ es that give us pl@@ eas@@ ure in the ar@@ ts can be found in all human societies : a pre@@ fer@@ ence for sym@@ me@@ tr@@ ical for@@ ms , the use of re@@ p@@ et@@ ition and vari@@ ation , even things as spec@@ if@@ ic as the fact that in po@@ et@@ ry all over the world , you have lin@@ es that are very clo@@ se to three secon@@ ds long , se@@ par@@ ated by pa@@ uses ."
"Now , on the other hand , in the second half of the 20@@ th century , the ar@@ ts are f@@ requ@@ ently said to be in de@@ cl@@ ine ."
"And I have a col@@ lec@@ tion , probably 10 or 15 head@@ lin@@ es , from high@@ bro@@ w ma@@ gaz@@ ines de@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the fact that the ar@@ ts are in de@@ cl@@ ine in our time ."
"I &apos;ll give you a couple of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative quot@@ es : &quot; &quot; We can as@@ s@@ ert with some con@@ f@@ idence that our own peri@@ od is one of de@@ cl@@ ine , that the stan@@ dar@@ ds of culture are lower than they were 50 years ago , and that the ev@@ id@@ ences of this de@@ cl@@ ine are vis@@ ible in every de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of human acti@@ vity . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a quot@@ e from T@@ . S@@ . E@@ li@@ ot , a little more than 50 years ago ."
And a more rec@@ ent one : &quot; &quot; The possi@@ bility of su@@ st@@ ain@@ ing high culture in our time is becom@@ ing increas@@ ing proble@@ ma@@ tical .
"S@@ er@@ ious book stor@@ es are lo@@ sing their fr@@ an@@ ch@@ ise , n@@ on@@ prof@@ it the@@ at@@ ers are surviv@@ ing pri@@ mar@@ ily by com@@ mer@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing their re@@ p@@ ert@@ ory , sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y or@@ ch@@ est@@ ras are dil@@ ut@@ ing their program@@ s , public tel@@ ev@@ ision is increas@@ ing its de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce on r@@ er@@ un@@ s of Brit@@ ish sit@@ com@@ s , clas@@ sic@@ al radi@@ o st@@ ations are d@@ w@@ ind@@ ling , mus@@ e@@ um@@ s are res@@ or@@ ting to bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ er sho@@ ws , dan@@ ce is d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s from R@@ ob@@ ert B@@ ru@@ ste@@ in , the f@@ amo@@ us dra@@ ma c@@ rit@@ ic and direc@@ tor , in The New R@@ e@@ public about five years ago ."
"Well , in fact , the ar@@ ts are not in de@@ cl@@ ine ."
"I don &apos;t think this will as a sur@@ pr@@ ise to any@@ one in this room , but by any stan@@ dar@@ d they have never been fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing to a gre@@ ater ext@@ ent ."
"There are , of course , enti@@ rel@@ y new art for@@ ms and new me@@ dia , many of which you &apos;ve heard over these few days ."
The only gra@@ in of tr@@ uth to this com@@ pla@@ in@@ t that the ar@@ ts are in de@@ cl@@ ine come from three sp@@ her@@ es .
"One of them is in el@@ ite art since the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — say , the kinds of works per@@ form@@ ed by maj@@ or sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y or@@ ch@@ est@@ ras , where most of the re@@ p@@ ert@@ ory is before 19@@ 30 , or the works sho@@ wn in maj@@ or g@@ all@@ er@@ ies and pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous mus@@ e@@ um@@ s ."
"In liter@@ ary c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism and anal@@ y@@ sis , probably 40 or 50 years ago , liter@@ ary c@@ rit@@ ics were a kind of cul@@ tu@@ ral her@@ o ; now they &apos;re kind of a national jo@@ ke ."
"And the hum@@ an@@ ities and ar@@ ts program@@ s in the univer@@ s@@ ities , which by many meas@@ ures , inde@@ ed are in de@@ cl@@ ine ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents are st@@ a@@ ying away in dro@@ ves , univer@@ s@@ ities are dis@@ inv@@ es@@ ting in the ar@@ ts and hum@@ an@@ ities ."
"Well , here &apos;s a diagno@@ sis ."
"They didn &apos;t ask me , but by their own ad@@ mis@@ sion , they need all the help that they can get ."
And I would like to su@@ g@@ gest that it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ c@@ idence that this sup@@ posed de@@ cl@@ ine in the el@@ ite ar@@ ts and c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism oc@@ cur@@ red in the same point in history in which there was a w@@ id@@ es@@ pre@@ ad den@@ ial of human nature .
"A f@@ amo@@ us quot@@ ation can be found — if you look on the w@@ eb , you can find it in liter@@ ally sc@@ or@@ es of English cor@@ e sy@@ l@@ lab@@ uses — &quot; &quot; I@@ n or about D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 19@@ 10 , human nature changed . &quot; &quot; A par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se of a quot@@ e by V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia W@@ o@@ ol@@ f , and there &apos;s some deb@@ ate as to what she actually me@@ ant by that ."
"But it &apos;s very c@@ lear , looking at these sy@@ l@@ lab@@ uses , that — it &apos;s used now as a way of saying that all for@@ ms of app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of art that were in place for cent@@ ur@@ ies , or mil@@ l@@ en@@ nia , in the 20@@ th century were dis@@ car@@ ded ."
"The be@@ aut@@ y and pl@@ eas@@ ure in art — probably a human univer@@ sal — were — be@@ gan to be consid@@ er@@ ed sac@@ char@@ ine , or k@@ its@@ ch , or com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al ."
B@@ ar@@ n@@ et@@ t N@@ e@@ w@@ man had a f@@ amo@@ us quot@@ e that &quot; &quot; the im@@ pul@@ se of moder@@ n art is the des@@ ire to des@@ tro@@ y be@@ aut@@ y &quot; &quot; — which was consid@@ er@@ ed b@@ our@@ ge@@ o@@ is or t@@ ac@@ k@@ y .
And here &apos;s just one example .
"I mean , this is perhaps a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative example of the vis@@ ual de@@ pic@@ tion of the f@@ em@@ ale form in the 1@@ 5@@ th century ; here is a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative example of the de@@ pic@@ tion of the f@@ em@@ ale form in the 20@@ th century ."
"And , as you can see , there — something has changed in the way the el@@ ite ar@@ ts ap@@ pe@@ al to the sen@@ ses ."
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , in mov@@ em@@ ents of moder@@ n@@ ism and pos@@ t-@@ moder@@ n@@ ism , there was vis@@ ual art without be@@ aut@@ y , liter@@ ature without nar@@ ra@@ tive and p@@ lot , po@@ et@@ ry without me@@ ter and r@@ hy@@ me , arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture and plan@@ ning without or@@ nam@@ ent , human sc@@ ale , gre@@ en space and natural light , mus@@ ic without mel@@ ody and r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , and c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism without cl@@ ar@@ ity , at@@ ten@@ tion to a@@ es@@ the@@ tics and in@@ sight into the human con@@ d@@ ition ."
( Laughter ) Let me give just you an example to back up that last stat@@ ement .
"But here , there — one of the most f@@ amo@@ us liter@@ ary English s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars of our time is the B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey prof@@ ess@@ or , J@@ ud@@ ith B@@ ut@@ l@@ er ."
"And here is an example of one of her anal@@ y@@ ses : &quot; &quot; The move from a struc@@ tur@@ al@@ ist ac@@ coun@@ t in which cap@@ ital is underst@@ ood to structure social rel@@ ations in rel@@ ati@@ vely ho@@ mo@@ log@@ ous ways to a view of he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y in which power rel@@ ations are sub@@ ject to re@@ p@@ et@@ ition , con@@ ver@@ gence and re@@ ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ation b@@ rou@@ ght the question of tem@@ po@@ ral@@ ity into the thinking of structure , and mar@@ ked a shi@@ ft from the form of A@@ l@@ th@@ us@@ ser@@ ian theory that takes struc@@ tu@@ ral tot@@ alit@@ ies as the@@ or@@ e@@ tical ob@@ jects ... &quot; &quot; Well , you get the idea ."
"B@@ y the way , this is one s@@ ent@@ ence — you can actually par@@ se it ."
"Well , the argum@@ ent in &quot; &quot; The B@@ l@@ ank S@@ l@@ ate &quot; &quot; was that el@@ ite art and c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism in the 20@@ th century , al@@ though not the ar@@ ts in gener@@ al , have dis@@ da@@ ined be@@ aut@@ y , pl@@ eas@@ ure , cl@@ ar@@ ity , in@@ sight and st@@ y@@ le ."
P@@ eople are st@@ a@@ ying away from el@@ ite art and c@@ rit@@ ic@@ ism .
What a p@@ uz@@ z@@ le — I won@@ der why .
"Well , this turned out to be probably the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al cl@@ a@@ im in the book ."
S@@ ome@@ one asked me whether I st@@ uc@@ k it in in order to de@@ fl@@ ect ire from disc@@ us@@ sions of gen@@ der and N@@ az@@ ism and ra@@ ce and so on . I won &apos;t com@@ ment on that .
But it certain@@ ly insp@@ i@@ red an ener@@ ge@@ tic re@@ action from many univer@@ sity prof@@ ess@@ ors .
"Well , the other h@@ ot b@@ ut@@ ton is par@@ ent@@ ing ."
And the starting point is the — for that disc@@ us@@ sion was the fact that we have all been sub@@ ject to the ad@@ vic@@ e of the par@@ ent@@ ing ind@@ ust@@ ri@@ al compl@@ ex .
"Now , here is — here is a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative quot@@ e from a b@@ es@@ i@@ eg@@ ed mother : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed with par@@ ent@@ ing ad@@ vic@@ e ."
I &apos;m sup@@ posed to do lots of physical acti@@ vity with my kids so I can in@@ still in them a physical f@@ it@@ ness h@@ ab@@ it so they &apos;ll grow up to be heal@@ thy ad@@ ults .
And I &apos;m sup@@ posed to do all kinds of intel@@ lec@@ tual play so they &apos;ll grow up s@@ mart .
"And there are all kinds of play — cl@@ ay for fin@@ ger de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity , word gam@@ es for read@@ ing success , large mo@@ tor play , small mo@@ tor play . I feel like I could dev@@ ot@@ e my life to fig@@ uring out what to play with my kids . &quot; &quot; I think any@@ one who &apos;s rec@@ ently been a par@@ ent can sym@@ pa@@ th@@ ize with this mother ."
"Well , here &apos;s some s@@ ob@@ ering fac@@ ts about par@@ ent@@ ing ."
"M@@ o@@ st studies of par@@ ent@@ ing on which this ad@@ vic@@ e is bas@@ ed are us@@ el@@ ess . They &apos;re us@@ el@@ ess because they don &apos;t control for her@@ it@@ ability . They measure some cor@@ rel@@ ation between what the parents do , how the children turn out and as@@ su@@ me a c@@ au@@ sal rel@@ ation : that the par@@ ent@@ ing shap@@ ed the child ."
"P@@ ar@@ ents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate , parents who sp@@ ank their kids have kids who grow up to be viol@@ ent and so on ."
And very few of them control for the possi@@ bility that parents pas@@ s on gen@@ es for — that increase the chan@@ ces a child will be ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate or viol@@ ent and so on .
"@@ Un@@ til the studies are re@@ done with ad@@ op@@ tive children , who pro@@ v@@ ide an environ@@ ment but not gen@@ es to their kids , we have no way of kno@@ wing whether these con@@ cl@@ us@@ ions are val@@ id ."
The gen@@ e@@ tically contro@@ l@@ led studies have some s@@ ob@@ ering results .
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber the M@@ al@@ li@@ fer@@ t tw@@ ins : se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th , then they me@@ et in the pat@@ ent off@@ ice — re@@ mark@@ ably si@@ mil@@ ar ."
"Well , what would have happened if the M@@ al@@ li@@ fer@@ t tw@@ ins had gro@@ wn up together ?"
"You might think , well , then they &apos;d be even more si@@ mil@@ ar , because not only would they share their gen@@ es , but they would also share their environ@@ ment ."
"That would make them super@@ -@@ si@@ mil@@ ar , right ?"
"W@@ rong . I@@ den@@ tical tw@@ ins , or any si@@ bl@@ ings , who are se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th are no less si@@ mil@@ ar than if they had gro@@ wn up together ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that happens to you in a given home over all of those years ap@@ pe@@ ars to leave no per@@ man@@ ent st@@ am@@ p on your person@@ ality or intel@@ l@@ ect .
"A compl@@ em@@ ent@@ ary fin@@ ding , from a completely different me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ lo@@ gy , is that ad@@ op@@ ted si@@ bl@@ ings re@@ ar@@ ed together — the mir@@ ro@@ r imag@@ e of id@@ en@@ tical tw@@ ins re@@ ar@@ ed ap@@ art , they share their parents , their home , their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , don &apos;t share their gen@@ es — end up not si@@ mil@@ ar at all ."
O@@ K — two different bo@@ dies of research with a si@@ mil@@ ar fin@@ ding .
"What it su@@ g@@ ges@@ ts is that children are shap@@ ed not by their parents over the long run , but in part — only in part — by their gen@@ es , in part by their culture — the culture of the country at large and the children &apos;s own culture , nam@@ ely their pe@@ er group — as we heard from J@@ ill S@@ ob@@ ul@@ e ear@@ li@@ er today , that &apos;s what kids care about — and , to a very large ext@@ ent , larg@@ er than most people are pre@@ par@@ ed to ac@@ knowledge , by chan@@ ce : chan@@ ce ev@@ ents in the w@@ ir@@ ing of the brain in ut@@ ero ; chan@@ ce ev@@ ents as you live your life ."
So let me con@@ cl@@ u@@ de with just a re@@ mar@@ k to bring it back to the the@@ me of cho@@ ices .
"I think that the sci@@ ences of human nature — behav@@ io@@ ral gen@@ e@@ tics , evolu@@ tion@@ ary psych@@ ology , neuro@@ science , co@@ gn@@ itive science — are going to , increas@@ ing@@ ly in the years to come , up@@ set vari@@ ous do@@ g@@ mas , care@@ ers and de@@ e@@ pl@@ y-@@ hel@@ d political beli@@ ef syst@@ ems ."
And that pres@@ ents us with a cho@@ ice .
"I have my own answer to that question , which comes from a great art@@ ist of the 19@@ th century , An@@ ton C@@ he@@ kh@@ o@@ v , who said , &quot; &quot; M@@ an will become better when you show him what he is like . &quot; &quot; And I think that the argum@@ ent can &apos;t be put any more el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently than that ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
