"When I was 11 , I remember w@@ ak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ou@@ se ."
"M@@ y father was list@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C N@@ e@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mil@@ e on his face which was un@@ us@@ ual then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly depres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The Tal@@ ib@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the Tal@@ ib@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan and made it il@@ le@@ ga@@ l for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I d@@ res@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der sis@@ ter , who was no longer al@@ lowed to be outside al@@ one , to a sec@@ ret school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different ro@@ ute so that no one would s@@ us@@ p@@ ect where we were going ."
We would c@@ over our bo@@ o@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a h@@ ou@@ se , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ zy in w@@ in@@ ter but extre@@ m@@ ely h@@ ot in sum@@ m@@ er .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because Tal@@ ib@@ an were s@@ us@@ pic@@ ious ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lowed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and dau@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ ured .
My grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ mo@@ te pro@@ vin@@ ce of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , he in@@ sis@@ ted that his dau@@ ghter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother bec@@ ame a teacher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ou@@ se into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ ive an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ ive an education , incl@@ ud@@ ing his dau@@ gh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the Tal@@ ib@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"@@ To him , there was gre@@ ater ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ uring Tal@@ ib@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by our life and always being sc@@ ar@@ ed and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my dau@@ ghter , you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home d@@ uring a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our blo@@ od to pa@@ y your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; To@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ ised in a country that has been des@@ tro@@ yed by dec@@ ades of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ ond high school , and had my family not been so com@@ mit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pro@@ u@@ d grad@@ u@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ l@@ eb@@ ury C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his dau@@ gh@@ ters , was amo@@ n@@ g the first to con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ate me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my college de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dr@@ ive him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ ul ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ ams even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global amb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pa@@ ign to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ k@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with amb@@ ition gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at opportun@@ ity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his dau@@ ghter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being k@@ il@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ riv@@ ed home , the ph@@ one ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his dau@@ ghter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my dau@@ ghter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to real@@ ize about A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that be@@ h@@ ind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who reco@@ gni@@ z@@ es the value in his dau@@ ghter and who se@@ es that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers ar@@ en &apos;t k@@ ey in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ it@@ ial and con@@ vin@@ cing ne@@ g@@ ot@@ i@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their dau@@ gh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the Tal@@ ib@@ an , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ le@@ ga@@ l ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the fra@@ g@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ ond the U.@@ S@@ . tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a prom@@ is@@ ing future and las@@ ting change ."
"@@ To me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is@@ tan is a country of hope and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bil@@ ities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ Just ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely amazing , every single d@@ ive ."
D@@ isa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars right into the bac@@ k@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s bl@@ uf@@ f@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it bac@@ k@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first public ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion ."
"If anything se@@ em@@ ed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really for@@ tun@@ ate to get out , many other Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ ans have not been so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an inst@@ ant ."
"We are all K@@ or@@ e@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , d@@ ue to 6@@ 7 years of div@@ ision ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ an or Nor@@ th K@@ or@@ e@@ an ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so sur@@ pris@@ ed that a tot@@ al stran@@ ger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I real@@ ized that this was a sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we des@@ ign@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a par@@ ent , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cl@@ es ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we des@@ ign this ?
"The princip@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sis@@ ted : &quot; &quot; How about having a n@@ et s@@ tic@@ king out from the edge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can cat@@ ch the children f@@ all@@ ing off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government of@@ fic@@ ial said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ p@@ ping through .
And we were al@@ lowed to call this rop@@ e as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the n@@ et .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the edge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ ed@@ ing time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ sh@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ ible t@@ ub@@ es , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ sh@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s put@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between inside and outside .
So it means basically this arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
So there is no ac@@ ous@@ tic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qu@@ iet bo@@ x , some of them get really nerv@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get nerv@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y .
"And the princip@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ cas@@ ion , us@@ u@@ ally children try to h@@ ide some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , we consid@@ er no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qu@@ iet space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing con@@ cent@@ ration in class ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go sk@@ i@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in w@@ in@@ ter .
I@@ n sum@@ m@@ er you go s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never mel@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they div@@ ide clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
They are sup@@ posed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to f@@ ish another mon@@ k@@ ey from ab@@ ove .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at le@@ ast one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ ta C@@ l@@ au@@ s comes down at the time of Ch@@ r@@ ist@@ mas .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that ov@@ al@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven f@@ lo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consid@@ er saf@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a dau@@ ghter and a son ."
They tri@@ ed to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite st@@ rong .
He is res@@ il@@ i@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ f@@ fic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in To@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The driv@@ er in front , she needs to learn how to dr@@ ive ."
"Now these days , kids need a small do@@ sa@@ ge of dan@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ cas@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of opportun@@ ity we are lo@@ sing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the mov@@ ement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the sur@@ pr@@ ise is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic abil@@ ities amo@@ n@@ g many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ s .
"The princip@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
Just like she@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t pro@@ t@@ ect them too much , and they need to tum@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate fundam@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to pl@@ ease rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a movi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a son@@ g or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ art@@ ed@@ ly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a lo@@ sing pro@@ position ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ ef@@ ul ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that I see , a us@@ ef@@ ul ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an al@@ g@@ eb@@ ra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.@@ S@@ . today .
"@@ To start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak mat@@ h down into two cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies ."
One is comput@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ ef@@ fic@@ i@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to rel@@ ear@@ n , pro@@ vid@@ ed you have a really st@@ rong gro@@ und@@ ing in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the ap@@ plic@@ ation of mat@@ h proc@@ ess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ sur@@ es they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to clo@@ se with , why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h teacher ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ t@@ oms that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ it@@ i@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture bloc@@ k and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five hands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ dents l@@ ack per@@ s@@ ever@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ e@@ sa@@ le ."
"There &apos;s an aver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that sit@@ u@@ ation .
This is really des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive .
"D@@ av@@ id M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amazing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary dra@@ ma , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ res@@ p@@ ect , it shap@@ es the ne@@ ural pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ res@@ olu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t res@@ ol@@ ve qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ ci@@ al bre@@ ak@@ s and a l@@ au@@ gh trac@@ k ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ v@@ ing is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — particul@@ arly mas@@ s@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing , it &apos;s func@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent to turn@@ ing on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) I@@ n all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics t@@ ext@@ book .
It app@@ li@@ es equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"@@ N@@ ot@@ ice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pi@@ ec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then comput@@ e ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ v@@ ing where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suf@@ fic@@ i@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ v@@ ing is like that .
"And the t@@ ext@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s h@@ am@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the prac@@ ti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ e@@ ak@@ ing the cont@@ ex@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t reco@@ gni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was mo@@ ld@@ ed from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ od@@ e a t@@ ext@@ book . That &apos;s a sh@@ ame ."
So I can diagno@@ se the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ p@@ e using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers , and I &apos;m cur@@ ious which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate la@@ y@@ ers and , particul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ ented to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing ."
I &apos;ll defin@@ e them here : You have the vis@@ ual .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure , talking about gr@@ id@@ s , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , lab@@ els , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ el@@ ling question , a comp@@ el@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re p@@ av@@ ing a smo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gra@@ tul@@ ating our students for how well they can step over the small cra@@ c@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing ."
"So right here I start with the vis@@ ual , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion because the vis@@ ual is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people arg@@ u@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in pa@@ ir@@ s , j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
And then even@@ tually we real@@ ize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the sk@@ ier in the lower le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the sk@@ ier just ab@@ ove the mi@@ d line .
"And we real@@ ize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ els to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to defin@@ e what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we real@@ ize it would be n@@ ice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical structure ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ p@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"@@ Do you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my prac@@ ti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the f@@ lo@@ or here for a second to E@@ inste@@ in , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his d@@ ues ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my prac@@ ti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the form@@ ul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ el@@ ling el@@ em@@ ents of problems like this from my t@@ ext@@ book and reb@@ u@@ il@@ d them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then not@@ ice that all the information writ@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"@@ N@@ one of it &apos;s a dis@@ trac@@ tor , so we lo@@ se that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to dec@@ ide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the c@@ olo@@ r of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ ented question in mat@@ h cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so often see in t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ low@@ ly , agon@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ low@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ling their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ t@@ ro , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted jo@@ ining the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer k@@ ey in the back of the teacher &apos;s ed@@ ition ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the movi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical mod@@ els that always work out in the answer k@@ ey in the back of a teacher &apos;s ed@@ ition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about s@@ our@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ or@@ e@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the prac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , amo@@ n@@ g the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n gam@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ uses day one of the class .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one s@@ em@@ es@@ ter in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally for@@ e@@ ign , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer aver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ da@@ ted by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ low@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge mat@@ h teachers I talk to to use mul@@ ti@@ me@@ dia , because it br@@ ings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high res@@ olu@@ tion and ful@@ l c@@ olo@@ r ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more spec@@ if@@ ic questions come out in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ inste@@ in said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ext@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tion , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ v@@ ing and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amazing time to be a mat@@ h teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um in our front po@@ c@@ k@@ et .
"It &apos;s ub@@ i@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ a@@ p , and the to@@ ols to dis@@ tri@@ b@@ ute it fre@@ ely under open l@@ ic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ aper or more ub@@ i@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a video ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ ils still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never vis@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : I@@ n a gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ e , which line do you get into , the one that has one c@@ art and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mod@@ el@@ ing inv@@ ol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just biz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ cl@@ u@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ at@@ ever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , par@@ ent , teacher , pol@@ ic@@ y mak@@ er , wh@@ at@@ ever — in@@ s@@ ist on better mat@@ h cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
"And un@@ less you &apos;ve been on M@@ ars rec@@ ently , you know there &apos;s a lot of that out there ."
"But let &apos;s face it , there &apos;s a lot of bun@@ k ."
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
"I b@@ rou@@ ght this with me , this was given to us by N@@ B@@ C D@@ at@@ el@@ ine to test ."
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ po@@ ration of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s called the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro 2@@ 000 D@@ ow@@ s@@ er R@@ od .
( Laughter ) This was being s@@ old to high@@ -@@ school ad@@ min@@ ist@@ rat@@ ors for $ 9@@ 00 api@@ ece .
It &apos;s a piece of pl@@ as@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ na att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So it looks something like this .
I &apos;ll show you .
"( Laughter ) Well , it has kind of a ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ le@@ an@@ ing bi@@ as ."
"Well , this is science , so we &apos;ll do a contro@@ l@@ led experiment ."
It &apos;ll go this way for sure .
"( Laughter ) S@@ ir , do you want to emp@@ ty your po@@ c@@ ket@@ s , pl@@ ease , si@@ r ? ( Laughter )"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in science , we have to keep trac@@ k of the mis@@ ses , not just the h@@ its ."
"And that &apos;s probably the k@@ ey les@@ son to my shor@@ t talk here : This is how psych@@ ics work , astro@@ log@@ ers , t@@ ar@@ ot c@@ ard read@@ ers and so on ."
P@@ eople remember the h@@ its and for@@ get the mis@@ ses .
"In this case , we tes@@ ted it ."
"We had two op@@ a@@ qu@@ e bo@@ x@@ es : one with govern@@ m@@ ent@@ -@@ appro@@ ved T@@ H@@ C mar@@ ij@@ u@@ ana , and one with nothing ."
And it got it 50 percent of the time — ( Laughter ) which is exactly what you &apos;d exp@@ ect with a co@@ in@@ -@@ f@@ li@@ p mo@@ del .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ p@@ tic &quot; &quot; is the qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly pub@@ l@@ ic@@ ation . E@@ ach one has a particular the@@ me .
This one is on the future of intelligence .
A@@ re people getting s@@ mar@@ ter or d@@ um@@ ber ?
S@@ or@@ t of an interesting thing .
"W@@ ith science , don &apos;t think of sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism as a thing , or science as a thing ."
A@@ re science and relig@@ ion comp@@ ati@@ ble ?
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
S@@ ci@@ ence is not a thing . It &apos;s a ver@@ b .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
It &apos;s a way of looking for natural ex@@ plan@@ ations for all ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena .
"B@@ e@@ fore we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it &apos;s not in this world ."
( Laughter ) The same the@@ me is ex@@ pres@@ sed n@@ ic@@ ely here in this S@@ id@@ ney H@@ ar@@ ris car@@ to@@ on .
"For those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; &quot; Th@@ en a mi@@ ra@@ cle oc@@ cur@@ s ."
I think you need to be more ex@@ pl@@ icit here in step two . &quot; &quot; This single sl@@ ide completely dis@@ man@@ t@@ les the intelli@@ gent des@@ ign argum@@ ents .
There &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
There &apos;s nothing to test .
It &apos;s the end of the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion for intelli@@ gent des@@ ign cre@@ ation@@ ists .
It &apos;s the beginning of the c@@ au@@ sal cha@@ in for science .
"For intelli@@ gent des@@ ign cre@@ ation@@ ists , it &apos;s the end of the cha@@ in ."
"So again , we can ask this : what &apos;s more likely ?"
"A@@ re U@@ F@@ O@@ s ali@@ en sp@@ ac@@ e@@ shi@@ ps , or per@@ cep@@ tual co@@ gn@@ itive mis@@ takes , or even f@@ ak@@ es ?"
"This is a U@@ F@@ O sh@@ ot from my h@@ ou@@ se in A@@ l@@ t@@ ad@@ ena , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , looking down over P@@ a@@ sa@@ den@@ a ."
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k h@@ ub@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
"You don &apos;t even need P@@ h@@ ot@@ o@@ sho@@ p or high@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h equ@@ ip@@ ment , you don &apos;t need comput@@ ers ."
This was sh@@ ot with a th@@ ro@@ wa@@ way K@@ o@@ da@@ k In@@ st@@ ama@@ tic c@@ amer@@ a .
You just have somebody off on the side with a h@@ ub@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
C@@ amer@@ a &apos;s ready — that &apos;s it .
"( Laughter ) So , al@@ though it &apos;s possible that most of these things are f@@ ake or ill@@ us@@ ions or so on , and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are f@@ ake , like the c@@ ro@@ p cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ esc@@ ope to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , there was no theory of plan@@ et@@ ary r@@ ings ."
So he w@@ ro@@ te that he had seen — &quot; I have observ@@ ed that the fur@@ th@@ est planet has three bo@@ dies . &quot;
And this is what he en@@ ded up con@@ cl@@ ud@@ ing that he saw .
"So without a theory of plan@@ et@@ ary r@@ ings and with only gra@@ in@@ y data , you can &apos;t have a good theory ."
It wasn &apos;t sol@@ ved until 1@@ 6@@ 5@@ 5 .
"And we see the an@@ gl@@ es of the r@@ ings at different an@@ gl@@ es , there ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
"So one of the problems of expla@@ ining why people believe we@@ ir@@ d things is that we have things , on a simple level , and then I &apos;ll go to more ser@@ ious ones ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , we have a ten@@ den@@ cy to see fac@@ es ."
"In 19@@ 7@@ 6 , where there was a whole mov@@ ement to get N@@ A@@ S@@ A to ph@@ ot@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h that are@@ a because people thought this was mon@@ um@@ ental arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture made by Mar@@ ti@@ ans ."
Here &apos;s the clo@@ se@@ -@@ up of it from 200@@ 1 .
"If you s@@ qu@@ in@@ t , you can still see the face ."
"And when you &apos;re s@@ qu@@ in@@ ting , you &apos;re turn@@ ing that from fin@@ e-@@ gra@@ in to co@@ ar@@ se@@ -@@ gra@@ in , so you &apos;re reduc@@ ing the qu@@ ality of your data ."
"You see the happy face on M@@ ars , there ."
"( Laughter ) If astro@@ nom@@ ers were f@@ rog@@ s , perhaps they &apos;d see K@@ er@@ mit the F@@ ro@@ g ."
R@@ el@@ ig@@ ious ic@@ on@@ o@@ graph@@ y .
( Laughter ) D@@ is@@ c@@ over@@ ed by a T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see b@@ ak@@ er in 19@@ 9@@ 6 .

"@@ Here &apos;s when the V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary made her ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance on a che@@ ese san@@ d@@ w@@ ich — which I got to actually hold in a L@@ as V@@ e@@ ga@@ s cas@@ ino — of course , this being America ."
"( Laughter ) This cas@@ ino pa@@ id $ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 on e@@ B@@ ay for the che@@ ese san@@ d@@ w@@ ich . ( Laughter )"
But who does it really look like ? The V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary ? ( Laughter )
"It has that sort of p@@ uc@@ ker@@ ed li@@ ps , 19@@ 4@@ 0@@ s@@ -@@ er@@ a look ."
"@@ V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary in C@@ lear@@ water , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ."
There was a lot of people there .
"The fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful come in their whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ s and c@@ r@@ ut@@ ch@@ es , and so on ."
We went down and inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ ted .
"@@ Just to give you a size , that &apos;s D@@ aw@@ kin@@ s , me and The A@@ maz@@ ing R@@ an@@ di , next to this two , two and a half stor@@ y-@@ si@@ z@@ ed imag@@ e ."

"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ gin M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
I gu@@ ess you can only have one mi@@ ra@@ cle per building .
"( Laughter ) So is it really a mi@@ ra@@ cle of M@@ ary , or is it a mi@@ ra@@ cle of M@@ arg@@ e ? ( Laughter )"
"And now I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with another example of this , with au@@ dit@@ ory ill@@ us@@ ions ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ n this case , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , these mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es are h@@ id@@ den in elec@@ t@@ ron@@ ic ph@@ en@@ om@@ ena ."
There &apos;s a R@@ ever@@ se@@ S@@ pe@@ e@@ ch@@ .@@ co@@ m w@@ eb p@@ age where I do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed this stuff .
This is the most f@@ amo@@ us one of all of these .

( M@@ us@@ ic ends ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t you just list@@ en to that all day ?
"A@@ ll right , here it is bac@@ k@@ wards , and see if you can hear the h@@ id@@ den mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es that are sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly in there ."

"I &apos;m going to just end with a pos@@ itive , n@@ ice little story ."
The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tics is a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it educ@@ ational organiz@@ ation .
We &apos;re always looking for little good things that people do .
"One of the top popul@@ ar sin@@ g@@ ers in Engl@@ and today , K@@ ati@@ e M@@ el@@ u@@ a ."
And she w@@ ro@@ te a beautiful son@@ g .
And she has this one pas@@ sa@@ ge here .
"( M@@ us@@ ic ) ( L@@ y@@ ric@@ s ) We are 12 billion ligh@@ t-@@ years from the edge That &apos;s a gu@@ ess , No one can ever say it &apos;s true , But I know that I will always be with you ."
"M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ her@@ m@@ er : Well , that &apos;s n@@ ice . A@@ t le@@ ast she got it clo@@ se ."
"You know , it &apos;s 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion light years , and it &apos;s not a gu@@ ess ."
We know within prec@@ ise er@@ ro@@ r b@@ ars how clo@@ se it is .
"So we can say , al@@ though not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely true , it &apos;s pretty clo@@ se to being true ."
So I will end with the new ver@@ sion .
( M@@ us@@ ic with l@@ y@@ ric@@ s ) We are 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion light years from the edge of the observ@@ able universe .
That &apos;s a good es@@ ti@@ mate with well-@@ defin@@ ed er@@ ro@@ r b@@ ars .
"And with the av@@ a@@ il@@ able information , I predic@@ t that I will always be with you ."
( Laughter ) How co@@ ol is that ?
( Applause )
Thank you .
"@@ T@@ w@@ o years ago , I st@@ ood on the TE@@ D stage in A@@ r@@ ush@@ a , Tan@@ z@@ ania ."
I spo@@ ke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pro@@ ud@@ est cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an In@@ tern@@ et .
"O@@ n the stage that day , I was so nerv@@ ous ."
"M@@ y English lo@@ st , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sis@@ ters , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my dad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I discover@@ ed the won@@ d@@ ers of science , I was just a simple far@@ m@@ er in a country of po@@ or far@@ m@@ ers ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
I@@ n 200@@ 1 we experien@@ ced an aw@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans be@@ gan to star@@ ve to death .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The food pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ dar@@ y school , you have to pa@@ y school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I fel@@ t very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ ive education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read bo@@ o@@ ks , science bo@@ o@@ ks , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally physics ."
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diag@@ ram@@ s and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a w@@ ind@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate elec@@ tric@@ ity .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion , a de@@ fen@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experien@@ cing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one w@@ ind@@ m@@ ill for my@@ self .
"But I didn &apos;t have mater@@ i@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p yar@@ d where I found my mater@@ i@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , incl@@ ud@@ ing my mother , said I was crazy ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sh@@ oc@@ k ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four ligh@@ ts , with s@@ w@@ it@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mod@@ el@@ ed after an elec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ ga@@ tion .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ ues of people start lin@@ ing up at my h@@ ou@@ se ( Laughter ) to ch@@ arg@@ e their mo@@ bil@@ e ph@@ one .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TE@@ D ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on stage that day in A@@ r@@ ush@@ a , my English lo@@ st , I said something like , &quot; I tri@@ ed . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fr@@ ic@@ ans , and the po@@ or who are st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with your dre@@ ams ."

We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ ane s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tum@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to spe@@ ak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of moral@@ ity — questions of good and ev@@ il and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fic@@ i@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to value ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ st@@ it@@ utes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to arg@@ ue that this is an ill@@ us@@ ion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an ill@@ us@@ ion — and actually quite a dan@@ ger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion for moral@@ ity and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues seem to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well-@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions to@@ ward roc@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel com@@ passion for roc@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think roc@@ ks can suf@@ fer . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ sec@@ ts , as inde@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al happiness and suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al thing to not@@ ice here is that this is a fac@@ tual cl@@ a@@ im : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bi@@ ological compl@@ ex@@ ity and the possi@@ bil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ sec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no not@@ ion , no ver@@ sion of human moral@@ ity and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about consci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from relig@@ ion , even if you think that good and ev@@ il ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rel@@ ate to con@@ dit@@ ions after death — ei@@ ther to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of suf@@ fer@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about consciousness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ s@@ ist after death is itself a fac@@ tual cl@@ a@@ im , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to spe@@ ak about the con@@ dit@@ ions of well-@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul col@@ labo@@ ration , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ rob@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the ev@@ il ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bl@@ ame their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ rob@@ ably not ."
"There are tr@@ u@@ ths to be known about how human commun@@ ities fl@@ our@@ ish , whether or not we understand these tr@@ u@@ ths ."
And moral@@ ity rel@@ ates to these tr@@ u@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic syst@@ ems and political ar@@ ran@@ g@@ em@@ ents ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is real@@ ized in the brain — wh@@ at@@ ever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as inde@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wh@@ at@@ ever cul@@ tu@@ ral vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ our@@ ish can , at le@@ ast in princi@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psych@@ ology , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m arg@@ u@@ ing is that value &apos;s reduc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the consci@@ ous experience of consci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vis@@ ual@@ ize a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ res@@ po@@ nd to differ@@ ences in the well-@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both person@@ al and col@@ lec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to not@@ ice is that perhaps there are st@@ ates of human well-@@ being that we r@@ ar@@ ely acc@@ ess , that few people acc@@ ess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our discover@@ y .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ s@@ tical or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t acc@@ ess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could acc@@ ess them .
"Now , let me be c@@ lear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ ra@@ n &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ il@@ ities , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the ful@@ l cost of TE@@ D as a business exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions af@@ fect human well-@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how hum@@ ans fl@@ our@@ ish — will change the way we talk about moral@@ ity , and will change our expec@@ t@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is le@@ ga@@ l , where it is le@@ ga@@ l for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ od@@ en bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large br@@ u@@ is@@ es and bl@@ is@@ ters and even bre@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ c@@ id@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed dis@@ tric@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to sur@@ pr@@ ise you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ ale for this behavior is ex@@ plic@@ it@@ ly relig@@ ious .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we spo@@ il the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and violence and public hum@@ il@@ i@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy emo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the not@@ ion of well-@@ being is tr@@ ul@@ y un@@ defin@@ ed , and se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ally open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive not@@ ion of well-@@ being ?"
"Well , consid@@ er by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ pec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this stat@@ ue was car@@ ved the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ d@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be consid@@ er@@ ed a prof@@ ound disa@@ bility .
P@@ eople will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ d@@ ition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vis@@ ion , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as c@@ lear and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to not@@ ice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e : There may be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ways to th@@ r@@ ive ; there may be equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ imi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an ob@@ jec@@ tive moral@@ ity ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to arg@@ ue to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of mater@@ i@@ als that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute heal@@ thy food .
But there &apos;s n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess a c@@ lear dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ pt us to say that there are no tr@@ u@@ ths to be known about human n@@ ut@@ rit@@ ion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univer@@ sal moral@@ ity would requ@@ ire moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tr@@ uth ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ sid@@ er , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the ga@@ me of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a princi@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ se your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mo@@ ments when lo@@ sing your Q@@ u@@ e@@ en is a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mo@@ ments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ ma@@ in of per@@ fect ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mov@@ es that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sp@@ here ."
Con@@ sid@@ er the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can c@@ over them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , of our intel@@ lec@@ tual commun@@ ity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ o@@ st@@ on or P@@ al@@ o A@@ l@@ to , who are we to say that the pro@@ u@@ d den@@ iz@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their w@@ iv@@ es and dau@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the p@@ riv@@ il@@ e@@ ge of being smo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pret@@ end that we know so little about human well-@@ being that we have to be n@@ on@@ -@@ j@@ ud@@ g@@ mental about a prac@@ ti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary we@@ aring of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar wh@@ at@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a commun@@ ity where , when a gir@@ l gets ra@@ ped , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of sh@@ ame ?"
"@@ Just let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a min@@ ute : Y@@ our dau@@ ghter gets ra@@ ped , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fect solu@@ tion in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civiliz@@ ed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may requ@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in philosoph@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fect ex@@ pres@@ sion of psych@@ ological bal@@ ance with res@@ p@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ ou@@ th and be@@ aut@@ y and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environ@@ ment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tr@@ um between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e ."
But the thing to not@@ ice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ron@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are relig@@ ious de@@ mag@@ o@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intelli@@ gent anal@@ y@@ sis of the ca@@ uses and con@@ d@@ ition of human and an@@ ima@@ l well-@@ being ."
"In fact , the end@@ ur@@ ance of relig@@ ion as a l@@ ens through which most people view moral questions has se@@ par@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and an@@ ima@@ l suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like ga@@ y marri@@ age and not about gen@@ oc@@ ide or n@@ uc@@ lear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or pov@@ ert@@ y or any other hu@@ g@@ ely con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ mag@@ o@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univer@@ sal con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to not@@ ice is that we do something different when talking about moral@@ ity — es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally sec@@ ul@@ ar , ac@@ ade@@ mic , scient@@ ist typ@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about moral@@ ity we value differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ dit@@ ating on com@@ passion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l com@@ pon@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very fon@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and ra@@ ping and t@@ or@@ tur@@ ing and k@@ il@@ ling young women ."
"So , we ap@@ pe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ o@@ st W@@ es@@ tern intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als look at this sit@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real argum@@ ent that po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate , he lik@@ es v@@ an@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ade the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot@@ ice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the s@@ mart@@ est physic@@ ists around who is the s@@ mart@@ est physic@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small sc@@ ale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physic@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of str@@ ing theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any str@@ ing theory cl@@ u@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ ions must be ex@@ cl@@ ud@@ ed .
That is what it is to have a do@@ ma@@ in of exp@@ ert@@ ise .
That is what it is for knowledge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral exp@@ ert@@ ise , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consid@@ ering ?
D@@ o@@ es the Tal@@ ib@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th consid@@ ering ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ign@@ or@@ ance any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well-@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ mit that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and moral@@ ity rel@@ ates to that do@@ ma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individ@@ ual@@ s , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and des@@ ir@@ es that rel@@ i@@ ably le@@ ad to need@@ less human suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about moral@@ ity .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between na@@ tions mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ ented ; it will always be eas@@ ier to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more res@@ p@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in not@@ ions of human well-@@ being than we can res@@ p@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the not@@ ions about how disease sp@@ read@@ s , or in the saf@@ ety stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ din@@ gs and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ mit that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this audi@@ ence or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , he@@ aring some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women d@@ res@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve liv@@ ed in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , spo@@ ken with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a cel@@ eb@@ ration of f@@ em@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a res@@ ult of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arg@@ u@@ ably a soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated psych@@ ological view — &quot; that mal@@ e l@@ ust is not to be tr@@ ust@@ ed . &quot;"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Y@@ eah , well I think I tri@@ ed to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ch@@ ing the c@@ loc@@ k tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ex@@ t where men have certain expec@@ t@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or t@@ at@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to vol@@ un@@ t@@ ar@@ ily do wh@@ at@@ ever we want , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ aring a ful@@ l bur@@ q@@ a ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ sion@@ al , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ loc@@ k 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ cing moral progress with ri@@ ch@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mit that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important deta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ mit that we are going to understand all of the pos@@ itive and ne@@ ga@@ tive qu@@ alit@@ ies of ourselves in much gre@@ ater deta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand pos@@ itive social emo@@ tion like em@@ pa@@ thy and com@@ passion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic syst@@ ems , and in@@ sof@@ ar as we be@@ gin to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my dau@@ ghter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ f@@ id@@ ent and well-@@ educ@@ ated in the cont@@ ex@@ t of men who do des@@ ire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ ol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ te them .
Do people love their dau@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these syst@@ ems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your inst@@ in@@ c@@ tive curr@@ ent j@@ ud@@ g@@ ment on some of these issu@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mod@@ ul@@ o one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a tr@@ ul@@ y del@@ us@@ ion@@ al beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my ga@@ y son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most com@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts al@@ ign@@ ed , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-@@ being in a larg@@ er cont@@ ex@@ t ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then b@@ lowing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
