To@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expec@@ ted discover@@ ies .
Now I work in the sol@@ ar technology ind@@ u@@ str@@ y .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environ@@ ment by pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to ...
... pa@@ ying at@@ ten@@ tion to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ cing .
It &apos;s just a qu@@ ic@@ k video of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ an@@ g on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just sk@@ i@@ p — I &apos;ll just sk@@ i@@ p through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ us@@ ic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life h@@ ack , and all it requ@@ ir@@ es of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ dit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pa@@ y at@@ ten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re particul@@ arly interes@@ ted in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interes@@ ted in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mil@@ e , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ sh@@ ake ."
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : Here they are ar@@ riv@@ ing at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scient@@ ists — it &apos;s language , so we think about commun@@ ic@@ ation ."
"When we think about commun@@ ic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really mean@@ ing@@ ful life ou@@ t@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or pro@@ mo@@ te , who we ask out on a da@@ te ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a rese@@ arch@@ er at T@@ uf@@ ts Un@@ iver@@ sity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0-@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physic@@ ian@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their j@@ ud@@ g@@ ments of the physic@@ ian &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that physic@@ ian will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ gh@@ ts and our feel@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ ology ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psych@@ olog@@ ist . I study pre@@ j@@ ud@@ ice , and I te@@ ach at a comp@@ et@@ itive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interes@@ ted in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I bec@@ ame es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally interes@@ ted in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pr@@ ide , J@@ es@@ sic@@ a Tra@@ cy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really power@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t mir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ch@@ ing this behavior in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ omen feel ch@@ ron@@ ically less power@@ ful than men , so this is not sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business scho@@ ols have been st@@ ru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mil@@ e when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mil@@ e by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the power@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the power@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So power@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ f@@ id@@ ent , more op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at gam@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stress ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s domin@@ ant , high on tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one , but really stress re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shap@@ e the mind , at le@@ ast at the f@@ aci@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shap@@ e the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be sit@@ ting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ch@@ ing your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative sit@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ ga@@ in , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ kled ."
P@@ eople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these cod@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ th@@ esis . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ dit@@ ions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s driv@@ ing the ef@@ fect , or medi@@ ating the ef@@ fect ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it t@@ ill you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad c@@ ar acc@@ id@@ ent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a c@@ ar , ro@@ l@@ led s@@ ever@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the c@@ ar .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fied with being s@@ mart , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish college ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it t@@ ill you make it ."
F@@ ake it t@@ ill you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ ali@@ ze .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ e@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"@@ T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ t@@ is@@ ol down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that sit@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vid@@ ence , R@@ h@@ od@@ e I@@ sl@@ and to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ yed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ad@@ s through state par@@ ks and national for@@ es@@ ts — basically the lon@@ gest ro@@ ute we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My fri@@ end looks at me tot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a per@@ fect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sign@@ s we keep seeing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mo@@ ments , and then she cra@@ c@@ ks up , because she fig@@ ures out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the f@@ amo@@ us Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about sit@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sign@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might st@@ ri@@ ke you as a stran@@ ge career move , but it actually has one great adv@@ ant@@ age : no job comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ n fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at le@@ ast to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human spec@@ ies , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay fin@@ e ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the w@@ ind@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ot@@ e in the present ten@@ se .
"So effec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing through life , tra@@ pped in this little b@@ ub@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individ@@ ual@@ s , in our person@@ al and profes@@ sion@@ al lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ vin@@ ce you that it is possible to step outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est moral , intel@@ lec@@ tual and cre@@ ative le@@ a@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me ask you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to real@@ ize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ e@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my st@@ up@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese charac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remember that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ot@@ e who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never cat@@ ch@@ ing a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ od@@ e of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ lif@@ f , which is fin@@ e — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e run@@ s off the c@@ lif@@ f right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at le@@ ast if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ot@@ e &apos;s tot@@ ally fin@@ e too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and real@@ iz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we real@@ ize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ot@@ e after he &apos;s gone off the c@@ lif@@ f and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tro@@ ub@@ le , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tu@@ ral reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ ind@@ ness .
"M@@ o@@ st of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tu@@ ral .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sit@@ ting there in class , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qu@@ i@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not mine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ aper ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tro@@ ub@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his ho@@ me@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are l@@ az@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ si@@ ble di@@ m@@ w@@ its — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just becom@@ ing per@@ fect little A students , per@@ fec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ achi@@ ev@@ ers ."
"R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , astro@@ physic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , astro@@ physic@@ ists , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so fin@@ e ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ s@@ ist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel s@@ mart and respon@@ si@@ ble and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ ger@@ y ."
B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ o@@ st@@ on .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing ho@@ sp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best ho@@ sp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — st@@ it@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the rec@@ over@@ y room ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing seems to have gone fin@@ e .
"And she w@@ ak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ g@@ es ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ g@@ es because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vic@@ e pres@@ id@@ ent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el spo@@ ke about this in@@ c@@ id@@ ent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply fel@@ t that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ ust@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very dan@@ ger@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a rel@@ i@@ able gu@@ ide to what is actually going on in the ex@@ tern@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ p@@ ed@@ o@@ ing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a huge prac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ fec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disa@@ gre@@ e with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we us@@ u@@ ally do when someone disa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ign@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have acc@@ ess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still disa@@ gre@@ e with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re id@@ i@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ ec@@ es of the p@@ uz@@ z@@ le , and they are too mo@@ ron@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disa@@ gre@@ e with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty s@@ mart , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion : they know the tr@@ uth , and they are d@@ eli@@ ber@@ ately dis@@ t@@ or@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a c@@ atas@@ tro@@ p@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mis@@ takes when we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely need to and ca@@ uses us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing and most tra@@ g@@ ic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fec@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent w@@ indo@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same w@@ ind@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ ra@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his f@@ amo@@ us thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , sa@@ t down and w@@ ro@@ te &quot; &quot; F@@ al@@ lo@@ r er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing de@@ fect in the human system , something we can er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fundamental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ im@@ als , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to figure it out ."
"@@ To me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the s@@ our@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"@@ L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found my@@ self list@@ en@@ ing to a lot of ep@@ is@@ od@@ es of the P@@ ub@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m list@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lo@@ st it ."
I &apos;ve become the crazy w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , who &apos;s the ho@@ st of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ od@@ e of our show has the same c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ r@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mo@@ ments of sur@@ pr@@ ise and re@@ ver@@ sal and w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audi@@ ence mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and sur@@ pr@@ ise en@@ din@@ gs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .

And something else happened instead .

And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your ho@@ me@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writ@@ ing an incredi@@ bly ner@@ d@@ y book about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an audi@@ ence that would never mater@@ i@@ ali@@ ze .

"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."

"We just sp@@ ent an enti@@ re week talking about in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ cem@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents , but you know why we need all of those in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ cem@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing and wor@@ ld@@ -@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TE@@ D 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you gu@@ ys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ discover@@ y of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disc@@ over won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness and compl@@ ex@@ ity and my@@ ster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
Ma@@ ybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you gu@@ ys . ( Applause )
"Th@@ ese are simple ob@@ jects : c@@ loc@@ ks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , gl@@ as@@ ses ."
They are the things the vic@@ tim@@ s of gen@@ oc@@ ide in B@@ os@@ nia car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their fin@@ al j@@ our@@ ney .
"We are all famil@@ i@@ ar with these m@@ und@@ ane , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
The fact that some of the vic@@ tim@@ s car@@ ri@@ ed person@@ al it@@ ems such as to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te and a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h is a c@@ lear si@@ g@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for pris@@ on@@ ers of war ."
"Th@@ ese it@@ ems have been rec@@ over@@ ed from num@@ er@@ ous mass grav@@ es across my h@@ om@@ el@@ and , and as we spe@@ ak , for@@ en@@ sic@@ s are ex@@ hum@@ ing bo@@ dies from ne@@ w@@ ly discover@@ ed mass grav@@ es , 20 years after the war ."
And it is quite possi@@ bly the larg@@ est ever discover@@ ed .
"D@@ uring the four years of con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t that dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an na@@ tion in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely 3@@ 0,000 c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , main@@ ly civ@@ il@@ i@@ ans , went mis@@ sing , pre@@ sum@@ ed k@@ il@@ led , and another 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 were k@@ il@@ led d@@ uring com@@ b@@ at oper@@ ations ."
"M@@ o@@ st of them were k@@ il@@ led ei@@ ther in the early days of the war or to@@ wards the end of the ho@@ st@@ il@@ ities , when U.@@ N@@ . sa@@ fe z@@ ones like S@@ reb@@ ren@@ ic@@ a f@@ ell into the hands of the S@@ er@@ b ar@@ my ."
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ bun@@ al del@@ iver@@ ed a number of s@@ ent@@ ences for cri@@ m@@ es against hum@@ an@@ ity and gen@@ oc@@ ide .
"@@ G@@ en@@ oc@@ ide is a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic and d@@ eli@@ ber@@ ate des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion of a raci@@ al , political , relig@@ ious or e@@ th@@ n@@ ic group ."
A@@ s much as gen@@ oc@@ ide is about k@@ il@@ ling .
"It is also about des@@ tro@@ ying their pro@@ p@@ ert@@ y , their cul@@ tu@@ ral her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the very not@@ ion that they ever ex@@ is@@ ted ."
G@@ en@@ oc@@ ide is not only about the k@@ il@@ ling ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed id@@ ent@@ ity .
There are always tra@@ ces — no such thing as a per@@ fect cri@@ me .
"Th@@ ese it@@ ems are rec@@ over@@ ed from num@@ er@@ ous mass grav@@ es , and the ma@@ in go@@ al of this col@@ lec@@ tion of the it@@ ems is a un@@ i@@ qu@@ e process of id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying those who disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in the k@@ ill@@ ings , the first act of gen@@ oc@@ ide on Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an so@@ il since the H@@ olo@@ ca@@ ust ."
Not a single body should re@@ ma@@ in un@@ discover@@ ed or un@@ id@@ enti@@ fied .
"O@@ n@@ ce rec@@ over@@ ed , these it@@ ems that the vic@@ tim@@ s car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their way to ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion are care@@ fully c@@ le@@ an@@ ed , anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed , cat@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ ed and st@@ ored ."
Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds of ar@@ ti@@ fac@@ ts are p@@ ac@@ ked in white pl@@ as@@ tic b@@ ag@@ s just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
"Th@@ ese ob@@ jects are used as a for@@ en@@ si@@ c to@@ ol in vis@@ ual id@@ enti@@ fic@@ ation of the vic@@ tim@@ s , but they are also used as very val@@ u@@ able for@@ en@@ si@@ c evidence in the on@@ going war cri@@ m@@ es tri@@ als ."
"S@@ ur@@ v@@ iv@@ ors are oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally called to try to id@@ enti@@ f@@ y these it@@ ems physic@@ ally , but physical bro@@ w@@ sing is extre@@ m@@ ely difficult , an in@@ effec@@ tive and pain@@ ful process ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the for@@ en@@ sic@@ s and doc@@ tors and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers are done with these ob@@ jects , they become or@@ ph@@ ans of the nar@@ ra@@ tive ."
"M@@ any of them get des@@ tro@@ yed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of sight and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to ph@@ ot@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ e@@ m in order to create a vis@@ ual arch@@ ive that surviv@@ ors could eas@@ ily bro@@ w@@ se .
"As a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er , I like to give back to the commun@@ ity ."
I like to move be@@ y@@ ond ra@@ is@@ ing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"And in this case , someone may reco@@ gni@@ ze these it@@ ems or at le@@ ast their ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ s will re@@ ma@@ in as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed and ac@@ cu@@ rate re@@ min@@ der of what happened ."
"P@@ h@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ y is about em@@ pa@@ thy , and the famil@@ iar@@ ity of these it@@ ems gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"In this case , I am mer@@ ely a to@@ ol , a for@@ en@@ si@@ c , if you like , and the res@@ ult is a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph@@ y that is as clo@@ se as possible of being a doc@@ um@@ ent ."
"O@@ n@@ ce all the mis@@ sing per@@ s@@ ons are id@@ enti@@ fied , only dec@@ a@@ ying bo@@ dies in their grav@@ es and these every@@ day it@@ ems will re@@ ma@@ in ."
"In all their sim@@ plic@@ ity , these it@@ ems are the last t@@ est@@ am@@ ent to the id@@ ent@@ ity of the vic@@ tim@@ s , the last per@@ man@@ ent re@@ min@@ der that these people ever ex@@ is@@ ted ."
Thank you very much .

I am for ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ ate don@@ ut@@ s .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ ro@@ us before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"In 19@@ 7@@ 5 , when I was seven years old , women in I@@ cel@@ and went on a st@@ ri@@ ke ."
They mar@@ ched into the center of R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k — 90 percent of women par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated — and pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly and in sol@@ id@@ ar@@ ity asked for equality .
"@@ N@@ o@@ thing worked in I@@ cel@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work ."
"I will never for@@ get this day , that P@@ res@@ id@@ ent V@@ ig@@ d@@ í@@ s , as we know her by her first name , ste@@ pped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mo@@ m with her dau@@ ghter by her side as she had won ."
"( Applause ) This woman was an incredi@@ ble ro@@ le mo@@ del for me and everyone gro@@ wing up at that time , incl@@ ud@@ ing bo@@ ys ."
"She f@@ requ@@ ently shar@@ es the story of how a young bo@@ y appro@@ ach@@ ed her after a couple of terms in off@@ ice and asked , &quot; &quot; C@@ an bo@@ ys really grow up to be pres@@ id@@ ent ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ole mod@@ els really matter , but even with such st@@ rong ro@@ le mod@@ els who I am so gra@@ te@@ ful for , when I was en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to run for pres@@ id@@ ent , my first re@@ action was , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I to run for pres@@ id@@ ent ?"
Wh@@ o am I to be pres@@ id@@ ent ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consid@@ er run@@ ning than men .
"So a study done in the U@@ S in 20@@ 11 sho@@ wed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had consid@@ er@@ ed run@@ ning for off@@ ice , but 4@@ 5 percent of women ."
"That &apos;s ga@@ p of 1@@ 6 per@@ cent@@ age poin@@ ts , and it &apos;s the same ga@@ p that ex@@ is@@ ted a dec@@ ade ear@@ li@@ er ."
And it was the j@@ our@@ ney of my life .
It was amazing .
The j@@ our@@ ney started with po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally as many as 20 can@@ di@@ da@@ t@@ es .
"It bo@@ il@@ ed down to n@@ ine can@@ di@@ da@@ t@@ es qu@@ al@@ if@@ ying , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the ra@@ ce came down to four of us , three men and me ."
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dra@@ ma yet .
Th@@ en later he changed his mind when our pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter re@@ sign@@ ed fol@@ lowing the in@@ f@@ amo@@ us P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ ap@@ ers that im@@ plic@@ ated him and his family .
"And there was a popul@@ ar pro@@ test in I@@ cel@@ and , so the sit@@ ting pres@@ id@@ ent thought they needed a tr@@ ust@@ ed lead@@ er ."
"So on M@@ ay 9 , 4@@ 5 days before elec@@ tion day , it was not looking too good for me ."
I did not even make the gra@@ p@@ h in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper .
"The pol@@ ls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the high@@ est that any woman an@@ n@@ oun@@ cing her can@@ di@@ da@@ cy had ear@@ ned ."
"So it would be an underst@@ at@@ ement to say that I had to work extre@@ m@@ ely hard to get my se@@ at at the table and acc@@ ess to tel@@ ev@@ ision , because the n@@ et@@ work decided that they would only incl@@ u@@ de those with 2@@ .@@ 5 percent or more in the pol@@ ls in the first T@@ V deb@@ ate ."
"I found out on the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on of the first T@@ V deb@@ ate that I would par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate along with the three men , and I found out on live T@@ V that I came in at exactly 2@@ .@@ 5 percent on the day of the first T@@ V deb@@ ate ."
"( Applause ) So , chall@@ eng@@ es ."
"The for@@ e@@ most chall@@ eng@@ es I had to face and over@@ come on this j@@ our@@ ney had to do with me@@ dia , mus@@ cle and money ."
Let &apos;s start with me@@ dia .
There are those who say gen@@ der doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to me@@ dia and polit@@ ics .
It pro@@ ved har@@ der for me to both get acc@@ ess and air@@ time in me@@ dia .
And I am not saying me@@ dia is doing this conscious@@ ly .
"But me@@ dia really mat@@ ters , and every time I ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed on T@@ V , we saw and experien@@ ced a r@@ ise in the pol@@ ls , so I know fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this mat@@ ters and why we have to talk about it ."
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other can@@ di@@ da@@ t@@ es and out of c@@ over@@ age about the elec@@ tions .
I got few if any com@@ ments about my ha@@ ir and pan@@ ts@@ u@@ it .
( Applause ) So k@@ u@@ do@@ s to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
"When acc@@ ess to me@@ dia pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we ra@@ n our own me@@ dia ."
I ra@@ n live F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok s@@ es@@ sions where I took questions from v@@ ot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the spo@@ t .
"And when re@@ ach@@ ing young v@@ ot@@ ers pro@@ ved to be chall@@ eng@@ ing , I bec@@ ame a S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at@@ ter ."
"I got young people to te@@ ach me how to do that , and I used every fil@@ ter on S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at d@@ uring the last part of the cam@@ pa@@ ign ."
"And I actually had to use a lot of hu@@ mo@@ r and hum@@ il@@ ity , as I was very bad at it ."
But we gre@@ w the fol@@ lowing amo@@ n@@ g@@ st young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different typ@@ e of cam@@ pa@@ ign .
"But un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , one cannot talk about polit@@ ics without men@@ tion@@ ing money ."
"I am sad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al resour@@ ces than the other can@@ di@@ da@@ t@@ es ."
This probably was par@@ tly d@@ ue to the fact that I think I had a har@@ der time as@@ king for fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al sup@@ port .
And maybe I also had the amb@@ ition to do more with less .
S@@ ome would call that very w@@ om@@ an@@ ly of me .
"But even with one third the me@@ dia , one third the fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al resour@@ ces , and only an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ial te@@ am , but an amazing te@@ am , we man@@ ag@@ ed to sur@@ pr@@ ise everyone on elec@@ tion night , when the first numbers came in ."
"I sur@@ pris@@ ed my@@ self , as you may see in that ph@@ ot@@ o ."
"( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in nec@@ k to nec@@ k to the lead@@ ing can@@ di@@ da@@ te ."
"( C@@ he@@ ers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pul@@ l that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with ne@@ arly a third of the v@@ ot@@ e , and we be@@ at the pol@@ ls by an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented mar@@ gin , or 10 per@@ cent@@ age poin@@ ts ab@@ ove what the last po@@ ll came in at ."
"S@@ ome people call me the real w@@ in@@ ner of the elec@@ tion because of this , and there are many people who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed me to run again ."
"( Applause ) She is 1@@ 3 , and she had never been on T@@ V before ."
"And on elec@@ tion day , I observ@@ ed her on T@@ V re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , and she was s@@ mart , she was self-@@ con@@ f@@ id@@ ent , she was sin@@ c@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother ."
This was probably the high@@ light of my cam@@ pa@@ ign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
A@@ u@@ di@@ ence : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a w@@ in for me .
"What we see , we can be ."
So scre@@ w fear and chall@@ eng@@ es .
"( Applause ) It mat@@ ters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for off@@ ice , be it the off@@ ice of the C@@ E@@ O or the off@@ ice of the pres@@ id@@ ent ."
"I also man@@ ag@@ ed to put an im@@ pres@@ sion on your very own &quot; &quot; New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new tit@@ le , &quot; &quot; A living emo@@ j@@ i of sin@@ cer@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( C@@ he@@ ers ) It is possi@@ bly my pro@@ ud@@ est tit@@ le yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ aliz@@ ed for using what I call their emo@@ tional cap@@ ital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that ."
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
"We cel@@ eb@@ ra@@ ted as if we had won on elec@@ tion night , because that &apos;s how we fel@@ t ."
So you don &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have to re@@ ach that off@@ ice .
"You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow be@@ y@@ ond anything you will experience before ."
"So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this j@@ our@@ ney , probably more l@@ ess@@ ons than I can share here in the time we have today ."
"But rest as@@ su@@ red , it was hard work ."
I lo@@ st a lot of s@@ le@@ ep d@@ uring those months .
"It took res@@ il@@ i@@ ence and per@@ s@@ ever@@ ance to not qu@@ it , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are tr@@ ul@@ y , au@@ th@@ en@@ tically list@@ en@@ ing to your own vo@@ ice and working in al@@ ign@@ ment with that ."
"As a good sis@@ ter of mine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your in@@ tu@@ ition , but your in@@ tu@@ ition never che@@ at@@ s on you ."
"As a matter of fact , the lead@@ ing P@@ R exper@@ t told me before I made my dec@@ ision that I would do well to get seven percent ."
"I app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated his per@@ spec@@ tive , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on val@@ u@@ able experience ."
"It &apos;s very important to men@@ tion this , because I did lo@@ se a lot of s@@ le@@ ep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me ."
"I took a lot of sup@@ port from others in doing this , and I made the dec@@ ision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s par@@ tly how I ke@@ pt my energy going throu@@ gh@@ out all of this ."
"I called it a 4@@ G cam@@ pa@@ ign , the G &apos;s re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c words ."
"S@@ econ@@ d one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or jo@@ y ."
I decided to en@@ jo@@ y the j@@ our@@ ney .
"I ke@@ pt no sec@@ re@@ ts , and it was all open , on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ o@@ ok and w@@ eb@@ sit@@ es ."
"@@ L@@ ast but not le@@ ast , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ra@@ n on the princi@@ ple of G@@ ir@@ l@@ power ."
"I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my enti@@ re te@@ am will ag@@ ree with me , that it was wor@@ th it ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : I &apos;m not l@@ etting you go yet . H@@ al@@ la T@@ ó@@ mas@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ ti@@ r : What a great c@@ ro@@ w@@ d . P@@ M : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
"And then what you may not know because our American me@@ dia did not re@@ port it , the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women wal@@ ked out again on M@@ on@@ day . R@@ ight ?"
"H@@ T : Y@@ es , they did . P@@ M : C@@ an you tell us about that ?"
"H@@ T : Y@@ es , so 4@@ 1 years after the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al st@@ ri@@ ke , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done ."
( Applause )
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my career since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ou@@ se , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ d@@ y , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pres@@ id@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great bl@@ ess@@ ing as a form@@ er pres@@ id@@ ent , because I have had an acc@@ ess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I famil@@ i@@ ar with the 50 st@@ ates in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vis@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l-@@ time program@@ s in 80 na@@ tions on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pres@@ id@@ ent , but we also me@@ et the vill@@ ag@@ ers who live in the most re@@ mo@@ te are@@ as of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ."
"So our over@@ all com@@ mit@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pro@@ mo@@ te human ri@@ gh@@ ts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ iv@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ gh@@ ts on Earth is , str@@ ang@@ ely , not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to be@@ gin with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of relig@@ ious sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ ible , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ ura@@ n and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant pos@@ it@@ ions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the mos@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these rul@@ es to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily rel@@ e@@ ga@@ ted to a secon@@ dar@@ y position com@@ par@@ ed to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very ser@@ ious problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 2@@ 000 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist for 7@@ 0 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ un@@ day school every S@@ un@@ day ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ un@@ day as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 2@@ 000 decided that women should play a secon@@ dar@@ y position , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent position to men ."
"So they issu@@ ed an ed@@ ic@@ t , in ef@@ fect , that pre@@ v@@ ents women from being pri@@ es@@ ts , pas@@ tors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or ch@@ ap@@ la@@ ins in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a clas@@ s@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist s@@ em@@ in@@ ary , they cannot te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the B@@ ible , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the B@@ ible , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the bas@@ ic thing is the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant position .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ ive problem , because men can ex@@ ert that power and if an ab@@ us@@ ive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als my@@ self ?"
"The other very ser@@ ious b@@ light that ca@@ uses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ or@@ t to violence , and that is increas@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for inst@@ ance , we have had an en@@ or@@ mo@@ us increase in ab@@ use of po@@ or people , mo@@ st@@ ly black people and min@@ or@@ ities , by put@@ ting them in pris@@ on ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ gia , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pris@@ on ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ada@@ ys , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pris@@ on ."
That &apos;s a s@@ even@@ f@@ old increase .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ us@@ ive in all el@@ em@@ ents of human ri@@ gh@@ ts in en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia now , and I fig@@ ured out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia has sp@@ ent four billion dollars in con@@ vic@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the death pen@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it co@@ st@@ s C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed ."
"@@ N@@ eb@@ ra@@ sk@@ a this week just pas@@ sed a la@@ w ab@@ oli@@ sh@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty , because it co@@ st@@ s so much . ( Applause ) So the res@@ or@@ t to violence and ab@@ use of po@@ or people and hel@@ pl@@ ess people is another cause of the increase in ab@@ use of women ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ uses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a li@@ mit@@ ed amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation .
"@@ G@@ en@@ ital m@@ ut@@ il@@ ation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a gir@@ l , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely c@@ ut away by a so@@ -@@ called c@@ ut@@ ter who has a ra@@ z@@ or bl@@ ade and , in a n@@ on@@ -@@ ster@@ iliz@@ ed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ ter@@ ior parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me cas@@ es but not very r@@ are cas@@ es , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the gir@@ l can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ st@@ ru@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets marri@@ ed , the same c@@ ut@@ ter goes in and op@@ ens the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have sex ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the f@@ em@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been s@@ ex@@ u@@ ally m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are c@@ ut that way before they re@@ ach mat@@ ur@@ ity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble af@@ fl@@ ic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very ser@@ ious thing is h@@ on@@ or k@@ ill@@ ings , where a family with mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation , again , of a ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ ura@@ n that man@@ da@@ t@@ es this — will ex@@ ec@@ ute a gir@@ l in their family if she is ra@@ ped or if she marri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she we@@ ars in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate clo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family becom@@ es m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the gir@@ l br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ y@@ sis was done in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it sho@@ wed that 7@@ 5 percent of these m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers of a gir@@ l are per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ ted by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers are conduc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women particul@@ arly is sl@@ aver@@ y , or human tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ada@@ ys ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people s@@ old from A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a into sl@@ aver@@ y in the New W@@ or@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in sl@@ aver@@ y .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a man@@ da@@ te from Con@@ g@@ ress to give a re@@ port every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are s@@ old across inter@@ national bor@@ d@@ ers every year into sl@@ aver@@ y , and that 80 percent of those s@@ old are women , into s@@ ex@@ ual sl@@ aver@@ y ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ da@@ ge , or sl@@ aver@@ y ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y Un@@ iver@@ sity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people s@@ old into sl@@ aver@@ y every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the na@@ tion because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to buy a gir@@ l that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned gir@@ l br@@ ings s@@ ever@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per sl@@ ave ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia , ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ s the tot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , G@@ e@@ or@@ gia ."
"So this is another very ser@@ ious problem , and the bas@@ ic problem is pro@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ or@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se in America that &apos;s not known by the loc@@ al of@@ fic@@ i@@ als , the loc@@ al pol@@ ic@@ em@@ en , or the ch@@ i@@ ef of pol@@ ice or the ma@@ yo@@ r and so for@@ th ."
"And this lead@@ s to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ou@@ ght increas@@ ing@@ ly and put into s@@ ex@@ ual sl@@ aver@@ y in all countries in the world ."
S@@ w@@ ed@@ en has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ w@@ ed@@ en decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed if they are in s@@ ex@@ ual sl@@ aver@@ y , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the mal@@ e cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , and — ( Applause ) — pro@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed for il@@ le@@ ga@@ l sex tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ ada , I@@ rel@@ and , I &apos;ve already said S@@ w@@ ed@@ en , F@@ ran@@ ce , and other countries are mov@@ ing now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ w@@ ed@@ ish mo@@ del ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great inst@@ it@@ u@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ mi@@ re : our mil@@ it@@ ary and our great univer@@ sity system .
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing how many s@@ ex@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults take place ."
"The last re@@ port I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 s@@ ex@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults that took place in the mil@@ it@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ ion in the A@@ r@@ my or a compan@@ y in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to dec@@ ide whether to pro@@ sec@@ ute a ra@@ p@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their com@@ m@@ and , s@@ ex@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"The D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce says that more than half of the ra@@ p@@ es on a college cam@@ p@@ us take place by ser@@ ial ra@@ p@@ ists , because outside of the univer@@ sity system , if they ra@@ p@@ e somebody , they &apos;ll be pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed , but when they get on a univer@@ sity cam@@ p@@ us , they can ra@@ p@@ e with im@@ p@@ un@@ ity ."
They &apos;re not pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ed .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ ious about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al pa@@ y for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l-@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I bec@@ ame pres@@ id@@ ent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some progress , par@@ ti@@ ally because I was pres@@ id@@ ent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like na@@ tion on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground f@@ igh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head dro@@ p@@ ping bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dro@@ nes that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ or@@ t to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pret@@ ation of the ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ uses , are the bas@@ ic ca@@ uses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a dam@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the p@@ riv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed position that we oc@@ c@@ up@@ y , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had ex@@ is@@ ted ."
"R@@ aci@@ al dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , le@@ g@@ ally , had ex@@ is@@ ted for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ et@@ ween the States , the C@@ iv@@ il W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son got the bil@@ ls pas@@ sed for equ@@ al ri@@ gh@@ ts ."
"But d@@ uring that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that raci@@ al dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation was o@@ kay , but they st@@ ay@@ ed qu@@ iet , because they en@@ jo@@ yed the p@@ riv@@ il@@ eg@@ es of better j@@ obs , un@@ i@@ qu@@ e acc@@ ess to j@@ ury d@@ ut@@ y , better scho@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that ex@@ ists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a p@@ riv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed position ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the univer@@ sity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mil@@ it@@ ary system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great relig@@ ions ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her dau@@ gh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally m@@ ut@@ il@@ ated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to deta@@ il about that .
"I have 12 grand@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they liv@@ ed in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or a for@@ e@@ ign country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ gh@@ ts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on for women and girls around the world and pro@@ t@@ ect their human ri@@ gh@@ ts ."
Thank you very much .

"When I was a stud@@ ent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ le@@ ak ."
The population explo@@ sion was un@@ st@@ op@@ p@@ able .
G@@ lob@@ al fam@@ ine was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
A cancer ep@@ ide@@ mic ca@@ used by chem@@ ic@@ als in the environ@@ ment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .

"The o@@ il was run@@ ning out , and a n@@ uc@@ lear w@@ in@@ ter would fin@@ ish us off ."

L@@ if@@ es@@ p@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
Ch@@ il@@ d mo@@ rt@@ ality is down by tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds .

And all this at a time when the population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
"@@ How did we achi@@ eve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we achi@@ eve that ?
How did we become the only spec@@ ies that becom@@ es more pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous as it becom@@ es more popul@@ ous ?
"The size of the blo@@ b in this gra@@ p@@ h re@@ pres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the gra@@ p@@ h re@@ pres@@ ents G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to com@@ b@@ ine and re@@ com@@ b@@ ine , to me@@ et and , inde@@ ed , to mate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making ob@@ jects like this to making ob@@ jects like this .
These are both real ob@@ jects .
One is an A@@ ch@@ e@@ ul@@ e@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ t@@ us .
The other is ob@@ vi@@ ously a computer mo@@ use .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shap@@ e to an un@@ can@@ n@@ y de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to work out which is big@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both des@@ ign@@ ed to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both tech@@ nologi@@ es . I@@ n the end , their si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just tel@@ ls you they were both des@@ ign@@ ed to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying des@@ ign for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ t@@ us made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but to@@ ols changed s@@ lower than sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no progress , no in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the object on the right is ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"The object on the right is made from a con@@ fec@@ tion of different sub@@ stan@@ ces , from sil@@ ic@@ on and met@@ al and pl@@ as@@ tic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ fec@@ tion of different ideas , the idea of pl@@ as@@ tic , the idea of a las@@ er , the idea of trans@@ ist@@ ors ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ bin@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the sec@@ ret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"M@@ y body &apos;s an acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"@@ How does evolution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it uses s@@ ex@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ ual spec@@ ies , if you get two different m@@ ut@@ ations in different cre@@ atures , a gre@@ en one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t for the other to surv@@ ive .
"But if you have a s@@ ex@@ ual spec@@ ies , then it &apos;s possible for an individ@@ ual to in@@ her@@ it both m@@ ut@@ ations from different lin@@ e@@ ages ."
So what sex does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individ@@ ual to dra@@ w u@@ po@@ n the gen@@ e@@ tic in@@ no@@ v@@ ations of the whole spec@@ ies .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same ef@@ fect in cul@@ tu@@ ral evolution as sex is having in bi@@ ological evolution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the h@@ ab@@ it of ex@@ chang@@ ing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a un@@ i@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ ature .
No other an@@ ima@@ l does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the labo@@ rat@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and inde@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ity in other an@@ im@@ als — But the ex@@ change of one object for another never happens .
"As A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture ."
"@@ Ch@@ impanze@@ es , k@@ ill@@ er wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ atures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other t@@ rad@@ it@@ ions which are h@@ and@@ ed down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ impanze@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cra@@ c@@ k n@@ ut@@ s with roc@@ ks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never grow , never acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ impanze@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stan@@ dar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ av@@ id R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ da@@ m takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than A@@ da@@ m .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ da@@ m .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ da@@ m make two ax@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sav@@ ed an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ da@@ m is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the be@@ au@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mo@@ men@@ tum for more speci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mo@@ men@@ tum for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ da@@ m and O@@ z both sav@@ ed an h@@ our of time .
"That is pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity , the sav@@ ing of time in sat@@ is@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to pro@@ v@@ ide for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this even@@ ing to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ rat@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a she@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the average w@@ age in Brit@@ ain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight secon@@ ds on the average w@@ age to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or ser@@ vic@@ e ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the average w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the average person on the average w@@ age could not af@@ for@@ d a c@@ and@@ le in 18@@ 00 ."
"@@ G@@ o back to this imag@@ e of the ax@@ e and the mo@@ use , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one ax@@ e was made by someone for h@@ im@@ self ."
It was self-@@ suf@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cy .
We call that pov@@ ert@@ y these days .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ und@@ re@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ san@@ ds ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably mil@@ lions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to incl@@ u@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the o@@ il ri@@ g , who was dr@@ il@@ ling for o@@ il , which was going to be made into the pl@@ as@@ tic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a mo@@ use for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed as a spec@@ ies .
"In the old days , if you were r@@ ich , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be r@@ ich ; you emp@@ lo@@ yed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly ou@@ t@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly h@@ air@@ st@@ y@@ les , or wh@@ at@@ ever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his din@@ ner every night .
"But a moder@@ n t@@ our@@ ist going around the p@@ al@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ il@@ les and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner t@@ on@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in b@@ is@@ tro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ an@@ ts and sh@@ op@@ s all over P@@ aris , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s not@@ ice with an ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w u@@ po@@ n speci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stan@@ dar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other an@@ im@@ als working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a clas@@ si@@ c example ; work@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for work@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive div@@ ision of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ ali@@ ze with res@@ p@@ ect to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our spec@@ ies , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ s@@ ist on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in Engl@@ and , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this h@@ ab@@ it start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is probably the s@@ ex@@ ual div@@ ision of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work mal@@ e for f@@ em@@ ale and f@@ em@@ ale for mal@@ e .
"In all h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er societies today , there &apos;s a fo@@ ra@@ ging div@@ ision of lab@@ or between , on the whole , h@@ un@@ ting mal@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between speci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for mal@@ es and f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
And the be@@ aut@@ y of this system is that it ben@@ ef@@ its both sid@@ es .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ a@@ d@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — dig@@ ging ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get acc@@ ess to pro@@ te@@ in is to di@@ g some extra ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ing h@@ un@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any dig@@ ging to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he k@@ il@@ ls a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both sid@@ es ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stan@@ dar@@ ds of living through the s@@ ex@@ ual div@@ ision of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative spec@@ ies .
They were a high@@ ly intelli@@ gent spec@@ ies .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on average , by the end , were big@@ ger than your@@ s and mine in this room today ."
They were imag@@ in@@ ative . They bur@@ i@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was discover@@ ed here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ il@@ ls .
They were br@@ il@@ li@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a s@@ ex@@ ual div@@ ision of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no evidence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavior by f@@ em@@ al@@ es .
It looks like the f@@ em@@ al@@ es were co@@ oper@@ ative h@@ un@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is ex@@ change between gro@@ ups , because the ob@@ jects that you find in N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from loc@@ al mater@@ i@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ auc@@ as@@ us there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find loc@@ al N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from loc@@ al ch@@ ert .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are moder@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same da@@ te , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from loc@@ al ch@@ ert , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ sid@@ ian from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings be@@ gan mov@@ ing ob@@ jects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ chang@@ ing between gro@@ ups ."
Tra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ m@@ ing .
P@@ eople for@@ get that . P@@ eople think of tra@@ de as a moder@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between gro@@ ups has been going on for a hundred thou@@ s@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est evidence for it c@@ rop@@ s up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , when you see ob@@ sid@@ ian and j@@ as@@ per and other things mov@@ ing long dis@@ tan@@ ces in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ ash@@ el@@ ls — as discover@@ ed by a te@@ am here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — mov@@ ing 1@@ 25 mil@@ es in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an in A@@ l@@ ger@@ ia .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ chang@@ ing between gro@@ ups .
And that will have led to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ dis@@ tan@@ ce mov@@ ement means tra@@ de rather than mi@@ gra@@ tion ?
"Well , you look at moder@@ n h@@ un@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ or@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ ad@@ o@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They t@@ rad@@ ed them with their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gra@@ y bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence was that st@@ one ax@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of A@@ ust@@ ral@@ ia ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ dis@@ tan@@ ce mov@@ ement of to@@ ols is a si@@ g@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gra@@ tion ."
"What happens when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ ali@@ ze ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down technolo@@ g@@ ical progress , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ ver@@ se ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the se@@ a level ro@@ se and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia bec@@ ame an is@@ land 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only experien@@ ced s@@ lower progress than people on the main@@ land , they actually experien@@ ced re@@ g@@ ress ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and fi@@ sh@@ ing equ@@ ip@@ ment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to main@@ tain the speci@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ il@@ ls nec@@ ess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ ert is@@ land .
"@@ How many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ket@@ s could we contin@@ ue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ ier@@ ra del F@@ u@@ e@@ go — si@@ mil@@ ar is@@ land , si@@ mil@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ ier@@ ra del F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ ou@@ th America by a much nar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ ight , and there was t@@ rad@@ ing cont@@ act across that stra@@ ight throu@@ gh@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"@@ G@@ o back to this imag@@ e again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer mo@@ use ?
"@@ N@@ ob@@ ody , liter@@ ally nob@@ ody ."
There is nob@@ ody on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer mo@@ use .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pres@@ id@@ ent of the computer mo@@ use compan@@ y doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a compan@@ y .
"The person on the as@@ s@@ em@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dr@@ ill an o@@ il well to get o@@ il out to make pl@@ as@@ tic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a f@@ amo@@ us es@@ say by L@@ e@@ on@@ ard R@@ e@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he w@@ ro@@ te about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how nob@@ ody kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ s@@ em@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to mine graph@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ fer ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ ond our cap@@ abil@@ ities ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ y@@ ond the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interes@@ ted in the deb@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some gro@@ ups have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other gro@@ ups ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
"What &apos;s rel@@ ev@@ ant to a society is how well people are commun@@ ic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cl@@ ever the individ@@ ual@@ s are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the col@@ lec@@ tive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the n@@ et@@ work .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ et@@ ing and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using technolo@@ g@@ ical progress , incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ ward , we will , of course , experience ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be w@@ ars ; there will be depres@@ sions ; there will be natural disa@@ st@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connec@@ tions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and ther@@ e@@ fore living stan@@ dar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d s@@ our@@ cing , through the bot@@ t@@ om@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ it@@ es but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and mate , we are sur@@ ely ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the rate of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
Thank you .

"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ p@@ riv@@ ed women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"@@ T@@ wo@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five st@@ it@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I be@@ gan the j@@ our@@ ney of re@@ discover@@ ing the value of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I me@@ t with me@@ d@@ ical doc@@ tors , scient@@ ists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more insp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new revolu@@ tion , this new f@@ em@@ in@@ ist issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation has become a vir@@ il@@ ity sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ g@@ g@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I fel@@ t like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I fel@@ t like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast da@@ te , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a ga@@ me of ten@@ nis in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tr@@ uth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ il@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in polit@@ ics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble dec@@ is@@ ions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ eb@@ er@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ is@@ ters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sis@@ ter would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g , because she would have wo@@ ken up from a s@@ even@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple c@@ ris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a person@@ al level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ tit@@ u@@ de , effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disc@@ over the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your en@@ gin@@ es and disc@@ over the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .

"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the func@@ tions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ ute about what this ent@@ a@@ ils .
"@@ Here is this mass of jel@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ po@@ und mass of jel@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ as@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ l@@ ar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate itself con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating on the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ lo@@ gy , and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ ster@@ ious or@@ gan ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of pro@@ to@@ pl@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity em@@ er@@ g@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of abil@@ ities that we call human nature and human consciousness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the func@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ st@@ ain@@ ed da@@ mag@@ e to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard reduc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ gn@@ itive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive lo@@ ss of one func@@ tion , with other func@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved in@@ t@@ act , and this giv@@ es you some con@@ f@@ idence in as@@ s@@ ert@@ ing that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ ol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that func@@ tion ."
"So you can then map func@@ tion on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular func@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few st@@ ri@@ king exam@@ pl@@ es of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ pl@@ es , six minutes each , d@@ uring this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sl@@ ide there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral lob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the tem@@ po@@ ral lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer reco@@ gni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still reco@@ gni@@ ze them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , that &apos;s J@@ o@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even reco@@ gni@@ ze yourself in the mir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it w@@ in@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really reco@@ gni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me is well known as ca@@ used by da@@ mag@@ e to the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physic@@ i@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ log@@ ists ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s del@@ us@@ ion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fec@@ tly l@@ u@@ ci@@ d and intelli@@ gent in all other res@@ pec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his del@@ us@@ ion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psych@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ext@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ dian view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same argum@@ ent app@@ li@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ ab@@ y , a young b@@ ab@@ y , you had a st@@ rong s@@ ex@@ ual at@@ trac@@ tion to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us compl@@ ex of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ dian view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ h@@ ib@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent s@@ ex@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be s@@ ex@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , al@@ lowing these l@@ at@@ ent s@@ ex@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ ex@@ plic@@ ably you find yourself being s@@ ex@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being s@@ ex@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pret@@ ation that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this argum@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ ious , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ dian argum@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same del@@ us@@ ion , a pati@@ ent having the same del@@ us@@ ion , about his p@@ et po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ if@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ if@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ dian ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cur@@ ious dis@@ order , we look at the structure and func@@ tions of the nor@@ mal vis@@ ual pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ Nor@@ m@@ ally , vis@@ ual sign@@ als come in , into the ey@@ eb@@ all@@ s , go to the vis@@ ual are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vis@@ ion , and after proc@@ ess@@ ing all that , the mes@@ sa@@ ge goes to a small structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ sit@@ ive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you lo@@ se the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the mes@@ sa@@ ge cas@@ c@@ ades into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala in the lim@@ b@@ ic system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , gau@@ g@@ es the emo@@ tional si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ da@@ tor ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely tr@@ iv@@ ial , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ign@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es then cas@@ c@@ ade into the aut@@ on@@ omi@@ c nerv@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ mine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ ute .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the vis@@ ual are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ ess@@ ed in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you reco@@ gni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the mes@@ sa@@ ge cas@@ c@@ ades into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the aut@@ on@@ omi@@ c nerv@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala to the lim@@ b@@ ic system , the emo@@ tional cor@@ e of the brain , is c@@ ut by the acc@@ id@@ ent ."
"So because the f@@ us@@ i@@ form is in@@ t@@ act , the cha@@ p can still reco@@ gni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is c@@ ut to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ ex@@ plic@@ able l@@ ack of emo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some stran@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and measure your gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an object , like a table or an um@@ br@@ el@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measure his gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"@@ T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vis@@ ual are@@ as to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vis@@ ion is nor@@ mal because the vis@@ ual are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his emo@@ tions are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll l@@ au@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vis@@ ion to emo@@ tions is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this del@@ us@@ ion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a biz@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , ne@@ ural psych@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me and say that the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ dian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a prec@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ ural an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no del@@ us@@ ion through the ph@@ one ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the he@@ aring cen@@ ters in the brain to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the acc@@ id@@ ent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the ph@@ one he reco@@ gni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this compl@@ ex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consid@@ ering another cur@@ ious sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ put@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ put@@ ated , for gan@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you lo@@ se it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ ious problem — you contin@@ ue to v@@ ivid@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vis@@ cer@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the ut@@ er@@ us re@@ mov@@ ed — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ t@@ om@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom ut@@ er@@ us , incl@@ ud@@ ing ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ st@@ ru@@ al c@@ ram@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for scientific en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we hav@@ en &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ a@@ im that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the ph@@ one when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll w@@ ave go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ el@@ ling , v@@ iv@@ id sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not del@@ us@@ ion@@ al .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be rel@@ i@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an oxy@@ mo@@ ro@@ n .
"But when we were looking at the case she@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was s@@ ever@@ ed , was c@@ ut , by say , a mo@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ cle acc@@ id@@ ent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ided at@@ tem@@ pt to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ put@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ ious cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are driv@@ en to su@@ ic@@ ide , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case she@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for s@@ ever@@ al months before the am@@ put@@ ation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ t@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ n@@ s , because of this H@@ eb@@ b@@ ian , as@@ soci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the mere com@@ m@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ put@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis car@@ ri@@ es over into your body imag@@ e and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , so you can rel@@ i@@ eve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the com@@ m@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vis@@ ual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s ob@@ ey@@ ing his com@@ m@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can rel@@ i@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ tom c@@ ram@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that co@@ st@@ s mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my f@@ und@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a mir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ put@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ ch@@ ial av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ put@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent put@@ s his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being resur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been resur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vis@@ ual im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is mov@@ ing , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mov@@ ing again , and the pa@@ in , the cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m , is rel@@ i@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok at your re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started g@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not st@@ up@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a v@@ iv@@ id sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mov@@ ing again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being rel@@ i@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lo@@ se your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , open your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , oh my G@@ od , it &apos;s mov@@ ing again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a c@@ and@@ y stor@@ e ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis and the c@@ rit@@ ical ro@@ le of vis@@ ual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ ob@@ el P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started real@@ iz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ sis that you see in neuro@@ lo@@ gy , like st@@ ro@@ ke , foc@@ al d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ ias — there may be a learned com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a mir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mir@@ ro@@ r to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and prac@@ ti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a peri@@ od of prac@@ ti@@ ce , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and start mov@@ ing your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , rel@@ i@@ eve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ o@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body imag@@ e , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this b@@ other you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing , no ph@@ an@@ tom for@@ ear@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers dan@@ gl@@ ing from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the des@@ ign and put it on my for@@ e@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and el@@ im@@ in@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ician ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ g@@ es from vis@@ ion saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ oc@@ ep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sign@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mo@@ tor com@@ m@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ ial — it ga@@ t@@ es the sign@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died pa@@ in f@@ lo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tri@@ ed on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other gro@@ ups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a treat@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , and inde@@ ed , people have tri@@ ed it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ mag@@ e to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some com@@ pon@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that com@@ pon@@ ent can be over@@ come using mir@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"This has also gone through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ w@@ it@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ ious ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
This was discover@@ ed by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ et@@ e@@ ent@@ h century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely nor@@ mal , had the fol@@ lowing pec@@ ul@@ iar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ ored ."
"F@@ ive is bl@@ ue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely nor@@ mal in other res@@ pec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke c@@ olo@@ r ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F shar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ."
These people mud@@ dle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pec@@ ts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia run@@ s in famil@@ ies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia is eight times more common amo@@ n@@ g art@@ ists , po@@ ets , no@@ vel@@ ists and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ? What ca@@ uses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ ad@@ s , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tr@@ uth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia . All right ?"
"So , we found that the c@@ olo@@ r are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some acc@@ id@@ ental c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing between c@@ olo@@ r and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding c@@ olo@@ r , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ro@@ s@@ sed w@@ ir@@ es in some people ?
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in famil@@ ies ?
That giv@@ es you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a m@@ ut@@ ation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ uses this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ m@@ ed down to create the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mod@@ ul@@ ar arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ m@@ m@@ ing and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get de@@ fic@@ i@@ ent tri@@ m@@ m@@ ing between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and c@@ olo@@ r , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ c@@ olo@@ r sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and c@@ olo@@ r , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ c@@ olo@@ r sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what art@@ ists , no@@ vel@@ ists and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to en@@ ga@@ ge in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ ul@@ iet is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ ul@@ iet is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lowing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , s@@ ch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"@@ Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"I@@ n@@ stan@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater c@@ ross w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pen@@ sity to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ c@@ idence of sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia amo@@ n@@ g po@@ ets , art@@ ists and no@@ vel@@ ists ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ological view of sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
The last demon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one min@@ ute ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ et@@ es , but you &apos;re in den@@ ial about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et . Just like your al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ if@@ fer@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et ."
"One of them is K@@ ik@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ ik@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ ik@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two m@@ ut@@ an@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ ik@@ i ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ del sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tion , mean@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion — k@@ i@@ -@@ ki , in your au@@ dit@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ ik@@ i , mi@@ m@@ ics the vis@@ ual in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , su@@ d@@ den in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of that j@@ ag@@ g@@ ed shap@@ e ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is en@@ gag@@ ing in a pri@@ mit@@ ive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly ill@@ us@@ ion , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this shap@@ e , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ dit@@ ory pat@@ tern , but the brain is able to ex@@ trac@@ t the common den@@ om@@ in@@ at@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mit@@ ive form of ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tion , and we now know this happens in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , these people lo@@ se the ability to en@@ ga@@ ge in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ ik@@ i , but they also lo@@ se the ability to en@@ ga@@ ge in met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not g@@ old , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and shin@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s g@@ old ."
"You have to measure its spec@@ if@@ ic grav@@ ity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical mean@@ ing ."
"So , this are@@ a is about eight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ pec@@ i@@ ally in hum@@ ans — as in lower pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the an@@ gul@@ ar g@@ y@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ad@@ s between he@@ aring , vis@@ ion and tou@@ ch , and it bec@@ ame en@@ or@@ mo@@ us in hum@@ ans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many un@@ i@@ qu@@ ely human abil@@ ities like ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tion , met@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that philosoph@@ ers have been stud@@ ying for mil@@ l@@ en@@ nia , we scient@@ ists can be@@ gin to ex@@ pl@@ ore by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stud@@ ying patients and as@@ king the right questions ."
