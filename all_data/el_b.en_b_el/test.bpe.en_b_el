"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ arly a billion people on this planet that acti@@ vely use social net@@ working sit@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in comm@@ on is that they &apos;re going to di@@ e .
"Wh@@ ile that might be a some@@ what mor@@ b@@ id thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a b@@ lo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ th@@ o@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ er@@ e@@ k K@@ . M@@ ill@@ er , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his family and friends wr@@ ite a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ or@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wr@@ ote in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my b@@ lo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ par@@ ed mess@@ age I wr@@ ote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ s@@ ite to an arch@@ ive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s arch@@ ive may have been better wr@@ it@@ ten and more car@@ e@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an arch@@ ive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few st@@ ats for a moment .
R@@ ight now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minut@@ e .
There are 200 million T@@ wee@@ ts being pos@@ ted every day .
And the a@@ verage F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 90 piec@@ es of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your gr@@ and@@ parents , at best they may have created some phot@@ os or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a bo@@ x some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly r@@ ich dig@@ ital arch@@ ive that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re g@@ one ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opport@@ uni@@ ties for techno@@ logi@@ sts .
"Now to be cle@@ ar , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist and not a techno@@ log@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly is pain@@ t a picture of what the pres@@ ent and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some serv@@ ices that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social me@@ dia ac@@ coun@@ ts after we di@@ e .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ing@@ ly enough , found me when I ch@@ ec@@ ked into a d@@ el@@ i at a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ s@@ qu@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ st@@ row : H@@ ell@@ o .
D@@ e@@ ath : A@@ d@@ am ?
A@@ O : Y@@ e@@ ah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : D@@ e@@ ath can c@@ at@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
D@@ e@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ st@@ row : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that serv@@ ice does , quite simply , is let you create a mess@@ age or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you di@@ e ."
"A@@ no@@ ther serv@@ ice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ or@@ ies ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with phot@@ os and vide@@ os and stories that they can p@@ ost after you di@@ e ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably famili@@ ar with D@@ e@@ b R@@ o@@ y who , back in M@@ ar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how he was able to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ ues to im@@ pro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ wee@@ ts , the phot@@ os , the vide@@ os , the b@@ lo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such m@@ as@@ sive num@@ bers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our dig@@ ital pers@@ on@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re g@@ one th@@ an@@ ks to the v@@ ast@@ ness of the amount of cont@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One serv@@ ice called My N@@ ext T@@ we@@ et an@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some pre@@ dic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the res@@ ul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ n@@ ical cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties im@@ pro@@ ve ."
"T@@ a@@ king it a ste@@ p f@@ ur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s me@@ dia la@@ b is working on ro@@ bot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like hum@@ ans ."
But what if those ro@@ bot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ qu@@ e char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics of a speci@@ fic person based on the hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of piec@@ es of cont@@ ent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ m of hi@@ p h@@ op arti@@ st w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same typ@@ e of technology to be@@ am a repres@@ en@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ om@@ s — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way based on all the cont@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clos@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ i@@ tion of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ exp@@ ected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the sol@@ ar technology indu@@ stry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to for@@ ce ourselves into the environment by p@@ ay@@ ing atten@@ tion to ...

It &apos;s just a qu@@ ick video of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ an@@ g on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just s@@ ki@@ p — I &apos;ll just s@@ ki@@ p through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organiz@@ ation &apos;s science ad@@ vi@@ s@@ or .
So I w@@ and@@ er@@ ed down the h@@ all@@ way to my colle@@ ag@@ ue Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s off@@ ice .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had de@@ ep in@@ stitu@@ tional know@@ le@@ dge and in@@ si@@ ghts ."
I expl@@ ain@@ ed to Ch@@ r@@ is that I was feel@@ ing a little bit st@@ uc@@ k .
"So Ch@@ r@@ is c@@ ut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issu@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gen@@ e@@ tic di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation , and re@@ produc@@ tive techno@@ logi@@ es , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..@@ ."
"&quot; Y@@ es , you know , pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my off@@ ice ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fi@@ le a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
So what does that mean ?
It also means that the pat@@ ent h@@ ol@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in research or cl@@ in@@ ical te@@ sting .
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , a 10@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old with long Q@@ T sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , a ser@@ ious heart con@@ di@@ tion that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can res@@ ult in su@@ dd@@ en de@@ ath ."
But then they went b@@ an@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never off@@ er@@ ed it .
G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming pati@@ ents .
"You can &apos;t pat@@ ent produc@@ ts of nature — the a@@ ir , the water , min@@ er@@ als , el@@ em@@ ents of the per@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ c table ."
Why is that ?
"Well , the pat@@ ent off@@ ice had been issu@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years ."
There were liter@@ ally thousands of pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
So the bot@@ to@@ m line : cour@@ ts just wer@@ en &apos;t going to be w@@ ill@@ ing to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
"Now , ne@@ ither Ch@@ r@@ is n@@ or I were the typ@@ e to sh@@ y away from a chall@@ en@@ ge , and hear@@ ing , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; se@@ em@@ ed all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght ."
So we set out to build our case .
It had for@@ c@@ ed mul@@ ti@@ ple l@@ ab@@ s that were off@@ ering B@@ R@@ C@@ A te@@ sting to stop .
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en M@@ ax@@ i@@ an .
The test was ne@@ g@@ ative .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
It turned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster was am@@ ong the 12 percent who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a f@@ al@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ g@@ ative test res@@ ult .
One of the maj@@ or chall@@ eng@@ es we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was fig@@ uring out how best to communic@@ ate the science .
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our case ."
"We fil@@ ed in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ i@@ str@@ ic@@ t of New York , and the case was r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to J@@ u@@ dge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched si@@ des ."
So in the di@@ str@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t the government sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
S@@ ort of .
"E@@ n@@ ds up s@@ pl@@ it deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 ."
So now we s@@ ought re@@ view by the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question pres@@ ented ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pat@@ ent@@ able ?
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
The ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Ch@@ r@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed br@@ illi@@ an@@ tly .
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce K@@ ag@@ an li@@ k@@ en@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ating DNA to ex@@ trac@@ ting a me@@ dic@@ in@@ al pl@@ ant from the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on .
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed it from car@@ ving a bas@@ e@@ b@@ all b@@ at from a t@@ ree .
S@@ ome of them pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed to off@@ er the te@@ sts at a lo@@ wer pr@@ ice than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
But of course the deci@@ sion goes far be@@ y@@ on@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It c@@ lear@@ s a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant bar@@ ri@@ er to bi@@ ome@@ d@@ ical disco@@ very and innov@@ ation .
"And it hel@@ ps to en@@ sure that pati@@ ents like A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en and E@@ il@@ e@@ en have ac@@ cess to the te@@ sts that they need ."
"A few wee@@ ks after the cour@@ t issu@@ ed its deci@@ sion , I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a small p@@ ack@@ age in the ma@@ il ."
I op@@ en@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ ff@@ ed anim@@ al .
( Laughter ) We took a big ris@@ k in taking this case .
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ anci@@ al S@@ er@@ v@@ ices A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , the answer is y@@ es ."
"Th@@ en , pre@@ dic@@ tions can be made and te@@ sted ."
So what do we know about comple@@ x systems ?
So the whole is liter@@ ally more than the su@@ m of its par@@ ts .
Wh@@ ere are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ ta@@ il was o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a val@@ ue to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"Th@@ ese are compan@@ ies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expl@@ ain by gi@@ ving you this an@@ al@@ o@@ gy .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of about e@@ ight of my pro@@ jects , done in coll@@ abor@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish arti@@ st S@@ o@@ re@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ st@@ an@@ tly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a gl@@ ass of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spec@@ ted figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the sit@@ u@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fi@@ ed me the most was his use of a l@@ and@@ line t@@ ele@@ phone .
He would h@@ old on to the re@@ ce@@ i@@ ver and exp@@ ect me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qui@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mis@@ sing his comm@@ ands ."
And so I made him a go@@ l@@ d@@ en t@@ y@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er through which he could di@@ sp@@ en@@ se his comm@@ ands to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of p@@ aper , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , typ@@ e his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and pul@@ l the p@@ aper out ."
This dev@@ ice would au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c@@ ally s@@ end the in@@ ten@@ ded person the le@@ tter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of electr@@ on@@ ics that underst@@ ands all of the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ical ac@@ tions and conver@@ ts it to dig@@ ital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a m@@ ech@@ an@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of r@@ it@@ u@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle li@@ kes it ."
"The next work is a s@@ ound@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive inst@@ all@@ ation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ m@@ ies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a n@@ oti@@ on of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ u@@ res ."
"So how it works is we have these p@@ an@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ u@@ res which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these p@@ an@@ els on three w@@ all@@ s of a room .
And we had over 5@@ 00 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ m@@ ies hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the p@@ an@@ els ."
"And they hear like hum@@ ans do , or real cre@@ at@@ u@@ res do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ un@@ e to s@@ ounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to b@@ ack@@ ground s@@ ounds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( N@@ o@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground s@@ ounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Wh@@ ist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavi@@ or , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e , m@@ ood s@@ w@@ ings , pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video inst@@ all@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with play@@ ing with the n@@ oti@@ on of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ er@@ a sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to devel@@ op a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a cam@@ er@@ a that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the b@@ ack@@ ground , r@@ en@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ o@@ re@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ cess@@ ed video where the cam@@ er@@ a has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
S@@ o@@ re@@ n en@@ ters the room . P@@ op ! He goes in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the cam@@ er@@ a is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ er@@ a looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The S@@ u@@ n S@@ ha@@ d@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper , like a c@@ ut@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an o@@ il sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ ared to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it almost se@@ em@@ ed very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ n@@ ore it , thinking it was some cra@@ p l@@ ay@@ ing around ."
"But as so@@ on as they p@@ ass@@ ed by , it would start to c@@ lim@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y f@@ as@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted , and it would coll@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , ful@@ l of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of f@@ all@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a pl@@ ant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken f@@ as@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table and ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low mo@@ vement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to w@@ and@@ er about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an inst@@ ance — so when people en@@ ter the room , it acti@@ v@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it g@@ ain@@ s mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vi@@ e@@ wer an inst@@ inc@@ t to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pul@@ l itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ n@@ ical chall@@ en@@ ge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would t@@ op@@ ple over , then it would d@@ ama@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it w@@ ouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ick video where we are doing a test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much fa@@ ster .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go c@@ at@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tin@@ y different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a b@@ lob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ape of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ ang@@ ing from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tr@@ ast something very co@@ ld and dist@@ ant and ab@@ str@@ act like the universe into the famili@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ tim@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ ce@@ ive it to be a h@@ ole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big st@@ anding in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tri@@ ed to in@@ tim@@ id@@ ate you by gro@@ wing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; e@@ ight &#93; times its vol@@ u@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly exp@@ anding and con@@ trac@@ ting to create a d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a sec@@ re@@ t within its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of p@@ ain in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interest@@ ed in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pres@@ s the em@@ oti@@ ons and behavi@@ or@@ al patter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ u@@ res that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature pop@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m really gl@@ ad to be here .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad we &apos;re all here .

"This is what life needs to sur@@ vi@@ ve , all life ."
"And many sol@@ ar system bo@@ dies don &apos;t have li@@ qu@@ id water , and so we don &apos;t look there ."
So that lea@@ ves a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem sim@@ pl@@ er for ourselves .
Let &apos;s think only about li@@ qu@@ id water on the sur@@ face of a planet .
You want to have an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here for water to be li@@ qu@@ id .
"You can &apos;t have too much at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , too th@@ ick or too war@@ m an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , because then you end up too h@@ ot like V@@ en@@ us , and you can &apos;t have li@@ qu@@ id water ."
"But if you have too little at@@ m@@ osp@@ here and it &apos;s too th@@ in and too co@@ ld , you end up like M@@ ars , too co@@ ld ."
"So V@@ en@@ us is too h@@ ot , M@@ ars is too co@@ ld , and Earth is just right ."
You can look at these imag@@ es behind me and you can see au@@ tom@@ ati@@ c@@ ally where life can sur@@ vi@@ ve in our sol@@ ar system .
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
Wh@@ en G@@ ol@@ di@@ loc@@ ks wal@@ ks into the room de@@ ter@@ min@@ es the answer that we get in the story .
And the same is true with plan@@ ets .
They &apos;re not st@@ ati@@ c things . They change .
And at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es do the same .
So let me give you an example .
This can &apos;t happen on M@@ ars today .
"This one image t@@ ells you that the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here of M@@ ars changed , and it changed in big ways ."
"And it changed from a state that we would de@@ f@@ ine as ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , because the three re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments for life were pres@@ ent long ago ."
And this happens with all bo@@ dies with at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es .
C@@ ome@@ ts have ta@@ il@@ s that are incredi@@ bly vi@@ sible re@@ min@@ d@@ ers of at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e .
"But V@@ en@@ us also has an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here that es@@ cap@@ es with time , and M@@ ars and Earth as well ."
It &apos;s just a matter of de@@ gre@@ e and a matter of scale .
"@@ Y@@ es , I &apos;m d@@ anc@@ ing , but they — ( Laughter ) O@@ h my God , not even at my we@@ d@@ ding . ( Laughter )"
A second way they can get energy is from the sol@@ ar w@@ ind .
"If P@@ ap@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too h@@ ot , and M@@ am@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too co@@ ld , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t B@@ ab@@ y B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l be even col@@ der if we &apos;re fol@@ lo@@ wing the tr@@ end ?"
"This thing that you &apos;ve ac@@ cep@@ ted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple ."
"And of course , dist@@ ance of a planet from the su@@ n de@@ ter@@ min@@ es its t@@ em@@ per@@ ature ."
This has to play into ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
Earth has one ; V@@ en@@ us and M@@ ars do not .
M@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds are gener@@ ated in the de@@ ep inter@@ i@@ or of a planet by electr@@ ically con@@ duc@@ ting ch@@ ur@@ ning fl@@ u@@ id materi@@ al that cre@@ ates this big old mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ d that sur@@ r@@ ounds Earth .
"If you have a comp@@ ass , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
( Laughter ) D@@ o@@ es this in@@ fl@@ u@@ ence ha@@ b@@ it@@ ability ?
"Well , how might it ?"
I like to think of it instead as a s@@ al@@ ad b@@ ar s@@ nee@@ ze gu@@ ard for plan@@ ets .
A@@ t@@ m@@ osp@@ here ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been able to es@@ cap@@ e .
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ enc@@ ed them , it &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
We know the energy is getting in .
We &apos;re trying to meas@@ ure how many partic@@ les are getting out and if the mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ d is in@@ fl@@ u@@ enc@@ ing this in any way .
We don &apos;t have a sol@@ ution .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve s@@ ent sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to all three plan@@ ets ."
We have sim@@ il@@ ar meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments from V@@ en@@ us and Earth .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"And fin@@ anci@@ ally as well , but de@@ ep@@ ly ."
It will te@@ ach us about at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ es that sur@@ r@@ ound us and that are close .
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es su@@ gg@@ est there are some@@ where between 40 billion and 100 billion of those plan@@ ets that we would de@@ f@@ ine as ha@@ b@@ it@@ able in just our g@@ al@@ ax@@ y ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
I &apos;m really gl@@ ad we &apos;re here .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ ink about everything it has br@@ ought us .
"Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we use , all the connec@@ ti@@ vity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the comm@@ er@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history boo@@ ks hund@@ re@@ ds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very ser@@ ious problems , problems with sec@@ ur@@ ity and problems with priv@@ acy ."
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my car@@ e@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k in@@ f@@ ected by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vir@@ us we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the boo@@ t sec@@ tor of an in@@ f@@ ected flo@@ p@@ p@@ y , and if we take a clos@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first nam@@ es , P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i first nam@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vir@@ us problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of phot@@ os I took while I was in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ h@@ ore , which is around 3@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ t@@ ab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was c@@ au@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a typ@@ ical stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad lead@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am b@@ loc@@ k at Al@@ l@@ am@@ a I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who op@@ en@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here st@@ anding up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wr@@ ote the first P@@ C vir@@ us .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters in@@ f@@ ected do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ rel@@ ated other vir@@ uses over these years .
So there is some sort of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce in the world after all .
"Now , the vir@@ uses that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 19@@ 9@@ 0s ob@@ vi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run ag@@ e-@@ old progra@@ ms on a mo@@ der@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old vir@@ uses .
So let me just run some vir@@ uses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vir@@ us first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get in@@ f@@ ected by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re in@@ f@@ ected because it actually sho@@ ws up .
"@@ Here &apos;s another one . This is the vir@@ us called C@@ r@@ as@@ h , inv@@ ented in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 19@@ 9@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ ker vir@@ us does ?"
"@@ Y@@ es , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get in@@ f@@ ected ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re in@@ f@@ ected by a vir@@ us , when the vir@@ uses were wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ i@@ sts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ i@@ sts and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vir@@ uses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the b@@ ack@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our l@@ ab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack vir@@ us in@@ f@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just b@@ loc@@ ked vir@@ uses in S@@ we@@ d@@ en and T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just con@@ n@@ ect back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vir@@ uses , how many new exam@@ ples of m@@ al@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"@@ Here &apos;s the l@@ at@@ est vir@@ us we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just m@@ as@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of m@@ al@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs wr@@ iting these vir@@ uses because they make money with their vir@@ uses ."
It &apos;s g@@ an@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ st@@ a@@ B@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying in@@ f@@ ected compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a vir@@ us wr@@ it@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of in@@ f@@ ec@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those in@@ f@@ ected compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually p@@ ay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those in@@ f@@ ected compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as b@@ an@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line b@@ an@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line b@@ an@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"@@ K@@ ey@@ log@@ g@@ ers sil@@ ently s@@ it on your computer , hi@@ dd@@ en from view , and they rec@@ ord everything you typ@@ e ."
So you &apos;re sit@@ ting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google sear@@ ch@@ es .
E@@ very single Google sear@@ ch you typ@@ e is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single e@@ ma@@ il you wr@@ ite is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single p@@ ass@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ es@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ cha@@ ses in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"Because when you do pur@@ cha@@ ses in on@@ line st@@ o@@ res , you will be typ@@ ing in your name , the de@@ li@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number and the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of wee@@ ks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion d@@ ate , that &apos;s the sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the o@@ w@@ ner of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you g@@ ain ac@@ cess to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever you want with this information ."
"And that , ob@@ vi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place and business ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and sear@@ ch for wanted pers@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in , or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from S@@ we@@ d@@ en , and his par@@ t@@ ner in cri@@ me , also li@@ sted on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ages , M@@ r@@ . S@@ ha@@ il@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ ma@@ r J@@ ain , a U.S@@ . ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
"Th@@ ese guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted m@@ illions ."
They are both right now on the run .
N@@ o@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.S@@ . off@@ ici@@ als , just a couple of wee@@ ks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S@@ . dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually aff@@ ord to inv@@ est into their att@@ ac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are h@@ ir@@ ing progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers , h@@ ir@@ ing te@@ sting people , te@@ sting their co@@ de , having b@@ ack@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ ases ."
And they can aff@@ ord to wat@@ ch how we work — like how sec@@ ur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any sec@@ ur@@ ity pre@@ c@@ au@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ ant@@ age .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ lar@@ i@@ fi@@ ed N@@ et@@ works , which ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates how one single m@@ al@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite is tri@@ ed to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ ke@@ ts to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exp@@ lo@@ it fi@@ le .
"@@ Here , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x d@@ um@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an exp@@ lo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image he@@ ad@@ er , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the att@@ ack star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t it ."
It has been enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R fun@@ c@@ tion 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that progra@@ m .
And that &apos;s a b@@ ack@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more interest@@ ing@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So ob@@ vi@@ ously I Goo@@ g@@ led for it .
I got z@@ er@@ o h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ o@@ ke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our l@@ ab@@ s , and one of them m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone num@@ bers and car lic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ates and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for cont@@ ac@@ ts in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
"@@ Here &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and he run@@ s a b@@ lo@@ g under the pop@@ ular L@@ ive J@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And on this b@@ lo@@ g , he b@@ lo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very n@@ ice car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er eng@@ ine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a n@@ ice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year@@ -@@ old k@@ id in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he b@@ log@@ g@@ ed about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cr@@ as@@ h@@ ed his car into another car ."
And he put b@@ log@@ g@@ ed imag@@ es about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ad@@ a S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he cr@@ as@@ h@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the lic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are c@@ au@@ ght ?"
Well in most c@@ ases it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me c@@ ases , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the att@@ ac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The loc@@ al poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be eas@@ i@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also chang@@ ing at a very r@@ ap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it in@@ f@@ ected these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , progra@@ m@@ m@@ able logi@@ c &#91; contro@@ l@@ l@@ er &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our in@@ fra@@ structure .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"@@ P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are progra@@ m@@ m@@ ed , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the el@@ ev@@ at@@ ors in this building most li@@ ke@@ ly are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net in@@ f@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a m@@ as@@ sive re@@ vol@@ ution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical in@@ fra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power pl@@ ant , any chem@@ ical pl@@ ant , any food pro@@ cess@@ ing pl@@ ant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on bas@@ ic things like electr@@ ic@@ ity , ob@@ vi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gr@@ an@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about b@@ ack@@ u@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ ink about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve sp@@ ent my life de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a ris@@ k of l@@ os@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs — these organiz@@ ed g@@ an@@ gs that are making m@@ illions out of their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning an@@ ti@@ -@@ vir@@ uses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ all@@ s .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these att@@ ac@@ ks , and even more import@@ an@@ tly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ ill@@ s , but without the opport@@ uni@@ ties and give them the opport@@ uni@@ ties to use their sk@@ ill@@ s for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is chang@@ ing with really re@@ mark@@ able spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ j@@ ec@@ tions su@@ gg@@ est that the Chin@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ected that the Chin@@ ese economy will be tw@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the In@@ di@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these pro@@ j@@ ec@@ tions were dra@@ wn up before the W@@ est@@ er@@ n fin@@ anci@@ al cri@@ s@@ is .
"A couple of wee@@ ks ago , I was looking at the l@@ at@@ est pro@@ j@@ ection by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ j@@ ected 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The pos@@ t-@@ cri@@ s@@ is pro@@ j@@ ection is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a dec@@ a@@ de away .
China is going to change the world in two fund@@ am@@ ental resp@@ ects .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a huge develop@@ ing country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been gro@@ wing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a dec@@ a@@ de , it will have the lar@@ g@@ est economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the mo@@ der@@ n er@@ a has the lar@@ g@@ est economy in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , rather than a develop@@ ed country ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , for the first time in the mo@@ der@@ n er@@ a , the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ational ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion in the W@@ est that as countries mo@@ der@@ n@@ ize , they also we@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ ize ."
This is an ill@@ us@@ ion .
"It &apos;s an ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion that mo@@ der@@ n@@ ity is a produc@@ t simply of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , mar@@ ke@@ ts and technology ."
It is not . It is also sh@@ ap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"@@ China is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ ma@@ in in very fund@@ am@@ ental resp@@ ects very different .
"Now the big question here is ob@@ vi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ est@@ er@@ n terms , using W@@ est@@ er@@ n ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three building b@@ loc@@ ks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state for the last hund@@ red years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ n@@ ast@@ y in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state per@@ i@@ od — the bir@@ th of mo@@ der@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies of mo@@ der@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ n@@ ast@@ y , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ c@@ up@@ ies most of what we now know as E@@ ast@@ er@@ n China , which is where the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of Chin@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Chin@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Chin@@ ese , comes not from the last hund@@ red years , not from the n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state per@@ i@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the per@@ i@@ od , if you like , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ om@@ s like an@@ ce@@ str@@ al wor@@ ship , of a very dist@@ inc@@ tive n@@ oti@@ on of the state , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , a very dist@@ inc@@ tive n@@ oti@@ on of the family , social relation@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ an val@@ ues and so on ."
These are all things that come from the per@@ i@@ od of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ est@@ er@@ n st@@ ates and most countries in the world , is sh@@ ap@@ ed by its sense of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , its ex@@ ist@@ ence as a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , rather than as a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ically and ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ically , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly di@@ ver@@ se and very pl@@ ur@@ al@@ is@@ tic , and in many ways very dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , rather than a n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations ."
I &apos;ll give you two qu@@ ick ones .
"The first is that the most important political val@@ ue for the Chin@@ ese is un@@ ity , is the ma@@ in@@ ten@@ ance of Chin@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Eu@@ rop@@ e : bre@@ a@@ k@@ down — the fra@@ g@@ men@@ tation of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ p@@ ire ."
"It divi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined divi@@ ded ever since ."
"@@ China , over the same time per@@ i@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tion , very pain@@ fully h@@ ol@@ ding this huge ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pr@@ os@@ a@@ ic , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
D@@ o you remember the h@@ an@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by B@@ r@@ it@@ ain to China in 19@@ 9@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Chin@@ ese con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ posi@@ tion was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll l@@ ay a w@@ ag@@ er that bar@@ ely any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ d@@ ow dre@@ s@@ sing .
"When China gets its h@@ ands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and le@@ g@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 19@@ 9@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ ink of G@@ er@@ man uni@@ fic@@ ation , 19@@ 90 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the n@@ ati@@ on-@@ state m@@ ent@@ ality .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me off@@ er you another building b@@ loc@@ k to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ table one .
"The Chin@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of r@@ ace to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Chin@@ ese , over 90 percent of them think they b@@ el@@ ong to the same r@@ ace , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most pop@@ ul@@ ous countries ."
"I@@ n@@ dia , the United States , In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il — all of them are mul@@ ti@@ r@@ ac@@ i@@ al ."
The Chin@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only mul@@ ti@@ r@@ ac@@ i@@ al really at the mar@@ g@@ ins .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , ess@@ enti@@ ally is , again , back to the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ c@@ up@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion , as@@ sim@@ il@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this n@@ oti@@ on of the H@@ an em@@ er@@ g@@ ed — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a gro@@ wing and very power@@ ful sense of cul@@ tur@@ al id@@ enti@@ ty ."
"Now the great adv@@ ant@@ age of this hi@@ stor@@ ical experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an id@@ enti@@ ty has been the c@@ ement which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tur@@ al difference .
"They really believe in their own su@@ per@@ i@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ re@@ spec@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the T@@ i@@ be@@ t@@ ans ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building b@@ loc@@ k , the Chin@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing@@ ly see@@ m to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and le@@ gi@@ tim@@ acy of the state is a fun@@ c@@ tion of demo@@ cr@@ acy .
The problem with this pro@@ posi@@ tion is that the Chin@@ ese state en@@ jo@@ ys more le@@ gi@@ tim@@ acy and more au@@ th@@ or@@ ity am@@ on@@ g@@ st the Chin@@ ese than is true with any W@@ est@@ er@@ n state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ously got nothing to do with demo@@ cr@@ acy , because in our terms the Chin@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very speci@@ al — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very speci@@ al sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance as the repres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Chin@@ ese ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in Eu@@ rop@@ e and N@@ or@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously chall@@ eng@@ ed — I mean in the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion , hi@@ stor@@ ically against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other sec@@ tors of the ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ r@@ acy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Chin@@ ese state has not been chall@@ eng@@ ed ."
It &apos;s had no ser@@ ious ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ struc@@ ted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ est@@ er@@ n history .
"The res@@ ult , by the way , is that the Chin@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as we t@@ end to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a str@@ an@@ ger , cer@@ tain@@ ly an org@@ an wh@@ ose po@@ w@@ ers need to be lim@@ ited or defin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Chin@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Chin@@ ese view the state as an in@@ tim@@ ate — not just as an in@@ tim@@ ate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Chin@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ours ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would su@@ gg@@ est to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Chin@@ ese cont@@ ext , is a new kind of par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the mark@@ et and the state .
"I mean , A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ it@@ h , already wr@@ iting in the l@@ ate 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chin@@ ese mark@@ et is lar@@ ger and more develop@@ ed and more s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated than anything in Eu@@ rop@@ e . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the M@@ a@@ o per@@ i@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is com@@ b@@ ined with an ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly str@@ ong and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s lead@@ ing fir@@ ms — many of them are still pub@@ lic@@ ly o@@ w@@ ned ."
"@@ P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , ho@@ we@@ ver large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , dep@@ end in many ways on state pat@@ r@@ on@@ age ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ th@@ or@@ ity flo@@ ws into lots of other are@@ as — as we are famili@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child po@@ lic@@ y ."
"M@@ o@@ re@@ over , this is a very old state tra@@ di@@ tion , a very old tra@@ di@@ tion of st@@ at@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ struc@@ ted in the first inst@@ ance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ ven@@ th century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 1@@ 4 mil@@ es , l@@ in@@ king B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary state in@@ fra@@ struc@@ tur@@ al pro@@ jects in China , which I sup@@ p@@ ose hel@@ ps us to expl@@ ain what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ org@@ es D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state com@@ pe@@ t@@ ence within China ."
"So there we have three building b@@ loc@@ ks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ati@@ on-@@ state , the n@@ oti@@ on of r@@ ace and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ si@@ st , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on W@@ est@@ er@@ n experience , looking at it through W@@ est@@ er@@ n eyes , using W@@ est@@ er@@ n con@@ cep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ing@@ ly see@@ m to get China wrong — our pre@@ dic@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t — this is the reason .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little W@@ est@@ er@@ ner m@@ ent@@ ality ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ e@@ fore we have the univer@@ s@@ al meas@@ ure ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , it &apos;s ig@@ nor@@ ant ."
We re@@ f@@ use to really ad@@ dre@@ ss the issu@@ e of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting p@@ ass@@ age in a book by P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ h@@ en , the American hi@@ stor@@ i@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ h@@ en ar@@ gu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al , because for 200 years , the W@@ est has been so d@@ om@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if nec@@ ess@@ ary by for@@ ce , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ a@@ ker posi@@ tion , vi@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by for@@ c@@ ed to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pres@@ ence in those socie@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , they are , as a res@@ ult , more c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , K@@ o@@ re@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the lar@@ g@@ est economic regi@@ on in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more know@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very g@@ er@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the pres@@ ent ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"What is happening is that , very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly in hi@@ stor@@ ical terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sh@@ ap@@ ed , not by the old develop@@ ed countries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ ping very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly the posi@@ tion of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly l@@ os@@ ing its in@@ fl@@ u@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ ma@@ tic ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion of this actually a year ago — C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en , c@@ lim@@ ate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Eu@@ rop@@ e was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ g@@ oti@@ ating table .
Wh@@ en did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ag@@ er it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second imp@@ lic@@ ation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly un@@ famili@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sh@@ ap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and hi@@ stories that we are not really famili@@ ar with , or conver@@ s@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Eu@@ rop@@ e ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ nor@@ ant , are un@@ aw@@ are about the way the world is chang@@ ing ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is s@@ le@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Eu@@ rop@@ e is incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly out of t@@ ou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of l@@ oss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Eu@@ rop@@ e once , of course , once comm@@ an@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to ta@@ st@@ e the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the li@@ kes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tra@@ ins .
China already has a bi@@ g@@ ger net@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tri@@ ed out sh@@ or@@ tly in a sub@@ ur@@ b of B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing ."
"@@ Here you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the up@@ per dec@@ k car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It tra@@ vel@@ s on ra@@ il@@ s down a sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an ro@@ ad , and the car@@ s tra@@ vel under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ e@@ ds of up to about 100 mil@@ es an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Eu@@ rop@@ e and different from the United States : China has huge num@@ bers of people and no space ."
"So this is a sol@@ ution to a sit@@ u@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gu@@ e , ab@@ o@@ ve all , a bi@@ g@@ -@@ picture posi@@ tive for this world ."
"For 200 years , the world was ess@@ enti@@ ally go@@ ver@@ ned by a fra@@ g@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Eu@@ rop@@ e and N@@ or@@ th America repres@@ ented .
"The ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and so on , repres@@ ent the most important single act of demo@@ cra@@ ti@@ z@@ ation in the last 200 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not list@@ en@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of repres@@ en@@ tation in this world ."
"As hum@@ an@@ i@@ sts , we must w@@ el@@ come , su@@ re@@ ly , this trans@@ for@@ mation , and we will have to learn about these ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one sa@@ il@@ ed in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great vo@@ y@@ ages around the S@@ outh China S@@ e@@ a , the E@@ ast China S@@ e@@ a and across the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ op@@ her C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us cr@@ os@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look car@@ e@@ fully at this sil@@ k sc@@ ro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re play@@ ing go@@ l@@ f .
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ st , the Chin@@ ese even inv@@ ented go@@ l@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .

I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ vol@@ ution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into s@@ ong , or you pic@@ k a fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite col@@ or , I want to de@@ f@@ ine what I mean by re@@ vol@@ ution ."
"B@@ y re@@ vol@@ ution , I mean a dr@@ as@@ tic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a re@@ vol@@ ution ?"
We need a re@@ vol@@ ution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us not living up to our pot@@ ential ."
I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Eu@@ rop@@ e in innov@@ ation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ to@@ m , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t val@@ ue innov@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Eu@@ rop@@ e , at the very bot@@ to@@ m ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three wee@@ ks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ con@@ om@@ ist ."
"We &apos;re the sa@@ dd@@ est place on Earth , rel@@ ative to G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a — the sa@@ dd@@ est place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Wh@@ ere do we r@@ ank three wee@@ ks ago in another re@@ port by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science . L@@ ast ."
B@@ us@@ iness : The lo@@ w@@ est per@@ cep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s provi@@ de b@@ ene@@ f@@ its to society .
"Wh@@ y as a res@@ ult , what happens ?"
The lo@@ w@@ est per@@ cent@@ age of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s star@@ ting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
And this is des@@ p@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the eng@@ ine of econom@@ ies .
We h@@ ire the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our eng@@ ine &apos;s bro@@ ken , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Eu@@ rop@@ e G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no surpri@@ se , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy I have got against B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really cle@@ ar that our system is bro@@ ken ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ ken ."
"We need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be posi@@ tive now . We &apos;re going to get posi@@ tive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ as@@ tic to some of you — because we are h@@ and@@ ic@@ app@@ ing ourselves .
We &apos;re h@@ ol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , ad@@ ul@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t val@@ ue play .
"In fact , we de@@ val@@ ue play ."
And we de@@ val@@ ue it in three are@@ as .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three are@@ as .
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f commun@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individu@@ al and s@@ qu@@ as@@ h@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently , cre@@ ati@@ vity , individu@@ al self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion and innov@@ ation ."
"And instead , what do we val@@ ue ?"
"Because it &apos;s sh@@ own the way we app@@ ly , gener@@ ate and use know@@ le@@ dge is aff@@ ected by our social and in@@ stitu@@ tional cont@@ ext , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?"
T@@ o be ser@@ ious .
"T@@ o be really , really ser@@ ious ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e ser@@ ious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the par@@ k for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ a@@ ven for@@ b@@ id they play in the di@@ r@@ t , the k@@ al , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ k@@ v@@ i , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and d@@ y@@ a@@ do@@ s that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is ser@@ ious and we need to tra@@ in them for the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a ser@@ ious me@@ me run@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e run@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a ser@@ ious gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a bab@@ y . I@@ sk@@ am bab@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the bab@@ y . W@@ oo@@ ho@@ o !@@ "
But then what happens in ste@@ p three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to f@@ ur@@ ther my car@@ e@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ ff@@ e@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ k@@ o to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been in@@ f@@ ected by the ser@@ ious me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"S@@ he p@@ ass@@ es that vir@@ us on to bab@@ y , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ w@@ ood tre@@ es — for that ser@@ ious me@@ me to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ ues r@@ ote learning , mem@@ or@@ iz@@ ation and st@@ and@@ ar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and de@@ val@@ ues self-@@ ex@@ pres@@ sion , self-@@ expl@@ or@@ ation , ques@@ tion@@ ing , cre@@ ati@@ vity and play ."
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my k@@ id .
We went to this pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study mat@@ h 10 times a wee@@ k and science e@@ ight times a wee@@ k and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and rec@@ ess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so ser@@ ious because education is ser@@ ious that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ d@@ less , ro@@ bot@@ ic wor@@ kers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ dr@@ ill@@ ed h@@ ol@@ es ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution ."
"We need ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ability , the ability to learn how to be cre@@ ative and innov@@ ative ."
We don &apos;t need m@@ ech@@ an@@ iz@@ ed wor@@ kers .
"But no , now our me@@ me goes into work where we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"We create ro@@ bot@@ ic wor@@ kers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to le@@ ver and just th@@ row away ."
What are qu@@ ali@@ ties of a B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ an work ?
A@@ u@@ to@@ cra@@ tic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ oss and I know better than you .
"@@ Un@@ tru@@ sting — you &apos;re ob@@ vi@@ ously a cri@@ min@@ al , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all cam@@ er@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ t@@ ro@@ l@@ ling — you &apos;re ob@@ vi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ illion little pro@@ cess@@ es for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t ste@@ p out of the bo@@ x ."
"So they &apos;re re@@ str@@ ic@@ tive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bi@@ le phone , don &apos;t use your l@@ ap@@ top , don &apos;t sear@@ ch the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing because you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ led , you &apos;re re@@ str@@ ic@@ ted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fu@@ n ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t val@@ ue play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous , S@@ te@@ ve . What a d@@ um@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"@@ J@@ ust play , that &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id thing . &quot; &quot; We have the ser@@ ious me@@ me in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ ec@@ h — that play is the c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the re@@ vol@@ ution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia for the better ."
P@@ l@@ ay : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ vol@@ ution has sel@@ ected , over m@@ illions and b@@ illions of years , for play in animals and in hum@@ ans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ vol@@ ution does a really , really good job of des@@ elec@@ ting tra@@ its that ar@@ en &apos;t adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ e@@ ous to us and sel@@ ec@@ ting tra@@ its for com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive adv@@ ant@@ age ."
"N@@ ature isn &apos;t stu@@ p@@ id , and it sel@@ ected for play ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough@@ out the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , for example : an@@ ts . An@@ ts play ."
M@@ ay@@ be you didn &apos;t know that .
"But when they &apos;re play@@ ing , they &apos;re learning the social order and d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics of things ."
"@@ R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that r@@ ats that play more have bi@@ g@@ ger bra@@ ins and they learn t@@ as@@ ks better , sk@@ ill@@ s ."
K@@ it@@ ten@@ s play . We all know k@@ it@@ ten@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s de@@ pri@@ ved of play are un@@ able to inter@@ act soci@@ ally .
"They can still h@@ un@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
B@@ ear@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more sur@@ vi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sh@@ own , a cor@@ rel@@ ation between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the bi@@ g@@ ger the bra@@ ins there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big bra@@ ins , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the bi@@ gg@@ est bra@@ ins are the bi@@ gg@@ est play@@ ers ?
Y@@ ours tru@@ ly : hum@@ ans .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds play , we play — of every n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality , of every r@@ ace , of every col@@ or , of every reli@@ gi@@ on ."
It &apos;s a univer@@ s@@ al thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s ad@@ ul@@ ts too ."
Re@@ ally c@@ ool ter@@ m : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in ad@@ ul@@ ts .
And who are the bi@@ gg@@ est ne@@ ot@@ en@@ i@@ sts ?
H@@ um@@ ans . We play sp@@ or@@ ts .
"We do it for fu@@ n , or as O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ ans , or as prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als ."
We play mus@@ ical in@@ str@@ um@@ ents .
"We d@@ ance , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re desig@@ ned by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re desig@@ ned to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop play@@ ing .
It is a huge b@@ ene@@ f@@ it .
"@@ J@@ ust like there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ f@@ its to animals , there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ f@@ its to hum@@ ans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sh@@ own to sti@@ mul@@ ate ne@@ ural growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , in the are@@ a where it contro@@ ls em@@ oti@@ ons ."
It &apos;s been sh@@ own to pr@@ om@@ ote pre@@ -@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of cog@@ ni@@ tion is happening .
"As a res@@ ult , what happens ?"
We devel@@ op more em@@ oti@@ onal mat@@ ur@@ ity if we play more .
We devel@@ op better deci@@ si@@ on-@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s co@@ ld , hard science ."
These are the b@@ ene@@ f@@ its to play .
"It is a gen@@ e@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spe@@ a@@ king or seeing ."
"And if we h@@ and@@ ic@@ a@@ p ourselves with play , we h@@ and@@ ic@@ a@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We h@@ old ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a world without the@@ ater , without the ar@@ ts , without s@@ ong , without d@@ anc@@ ing , without so@@ c@@ c@@ er , without fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , without l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ le@@ ak .
It &apos;s pretty gl@@ um .
Now imagine your wor@@ k@@ place .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it play@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re for@@ ward thinking .
I@@ s it fu@@ n ? I@@ s it play@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cra@@ p ? I@@ s it au@@ to@@ cra@@ tic , contro@@ l@@ ling , re@@ str@@ ic@@ tive and un@@ tru@@ sting and un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing ?"
We have this con@@ cept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen play@@ ing at work .
"&quot; O@@ h , my colle@@ ag@@ ues see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ oss might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is b@@ ack@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is de@@ pres@@ sion . It &apos;s de@@ pres@@ sion .
"In fact , play im@@ pro@@ ves our work ."
"@@ J@@ ust like there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ f@@ its for hum@@ ans and animals , there &apos;s b@@ ene@@ f@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it sti@@ mul@@ ates cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
It incre@@ ases our op@@ en@@ ness to change .
It im@@ pro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It provi@@ des a sense of pur@@ p@@ ose and ma@@ st@@ ery — two key m@@ oti@@ v@@ ational things that incre@@ ase produc@@ ti@@ vity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not ser@@ ious , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous ."
"You know , the prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal a@@ th@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s ser@@ ious about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having fu@@ n , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A doc@@ tor might be ser@@ ious , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great me@@ dic@@ ine ."
O@@ ur thinking is b@@ ack@@ wards .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be feel@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating play .
Q@@ u@@ ick example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy m@@ ot@@ to : people , serv@@ ice , prof@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , they have a sense of ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ p@@ ose ."
"What happens ? They give better serv@@ ice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers call for serv@@ ice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make deci@@ sions and are ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , how do the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feel@@ ing cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?"
"They bu@@ y more of your serv@@ ice and they tell more of their friends , which lea@@ ds to more prof@@ it ."
"@@ Pe@@ ople , serv@@ ice , prof@@ it ."
"@@ P@@ l@@ ay incre@@ ases produc@@ ti@@ vity , not dec@@ reas@@ es ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia ."
"@@ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia , you guys . T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is univer@@ s@@ al ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , b@@ es@@ id@@ es the ser@@ ious me@@ me that we have to k@@ ick out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tri@@ ed it . I &apos;ve tri@@ ed at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had z@@ er@@ o happy cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
N@@ ot one cu@@ st@@ om@@ er would re@@ f@@ er us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ g@@ in@@ al prof@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ g@@ in@@ al prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough some bas@@ ic change , change like im@@ pro@@ ving tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ency , change like pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing self-@@ direc@@ tion and coll@@ abor@@ ation , enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing coll@@ abor@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , the things like having a res@@ ul@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ foc@@ us ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the mor@@ ning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cu@@ st@@ om@@ er and your te@@ am is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ?
B@@ as@@ ically pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing fu@@ n .
"Th@@ r@@ ough pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing fu@@ n and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three sh@@ ort years — s@@ ounds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , from z@@ er@@ o to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing us , ab@@ o@@ ve a@@ verage prof@@ its for the indu@@ stry and happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ k@@ ings for best emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er for small business ."
In@@ dep@@ end@@ ent an@@ al@@ ys@@ is from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia ."
"There &apos;s nothing h@@ ol@@ ding us back , ex@@ cept our own m@@ ent@@ ality about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this re@@ vol@@ ution through play .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the feel@@ ing of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it was that as a k@@ id you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that pr@@ om@@ oti@@ on you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be ser@@ ious , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain bi@@ king or read@@ ing a book or play@@ ing a game .
"@@ Re@@ disco@@ ver that because you &apos;re the lead@@ ers , the innov@@ ation lead@@ ers , the thought lead@@ ers ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your friends and ig@@ n@@ ite the fir@@ e of change in the play re@@ vol@@ ution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feel@@ ing it , your colle@@ ag@@ ues , your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tr@@ ust you . &quot; &quot; W@@ e@@ ird con@@ cept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tr@@ ust you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make deci@@ sions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to d@@ ele@@ g@@ ate to the lo@@ w@@ est level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge con@@ struc@@ tive cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m .
I &apos;m going to let you chall@@ en@@ ge au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
Because it &apos;s by chall@@ eng@@ ing the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create innov@@ ative solu@@ tions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as lead@@ ers .
We &apos;re going to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate fe@@ ar .
F@@ e@@ ar is the ene@@ my of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like e@@ li@@ min@@ ate re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bi@@ le phone for pers@@ onal call@@ s — he@@ a@@ ven for@@ b@@ id ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on inst@@ ant mess@@ eng@@ ers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ch@@ es .
L@@ un@@ ch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you w@@ ouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"@@ Let them do it . G@@ ive them some fre@@ e@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have fu@@ n at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We sp@@ end so much of our lives at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be , what , a mis@@ er@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wa@@ ke up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table . N@@ e@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; re@@ vol@@ ution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; re@@ vol@@ ution .
What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
"S@@ eri@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ o@@ day is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ am@@ es of the re@@ vol@@ ution . You need to go and share your ideas and your suc@@ cess stor@@ i@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ating our lives , our sch@@ o@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play pr@@ om@@ ot@@ es a sense of pr@@ om@@ ise and self-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ; of how play pr@@ om@@ ot@@ es innov@@ ation and produc@@ ti@@ vity , and , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , how play cre@@ ates me@@ an@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it al@@ one . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ g@@ ar@@ ia for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we h@@ old on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay atten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ul@@ arly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a sm@@ ile , or a cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ s@@ ha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about communic@@ ation ."
"When we think about communic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can pre@@ dic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or pr@@ om@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ ound@@ less c@@ li@@ ps of real phys@@ ici@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the phys@@ ici@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess pre@@ dic@@ t whether or not that phys@@ ici@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ fl@@ u@@ enc@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social p@@ sy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist . I study pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I became es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally interest@@ ed in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and d@@ om@@ in@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and d@@ om@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make y@@ our@@ self big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ ening up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ ening up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ ess@@ ica T@@ r@@ acy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really power@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavi@@ or in the cl@@ ass@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more li@@ ke@@ ly to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ r@@ on@@ ically less power@@ ful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cl@@ ass@@ room , because par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business sch@@ o@@ ols have been str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that they do .
"So , for example , we sm@@ ile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to sm@@ ile by h@@ ol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the power@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the power@@ ful ver@@ s@@ us the power@@ less look like ?
"So power@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to st@@ res@@ s ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s d@@ om@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really st@@ res@@ s re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"@@ P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , both that the body can sh@@ ape the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le chang@@ es can sh@@ ape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this tin@@ y man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation , this tin@@ y inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be sit@@ ting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making y@@ our@@ self small ."
"When you &apos;re t@@ ou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting y@@ our@@ self ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these chang@@ es ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it se@@ ems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative sit@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to y@@ our@@ self .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
Pe@@ ople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ d@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ di@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fi@@ ed with being s@@ mar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
D@@ o it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y twe@@ a@@ ks can le@@ ad to big chang@@ es .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that sit@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .

Here is one such sc@@ ra@@ p from an in@@ i@@ ti@@ ative I &apos;m inv@@ ol@@ ved in using cre@@ ati@@ vity to in@@ sp@@ ire people to be gre@@ en@@ er .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to wal@@ k ."
"N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."
S@@ tran@@ ge and wonder@@ ful things he would not o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se have seen .
A de@@ er with an it@@ ch@@ y le@@ g . A fl@@ ying m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle .
A father and d@@ aughter se@@ par@@ ated from a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle by a my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous w@@ all .
And then he st@@ op@@ ped . W@@ al@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped with him through fiel@@ ds and bro@@ ken his heart .
"S@@ ure , she had ag@@ ed a little ."
"In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot ."
But he felt all his old p@@ assion for her re@@ turn .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ ord , &quot; &quot; he called so@@ f@@ tly . F@@ or that was her name ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t say another word , G@@ u@@ st@@ y , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"&quot; &quot; I know a t@@ ent next to a car@@ av@@ an , exactly 3@@ 00 y@@ ar@@ ds from here ."

"B@@ e@@ a@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . R@@ ight ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ A@@ u@@ dience : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ ma@@ zing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ A@@ u@@ dience : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
A@@ u@@ dience : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . R@@ ight ?"
"It liter@@ ally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ight ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . R@@ ight ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ R@@ ight ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ ing@@ less information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was us@@ e@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavi@@ or that &apos;s us@@ e@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ y@@ ed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dre@@ am@@ s , the c@@ lo@@ th@@ es we we@@ ar , f@@ all@@ ing in love , everything beg@@ ins with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ as@@ ick@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"@@ R@@ ight ? If you go down b@@ el@@ ow on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you t@@ elling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m st@@ anding still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain can@@ not de@@ al with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the ir@@ on@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to ste@@ p into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tun@@ ately , evol@@ ution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . R@@ ight ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ on@@ d the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ p@@ ping into that space ."
So what is evol@@ ution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ l@@ ay is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated . Un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fu@@ n .
"@@ R@@ ight ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . R@@ ight ? It op@@ ens pos@@ si@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ l@@ ay is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od sec@@ tion of a p@@ aper .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d r@@ ules to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ m@@ ed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 e@@ igh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the a@@ i@@ m of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . R@@ ight ?"
The first ste@@ p was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fund@@ ing for this study because the scienti@@ sts said small children couldn &apos;t make a us@@ e@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . R@@ ight ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small prin@@ t so you w@@ ouldn &apos;t b@@ other read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ in@@ t is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science pub@@ lic@@ ation the last five to 15 years . R@@ ight ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to exper@@ t scienti@@ sts .
"Now here , I want to share the st@@ age with someone quite speci@@ al . R@@ ight ?"
"S@@ he was one of the young people who was inv@@ ol@@ ved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ g@@ est publi@@ shed scienti@@ sts in the world . R@@ ight ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to st@@ age , will be the youn@@ g@@ est person to ever spe@@ ak at TED . R@@ ight ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the pers@@ on@@ i@@ fic@@ ation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to st@@ and up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you ple@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton B@@ e@@ es P@@ ro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ oo@@ le : Thank you , B@@ e@@ a@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the l@@ ink between hum@@ ans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible l@@ ink with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if hum@@ ans and be@@ es thought sim@@ il@@ ar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if hum@@ ans and be@@ es might sol@@ ve comple@@ x problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new sit@@ u@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned r@@ ules and con@@ di@@ tions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ s@@ ect with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize a good flo@@ wer re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next ste@@ p was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain col@@ or , but to a certain col@@ or flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain patter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ w@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ w@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the bl@@ ue , or if the bl@@ ue flo@@ w@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different r@@ ules the be@@ es can learn to sol@@ ve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and B@@ e@@ a@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , in@@ clu@@ ding ad@@ ul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a cl@@ ue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a te@@ ac@@ her not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it goes to D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick , who was the coll@@ abor@@ ator on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next ste@@ p is ob@@ serv@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ serv@@ ations . They &apos;re rec@@ or@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Y@@ e@@ ah .
"D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So you keep tr@@ ack of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : R@@ ight ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ serv@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next ste@@ p .
So we &apos;re going to wr@@ ite this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for pub@@ lic@@ ation . R@@ ight ? So we have to wr@@ ite it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is m@@ ine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a p@@ aper has four different sec@@ tions : an int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , a res@@ ul@@ ts , a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"The int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ds , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ul@@ ts , what was the ob@@ serv@@ ation ?"
"And the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? R@@ ight ?"
"That &apos;s a science p@@ aper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive , which means that this p@@ aper is wr@@ it@@ ten in k@@ id@@ spe@@ ak ."
"It &apos;s not wr@@ it@@ ten by me . It &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the cl@@ ass . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science p@@ aper beg@@ ins , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The res@@ ul@@ ts sec@@ tion , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining p@@ ha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; sm@@ il@@ ey face . R@@ ight ? ( Laughter ) This is a science p@@ aper . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle p@@ age . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in bo@@ ld are e@@ ight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ ch@@ ool , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ed , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public ac@@ cess jour@@ n@@ al , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the p@@ aper fa@@ il@@ s our in@@ i@@ ti@@ al qu@@ ality control ch@@ ec@@ ks in se@@ ver@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once up@@ on a time , &quot; &quot; the fi@@ gu@@ res are in cra@@ y@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the lead@@ ing neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most or@@ ig@@ in@@ al science p@@ aper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly des@@ er@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vi@@ sion , says , &quot; &quot; The p@@ aper is mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ s@@ ha@@ ble if done by ad@@ ul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We s@@ end it back to the ed@@ it@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ ali@@ e H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to wr@@ ite a comm@@ ent@@ ary sit@@ u@@ ating the fin@@ d@@ ings for scienti@@ sts , right , p@@ ut@@ ting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed by five in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ yp@@ ical science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ g@@ est publi@@ shed scienti@@ sts in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ d@@ it@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ o@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver fre@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only p@@ aper that will ever be fre@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by this jour@@ n@@ al .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d@@ -@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed p@@ aper by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scienti@@ sts and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton B@@ e@@ es &apos; rec@@ ently . I don &apos;t have words to expl@@ ain exactly how I am feel@@ ing right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ ur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , inno@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most bas@@ ic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s te@@ am from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a phys@@ ical me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) O@@ h ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Y@@ e@@ ah ye@@ ah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredi@@ ble ris@@ k , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . R@@ ight ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ h@@ im@@ on S@@ ch@@ oc@@ ken : R@@ ight , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . R@@ ight . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"

E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ R@@ ight ? We nor@@ m@@ ally wal@@ k through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to ste@@ p into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . Wh@@ en he op@@ en@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the pos@@ si@@ bility to ste@@ p on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about gi@@ ving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pres@@ s that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this sh@@ ort story ."

"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it br@@ ought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the pot@@ ential to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."

The year is 18@@ 00 .
A cur@@ ious little inv@@ en@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tin@@ y little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are in@@ vi@@ sible to the n@@ a@@ ked ey@@ e .
S@@ o@@ on comes the me@@ d@@ ical disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually ca@@ uses of ter@@ ri@@ ble human dise@@ ases .
"I@@ mag@@ ine what happened to the society when they realiz@@ ed that an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ in@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast for@@ ward 200 years .
"We still have this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken h@@ old in the develop@@ ing countries around the t@@ rop@@ ical b@@ el@@ t ."
"@@ J@@ ust for m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be te@@ sted because they are at ris@@ k for different species of m@@ al@@ ari@@ al in@@ f@@ ec@@ tions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ st@@ ers .
"You take a st@@ ain , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ an@@ ge or a fl@@ u@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent st@@ ain or G@@ i@@ em@@ s@@ a , and a mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"Wh@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , F@@ ati@@ m@@ a in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , N@@ av@@ j@@ oo@@ t in M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i , and J@@ u@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ g@@ and@@ a still wa@@ it months to be able to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose why they are s@@ ick ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ ily because sc@@ al@@ ability of the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem li@@ es with the mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of mo@@ der@@ n science , research mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es are not desig@@ ned for fiel@@ d te@@ sting ."
N@@ e@@ ither were they first desig@@ ned for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , b@@ ul@@ k@@ y , really hard to ma@@ in@@ tain , and c@@ ost a lot of money ."
This picture is M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his as@@ h@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in India .
"T@@ w@@ o of my students , J@@ i@@ m and J@@ am@@ es , tra@@ vel@@ ed around India and Th@@ ail@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of d@@ on@@ ated equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us gro@@ wing on mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e l@@ en@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a fun@@ c@@ tional mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e is a completely fun@@ c@@ tional mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , a pl@@ at@@ form for fl@@ u@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ fiel@@ d , p@@ ol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation , pro@@ j@@ ection , all kinds of adv@@ anc@@ ed mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ y built pu@@ re@@ ly by fol@@ ding p@@ aper ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
What you see here is all the possible comp@@ on@@ ents to build a fun@@ c@@ tional bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ fiel@@ d and fl@@ u@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ence mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e .
"So , there are three st@@ ages : There is the op@@ tical st@@ age , the ill@@ um@@ in@@ ation st@@ age and the m@@ as@@ k@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ ding st@@ age ."
And there are mic@@ r@@ o op@@ tics at the bot@@ to@@ m that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the p@@ aper itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are play@@ ing like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This p@@ aper has no in@@ struc@@ tions and no langu@@ ages .
"There is a co@@ de , a col@@ or co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that t@@ ells you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties of a st@@ and@@ ard mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , just like an X@@ Y st@@ age , a place where a sa@@ m@@ ple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the st@@ and@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ tim@@ iz@@ ed for over the years , and many health wor@@ kers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what chang@@ es , but the st@@ and@@ ard st@@ ain@@ s all re@@ ma@@ in the same for many different dise@@ ases ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y st@@ age , and then there is a foc@@ using st@@ age , which is a f@@ le@@ x@@ ure m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism that &apos;s built in p@@ aper itself that allo@@ ws us to move and foc@@ us the l@@ en@@ ses by mic@@ r@@ on ste@@ ps ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students h@@ ate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ gg@@ ed dev@@ ices ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re desig@@ ned from a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble materi@@ al , like p@@ aper ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fu@@ n fact is , this is what we actually s@@ end out there as a st@@ and@@ ard di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic too@@ l , but here in this en@@ vel@@ op@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es of different con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pic@@ k one r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually desig@@ ned speci@@ f@@ ically for m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia , because it has the fl@@ u@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent fil@@ ters built speci@@ f@@ ically for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es comes out of this .
"So up ti@@ ll now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the li@@ ghts , ple@@ ase , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es are also pro@@ j@@ ection mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es ."
"I have these two mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of a comp@@ ound ey@@ e , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m in clos@@ er , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ ax@@ is ."
You actually see how the l@@ en@@ ses are c@@ ut together in the cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion patter@@ n .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite in@@ s@@ ects , I love to h@@ ate this one , is a m@@ os@@ qui@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ n@@ a of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
R@@ ight there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually des@@ cri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been fiel@@ d te@@ sting some of our mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es by was@@ h@@ ing my c@@ lo@@ th@@ es wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the dr@@ y@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fl@@ u@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also sho@@ ws you how the pro@@ j@@ ection sc@@ op@@ e works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ected and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quick@@ ly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it c@@ os@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the bi@@ gg@@ est idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of par@@ ts and c@@ os@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new par@@ a@@ dig@@ m in mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ y , which we call us@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ th@@ row mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a qu@@ ick s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the par@@ ts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of p@@ aper .
These are the three st@@ ages that you actually see .
"And the op@@ tical comp@@ on@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture l@@ en@@ ses in p@@ aper itself at really high thr@@ ough@@ pu@@ ts , so it uses a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and sur@@ face ten@@ sion to build ach@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c l@@ en@@ ses in the p@@ aper itself ."
So that &apos;s where the l@@ en@@ ses go .
There are some light sour@@ ces .
"And ess@@ enti@@ ally , in the end , all the par@@ ts line up because of or@@ ig@@ am@@ i , because of the fact that or@@ ig@@ am@@ i allo@@ ws us mic@@ r@@ on-@@ scale pre@@ ci@@ sion of op@@ tical al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the as@@ p@@ ects of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ."
"So here is another ob@@ vi@@ ous thing that we would do , t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es are ro@@ b@@ ust , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it sur@@ vi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next ste@@ p actually is really fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing our fiel@@ d tri@@ als ."
We are star@@ ting at the end of the sum@@ m@@ er .
We are at a st@@ age where we &apos;ll be making thousands of mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es .
That would be the first time where we would be doing fiel@@ d tri@@ als with the high@@ est d@@ en@@ sity of mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started coll@@ ec@@ ting data for m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia , C@@ ha@@ g@@ as disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from pati@@ ents themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated this before , but a really interesting l@@ ink between h@@ and@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the to@@ ols that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fi@@ ght this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p for tom@@ or@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just prin@@ t out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
Thank you .
( Applause )
O@@ ur world has many su@@ per@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all su@@ per@@ po@@ w@@ ers : in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
"For example , the c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res , wor@@ kers who coll@@ ect rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materi@@ als for a living ."
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res em@@ er@@ g@@ ed from social in@@ equ@@ ality , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , and the ab@@ und@@ ance of so@@ li@@ d wa@@ st@@ e from the de@@ f@@ ici@@ ency of the wa@@ st@@ e coll@@ ection system ."
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res provi@@ de a he@@ av@@ y , h@@ on@@ est and ess@@ ential work that b@@ ene@@ f@@ its the entire population . But they are not ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ed for it ."
"@@ Here in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , they coll@@ ect 90 percent of all the wa@@ st@@ e that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"M@@ ost of the c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res work in@@ dep@@ end@@ ently , pic@@ king wa@@ st@@ e from the stre@@ ets and sel@@ ling to j@@ un@@ k y@@ ar@@ ds at very low pr@@ ices ."
"They may coll@@ ect over 3@@ 00 k@@ il@@ os in their b@@ ag@@ s , sh@@ op@@ ping car@@ ts , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cl@@ es and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from w@@ ood or me@@ t@@ al and found in se@@ ver@@ al stre@@ ets in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , much like gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first m@@ et these mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ed su@@ per@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i arti@@ st and acti@@ vi@@ st and my art is social , environ@@ mental and political in nature ."
"But at this time , gi@@ ving vo@@ ice to the c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and hum@@ or to the c@@ ause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which hel@@ ped call atten@@ tion to the c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res and im@@ pro@@ ve their self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m ."
"And also , they are fam@@ ous now on the stre@@ ets , on m@@ ass me@@ dia and social ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ g@@ ed into this universe and have not st@@ op@@ ped working since ."
I have pain@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been inv@@ ited to do ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
"And then I realiz@@ ed that c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res , in their in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility , are not ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
"I m@@ et them in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ a , C@@ hi@@ le , B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in develop@@ ed countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this was when I realiz@@ ed that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the c@@ ause because it &apos;s a big chall@@ en@@ ge .
"And then , I created a coll@@ abor@@ ative mo@@ vement called P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent to help c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res are assi@@ sted by w@@ ell@@ -@@ being prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like phys@@ ici@@ ans , d@@ enti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ sts , ha@@ ir st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , m@@ ass@@ age ther@@ ap@@ i@@ sts and much more ."
"But also , they also re@@ ce@@ ive sa@@ fe@@ ty sh@@ ir@@ ts , g@@ lo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ ats and e@@ ye@@ gl@@ ass@@ es to see in high@@ -@@ defin@@ i@@ tion the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ated by our incredi@@ ble vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they re@@ ce@@ ive sa@@ fe@@ ty it@@ ems , too : re@@ fl@@ ective t@@ ap@@ es , hor@@ ns and m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bi@@ le art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"@@ P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the stre@@ ets of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o , R@@ i@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ ur@@ i@@ ti@@ b@@ a ."
So c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res are lea@@ ving in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility behind and becom@@ ing incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly re@@ spec@@ ted and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their p@@ im@@ ped car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , there are over 20 million c@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , th@@ ank you ."
"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tual Earth , br@@ ought me over to become the arch@@ it@@ ect of B@@ ing M@@ aps , which is M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ o@@ ft &apos;s on@@ l@@ in@@ e-@@ m@@ app@@ ing eff@@ ort ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way m@@ aps work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of m@@ app@@ ing and direc@@ tion s@@ ite that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might not@@ ice about the m@@ app@@ ing s@@ ite is just the fl@@ u@@ id@@ ity of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the p@@ an@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re famili@@ ar at all with S@@ e@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ y , it &apos;s also about imag@@ ery ."
"So , as we z@@ o@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ y@@ on@@ d a certain level this re@@ sol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ i@@ m C@@ it@@ y-@@ like vir@@ tual view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vi@@ e@@ wed from any of the car@@ d@@ in@@ al direc@@ tions to show you the 3@@ D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ad@@ es ."
"Now , we see this space , this thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sor@@ ts of app@@ lic@@ ations can play out , and ma@@ p &apos;s direc@@ tions are really just one of them ."
"If you c@@ lic@@ k on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the di@@ sa@@ ster in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ma@@ p that sho@@ wed before and after pic@@ tures from the sk@@ y ."
"This wonder@@ ful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ loc@@ al b@@ lo@@ gs in real time and m@@ app@@ ing those stories , those ent@@ ri@@ es to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the b@@ lo@@ gs ."
It &apos;s wonder@@ ful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more can@@ dy sort of stuff .
"So , we see the imag@@ ery , of course , not st@@ op@@ ping at the sk@@ y ."
These little gre@@ en bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es repres@@ ent phot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them e@@ ither , but phot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths are in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ very@@ thing that &apos;s c@@ as@@ ed in bl@@ ue is an are@@ a where we &apos;ve taken imag@@ ery on the ground as well .
"And so , when you f@@ ly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . Wh@@ en you f@@ ly down to the ground , and you see this kind of p@@ an@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ery , the first thing that you might not@@ ice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal underst@@ anding of this environment as there is of the thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal city from ab@@ o@@ ve , so if I c@@ lic@@ k on something to get a clos@@ er view of it , then , the fact that that tran@@ si@@ tion looks as it does , is a fun@@ c@@ tion of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D underst@@ anding behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a fu@@ n ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a coll@@ abor@@ ation with our friends at F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , ge@@ o@@ regi@@ st@@ er@@ ed imag@@ ery and uses phot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ -@@ like pro@@ cess@@ es to con@@ n@@ ect that imag@@ ery to our imag@@ ery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pul@@ l up , but — ( Laughter ) But not@@ ice — this is , of course , a pop@@ ular t@@ ou@@ ri@@ st s@@ ite , and there are lots of phot@@ os around here , and these phot@@ os are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ph@@ o@@ to , that &apos;s our imag@@ ery ."
"So you really see how this kind of c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ sour@@ c@@ ed imag@@ ery is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating , in a very de@@ ep way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time tra@@ vel ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonder@@ ful hi@@ stor@@ ic imag@@ ery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s c@@ ool about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ men@@ ting this vi@@ su@@ al repres@@ en@@ tation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ ound@@ ation for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a tran@@ si@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , not@@ ice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of ab@@ o@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace M@@ ar@@ k@@ et .
"And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a b@@ ack@@ p@@ ack cam@@ er@@ a , so , we &apos;re now not only imag@@ ing in the stre@@ et with this cam@@ er@@ a on t@@ op@@ s of car@@ s , but we &apos;re also imag@@ ing inside ."
"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of regi@@ stra@@ tion , not only of still imag@@ es , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( N@@ o@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m h@@ it@@ ting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace M@@ ar@@ k@@ et , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting this live .
"O@@ K , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner mark@@ et ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of inter@@ est .
"@@ No , no . The other way ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , O@@ K , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the sp@@ ot , you can think about this — this is taking a ste@@ p in ad@@ di@@ tion to au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"What the h@@ ell are you guys — o@@ h , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — O@@ K , I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the te@@ am ."
They &apos;ve done a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic job of pul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and wal@@ k back outside .
"And while I wal@@ k outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for t@@ ele@@ pres@@ ence , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the sp@@ ot , for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"When you use it on the sp@@ ot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that me@@ ta@@ data and information about the world to you ."

Thank you all very much .

"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have l@@ ost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are ro@@ c@@ k and lots of se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ ome@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I j@@ um@@ ped in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast off S@@ p@@ ain .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him J@@ o@@ e — what would J@@ o@@ e see ?"
"If J@@ o@@ e j@@ um@@ ped in a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"@@ V@@ ery un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly , J@@ o@@ e would j@@ um@@ p on a pri@@ st@@ ine cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f , a vir@@ g@@ in cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f with lots of cor@@ al , sh@@ ar@@ ks , c@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ les , man@@ ate@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"So , probably , what J@@ o@@ e would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the picture ."
"@@ Here we have the ex@@ tre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al s@@ ou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the re@@ e@@ f@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ gro@@ wing the cor@@ als , lots of b@@ acter@@ ia , and where the large animals are g@@ one ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scienti@@ sts have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started mo@@ der@@ n science with sc@@ u@@ b@@ a di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the o@@ ce@@ an was like ."
"And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the L@@ ine Is@@ l@@ ands , where we have con@@ duc@@ ted a ser@@ ies of N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions ."
"This se@@ a is an arch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to K@@ i@@ ri@@ b@@ at@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has se@@ ver@@ al un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited , un@@ fi@@ shed , pri@@ st@@ ine is@@ l@@ ands and a few in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited is@@ l@@ ands ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as Is@@ land , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"M@@ ost of the re@@ e@@ f@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are sm@@ all@@ er than the p@@ enc@@ il@@ s we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single sh@@ ark .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ tain C@@ oo@@ k disco@@ vered in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7 and he des@@ cri@@ bed a huge ab@@ und@@ ance of sh@@ ar@@ ks b@@ iting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going as@@ h@@ ore .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would consi@@ der par@@ a@@ di@@ se .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a K@@ e@@ ys N@@ ational M@@ ar@@ ine S@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ r@@ a A@@ t@@ ol@@ l , where I was with J@@ er@@ e@@ my J@@ ack@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are sh@@ ar@@ ks ."
You can see sh@@ ar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ us@@ ual in today &apos;s cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 200 , 5@@ 00 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are ab@@ solu@@ tely heal@@ thy and g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular struc@@ tures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sh@@ ar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bi@@ om@@ ass p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f together and we@@ i@@ gh them , this is what we would exp@@ ect ."
"M@@ ost of the bi@@ om@@ ass is low on the food cha@@ in , the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ r@@ ot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little d@@ am@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ ass of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , and a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ ass of top head , or the sh@@ ar@@ ks , the large s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , the large grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ sequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having stu@@ died de@@ gra@@ ded re@@ e@@ f@@ s .
"When we went to pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ e@@ f@@ s , we realiz@@ ed that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bi@@ om@@ ass , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ e@@ f , which is now prot@@ ected ."
"The good news is that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is bi@@ g@@ ger .
"We have more sh@@ ar@@ ks , more bi@@ om@@ ass of s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , more bi@@ om@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats ."
"They cle@@ an the re@@ e@@ f ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the re@@ e@@ f cle@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these anci@@ ent , pri@@ st@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important comp@@ on@@ ents of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem like the gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s ; pa@@ v@@ em@@ ents of gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter ."
"Th@@ ese have dis@@ appe@@ ared from every in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited re@@ e@@ f in the world , and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water cle@@ an from mic@@ ro@@ b@@ es and pa@@ th@@ o@@ gen@@ s ."
"But still , now we have global war@@ ming ."
"If we don &apos;t have fi@@ sh@@ ing because these re@@ e@@ f@@ s are prot@@ ected by la@@ w or their re@@ m@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ m@@ er for too long and the cor@@ als di@@ e .
"So how are these fish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?"
"Well , what we have seen is that in this particular are@@ a during E@@ l N@@ in@@ o , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too war@@ m for too long , and many cor@@ als b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed and many died ."
"In Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , where the food we@@ b is really tri@@ m@@ m@@ ed down , where the large animals are g@@ one , the cor@@ als have not re@@ co@@ vered ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , the cor@@ als are not re@@ co@@ vered ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that died and coll@@ ap@@ sed .
"And the fish have gra@@ z@@ ed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little lo@@ wer ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ r@@ a A@@ t@@ ol@@ l that has more bi@@ om@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pri@@ st@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"Th@@ ese places b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed too , but they re@@ co@@ vered fa@@ ster ."
"The more int@@ act , the more comple@@ te , &#91; and &#93; the more comple@@ x your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more li@@ ke@@ ly that the system is going to re@@ co@@ ver from the sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m imp@@ ac@@ ts of war@@ ming ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to re@@ co@@ ver that structure ."
We need to make sure that all of the piec@@ es of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem are there so the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem can ad@@ ap@@ t to the eff@@ ects of global war@@ ming .
"So if we have to re@@ set the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to p@@ us@@ h the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are se@@ ver@@ al ways ."
"One very cle@@ ar way is the mar@@ ine prot@@ ected are@@ as , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that we set as@@ i@@ de to al@@ low for the re@@ co@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a k@@ id .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u &apos;s sho@@ ws on T@@ V , with all this r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness and ab@@ und@@ ance and di@@ ver@@ sity ."
"And I thought that this r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ed to t@@ rop@@ ical se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an was a nat@@ ur@@ ally po@@ or se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , until I j@@ um@@ ped for the first time in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and se@@ ven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e gro@@ w again ."
"So you have this little al@@ g@@ al fore@@ st , and in the size of a l@@ ap@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , m@@ os@@ tly mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ ic f@@ it hund@@ re@@ ds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system re@@ co@@ ver@@ s ."
"And this particular place , the M@@ e@@ des Is@@ l@@ ands M@@ ar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 h@@ ec@@ t@@ ar@@ es , and it br@@ ings 6 million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s to the loc@@ al economy , 20 times more than fi@@ sh@@ ing , and it repres@@ ents 8@@ 8 percent of all the t@@ ou@@ ri@@ st re@@ ven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem but also help the people who can b@@ ene@@ f@@ it from the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves do .
"Th@@ ese places , when we prot@@ ect them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prot@@ ected are@@ as ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species incre@@ ases 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would exp@@ ect 200 more in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al .
"The size of organ@@ is@@ ms incre@@ ases a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ und@@ ance , how many fish you have per s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter , incre@@ ases almost 1@@ 70 percent ."
"And the bi@@ om@@ ass — this is the most spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bi@@ om@@ ass on a@@ verage , just after five to se@@ ven years ."
In some places up to 10 times lar@@ ger bi@@ om@@ ass inside the re@@ ser@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the re@@ ser@@ ve that gro@@ w , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ pro@@ duce . That &apos;s population bio@@ logy 10@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the fish , they take a longer time to di@@ e , they gro@@ w lar@@ ger and they re@@ pro@@ duce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
"Th@@ ese are e@@ g@@ g c@@ ases la@@ id by a s@@ n@@ a@@ il off the co@@ ast of C@@ hi@@ le , and this is how many e@@ g@@ gs they l@@ ay on the bot@@ to@@ m ."
"O@@ ut@@ side the re@@ ser@@ ve , you can@@ not even de@@ t@@ ect this ."
One point three million e@@ g@@ gs per s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter inside the mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve where these s@@ n@@ ail@@ s are very ab@@ und@@ ant .
"So these organ@@ is@@ ms re@@ pro@@ duce , the little lar@@ v@@ a@@ e ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can b@@ ene@@ f@@ it from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ m@@ as : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ und@@ ance of grou@@ per@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ve , and the clos@@ er you get to the re@@ ser@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are c@@ at@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the re@@ ser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats l@@ ined up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are b@@ ene@@ f@@ its be@@ y@@ on@@ d the b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies of these re@@ ser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the re@@ ser@@ ve is prot@@ ec@@ ting the entire ha@@ b@@ it@@ at . It is building re@@ si@@ li@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world without re@@ ser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t t@@ ou@@ ch ; that produc@@ es re@@ turns , social , economic and ec@@ o@@ logical ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bi@@ om@@ ass inside the re@@ ser@@ ves , this is like comp@@ ound inter@@ est ."
"T@@ w@@ o exam@@ ples , again , of how these re@@ ser@@ ves can b@@ ene@@ f@@ it people ."
"This is how much fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men get every@@ day in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , fi@@ sh@@ ing over a ser@@ ies of years , in a place where there is no prot@@ ection ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fi@@ sh@@ ing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were c@@ at@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually c@@ at@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ve on top of that , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fi@@ sh@@ ing less around an are@@ a that is prot@@ ected ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per@@ s in B@@ e@@ li@@ ze in the M@@ es@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Re@@ e@@ f .
"This is grou@@ per se@@ x , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the ful@@ l mo@@ ons of D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a wee@@ k ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one h@@ ec@@ t@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they c@@ au@@ ght them , and they dep@@ le@@ ted them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 2@@ 000 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ed to c@@ at@@ ch 30 percent of the entire sp@@ aw@@ ning population every year .
"So we did a simple an@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ c@@ k@@ et science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fi@@ sh@@ ery is going to coll@@ ap@@ se very quick@@ ly ."
"And with the fi@@ sh@@ ery , the entire re@@ produc@@ tive ability of the species goes ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , t@@ ot@@ al , for the entire fi@@ sh@@ ery , se@@ ver@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ ats ."
"Now , if you do an economic an@@ al@@ ys@@ is and project what would happen if the fish were not c@@ ut , if we br@@ ought just 20 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be su@@ st@@ ain@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"If this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how much of this do we have ?"
And you already heard that less than one percent of the o@@ ce@@ an &apos;s prot@@ ected .
"We &apos;re getting clos@@ er to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prot@@ ec@@ tions of the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago , and only a fr@@ action of this is fully prot@@ ected from fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic stu@@ dies re@@ comm@@ end that at least 20 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an should be prot@@ ected .
The es@@ tim@@ ated ran@@ ge is between 20 and 50 percent for a ser@@ ies of go@@ als of bio@@ di@@ ver@@ sity and fi@@ sh@@ ery en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement and re@@ si@@ li@@ ence .
"Now , is this possible ? Pe@@ ople would ask : How much would that c@@ ost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are p@@ ay@@ ing now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fi@@ sh@@ ing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to de@@ struc@@ tive fi@@ sh@@ ing pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es .
"Well , there are a couple es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es of how much it would c@@ ost to create a net@@ work of prot@@ ected are@@ as co@@ ver@@ ing 20 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an that would be only a fr@@ action of what we are now p@@ ay@@ ing ; the government h@@ ands out to a fi@@ sh@@ ery that is coll@@ ap@@ sing ."
Pe@@ ople are l@@ os@@ ing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies are coll@@ ap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a net@@ work of re@@ ser@@ ves would provi@@ de direc@@ t emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment for more than a million people pl@@ us all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary b@@ ene@@ f@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so cle@@ ar that these sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al sol@@ ution is to create really large prot@@ ected are@@ as like the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
"The problem is that we can create these large re@@ ser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conf@@ lic@@ t , where the political c@@ ost is really low and the economic c@@ ost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organiz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fi@@ sh@@ ing ?"
"Well , there are three ma@@ in reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thousands of small re@@ ser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves do , and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men t@@ end to be really , really de@@ f@@ en@@ sive when it comes to re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating or clos@@ ing an are@@ a , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ ast@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity to mon@@ it@@ or the res@@ our@@ ces to create the re@@ ser@@ ve and en@@ for@@ ce it ."
It &apos;s a top down hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical structure where people wa@@ it for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not eff@@ ective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough res@@ our@@ ces .
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more re@@ ser@@ ves , is that the fund@@ ing mo@@ d@@ els have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments sp@@ end a lot of time and energy and res@@ our@@ ces in a few small are@@ as , us@@ u@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation and co@@ ast@@ al prot@@ ection has become a s@@ ink for government or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic money , and this is not su@@ st@@ ain@@ able ."
So the solu@@ tions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we need to devel@@ op a global a@@ war@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to in@@ sp@@ ire loc@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties and govern@@ ments to create no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ s@@ us the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ econ@@ d , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so con@@ serv@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts can be dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ serv@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts don &apos;t dep@@ end on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and can be created by the loc@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties , like it happens in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to devel@@ op new business mo@@ d@@ els ."
The ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ y s@@ ink as the only way to create re@@ ser@@ ves is not su@@ st@@ ain@@ able .
"We really need to devel@@ op mo@@ d@@ els , business mo@@ d@@ els , where co@@ ast@@ al con@@ serv@@ ation is an in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves provi@@ de social , ec@@ o@@ logical and economic b@@ ene@@ f@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organiz@@ ation al@@ one is going to sa@@ ve the o@@ ce@@ an ."
"There has been a lot of com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion in the past , and we need to devel@@ op a new model of par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly coll@@ abor@@ ative , where we are looking for comple@@ men@@ ting , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting ."
The st@@ a@@ kes are just too high to contin@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ al@@ a : Thank you .
C@@ A : That was a ma@@ st@@ er@@ ful job of pul@@ ling things together .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , your p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id , your in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id , sho@@ wing 8@@ 5 percent bi@@ om@@ ass in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that se@@ ems im@@ possible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent sur@@ vi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ear@@ s of a wat@@ ch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , and the small one is moving f@@ ast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the lo@@ wer par@@ ts of the food cha@@ in , they re@@ pro@@ duce very f@@ ast ; they gro@@ w really f@@ ast ; they pro@@ duce m@@ illions of e@@ g@@ gs ."
"@@ U@@ p there , you have sh@@ ar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ pro@@ duce very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ m ; and , basically , they just ma@@ in@@ tain their bi@@ om@@ ass ."
"So , basically , the produc@@ tion sur@@ pl@@ us of these guys down there is enough to ma@@ in@@ tain this bi@@ om@@ ass that is not moving ."
They are like cap@@ ac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
C@@ A : That &apos;s very f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"So , really , our picture of a food p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id is just — we have to change that completely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t least in the se@@ as .
"What we found in cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ en@@ ge@@ t@@ i , with five li@@ ons per w@@ il@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this can@@ not work ."
But at least on cor@@ al re@@ e@@ f@@ s are systems where there is a bot@@ to@@ m comp@@ on@@ ent with structure .
We think this is univer@@ s@@ al .
But we have started stud@@ ying pri@@ st@@ ine re@@ e@@ f@@ s only very rec@@ ently .
C@@ A : So the num@@ bers you pres@@ ented really are ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only c@@ ost 1@@ 6 billion to set up 20 percent of the o@@ ce@@ an as mar@@ ine prot@@ ected are@@ as that actually give new living cho@@ ices to the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men as well .
"If the world was a s@@ mar@@ ter place , we could sol@@ ve this problem for ne@@ g@@ ative 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to sp@@ end on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ance of fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big solu@@ tions is have the W@@ or@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ dies to su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es ."
"C@@ A : O@@ kay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m hear@@ ing out there about en@@ ding this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ d@@ ness ."
So th@@ ank you for those num@@ bers .
The last one &apos;s a pers@@ onal question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the o@@ ce@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pres@@ sing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feel@@ ing that you must have experi@@ enc@@ ed of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine are@@ as and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual experience .
"We go there to try to understand the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems , to try to meas@@ ure or coun@@ t fish and sh@@ ar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feel@@ ing is this bi@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where hum@@ ans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ t@@ am@@ ed nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger global ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could contin@@ ue doing this job ."
It would be just too de@@ pres@@ sing .
"C@@ A : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for sh@@ ar@@ ing some of that sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ a@@ ds through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ g@@ est r@@ out@@ e we can pos@@ si@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ a@@ k@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me t@@ ot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perf@@ ect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fam@@ ous Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about sit@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a str@@ an@@ ge car@@ e@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ ant@@ age : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the pos@@ si@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I h@@ old , here in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ d@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go to the p@@ oll@@ s and v@@ ote in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se .
"So eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our pers@@ onal and prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ ince you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est mor@@ al , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — em@@ oti@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing . O@@ kay , wonder@@ ful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realiz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ ast@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ p@@ id Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter m@@ ist@@ ake ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy .
D@@ o you remember that L@@ o@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never c@@ at@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a b@@ ird , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ a@@ ir .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realiz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s g@@ one off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tur@@ al reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sit@@ ting there in cl@@ ass , and your te@@ ac@@ her is h@@ anding back qui@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ aper ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just becom@@ ing perf@@ ect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ i@@ sts , over@@ -@@ ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phys@@ ic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phys@@ ici@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the pos@@ si@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel s@@ mar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ osp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing se@@ ems to have g@@ one f@@ ine .
"And she wa@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ sting too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the pos@@ si@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just perf@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to expl@@ ain all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expl@@ ain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate ass@@ um@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we us@@ u@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty s@@ mar@@ t , then we move on to a third ass@@ um@@ p@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own m@@ al@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a c@@ at@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ ven@@ ting m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes when we ab@@ solu@@ tely need to and ca@@ uses us to tre@@ at each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ aff@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perf@@ ec@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and des@@ cri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ d@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally fund@@ am@@ ental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ ening to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ ening and I &apos;m list@@ ening , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve l@@ ost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ r@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ a@@ ff , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ r@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ s@@ al and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ i@@ sts and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ un@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of m@@ ass de@@ struc@@ tion , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ cr@@ acy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ u@@ bar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dic@@ t@@ ator of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too s@@ ick and could p@@ ass the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to gro@@ w up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a b@@ un@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredi@@ ble stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ es us ."
"@@ No off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ um@@ ent to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just sp@@ ent an entire wee@@ k talking about innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ em@@ ents and im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ em@@ ents and im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ r@@ is ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We h@@ old another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard se@@ ven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that tin@@ y , ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ ay@@ be I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

"S@@ ad@@ ly , the 19@@ 9@@ 3 b@@ om@@ b@@ ing of the W@@ or@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter was not ."
N@@ os@@ a@@ ir would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted for his inv@@ ol@@ vement in the p@@ lot .
E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ a@@ ir is my father .
It wasn &apos;t until I was se@@ ven years old that our family d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic started to change .
"A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he s@@ at me down and expl@@ ain@@ ed that for the past few wee@@ k@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ ot@@ ing ran@@ ge on L@@ ong Is@@ land for t@@ ar@@ get pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next mor@@ ning .
"M@@ y un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Ar@@ ab@@ ic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; L@@ i@@ ke father , like son ."
"They all se@@ em@@ ed to get a really big l@@ au@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully underst@@ ood what they thought was so fun@@ n@@ y ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ struc@@ tion my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an f@@ ill@@ ed with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 p@@ ounds of expl@@ os@@ i@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the W@@ or@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter &apos;s N@@ or@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , ca@@ using an expl@@ os@@ ion that kill@@ ed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"Th@@ ese were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel com@@ for@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"B@@ e@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tual new face in cl@@ ass , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the t@@ ar@@ get of b@@ ul@@ li@@ es ."
So what op@@ en@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that chall@@ eng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ d@@ ential elec@@ tions .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ m@@ er job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ d@@ ens , an am@@ us@@ ement par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fa@@ i@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fund@@ am@@ ental to the develop@@ ment of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"Because of that feel@@ ing , I was able to con@@ tr@@ ast the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"In that inst@@ ant , I realiz@@ ed how much ne@@ g@@ ative energy it takes to h@@ old that h@@ at@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
So why would I out myself and pot@@ enti@@ ally put myself in d@@ an@@ ger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , against the bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry ."
"For the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , I will spe@@ ak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I st@@ and here as pro@@ of that viol@@ ence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s reli@@ gi@@ on or r@@ ace , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted to be here .

"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interest@@ ed in , but un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect that what I &apos;m interest@@ ed in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much fu@@ n to talk about some stuff that happened in 19@@ 8@@ 6 and 19@@ 8@@ 7 , when a computer h@@ ack@@ er is bre@@ a@@ king into our systems over at L@@ a@@ wr@@ ence B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ ab@@ s ."

I feel that there &apos;s a m@@ as@@ sive and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into sch@@ o@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"@@ G@@ et them out of sch@@ o@@ ols , and keep them out of sch@@ o@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent is so ob@@ vi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s h@@ un@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de cl@@ ass@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has li@@ es in it as well .
"H@@ a@@ ving said that , I out@@ l@@ ined my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the ma@@ in thing I wr@@ ote on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m sup@@ posed to talk about the future , y@@ es ?"
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s wr@@ iting co@@ de .
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten te@@ ac@@ her , ask an experi@@ enc@@ ed one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these c@@ ool new things that are going to be there ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally good at t@@ ext mess@@ ag@@ ing and sp@@ end a huge amount of on-@@ scre@@ en time , but have never g@@ one bo@@ w@@ ling together ?"
"@@ Ch@@ an@@ ge is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fu@@ n , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
O@@ h — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . R@@ ight over here .
I@@ s that vi@@ sible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love M@@ o@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love M@@ o@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"@@ R@@ ight away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the au@@ dience who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has z@@ er@@ o vol@@ u@@ me . And it &apos;s n@@ on-@@ ori@@ ent@@ able .
It has wonder@@ ful pro@@ per@@ ties .
"If you take two M@@ o@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their comm@@ on e@@ dge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of gl@@ ass ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a co@@ ld . ) H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course st@@ ands for design ."
"@@ J@@ ust two wee@@ ks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four di@@ men@@ sions it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to h@@ old any fl@@ u@@ id at all , it &apos;s perf@@ ec@@ tly cap@@ able of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al di@@ men@@ sions , it can h@@ old fl@@ u@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the c@@ ool one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about t@@ op@@ o@@ logy with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ stead , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mo@@ m , who p@@ ass@@ ed away last sum@@ m@@ er ."
"H@@ ad coll@@ ected photograp@@ h@@ s of me , as mo@@ thers will do ."
C@@ ould somebody put this guy up ?
"And I looked at it , and said , o@@ h my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o !@@ "
"As a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing and ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ing the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o . And w@@ ow !@@ "
"W@@ ay back machine . And I said to myself , o@@ h ye@@ ah !@@ "
And it s@@ ent me back .
"S@@ o@@ on after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me ."
This guy over here of course is me .
"This man is R@@ ob@@ er@@ t M@@ oo@@ g , the inv@@ ent@@ or of the M@@ oo@@ g sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ er , who p@@ ass@@ ed away this past A@@ u@@ g@@ ust ."
"A mus@@ ici@@ an who took time from his life to te@@ ach me , a s@@ op@@ h@@ om@@ ore , a fre@@ sh@@ man at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o ."
"He &apos;d come up from T@@ r@@ um@@ ans@@ bur@@ g to te@@ ach me not just about the M@@ oo@@ g sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ er , but we &apos;d be sit@@ ting there — I &apos;m stud@@ ying phys@@ ics at the time . This is 19@@ 6@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 ."
"We &apos;re stud@@ ying phys@@ ics , I &apos;m stud@@ ying phys@@ ics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do ."
D@@ on &apos;t get c@@ au@@ ght up in electr@@ on@@ ic music if you &apos;re doing phys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; M@@ ent@@ or@@ ing me . He &apos;d come up and sp@@ end hours and hours with me .
He wr@@ ote a le@@ tter of re@@ comm@@ end@@ ation for me to get into gra@@ du@@ ate school .
"In the b@@ ack@@ ground , my b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
I realiz@@ e that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
B@@ o@@ b M@@ oo@@ g came by and ha@@ ul@@ ed a whole pi@@ le of equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment to show Gre@@ g F@@ l@@ in@@ t and I things about this .
"We s@@ at around talking about F@@ ou@@ ri@@ er trans@@ for@@ ms , B@@ es@@ se@@ l fun@@ c@@ tions , mo@@ d@@ ulation trans@@ f@@ er fun@@ c@@ tions , stuff like this ."
B@@ o@@ b &apos;s p@@ ass@@ ing this past sum@@ m@@ er has been a l@@ oss to all of us .

"( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do .

"O@@ h , c@@ ool . I can get to this place over here , right ?"
K@@ i@@ ds . K@@ i@@ ds is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that o@@ kay ?
"It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about ."
"I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head ."
"And one of them , se@@ ver@@ al of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teach@@ ing ? &quot;"

I str@@ on@@ g@@ ly su@@ gg@@ est that this is a good thing for each of you to do .

"T@@ each a so@@ li@@ d wee@@ k . O@@ kay , I &apos;m teach@@ ing thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters time , but good enough ."
"One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , I &apos;m going to te@@ ach you colle@@ ge@@ -@@ level phys@@ ics ."
"@@ No cal@@ cul@@ us , I &apos;ll c@@ ut out that ."
"But you will need to know e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , and we &apos;re going to do ser@@ ious experim@@ ents ."
N@@ one of this op@@ en@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ch@@ ap@@ ter@@ -@@ se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ do@@ -@@ all@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ o@@ dd@@ -@@ proble@@ m@@ -@@ se@@ ts .
We &apos;re going to be doing gen@@ u@@ ine phys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched t@@ one ) O@@ h , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three wee@@ ks ago in my cl@@ ass — this is through the l@@ ens , and one of the things we used a l@@ ens for was to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"M@@ y students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ c@@ ill@@ os@@ cop@@ e — meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ d@@ ers do you know of who have meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ?
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red the spe@@ ed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to imp@@ ose up@@ on the po@@ w@@ ers that be , and meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !@@ "
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light !@@ "
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound !@@ "
"Well , the ob@@ vi@@ ous way to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the ech@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ cle@@ ar &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of light using the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation is the fre@@ qu@@ ency times the wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th of any wa@@ ve ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . Wh@@ en the fre@@ qu@@ ency goes up , the wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ a@@ vel@@ eng@@ th goes up , fre@@ qu@@ ency goes down . So , if we have a wa@@ ve here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the p@@ it@@ ch goes up , things get clos@@ er , p@@ it@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out ."
R@@ ight ? This is simple phys@@ ics .
"A@@ ll of you know this from e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in phys@@ ics — in e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de phys@@ ics — but they should have , and I w@@ ish they had , was that if you mul@@ ti@@ ply the fre@@ qu@@ ency times the wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of sound .
"So , in order to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its fre@@ qu@@ ency . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a fre@@ qu@@ ency coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , ab@@ o@@ ve A , ab@@ o@@ ve A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 k@@ il@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z . I meas@@ ure its wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th .
"A@@ ll I need now is to f@@ li@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bot@@ to@@ m be@@ am is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the sour@@ ce , you &apos;ll not@@ ice the sp@@ ir@@ al ."
I &apos;ve mo@@ ved the mic@@ ro@@ phone 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters .
"@@ 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters from here , back to here , 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters ."
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go back to M@@ r@@ . E@@ l@@ m@@ o ."
"And we &apos;ll say the fre@@ qu@@ ency is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 k@@ il@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 1@@ 7@@ 60 ."
The wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 me@@ ters per second .
"If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 ."
"But , here with k@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ gy materi@@ al , and l@@ ous@@ y dr@@ ink — we &apos;ve been able to meas@@ ure the spe@@ ed of sound to — not bad . P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good ."
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
G@@ o back to this picture of me a million years ago .
"It was 19@@ 7@@ 1 , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m stud@@ ying phys@@ ics : L@@ and@@ a@@ u , L@@ i@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , R@@ es@@ n@@ ick and H@@ al@@ li@@ day ."
I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ ter@@ m . A ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ p@@ us .
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot ! H@@ ey , E@@ l@@ m@@ o &apos;s done : off ."
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on cam@@ p@@ us , and the poli@@ ce are cha@@ sing me , right ?"
"I &apos;m wal@@ king across cam@@ p@@ us . C@@ op comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a stud@@ ent . &quot;"
P@@ ul@@ ls out a gu@@ n . G@@ o@@ es boo@@ m !
And a te@@ ar g@@ as can@@ ist@@ er the size of a P@@ ep@@ s@@ i can goes by my head . Wh@@ o@@ os@@ h !
I get a bre@@ ath of te@@ ar g@@ as and I can &apos;t bre@@ a@@ the .

"I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to cle@@ ar out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go run@@ ning across cam@@ p@@ us qu@@ ick as I can . I duc@@ k into H@@ ay@@ es H@@ all ."

I go to a place where a do@@ we@@ l s@@ pl@@ its off .
"There &apos;s a c@@ loc@@ k , c@@ loc@@ k , c@@ loc@@ k , c@@ loc@@ k ."
The time &apos;s going b@@ ack@@ wards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ or@@ en@@ z con@@ trac@@ tions and E@@ in@@ ste@@ in@@ i@@ an relati@@ vity .
"I c@@ lim@@ b up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you c@@ lim@@ b up this w@@ oo@@ d@@ en l@@ ad@@ der ."

"A few years ago , I bro@@ ke into my own house ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those e@@ ight hours and no s@@ le@@ ep ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
Re@@ member under st@@ res@@ s you &apos;re not thinking c@@ lear@@ ly .
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the st@@ ati@@ n or not ."
G@@ ood mor@@ ning !
A@@ re you a@@ wa@@ ke ?
"They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did any@@ one here wr@@ ite their name on the ta@@ g in Ar@@ ab@@ ic ?"
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem ."
"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , not long ago , I was sit@@ ting in a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food ."

"&quot; &quot; C@@ ome , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ it@@ er ."
"He was dis@@ gu@@ sted when talking to me , as if he was saying to h@@ im@@ self , &quot; If this was the last gir@@ l on Earth , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;"
What &apos;s the me@@ an@@ ing of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in Ar@@ ab@@ ic ?
T@@ w@@ o words made a L@@ e@@ b@@ an@@ ese young man ju@@ dge a gir@@ l as being b@@ ack@@ ward and ig@@ nor@@ ant .
How could she spe@@ ak that way ?
"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It defin@@ it@@ ely h@@ ur@@ ts !
I &apos;m d@@ en@@ i@@ ed the right to spe@@ ak my own language in my own country ?
Wh@@ ere could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a st@@ age in their lives , where they inv@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ar@@ ily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re mo@@ der@@ n and ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed ."
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , int@@ ell@@ ect and all my mem@@ or@@ ies ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ h@@ ood stories might be the best mem@@ or@@ ies we have of the war !
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , just to con@@ form ?"
T@@ o be one of them ?
Wh@@ ere &apos;s the logi@@ c in that ?
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite all that , I tri@@ ed to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ dge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed me .
The Ar@@ ab@@ ic language doesn &apos;t sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in univer@@ si@@ ties , a language we use in the wor@@ k@@ place , a language we re@@ ly on if we were to per@@ form an adv@@ anc@@ ed research project , and it defin@@ it@@ ely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ port ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our c@@ lo@@ th@@ es ."
"Wh@@ ere can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !@@ "
"So , you want us to use Ar@@ ab@@ ic . Wh@@ ere are we to do so ?"
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Ar@@ ab@@ ic is the mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch says that ma@@ st@@ ery of other langu@@ ages de@@ m@@ ands ma@@ st@@ ery of the mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
M@@ ast@@ ery of the mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for cre@@ ative ex@@ pres@@ sion in other langu@@ ages .
How ?
"@@ G@@ i@@ br@@ an K@@ hal@@ il G@@ i@@ br@@ an , when he first started wr@@ iting , he used Ar@@ ab@@ ic ."
"A@@ ll his ideas , imag@@ in@@ ation and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y were in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the v@@ ill@@ age where he gre@@ w up , sm@@ elling a speci@@ fic sm@@ ell , hear@@ ing a speci@@ fic vo@@ ice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started wr@@ iting in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
"E@@ ven when he wr@@ ote in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , when you read his wr@@ it@@ ings in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , you sm@@ ell the same sm@@ ell , sense the same feel@@ ing ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him wr@@ iting in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ rom a v@@ ill@@ age on M@@ oun@@ t L@@ e@@ b@@ an@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can ar@@ gu@@ e with ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , it &apos;s often said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its language ."
This is a reality that develop@@ ed socie@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
"The G@@ er@@ m@@ ans , F@@ r@@ en@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Chin@@ ese , all these n@@ ations are aw@@ are of this ."
That &apos;s why they le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ate to prot@@ ect their language .
They make it s@@ ac@@ red .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produc@@ tion , they p@@ ay a lot of money to devel@@ op it ."
D@@ o we know better than them ?
"A@@ ll right , we ar@@ en &apos;t from the develop@@ ed world , this adv@@ anc@@ ed thinking ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us yet , and we would like to c@@ at@@ ch up with the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for develop@@ ment , do research , and c@@ at@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ ay@@ si@@ a and others , they car@@ ri@@ ed their language with them as they were c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the l@@ ad@@ der , prot@@ ected it like a di@@ am@@ on@@ d ."
They ke@@ pt it close to them .
"Because if you get any produc@@ t from T@@ ur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a loc@@ al produc@@ t ."
You w@@ ouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a loc@@ al produc@@ t .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ sum@@ ers , clu@@ el@@ ess con@@ sum@@ ers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and pro@@ duce , they had to prot@@ ect their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t r@@ ing a b@@ ell , does it ?"
"@@ Re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for conver@@ sing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age repres@@ ents speci@@ fic st@@ ages in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ o@@ logy that is l@@ in@@ ked to our em@@ oti@@ ons ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a speci@@ fic image in their own mind , there are speci@@ fic feel@@ ings of a speci@@ fic day in a speci@@ fic hi@@ stor@@ ical per@@ i@@ od ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or le@@ t@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that rel@@ ates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our int@@ ell@@ ect ?
How do you say whether this guy underst@@ ands or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the per@@ i@@ od of the fre@@ e@@ dom ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ ain ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a fr@@ anc@@ op@@ h@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ri@@ ed to a F@@ r@@ en@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is f@@ ine , but once , I sp@@ ent a whole night as@@ king and trying to trans@@ l@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had m@@ ist@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then sp@@ ent the whole night trying to expl@@ ain it to him ."
He was pu@@ z@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could any@@ one be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
D@@ o@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ury me ? &apos; ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exam@@ ples .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"S@@ he said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ ens to F@@ air@@ u@@ z with me , and one night , I tri@@ ed to trans@@ l@@ ate for him so he can feel what I feel when I list@@ en to F@@ air@@ u@@ z . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tri@@ ed to trans@@ l@@ ate this for him : &quot; F@@ rom them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my h@@ ands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you b@@ el@@ ong to them , I re@@ turned my h@@ ands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )"
T@@ r@@ ans@@ l@@ ate that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prot@@ ect the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the ci@@ vi@@ l society , and we la@@ un@@ ched a cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pres@@ er@@ ve the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you b@@ other ?"
F@@ or@@ get about this he@@ ad@@ ac@@ he and go have fu@@ n . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n to pres@@ er@@ ve Ar@@ ab@@ ic la@@ un@@ ched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not ac@@ cept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we w@@ ouldn &apos;t be underst@@ ood ."
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I h@@ ate the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed in a way that re@@ fl@@ ects our dre@@ am@@ s , as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions and d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that dre@@ s@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the sp@@ ot ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very easy , yet cre@@ ative and per@@ su@@ as@@ ive ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we la@@ un@@ ched another cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with sc@@ en@@ es of le@@ t@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a sc@@ en@@ e of a le@@ tter sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by black and y@@ el@@ low t@@ ape with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t k@@ ill your language ! &quot; &quot; wr@@ it@@ ten on it ."
"Wh@@ y ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t k@@ ill your language ."
We really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ ill our language .
"If we were to k@@ ill the language , we &apos;d have to find an id@@ enti@@ ty ."
We &apos;d have to find an ex@@ ist@@ ence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ y@@ on@@ d just mis@@ sing our chan@@ ce of being mo@@ der@@ n and ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ed .
A@@ f@@ ter that we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed phot@@ os of guys and gir@@ ls w@@ ear@@ ing the Ar@@ ab@@ ic le@@ tter .
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os of &quot; &quot; c@@ ool &quot; &quot; guys and gir@@ ls .
We are very c@@ ool !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I ad@@ op@@ t the word &apos; c@@ ool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them ob@@ ject ho@@ we@@ ver they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and mat@@ ch@@ es the reality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( L@@ augh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t f@@ it ! We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ id ourselves .
"But to re@@ ach this point , we all have to be con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t al@@ low any@@ one who is bi@@ g@@ ger or thin@@ ks they have any au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want ."
C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity is the idea .
"So , if we can &apos;t re@@ ach space or build a ro@@ c@@ k@@ et and so on , we can be cre@@ ative ."
"A@@ t this moment , every one of you is a cre@@ ative project ."
C@@ re@@ ati@@ vity in your mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e is the p@@ ath .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s wr@@ ite a no@@ vel or pro@@ duce a sh@@ ort fil@@ m .
A single no@@ vel could make us global again .
It could bring the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no sol@@ ution ; there is a sol@@ ution !@@ "
"But we have to know that , and be con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that a sol@@ ution ex@@ i@@ sts , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that sol@@ ution ."
"In con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , what can you do today ?"
"Now , twe@@ ets , who &apos;s twe@@ e@@ ting ?"
"@@ P@@ le@@ ase , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fin@@ i@@ shed , e@@ ither Ar@@ ab@@ ic , En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , F@@ r@@ en@@ ch or Chin@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t wr@@ ite Ar@@ ab@@ ic with L@@ ati@@ n char@@ ac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with num@@ bers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a di@@ sa@@ ster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a vir@@ tual world with a vir@@ tual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and ri@@ se .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"S@@ econ@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to con@@ v@@ ince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring atten@@ tion to the nec@@ ess@@ ity of pres@@ er@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a sec@@ re@@ t .
A bab@@ y first id@@ enti@@ fi@@ es its father through language .
"When my d@@ aughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , h@@ on@@ ey ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) . &quot; &quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your d@@ ad , h@@ on@@ ey ( En@@ g@@ li@@ sh ) . &quot; &quot; And in the su@@ per@@ mark@@ et , I pr@@ om@@ ise my d@@ aughter N@@ o@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , M@@ am@@ an , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her ."
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get ri@@ d of this cul@@ tur@@ al cr@@ in@@ ge . ( Applause )
"S@@ u@@ st@@ ain@@ ability repres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is c@@ au@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my d@@ in@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they re@@ ly on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
Un@@ der@@ st@@ anding all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood away from a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity to an opport@@ un@@ ity to re@@ st@@ ore our ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .
It allo@@ ws for us to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the se@@ af@@ ood that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
"Wh@@ ere su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to end@@ ure and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ stor@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood allo@@ ws for an evol@@ ving and d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic system and ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ es our relation@@ ship with the o@@ ce@@ an as a res@@ our@@ ce , su@@ g@@ ge@@ sting that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the o@@ ce@@ an and to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge its re@@ si@@ li@@ ency ."
"It is a more hop@@ e@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more us@@ e@@ ful way of underst@@ anding our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ id@@ es — st@@ and@@ ard issu@@ e by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very h@@ an@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonder@@ ful too@@ l .
"@@ Gre@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ ood species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y gre@@ en , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at gre@@ en li@@ st ."
We can &apos;t su@@ st@@ ain this without the meas@@ ure of our suc@@ cess really chang@@ ing the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the gre@@ en li@@ st ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ au@@ ght y@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in tun@@ a here — comes from su@@ st@@ ain@@ able st@@ oc@@ ks .
P@@ ole c@@ au@@ ght — no b@@ y@@ c@@ at@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ up@@ por@@ ting loc@@ al econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a li@@ on of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the cont@@ ext of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sit@@ ting down in a ste@@ a@@ k@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a wee@@ k ?
"I might still be in the gre@@ en li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the o@@ ce@@ ans any fa@@ v@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a cont@@ ext , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ an@@ ts and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ ink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prot@@ e@@ in problem ."
"We have l@@ ost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds our food , and we are p@@ ay@@ ing a c@@ ost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that c@@ ost b@@ ene@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that c@@ ost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance of exp@@ anding wa@@ ist@@ l@@ ines .
And we are hi@@ ding that c@@ ost behind mon@@ ster prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood might best be repres@@ ented not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ p@@ per , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the o@@ ce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a li@@ kes to say that bl@@ ue is the new gre@@ en .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spec@@ t@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i gre@@ en might then be the new bl@@ ue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ ood possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ m@@ on we@@ d@@ g@@ es .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia b@@ read@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on m@@ u@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ cr@@ um@@ b@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of p@@ ec@@ an qu@@ in@@ o@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ ill@@ ed bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mo@@ k@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ in@@ t of chil@@ i f@@ la@@ ke ."
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an easy s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are av@@ ail@@ able to every family at the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ i@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve the o@@ ce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a patter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ho@@ loc@@ a@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ c@@ ed to h@@ and@@ ic@@ a@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we exp@@ ect from our food .
S@@ u@@ st@@ ain@@ ability is comp@@ lic@@ ated but d@@ in@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of mo@@ vement rec@@ ently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are lead@@ ing p@@ assi@@ on@@ ately the gre@@ en food D@@ e@@ li@@ ci@@ ous R@@ evol@@ ution .
But gre@@ en f@@ oo@@ ds often repres@@ ent a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ at@@ ers .
J@@ ust because it comes from a gre@@ en sour@@ ce doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ end@@ ly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy d@@ in@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
"Wh@@ ile we try to man@@ age dec@@ l@@ ining mar@@ ine pop@@ ul@@ ations , the me@@ dia &apos;s re@@ comm@@ en@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers , gr@@ and@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we in@@ clu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ ood ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not w@@ ill@@ ing to p@@ ass up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ ood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"As a che@@ f , I realiz@@ e the eas@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ duce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"@@ Pe@@ ople started bu@@ ying appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ers and s@@ al@@ a@@ ds , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es al@@ one ."
"@@ Pe@@ ople sp@@ ent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"@@ Pe@@ ople got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prot@@ e@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ or@@ ies over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fi@@ ed me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ viron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ y the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ d@@ ines were un@@ comm@@ on ."
"S@@ h@@ ell@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , o@@ y@@ st@@ ers , cl@@ am@@ s , ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia , cha@@ r — these were the comm@@ on species ."
"We were direc@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es to@@ wards more re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fa@@ v@@ or .
This is what the gre@@ en li@@ st says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ able species , that gre@@ en li@@ st tun@@ a that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the o@@ ce@@ an , so here we go ."
St@@ art with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ und@@ y you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the opport@@ un@@ ity you have to e@@ at this .
"I@@ n@@ v@@ ite your friends and ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I exp@@ ect a lot from food .
I exp@@ ect health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I exp@@ ect that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the comm@@ uni@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y enough that my father was a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic c@@ oo@@ k .
And he ta@@ u@@ ght me very early on about the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge that e@@ ating repres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prot@@ e@@ in ser@@ ved with cop@@ ious qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , us@@ u@@ ally r@@ ice ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get s@@ ick when I go to ste@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prot@@ e@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our o@@ ce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ d@@ en of de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing to you pos@@ si@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ tter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ st@@ e less like p@@ en@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fl@@ ect to my own pers@@ onal hi@@ stories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first ste@@ p to min@@ im@@ ize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our bl@@ ue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our res@@ our@@ ces ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ y of the comm@@ uni@@ on we call d@@ in@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate , we can beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or sm@@ all@@ er por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ ood .
And we need to sa@@ ve d@@ in@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an arch@@ it@@ ect .
"I am the only arch@@ it@@ ect in the world making buil@@ d@@ ings out of p@@ aper like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ec@@ o@@ logical issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started te@@ sting the p@@ aper tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to test the new materi@@ al for the building , but this is much str@@ on@@ ger than I exp@@ ected , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indu@@ stri@@ al materi@@ al , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the t@@ em@@ por@@ ary structure , 19@@ 90 ."
This is the first t@@ em@@ por@@ ary building made out of p@@ aper .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ b@@ es , di@@ a@@ me@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ b@@ es with a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 1@@ 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the ph@@ o@@ to , inside is the to@@ il@@ et ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed with to@@ il@@ et p@@ aper , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very us@@ e@@ ful ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar 2@@ 000 , there was a big exp@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the exp@@ o was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was ch@@ os@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on out of p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able p@@ aper ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"M@@ y go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons but after half a year , we create a lot of indu@@ stri@@ al wa@@ st@@ e , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to w@@ in the com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion to build the second P@@ om@@ p@@ id@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in F@@ r@@ ance in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an off@@ ice in P@@ ar@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t aff@@ ord it , so I decided to bring my students to P@@ ar@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ p@@ id@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ ar@@ is by ourselves ."
So we br@@ ought the p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es and the w@@ oo@@ d@@ en jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We st@@ ay@@ ed there for six years without p@@ ay@@ ing any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a tic@@ k@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ p@@ id@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very pop@@ ular mus@@ e@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ um@@ ent for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my prof@@ es@@ sion as an arch@@ it@@ ect , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for priv@@ il@@ e@@ g@@ ed people , r@@ ich people , government , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they h@@ ire us to vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ ental arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture .
"That is our prof@@ es@@ sion , even hi@@ stor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who l@@ ost their h@@ ous@@ es by natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers ."
But I must say they are no longer natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes never k@@ ill people , but coll@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ d@@ ings k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of arch@@ it@@ ects .
"Th@@ en people need some t@@ em@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no arch@@ it@@ ects working there because we are too bus@@ y working for priv@@ il@@ e@@ g@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as arch@@ it@@ ects , we can be inv@@ ol@@ ved in the re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of t@@ em@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in di@@ sa@@ ster are@@ as .
"@@ 19@@ 9@@ 4 , there was a big di@@ sa@@ ster in R@@ w@@ and@@ a , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ b@@ es , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ s@@ i , f@@ ought each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are fre@@ e@@ zing with bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a pl@@ as@@ tic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to c@@ ut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people c@@ ut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ r@@ ac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ ery exp@@ en@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then c@@ ut@@ ting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to im@@ pro@@ ve the sit@@ u@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es because this is so che@@ a@@ p and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.S@@ . dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the d@@ ur@@ ability and mo@@ ist@@ ure and ter@@ m@@ it@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 19@@ 9@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kill@@ ed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ str@@ ic@@ t , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fir@@ e after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ ff@@ ering and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was t@@ ot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h God , are you cra@@ z@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fir@@ e , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ sted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started comm@@ u@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I m@@ et the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or pl@@ as@@ tic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I ra@@ is@@ ed — did fund@@ ra@@ is@@ ing .
"I made a p@@ aper tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ li@@ sh , I used be@@ er cr@@ ates as a f@@ ound@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ p@@ ose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their pl@@ as@@ tic be@@ er cr@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ."
The col@@ or co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were exp@@ ec@@ ting to have a be@@ er inside the pl@@ as@@ tic be@@ er cr@@ ate , but it came emp@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ m@@ er with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ sted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you coll@@ ect money by y@@ our@@ self , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we sp@@ ent five wee@@ ks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it st@@ ay@@ ed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to d@@ on@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It st@@ ay@@ ed there in T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a t@@ em@@ por@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in p@@ aper can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very t@@ em@@ por@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 19@@ 9@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the loc@@ al materi@@ al to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a , after the S@@ um@@ at@@ r@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , I re@@ built Is@@ l@@ am@@ ic fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s v@@ ill@@ ages ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an are@@ a in China , ne@@ arly 7@@ 0,000 people were kill@@ ed , and also es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally many of the sch@@ o@@ ols were de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed because of the cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion between the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and the con@@ trac@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the t@@ em@@ por@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I br@@ ought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chin@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s , over 5@@ 00 s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the curr@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting ph@@ o@@ to : form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er ever year ."
"And they are very kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a t@@ em@@ por@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fam@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t h@@ all@@ s were de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , so mus@@ ici@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the t@@ em@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i br@@ ought G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our form@@ er pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er came , so they hel@@ ped us to coll@@ ect money , and I got half a million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this t@@ em@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , nex@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ it@@ i with the loc@@ al students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of loc@@ al p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no priv@@ acy .
Pe@@ ople su@@ ff@@ er m@@ ent@@ ally and phys@@ ically .
"So we went there to build par@@ ti@@ tions with all the stud@@ ent vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with p@@ aper tu@@ b@@ es , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , some of the fac@@ ility au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really nec@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at are@@ a to build st@@ and@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ oo@@ k at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vi@@ l government is doing such po@@ or con@@ struc@@ tion of the t@@ em@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , so d@@ en@@ se and so mess@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is lea@@ king , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or while I was making par@@ ti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I m@@ et a very n@@ ice may@@ or in O@@ n@@ ag@@ aw@@ a v@@ ill@@ age in M@@ i@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on bas@@ e@@ b@@ all &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ p@@ ping con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the are@@ a of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also kill@@ ed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al of the city , the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was t@@ ot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the t@@ em@@ por@@ ary ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
So this is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ um@@ ents that are b@@ el@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , in@@ clu@@ ding p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ ra@@ tional , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the per@@ spec@@ tive of another person or understand c@@ ause and eff@@ ect ."
"In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most br@@ illi@@ ant scienti@@ sts ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ d@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feel@@ ing ."
And maybe the har@@ d@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s fol@@ lo@@ wed poli@@ tics can t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year@@ -@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ous@@ ness mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ e about p@@ on@@ ies and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the sec@@ re@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous go@@ l@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ack@@ ers ."
"Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ le@@ y , like the cr@@ ack@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little ta@@ st@@ e of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ack@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other s@@ an@@ e person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I ta@@ sted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ack@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k , cr@@ ack@@ ers ."
"I ta@@ sted the cr@@ ack@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the bab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?"
"And the re@@ mark@@ able thing was that 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies , just bar@@ ely wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cr@@ ack@@ ers if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ack@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ack@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mark@@ able things about this .
"The first one is that these little 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies have already disco@@ vered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mark@@ ably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that these 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hund@@ re@@ ds and hund@@ re@@ ds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a sh@@ ort time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally , they see@@ m pretty us@@ el@@ ess ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than us@@ el@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ ep@@ ing them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to evol@@ ution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we sp@@ end so much time taking care of us@@ el@@ ess bab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mat@@ es , but also in@@ clu@@ ding other ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ ang@@ ar@@ oo@@ s and wom@@ b@@ ats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ par@@ ed to their bo@@ dies and how s@@ mar@@ t and f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ an c@@ row .
"And c@@ ro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ d@@ a@@ e , ra@@ v@@ ens , ro@@ o@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly s@@ mar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as s@@ mar@@ t as ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es in some resp@@ ects .
And this is a b@@ ird on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a too@@ l to get food .
"O@@ n the other hand , we have our friend the d@@ om@@ es@@ tic ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as d@@ um@@ b as d@@ um@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at p@@ ec@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the bab@@ ies , the New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ an c@@ row bab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They dep@@ end on their mom@@ s to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a b@@ ird ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually mat@@ ure within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood is the reason why the c@@ ro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood that se@@ ems to be connec@@ ted to know@@ le@@ dge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the ch@@ ic@@ ken , see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well ."
So they see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to p@@ ec@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , like the c@@ ro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion like the c@@ ro@@ ws ."
We have bi@@ g@@ ger bra@@ ins rel@@ ative to our bo@@ dies by far than any other anim@@ al .
"We &apos;re s@@ mar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we sur@@ vi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ gr@@ ated to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our bab@@ ies and children are dep@@ end@@ ent on us for much longer than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still pop@@ ping those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ rel@@ ation ?"
"Well an idea is that that str@@ ate@@ gy , that learning str@@ ate@@ gy , is an ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly power@@ ful , great str@@ ate@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age ."
"And that one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ st@@ o@@ don char@@ g@@ ing at you and be saying to y@@ our@@ self , &quot; A s@@ l@@ ing@@ sho@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ o@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evol@@ u@@ tions se@@ ems to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early per@@ i@@ od when we &apos;re completely prot@@ ected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as ad@@ ul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develop@@ ment divi@@ sion of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prot@@ ected bl@@ ue sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and mar@@ ke@@ ting ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like de@@ f@@ ective grow@@ n@@ u@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental st@@ age of the same species — kind of like c@@ at@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es — ex@@ cept that they &apos;re actually the br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the g@@ ar@@ d@@ en and expl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the c@@ at@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our n@@ ar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , ad@@ ult p@@ ath ."
"If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are desig@@ ned to learn — and this evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might exp@@ ect that they would have really power@@ ful learning m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain se@@ ems to be the most power@@ ful learning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ vol@@ ution in our underst@@ anding of machine learning rec@@ ently .
"And it all dep@@ ends on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ om@@ as B@@ ay@@ es , who was a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tici@@ an in the 18@@ th century ."
"And ess@@ enti@@ ally what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provi@@ de a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way using prob@@ ability the@@ ory to char@@ acter@@ ize , des@@ cri@@ be , the way that scienti@@ sts find out about the world ."
So what scienti@@ sts do is they have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that they think might be li@@ ke@@ ly to start with .
They go out and test it against the e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence .
The e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ ay@@ es sho@@ wed was a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics is at the c@@ ore of the best machine learning progra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations with con@@ di@@ tional prob@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties that they &apos;re re@@ vi@@ sing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might see@@ m like an even t@@ all@@ er order to actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ n@@ u@@ ps about st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics , they look ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ p@@ id ."
How could it be that children are doing st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ tor .
This is a bo@@ x that li@@ ghts up and pl@@ ays music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world ."
"@@ Let me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ma@@ r K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , my stud@@ ent ."
"If I sho@@ wed you this de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , you would be li@@ ke@@ ly to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor go would be to put a b@@ loc@@ k on top of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor ."
"But actually , this de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor works in a bit of a str@@ an@@ ge way ."
"Because if you wa@@ ve a b@@ loc@@ k over the top of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , something you w@@ ouldn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor will actually acti@@ v@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the li@@ ke@@ ly thing , put the b@@ loc@@ k on the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , it will only acti@@ v@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is actually has str@@ on@@ ger e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence .
It looks as if the wa@@ ving is a more eff@@ ective str@@ ate@@ gy than the other str@@ ate@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds this patter@@ n of e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds used the e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence to wa@@ ve the ob@@ ject on top of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations that will give them a con@@ di@@ tional prob@@ ability meas@@ ure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is about the world , that se@@ ems very un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly to beg@@ in with ."
"And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , sim@@ il@@ ar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is than ad@@ ul@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same t@@ ask ."
"So in these cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es , the children are using st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics to find out about the world , but after all , scienti@@ sts also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
Wh@@ en children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; play@@ ing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a b@@ un@@ ch of interesting stu@@ dies rec@@ ently that have sh@@ own this play@@ ing around is really a kind of experim@@ ental research progra@@ m .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine L@@ e@@ g@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ tors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ wed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) B@@ o@@ y : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : O@@ kay , so his first hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is has just been f@@ al@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ental not@@ e@@ book out ."
B@@ o@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize that ex@@ pres@@ sion of des@@ pa@@ ir .
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : O@@ h , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is two ."
B@@ o@@ y : That &apos;s why .
O@@ h .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ en@@ ter to do this , to try p@@ ut@@ ting it out on@@ to the other loc@@ ation ."
N@@ ot working e@@ ither .
"B@@ o@@ y : O@@ h , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ to@@ m of this bo@@ x has electr@@ ic@@ ity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electr@@ ic@@ ity ."
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
B@@ o@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : O@@ kay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
"Now that is a partic@@ ul@@ arly — that is a partic@@ ul@@ arly ad@@ or@@ able and ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine disco@@ vered is this is actually quite typ@@ ical ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expl@@ ain something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty typ@@ ical of four year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who can test five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were bar@@ ely consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how ad@@ ult consci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And ad@@ ul@@ ts &apos; atten@@ tion and consci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a sp@@ ot@@ light .
"So what happens for ad@@ ul@@ ts is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ le@@ v@@ ant or important , we should p@@ ay atten@@ tion to it ."
"O@@ ur consci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to becom@@ es ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes d@@ ark ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we p@@ ay atten@@ tion is that the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ n@@ al that makes a little part of our brain much more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , more pl@@ as@@ tic , better at learning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down acti@@ vity in all the rest of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very foc@@ used , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of atten@@ tion ."
"If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think bab@@ ies and young children see@@ m to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consci@@ ous@@ ness than a sp@@ ot@@ light of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sour@@ ces at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and pl@@ as@@ tic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ory par@@ ts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at p@@ ay@@ ing atten@@ tion , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not p@@ ay@@ ing atten@@ tion ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of atten@@ tion , the kind of consci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might exp@@ ect from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es who are desig@@ ned to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a ta@@ st@@ e of that kind of bab@@ y consci@@ ous@@ ness as ad@@ ul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about c@@ ases where we &apos;re put in a new sit@@ u@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ous@@ ness con@@ trac@@ ts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three days in P@@ ar@@ is see@@ m to be more ful@@ l of consci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , that wonder@@ ful co@@ ff@@ e@@ e you &apos;ve been dr@@ in@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ st@@ air@@ s , actually m@@ im@@ ics the eff@@ ect of those bab@@ y neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in P@@ ar@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic way to be , but it does t@@ end to leave you wa@@ king up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k in the mor@@ ning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonder@@ ful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and cr@@ oss the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of eff@@ ort into making bab@@ ies think like ad@@ ul@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es , to have op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , imag@@ in@@ ation , cre@@ ati@@ vity , innov@@ ation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the ad@@ ul@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner .
And this is the name of my cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
"In N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber of 200@@ 3 , I was inv@@ ited to take part in the la@@ un@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ ound@@ ation — that is his H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ ound@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ and@@ el@@ a had when he was im@@ pri@@ s@@ on@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en Is@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ st@@ age , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the arti@@ sts were inv@@ ited to jo@@ in M@@ and@@ el@@ a in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en Is@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s pres@@ s , st@@ anding in front of his form@@ er pri@@ son cell ."
You can see the b@@ ars of the win@@ d@@ ow there .
It was quite a mom@@ ent@@ ous oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , M@@ and@@ el@@ a told the world &apos;s pres@@ s that there was a vir@@ tual gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that pos@@ t-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id R@@ ain@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thous@@ and people were d@@ ying on a d@@ a@@ ily bas@@ is and that the front line v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge imp@@ act on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realiz@@ ed that the H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S p@@ an@@ de@@ m@@ ic was direc@@ tly aff@@ ec@@ ting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ outh Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ e@@ to@@ wn , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws , talking and using my pl@@ at@@ form as a mus@@ ici@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to M@@ and@@ el@@ a — out of resp@@ ect for the tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world resp@@ ects N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ outh Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sh@@ oc@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tun@@ ate a couple of years later to have m@@ et Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n , an incredi@@ ble cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner and acti@@ vi@@ st ."
I m@@ et him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was w@@ ear@@ ing a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a too@@ l — this t@@ ells you I am in so@@ li@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with people who have H@@ I@@ V , people who are living with H@@ I@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the sti@@ g@@ m@@ a , by w@@ ear@@ ing this t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , we can talk about this issu@@ e ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clos@@ et . &quot; &quot; I became a member of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and I &apos;m very pr@@ ou@@ d to be a member of that incredi@@ ble organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ posi@@ tive ."
They work in the fiel@@ d .
They have tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living direc@@ tly with the eff@@ ects of the vir@@ us .
They have education progra@@ ms .
They bring out the issu@@ es of sti@@ g@@ m@@ a .
It &apos;s quite ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n has sup@@ por@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n in the way that I have tri@@ ed to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fund@@ ing that I have man@@ ag@@ ed to ra@@ ise has g@@ one direc@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n and the incredi@@ ble work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ outh Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonder@@ ful people who help to sup@@ port me .
I &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"@@ Here I am in O@@ s@@ l@@ o in N@@ or@@ way , getting a n@@ ice , f@@ at ch@@ ec@@ k ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In J@@ o@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , I had the opport@@ un@@ ity to play to a ma@@ in@@ ly wh@@ ite , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ cl@@ ass S@@ outh Afr@@ ic@@ an au@@ dience who en@@ ded up in t@@ ear@@ s because I use fil@@ m c@@ li@@ ps that really t@@ ou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this ter@@ ri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ o@@ id , because they are f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solu@@ tions are ."
"A@@ ar@@ on M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the curr@@ ent health min@@ ist@@ er , atten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opport@@ un@@ ity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is ab@@ solu@@ tely nec@@ ess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ sh P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and H@@ I@@ V .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ d@@ in@@ bur@@ gh with the wonder@@ ful Afr@@ ic@@ an Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Ch@@ o@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being aff@@ ected by the A@@ I@@ D@@ S vir@@ us ."
I &apos;m sit@@ ting here in New York with M@@ ic@@ he@@ l S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the direc@@ tor of U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very h@@ on@@ o@@ red by the fact that M@@ ic@@ he@@ l inv@@ ited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening my pl@@ at@@ form and bro@@ ad@@ ening my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The mess@@ age that U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S are curr@@ ently sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vir@@ tual e@@ li@@ min@@ ation of the trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed with political will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant woman , who is H@@ I@@ V posi@@ tive and we &apos;re sm@@ il@@ ing , both of us are sm@@ il@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the bab@@ y she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her bab@@ y will re@@ ce@@ ive P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that bab@@ y can be born free of the vir@@ us ."
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the A@@ I@@ D@@ S p@@ an@@ de@@ m@@ ic .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she repres@@ ents one of m@@ illions of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had H@@ I@@ V vir@@ us — she died from A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ rel@@ ated ill@@ ness .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the vir@@ us , she was born with the vir@@ us ."
"And here she is at se@@ ven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one year@@ -@@ old bab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s su@@ ff@@ ering with ful@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ wn A@@ I@@ D@@ S and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ."
We m@@ et her in a h@@ osp@@ ital in the E@@ ast@@ er@@ n C@@ ape and sp@@ ent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very speci@@ al n@@ u@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the h@@ osp@@ ital — because we fil@@ m@@ ed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"So , it was ob@@ vi@@ ously — it was a very em@@ oti@@ onal en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feel@@ ing very res@@ on@@ ant with this direc@@ t experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ ive months later , we went back to S@@ outh Africa to me@@ et A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the ha@@ ir@@ s on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the ha@@ ir@@ s on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re st@@ anding up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ for@@ mation that took place .
Is@@ n &apos;t it ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ?
( Applause ) That r@@ ound of ap@@ plause is actually for the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the h@@ osp@@ ital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ for@@ mation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the au@@ dience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have ac@@ cess to good n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion and good me@@ d@@ ical care , and you believe that the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment G@@ o@@ als , speci@@ f@@ ically five and six , should be ab@@ solu@@ tely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa — could you ple@@ ase st@@ and up ."
"I think that &apos;s fa@@ ir to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all ."
Thank you very much .

"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on , a te@@ am of engine@@ ers was sec@@ re@@ tly moving a large ob@@ ject through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ it@@ h it , they were hop@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ c@@ k@@ et was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its n@@ ose was a sil@@ ver b@@ all with two ra@@ di@@ os inside .
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they la@@ un@@ ched their ro@@ c@@ k@@ et ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scienti@@ sts wr@@ ote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ d@@ en days , expl@@ or@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o d@@ a G@@ am@@ a and C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us had the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al g@@ lo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ tun@@ e to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ v@@ y us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about comple@@ ted ."
"It t@@ ells the story of S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a res@@ ult ."
"For days after the la@@ un@@ ch , S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k was a wonder@@ ful cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vi@@ sible by ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , it in@@ sp@@ i@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that hum@@ ans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the me@@ dia and the poli@@ tici@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our ene@@ my had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now att@@ ack us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ om@@ b@@ s , using their S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k ro@@ c@@ k@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke lo@@ ose .
S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k quick@@ ly became one of the three great sh@@ oc@@ ks to h@@ it America — hi@@ stor@@ i@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mis@@ si@@ le ga@@ p .
It exp@@ lo@@ ded an ar@@ ms r@@ ace .
It began the space r@@ ace .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gre@@ ss fund@@ ed huge we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 200 n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar we@@ ap@@ ons to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ y@@ on@@ d we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ un@@ e 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ se D@@ r@@ ill , where ten@@ s of m@@ illions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ all@@ up P@@ ol@@ l that sho@@ wed that se@@ ven in 10 Americ@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kill@@ ed ."
But S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k pro@@ vo@@ ked wonder@@ ful chang@@ es as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ up@@ port for engine@@ ering , mat@@ h and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ in@@ t C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary sho@@ ws how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use me@@ dia .
"But it also sho@@ ws how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad sit@@ u@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"In clos@@ ing , I would like to take a moment to th@@ ank one of my in@@ ve@@ st@@ ors : lon@@ g@@ time TE@@ D@@ ster , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ ker ."

So these are my ill@@ us@@ ion gl@@ ass@@ es .
They &apos;re a little bi@@ g@@ ger . They &apos;re a prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"And when you look through them , you get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se into the mind of the cy@@ ber@@ -@@ ill@@ us@@ i@@ on@@ ist ."
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a play@@ ing c@@ ard . An@@ y c@@ ard will do .

All right . V@@ ery sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mar@@ k .

"W@@ in@@ ter is like ma@@ gi@@ c . It &apos;s a time of change , when war@@ m@@ th turns to co@@ ld , water turns to s@@ now , and then it all dis@@ appe@@ ars ."
There are 1@@ 3 car@@ ds in each su@@ it . ( Mus@@ ic ) V@@ o@@ ice : E@@ ach c@@ ard repres@@ ents a p@@ ha@@ se of the 1@@ 3 l@@ un@@ ar cy@@ cl@@ es .

M@@ T : B@@ y@@ e b@@ y@@ e . ( Mus@@ ic ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less ob@@ vi@@ ous .
"H@@ ave they all ag@@ re@@ ed ? No , not completely ."
I &apos;ll bu@@ y it . I have so much money .
"I have so much money , it takes me fore@@ ver ."
"M@@ y bro@@ thers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home ."
"He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we cri@@ ed when that car@@ t with our hal@@ f-@@ e@@ at@@ en s@@ wee@@ ts was pul@@ led away from us ."
"L@@ ater , I underst@@ ood why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ wee@@ ts were a bri@@ be from a con@@ trac@@ tor who was trying to get my father to a@@ ward him a government con@@ tr@@ act .
"M@@ y father was respon@@ sible for building ro@@ a@@ ds in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r , and he had develop@@ ed a fir@@ m st@@ ance against cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion , even though he was har@@ ass@@ ed and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ."
"H@@ is was a lon@@ ely str@@ u@@ gg@@ le , because B@@ i@@ ha@@ r was also India &apos;s most cor@@ ru@@ pt state , where public off@@ ici@@ als were en@@ r@@ ic@@ h@@ ing themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the po@@ or who had no means to ex@@ pres@@ s their an@@ gu@@ ish if their children had no food or no sch@@ o@@ ol@@ ing ."
And I experi@@ enc@@ ed this most vi@@ sc@@ er@@ ally when I tra@@ vel@@ ed to re@@ m@@ ote v@@ ill@@ ages to study po@@ ver@@ ty .
"And as I went v@@ ill@@ age to v@@ ill@@ age , I remember one day , when I was fam@@ i@@ shed and ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted , and I was almost coll@@ ap@@ sing in a sc@@ or@@ ching he@@ at under a t@@ ree , and just at that time , one of the p@@ oo@@ rest men in that v@@ ill@@ age inv@@ ited me into his h@@ ut and gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ously f@@ ed me ."
O@@ n@@ ly I later realiz@@ ed that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This pro@@ found gi@@ ft of gener@@ os@@ ity chall@@ eng@@ ed and changed the very pur@@ p@@ ose of my life .
I re@@ sol@@ ved to give back .
"L@@ ater , I jo@@ ined the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , which s@@ ought to fi@@ ght such po@@ ver@@ ty by trans@@ fer@@ r@@ ing a@@ id from r@@ ich to po@@ or countries ."
"M@@ y in@@ i@@ ti@@ al work foc@@ used on U@@ g@@ and@@ a , where I foc@@ used on ne@@ g@@ oti@@ ating re@@ for@@ ms with the F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ i@@ stry of U@@ g@@ and@@ a so they could ac@@ cess our lo@@ ans ."
"But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the lo@@ ans , I remember a tri@@ p in U@@ g@@ and@@ a where I found ne@@ w@@ ly built sch@@ o@@ ols without t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks or teach@@ ers , new health cl@@ in@@ ics without dru@@ gs , and the po@@ or once again without any vo@@ ice or rec@@ our@@ se ."
It was B@@ i@@ ha@@ r all over again .
B@@ i@@ ha@@ r repres@@ ents the chall@@ en@@ ge of develop@@ ment : ab@@ ject po@@ ver@@ ty sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion .
"@@ G@@ lob@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ g@@ and@@ a repres@@ ents the tra@@ di@@ tional appro@@ ach to these problems that has been pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ n@@ ers of W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I , 5@@ 00 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ ther@@ ed in New H@@ am@@ p@@ sh@@ ire , U@@ S@@ A , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh the B@@ re@@ t@@ ton W@@ oo@@ ds in@@ stitu@@ tions , in@@ clu@@ ding the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the develop@@ ment in@@ stitu@@ tions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers were op@@ a@@ qu@@ e , with little tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ency of what they fin@@ anc@@ ed or what res@@ ul@@ ts they ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed ."
"And third , the eng@@ ag@@ ement in develop@@ ing countries was with a n@@ ar@@ row set of government el@@ it@@ es with little inter@@ action with the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , who are the ul@@ tim@@ ate b@@ ene@@ f@@ ici@@ ar@@ ies of develop@@ ment assi@@ st@@ ance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , each of these el@@ em@@ ents is op@@ ening up du@@ e to dra@@ ma@@ tic chang@@ es in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en know@@ le@@ dge , open a@@ id , open govern@@ ance , and together , they repres@@ ent three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ form@@ ing develop@@ ment and that also h@@ old gre@@ ater hope for the problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open know@@ le@@ dge .
"They get their in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion , their hope , their pr@@ ac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from suc@@ cess@@ ful em@@ er@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies in the S@@ outh ."
"And just as these N@@ or@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ outh trans@@ f@@ ers are op@@ ening up , so too are the develop@@ ment in@@ stitu@@ tions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment in@@ stitu@@ tions today are also op@@ ening for public sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y the pro@@ jects they fin@@ ance .
"In this man@@ ner , the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank has now G@@ e@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 project acti@@ vi@@ ties in 1@@ 4@@ 3 countries , and d@@ on@@ ors are using a comm@@ on pl@@ at@@ form to ma@@ p all their pro@@ jects ."
This is a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous lea@@ p for@@ ward in tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ency and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability of a@@ id .
"F@@ rom the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ n@@ a H@@ a@@ z@@ are mo@@ vement in India , using mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and social me@@ dia not just for political ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability but also for develop@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing serv@@ ices to the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ?
"So for inst@@ ance , se@@ ver@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Eu@@ rop@@ e are op@@ ening their bu@@ d@@ gets to the public ."
"This is a public bu@@ d@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really acc@@ es@@ sible or underst@@ and@@ able to an ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ en@@ ding its res@@ our@@ ces ."
"T@@ o t@@ ack@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new to@@ ols to vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e the bu@@ d@@ get so it &apos;s more underst@@ and@@ able to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , the gre@@ en col@@ or sho@@ ws those di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts that have low sp@@ en@@ ding on sch@@ o@@ ols but good educ@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red col@@ or sho@@ ws the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f ful@@ l of in@@ sc@@ ru@@ table doc@@ um@@ ents into a pub@@ lic@@ ly underst@@ and@@ able vi@@ su@@ al , and what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that with this op@@ en@@ ness , there are today new opport@@ uni@@ ties for ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and eng@@ age with government ."
"So in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines today , parents and students can give re@@ al@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ my@@ sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"And you know what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that this innov@@ ation is now sp@@ read@@ ing S@@ outh to S@@ outh , from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines to In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia , K@@ en@@ y@@ a , M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a and be@@ y@@ on@@ d ."
"Th@@ ese are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develop@@ ment work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in h@@ ands so they can together over@@ come the o@@ d@@ ds ."
"Th@@ ese exam@@ ples give new hope , new pos@@ si@@ bility to the problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , on Ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very l@@ ate at night , and at age 80 , he was typ@@ ing a 7@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age public inter@@ est li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation against cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion in a ro@@ ad project ."
"He f@@ ought ti@@ ll the end , incre@@ as@@ ing@@ ly p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate that to com@@ b@@ at cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government off@@ ici@@ als need to be h@@ on@@ est , but ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"Th@@ ese became the two boo@@ k@@ ends of his life , and the jour@@ ne@@ y he tra@@ vel@@ ed in between m@@ ir@@ ro@@ red the chang@@ ing develop@@ ment l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by these chang@@ es , and I &apos;m exc@@ ited that at the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , we are em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing these new direc@@ tions , a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ g@@ and@@ a 20 years ago ."
"We need to ra@@ dic@@ ally open up develop@@ ment so know@@ le@@ dge flo@@ ws in mul@@ ti@@ ple direc@@ tions , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing pr@@ acti@@ tion@@ ers , so a@@ id becom@@ es tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and eff@@ ective , so govern@@ ments open up and ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are eng@@ ag@@ ed and em@@ power@@ ed with re@@ form@@ ers in government ."
We need to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the coll@@ ective vo@@ ices of the po@@ or will be heard in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r , in U@@ g@@ and@@ a , and be@@ y@@ on@@ d ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ d@@ est inv@@ enti@@ ons : a b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p .
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ke@@ e@@ ps kids in school .
It st@@ op@@ s bab@@ ies from d@@ ying .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty us@@ e@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
"@@ P@@ re@@ t@@ ty y@@ uc@@ k@@ y , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ a@@ p ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ a@@ p is av@@ ail@@ able ."
"In 90 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , you will find so@@ a@@ p ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ a@@ p is the lo@@ w@@ est , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
"Wh@@ y is it that M@@ ay@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I m@@ et in India , isn &apos;t was@@ h@@ ing his h@@ ands ?"
"Well , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for b@@ a@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for la@@ und@@ ry , so@@ a@@ p is used for was@@ h@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a c@@ up@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t wa@@ st@@ e it .
What &apos;s the res@@ ult of that ?
Th@@ ink about where you learned to was@@ h your h@@ ands .
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your h@@ ands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your h@@ ands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scienti@@ sts will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ b@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , we all cop@@ y what everyone else does , and loc@@ al cul@@ tur@@ al nor@@ ms are something that sh@@ ape how we change our behavi@@ or , and this is where the priv@@ ate sec@@ tor comes in ."
I@@ con@@ ic br@@ ands like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they s@@ ell their produc@@ ts .
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers sp@@ end all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ elling mess@@ ages ."
"A hund@@ red and e@@ igh@@ te@@ en years later , the sol@@ ution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have ac@@ cess to this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a from sp@@ read@@ ing ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"In sh@@ ort , those that fi@@ ght for public health are actually dep@@ end@@ ent up@@ on the so@@ a@@ p compan@@ ies to keep pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing h@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
We &apos;ve had over 30 million vi@@ e@@ ws .
"I come from M@@ al@@ i , one of the world &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest countries ."
I gre@@ w up in a family where every d@@ in@@ ner conver@@ sa@@ tion was around social j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce .
We &apos;ve re@@ ach@@ ed over 18@@ 3 million people in 1@@ 6 countries .
"L@@ ast wee@@ k , my te@@ am and I sp@@ ent time vi@@ sit@@ ing mo@@ thers that have all experi@@ enc@@ ed the same thing : the de@@ ath of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
"S@@ he had the most beautiful sm@@ ile , the sm@@ ile , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chan@@ ce ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ y@@ o , is her second one ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : bu@@ y her so@@ a@@ p ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inv@@ en@@ tion in public health .
"We are all famili@@ ar with these m@@ und@@ an@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
And it is quite pos@@ si@@ bly the lar@@ g@@ est ever disco@@ vered .
The inter@@ national cri@@ min@@ al tri@@ b@@ un@@ al de@@ li@@ vered a number of s@@ ent@@ ences for cri@@ m@@ es against hum@@ an@@ ity and gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de .
"It is also about de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tur@@ al her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the very n@@ oti@@ on that they ever ex@@ ist@@ ed ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kill@@ ing ; it is about the d@@ en@@ i@@ ed id@@ enti@@ ty .
"@@ P@@ h@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ y is about em@@ pa@@ thy , and the famili@@ ar@@ ity of these it@@ ems gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e em@@ pa@@ thy ."
( Applause )
Th@@ ink of a hard cho@@ ice you &apos;ll face in the ne@@ ar future .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a chall@@ en@@ ge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) So this is the s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch of the two st@@ ates .
One is t@@ ot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e order .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ t@@ ori@@ al tra@@ di@@ tions .
"So this br@@ ings me to a qui@@ e@@ ter , small work called H@@ and@@ hel@@ d ."
So here is the first test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
In the sh@@ ape of an am@@ p@@ hi@@ the@@ ater that &apos;s sc@@ al@@ ed to the size of an au@@ dience as per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved from somebody from the st@@ age .
S@@ e@@ ated in this au@@ dience are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small fi@@ gu@@ res .
They &apos;re m@@ ech@@ an@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to cl@@ a@@ p of their own free will .
It also has an all@@ uring and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion ."
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government maj@@ or , which means I had to wr@@ ite a lot of p@@ ap@@ ers ."
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pl@@ an .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the p@@ aper would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single p@@ aper .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age sen@@ i@@ or the@@ s@@ is , a p@@ aper you &apos;re sup@@ posed to sp@@ end a year on ."
"And I knew for a p@@ aper like that , my nor@@ m@@ al work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this ."
This is how the year would go .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d b@@ um@@ p it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ick it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little st@@ air@@ case ."
How hard could it be to wal@@ k up the st@@ air@@ s ?
"@@ No big de@@ al , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two wee@@ ks ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
"It was a very , very bad the@@ s@@ is . ( Laughter )"
"I just wanted to en@@ jo@@ y that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )"
"@@ No , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a wr@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ b@@ log@@ ger guy ."
I wr@@ ite the b@@ lo@@ g W@@ a@@ it But Why .
"And a couple of years ago , I decided to wr@@ ite about pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation ."
"And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I la@@ b that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven n@@ on-@@ pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator , so I could comp@@ are them ."
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
"@@ &#91; This is a perf@@ ect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ op@@ e ! &#93; So the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ a@@ ker will make the ra@@ tional deci@@ sion to do something produc@@ tive , but the M@@ on@@ key doesn &apos;t like that pl@@ an , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ tually , let &apos;s read the entire W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age of the N@@ anc@@ y K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ y@@ a H@@ ar@@ ding sc@@ and@@ al , because I just re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed that that happened ."
"Now , in the anim@@ al world , that works f@@ ine ."
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , hum@@ ans are just another anim@@ al species ."
"But , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ b@@ al times ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ anc@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
And he wan@@ ts to take all of that into ac@@ coun@@ t .
And he wan@@ ts to just have us do wh@@ at@@ ever makes sense to be doing right now .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less ple@@ as@@ ant , for the sa@@ ke of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a conf@@ lic@@ t .
I call it the D@@ ark P@@ l@@ ay@@ ground .
"And the question is , in this sit@@ u@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ever get h@@ im@@ self over here to this bl@@ ue z@@ one , a less ple@@ as@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"Well , turns out the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator has a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an an@@ ge@@ l , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and wat@@ ching over him in his d@@ ar@@ k@@ est mom@@ ents — someone called the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster ."
"And import@@ an@@ tly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed of ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of m@@ ine to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
D@@ o we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to re@@ le@@ ase the spe@@ a@@ kers ."
"And I op@@ en@@ ed up the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me ."
"And finally , finally , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on-@@ M@@ a@@ ker can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to wr@@ ite about on the b@@ lo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was ama@@ z@@ ed by the respon@@ se ."
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally thousands of e@@ ma@@ il@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
"Th@@ ese are people who were n@@ ur@@ ses , b@@ an@@ kers , pa@@ inter@@ s , engine@@ ers and lots and lots of P@@ h@@ D students ."
But what struc@@ k me was the con@@ tr@@ ast between the light t@@ one of the p@@ ost and the he@@ av@@ iness of these e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a d@@ ark place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation ."
"So if you wanted a car@@ e@@ er where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the ar@@ ts , something ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ i@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve g@@ one out and done the hard work to get mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m , get things going ."
"And it &apos;s this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m kind of pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation that &apos;s much less vi@@ sible and much less tal@@ ked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m de@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ e-@@ based kind ."
It &apos;s us@@ u@@ ally su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed qui@@ e@@ tly and priv@@ ately .
"And it can be the sour@@ ce of a huge amount of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m un@@ happ@@ iness , and re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place ."
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cra@@ m@@ ming for some project .
"It &apos;s that lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ation has made them feel like a spec@@ t@@ ator , at times , in their own lives ."
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ at@@ ors .
"Now , you might not all be a m@@ ess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a heal@@ thy relation@@ ship with de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , but remember : the M@@ on@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ a@@ ki@@ est tr@@ ick is when the de@@ ad@@ l@@ ines ar@@ en &apos;t there ."
"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a L@@ i@@ fe C@@ al@@ end@@ ar .
That &apos;s one bo@@ x for every wee@@ k of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ end@@ ar ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on something in life ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
"And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today ."
( Laughter ) You know .
S@@ ome@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
"One of the people he re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ a@@ c he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep em@@ oti@@ on , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
We have it b@@ ack@@ wards . R@@ ight ?
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
So where does that feel@@ ing come from ?
N@@ o@@ thing pers@@ onal .
"And so we evol@@ ved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ fe@@ ty , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ed ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
The mo@@ der@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"Th@@ ese are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like c@@ at@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the r@@ ules , I could get in tr@@ ou@@ ble or l@@ ose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was t@@ elling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was t@@ elling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her lead@@ ers .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines is not because they nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily h@@ ire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fe@@ ar their lead@@ ers .
"The clos@@ est an@@ al@@ o@@ gy I can give to what a great lead@@ er is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
We would never do it .
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite .
It &apos;s not the num@@ bers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very defin@@ i@@ tion of lead@@ er@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ tr@@ act .
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
D@@ o we have an issu@@ e with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice
And B@@ o@@ b re@@ f@@ used .
"You see , B@@ o@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ duce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a f@@ ur@@ l@@ ough progra@@ m .
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ sec@@ u@@ ti@@ vely ."
Th@@ ose who could aff@@ ord it more would tra@@ de with those who could aff@@ ord it less .
L@@ e@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is a cho@@ ice . It is not a r@@ ank .
"They are au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties , and we do what they say because they have au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"I heard a story of some M@@ ar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the M@@ ar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the off@@ ic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the fiel@@ d , his men br@@ ought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lead@@ ers because they go first .
"They will give us their b@@ loo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s to see that their lead@@ er &apos;s vi@@ sion comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your b@@ loo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organiz@@ ation we would all like to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ pop@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ pop@@ o and M@@ p@@ um@@ al@@ ang@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ et@@ em@@ a ."
"W@@ ater and electr@@ ic@@ ity sup@@ ply are as un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table as the we@@ a@@ ther , and gro@@ wing up in these t@@ ough sit@@ u@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was re@@ la@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of m@@ ine in win@@ ter , and we were s@@ un@@ b@@ a@@ thing ."
The L@@ im@@ pop@@ o su@@ n gets really h@@ ot in win@@ ter .
"So as we were s@@ un@@ b@@ a@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to b@@ a@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sh@@ oc@@ king st@@ ati@@ s@@ tics ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per ac@@ cess to water and s@@ an@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hund@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"The disease lea@@ ves e@@ ight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind each and every year . The sh@@ oc@@ king part about it is that to av@@ o@@ id being in@@ f@@ ected with tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no me@@ dic@@ ine , no p@@ ill@@ s , no in@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C speci@@ al sp@@ ice , you know ?"
"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the form@@ ul@@ a ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into pr@@ acti@@ ce .
"F@@ ast for@@ ward four years later , after having wr@@ it@@ ten a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age business pl@@ an on the cell phone , having wr@@ it@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ g@@ est pat@@ ent@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more b@@ a@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that .

"You liter@@ ally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to b@@ a@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tri@@ ed to make it work in high school with the lim@@ ited res@@ our@@ ces I had , I went to univer@@ sity , m@@ et a few people , got it into pr@@ acti@@ ce , and we have a fully fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing produc@@ t that &apos;s ready to go to the mark@@ et . It &apos;s actually av@@ ail@@ able on the mark@@ et ."
So we learned a few l@@ ess@@ ons in comm@@ er@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath av@@ ail@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or comm@@ uni@@ ties don &apos;t bu@@ y produc@@ ts in b@@ ul@@ k .
So we p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ed D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these innov@@ ative little s@@ ac@@ he@@ ts .
"You just s@@ n@@ a@@ p them in half , and you s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the c@@ ool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ t@@ es one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting the produc@@ t ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key val@@ ue pro@@ posi@@ tion , which was cle@@ an@@ l@@ iness and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a r@@ ich man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produc@@ t into pr@@ acti@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t on@@ to a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the re@@ ta@@ il mark@@ et , and one question I have for the au@@ dience today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ a@@ ds of L@@ im@@ pop@@ o , with an allo@@ w@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a wee@@ k , I came up with a way for the world not to b@@ a@@ the ."
What &apos;s st@@ op@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot thr@@ ough@@ out this whole process , last year Google nam@@ ed me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also curr@@ ently the best stud@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur in the world , the first Afr@@ ic@@ an to get that ac@@ col@@ a@@ de , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to b@@ a@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ ive years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ c@@ al , and I re@@ turned to the me@@ d@@ ical univer@@ sity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real pati@@ ents and I wor@@ e the wh@@ ite co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ ag@@ ement con@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that surpri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I sp@@ ent .
"The first one was that the comm@@ on the@@ me of the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions we had were h@@ osp@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and c@@ os@@ t-@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that se@@ ver@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I m@@ et , form@@ er friends from me@@ d@@ ical school , who I knew to be some of the s@@ mar@@ test , most m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated , eng@@ ag@@ ed and p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate people I &apos;d ever m@@ et , many of them had turned cy@@ n@@ ical , dis@@ eng@@ ag@@ ed , or had dist@@ anc@@ ed themselves from h@@ osp@@ ital man@@ ag@@ ement ."
"So with this foc@@ us on c@@ os@@ t-@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the pati@@ ent ?"
M@@ any countries that you repres@@ ent and where I come from str@@ u@@ gg@@ le with the c@@ ost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms a@@ i@@ m at h@@ ol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for pati@@ ents for sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach pati@@ ents ."
"In se@@ ver@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the t@@ ar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the c@@ os@@ tly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an exp@@ en@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il pati@@ ent ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of phys@@ ici@@ ans , this is a way to h@@ old c@@ os@@ ts down ."
"And ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , some phys@@ ici@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the ful@@ l li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their pati@@ ents ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ ag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a ste@@ p back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve ? &quot;"
"@@ U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at im@@ pro@@ ving health for the pati@@ ents , and we need to do so at a lim@@ ited , or aff@@ ord@@ able , c@@ ost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by val@@ ue : out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents rel@@ ative to the money we sp@@ end ."
This was des@@ cri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the c@@ os@@ ts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ ast@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ ma@@ tic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ ff@@ ers from pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"Now living in Eu@@ rop@@ e , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the a@@ verage h@@ osp@@ ital , he will have the ris@@ k of becom@@ ing in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start w@@ ear@@ ing di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent ris@@ k . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ in@@ ic called the M@@ ar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ l@@ in@@ i@@ k , the ris@@ k would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ ither you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 ris@@ k ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many h@@ osp@@ it@@ als for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
N@@ o@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the h@@ osp@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who m@@ et at their an@@ n@@ ual me@@ e@@ ting , and they were di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"T@@ o the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ e@@ ty of me@@ t@@ al piec@@ es , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realiz@@ ed they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to meas@@ ure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact sp@@ ent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ? &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h , we should meas@@ ure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should meas@@ ure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started meas@@ uring , and started sh@@ ar@@ ing the data ."
"@@ V@@ ery quick@@ ly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the b@@ one of the pati@@ ent before you put the me@@ t@@ al s@@ ha@@ ft in , it actually la@@ sted a lot longer , and most pati@@ ents would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ form@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ical pr@@ acti@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ ince then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ to@@ m ?"
"And they vi@@ s@@ it each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of im@@ pro@@ vement ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best res@@ ul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were meas@@ uring , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the phys@@ ici@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start meas@@ uring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous im@@ pro@@ vement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the c@@ ost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have foc@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the lo@@ w@@ est c@@ os@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ p@@ ose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ par@@ ed the U.S@@ . and S@@ we@@ d@@ en ."
They looked at how many pati@@ ents have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on se@@ ven years after the first sur@@ g@@ ery .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ d@@ en ."
"So many un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies , and so much un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary su@@ ff@@ ering for all the pati@@ ents who were oper@@ ated on in that se@@ ven year per@@ i@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sa@@ v@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a qu@@ ality which is b@@ el@@ ow the a@@ verage in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would foc@@ us a lot more on meas@@ uring qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of a@@ verage O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 5@@ 00 billion U.S@@ . dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these num@@ bers are f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a par@@ a@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ gu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my pr@@ acti@@ ce as a con@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hund@@ red or more than a hund@@ red doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other h@@ osp@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care st@@ a@@ ff every year ."
The one thing they have in comm@@ on is they really care about what they ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve in terms of qu@@ ality for their pati@@ ents .
"@@ P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans are , like most of you in the au@@ dience , very com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive ."
They were always best in cl@@ ass .
We were always best in cl@@ ass .
"And if somebody can show them that the res@@ ult they per@@ form for their pati@@ ents is no better than what others do , they will do wh@@ at@@ ever it takes to im@@ pro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But phys@@ ici@@ ans have another char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er re@@ cog@@ ni@@ tion .
"If a car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist call@@ s another car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist in a com@@ pe@@ ting h@@ osp@@ ital and di@@ sc@@ us@@ ses why that other h@@ osp@@ ital has so much better res@@ ul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to im@@ pro@@ ve .
"So it is , by meas@@ uring and cre@@ ating tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ency , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous im@@ pro@@ vement , which is what this sli@@ de sho@@ ws ."
"Now , you may say this is a n@@ ice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to meas@@ ure and comp@@ are what we ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ic in@@ stitu@@ tions , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ ch@@ ool , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ d@@ en , B@@ C@@ G has form@@ ed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an acr@@ on@@ y@@ m ."
It st@@ ands for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together lead@@ ing phys@@ ici@@ ans and pati@@ ents to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we meas@@ ure , and to make those st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : c@@ at@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back p@@ ain , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for inst@@ ance , heart att@@ ack , and pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ext year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do e@@ ight dise@@ ases , the year after , 1@@ 6 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pl@@ an to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ d@@ en ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ ive months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ g@@ est univer@@ sity h@@ osp@@ ital in N@@ or@@ ther@@ n Eu@@ rop@@ e ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vi@@ sion : I want to man@@ age my big in@@ stitu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to pati@@ ents ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with phys@@ ici@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other st@@ a@@ ff , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia in children ."
"The group di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we meas@@ ure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we meas@@ ure it better than we do ?
"We di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
"And we di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed what are the c@@ os@@ ts for these pati@@ ents , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more eff@@ ici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ e@@ ting , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , he st@@ ood up ."

I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the gre@@ at@@ est for@@ ms to make the world a better place .
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge , I started so@@ f@@ tw@@ are compan@@ ies ."
We learned a lot from those fa@@ il@@ u@@ res .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er M@@ i@@ ke T@@ y@@ son on the TED st@@ age , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body has a pl@@ an , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very cle@@ ar p@@ ath gener@@ ating cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ ven@@ ues ?
"The bot@@ to@@ m compan@@ ies had in@@ ten@@ se fund@@ ing , they even had business mo@@ d@@ els in some c@@ ases , but they didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"D@@ ri@@ ver@@ s were looking for ex@@ tr@@ a money ; it was very , very important ."
"S@@ ome of our early suc@@ cess@@ es , C@@ it@@ y@@ sear@@ ch , came out when people needed we@@ b p@@ ages ."
And then some of our fa@@ il@@ u@@ res .
"We started a company called Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , it was an on@@ line en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment company ."
The idea mat@@ ters a lot .
"Th@@ ank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great au@@ dience ."

"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully en@@ ter@@ ed the stud@@ ent life of l@@ ec@@ tures , par@@ ties and tra@@ ff@@ ic c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"@@ Un@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ ep@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ sec@@ ure and fund@@ am@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fa@@ il@@ ure and of the emp@@ t@@ iness that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ bl@@ ing with my b@@ a@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hund@@ red times before , when su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the cl@@ ar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ m@@ ist@@ a@@ k@@ able ."
&quot; She is op@@ ening the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ si@@ sted , days and then wee@@ ks of it , on and on , n@@ ar@@ r@@ ating everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a l@@ ec@@ ture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did not@@ ice that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sometimes sli@@ p@@ ped and that it oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally m@@ ir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ ex@@ pres@@ sed em@@ oti@@ on ."
"So , for example , if I was an@@ gr@@ y and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ dep@@ t at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated ."
"A sub@@ tle con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the imp@@ lic@@ ation that nor@@ m@@ al people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very ser@@ i@@ ously wrong ."
I sp@@ ent some time t@@ elling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fa@@ ir , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my str@@ an@@ ge comm@@ ent@@ ator ."
"For example , I was part of a stud@@ ent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news b@@ ul@@ le@@ t@@ ins around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment which was run@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A h@@ osp@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion fol@@ lo@@ wed , the first of many , a di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , t@@ or@@ men@@ ting sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hum@@ ili@@ ation and des@@ pa@@ ir about myself and my pr@@ osp@@ ects ."
"But having been enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ed to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sy@@ m@@ p@@ to@@ m , my fe@@ ar and re@@ si@@ st@@ ance to@@ wards it in@@ ten@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"Now ess@@ enti@@ ally , this repres@@ ented taking an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive st@@ ance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ic ci@@ vi@@ l war , and in turn this ca@@ used the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and gro@@ w pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that gl@@ ass of water ?
"In eff@@ ect , a v@@ ici@@ ous cy@@ cle of fe@@ ar , av@@ o@@ id@@ ance , mi@@ str@@ ust and mis@@ underst@@ anding had been est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , and this was a b@@ at@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole fr@@ en@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ qu@@ e vi@@ sions , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , in@@ trac@@ table d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ ons ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age and des@@ pa@@ ir of those years , it se@@ ems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A bro@@ ken and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ne@@ y , but the person who em@@ er@@ g@@ ed was a sur@@ vi@@ v@@ or and would ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely gro@@ w into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ m@@ ed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ or@@ ies gro@@ w p@@ ale and fa@@ in@@ t in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as l@@ ate as M@@ ay , but sum@@ m@@ er always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ d@@ it those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ought with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to w@@ el@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ed , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ared so h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this resp@@ ect , a v@@ ital first ste@@ p was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."

"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sit@@ ting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prot@@ ect them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."

I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ h@@ y .
O@@ r is it photograp@@ h@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photograp@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ er@@ a ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photograp@@ h@@ y started as I got my first dig@@ ital cam@@ er@@ a at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er p@@ assion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ er@@ a , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photograp@@ h with a cam@@ er@@ a , the process ends when you pres@@ s the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photograp@@ h@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pres@@ s the tri@@ g@@ ger ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ exp@@ ected tw@@ ist .
"And des@@ p@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"O@@ r phot@@ os like these — both d@@ ark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a comm@@ on go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"When I say re@@ al@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o@@ -@@ re@@ al@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photograp@@ h ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ e@@ f moment to think to figure out the tr@@ ick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tr@@ ick that makes it look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the ill@@ us@@ ion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the per@@ spec@@ tive is the ill@@ us@@ ion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realiz@@ ed on a tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal sur@@ face ."
"It &apos;s not really what is re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks re@@ al@@ is@@ tic really ."
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different piec@@ es of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"@@ Here we have three perf@@ ec@@ tly imag@@ in@@ able phys@@ ical ob@@ jects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tr@@ ick our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ b@@ ining photograp@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ b@@ ining different re@@ ali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photograp@@ h look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our d@@ a@@ ily lives ."
"But when com@@ b@@ ining photograp@@ h@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple r@@ ules to fol@@ low to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic res@@ ult .
"As you can see , these imag@@ es ar@@ en &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ b@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that phot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same per@@ spec@@ tive .
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , phot@@ os com@@ b@@ ined should have the same typ@@ e of light ."
And these two imag@@ es both ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same typ@@ e of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different imag@@ es beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was comp@@ os@@ ed .
"So by mat@@ ching col@@ or , con@@ tr@@ ast and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ d@@ ers between the different imag@@ es , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hi@@ c de@@ f@@ ects like dep@@ th of fiel@@ d , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ d@@ ers between the different imag@@ es and make it look like one single image , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hund@@ re@@ ds of l@@ ay@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pul@@ ated .
But this image is actually enti@@ re@@ ly comp@@ os@@ ed of photograp@@ h@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
"I pers@@ on@@ ally think that it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comp@@ r@@ om@@ ise with the ideas in your head ."
But it does re@@ qu@@ ire a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pl@@ an it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ sh@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sho@@ res are from a different loc@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic res@@ ult , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ b@@ ining the different photograp@@ h@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the phot@@ os , the res@@ ult can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imag@@ in@@ ation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
This is the sort of behavi@@ or that aff@@ ects all of us .
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : J@@ u@@ li@@ an , w@@ el@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ e@@ a@@ ks , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed more cl@@ assi@@ fi@@ ed doc@@ um@@ ents than the rest of the world &apos;s me@@ dia com@@ b@@ ined ."
C@@ an that pos@@ si@@ bly be true ?
"@@ J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge : Y@@ e@@ ah , can it pos@@ si@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s me@@ dia is doing such a bad job that a little group of acti@@ vi@@ sts is able to re@@ le@@ ase more of that typ@@ e of information than the rest of the world pres@@ s com@@ b@@ ined .
C@@ A : How does it work ?
How do people re@@ le@@ ase the doc@@ um@@ ents ?
And how do you sec@@ ure their priv@@ acy ?
"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — cl@@ ass@@ ical wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ w@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this st@@ at@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , p@@ ass it through le@@ g@@ al j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ d@@ en and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those le@@ g@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the re@@ g@@ ular pos@@ t@@ al ma@@ il , enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a re@@ g@@ ular news organiz@@ ation , form@@ at it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant dat@@ ab@@ ases of information — re@@ le@@ ase it to the public and then de@@ f@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able le@@ g@@ al and political att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an eff@@ ort to en@@ sure the doc@@ um@@ ents are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate , but you actually almost never know who the id@@ enti@@ ty of the sour@@ ce is ?"
"@@ J@@ A : That &apos;s right , ye@@ ah . V@@ ery r@@ ar@@ ely do we ever know , and if we find out at some st@@ age then we de@@ st@@ ro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( P@@ h@@ one r@@ ing ) God d@@ am@@ n it .
( Laughter ) C@@ A : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A as@@ king what the co@@ de is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this doc@@ um@@ ent up ...
So this was a story in K@@ en@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ port .
This was a sec@@ re@@ t int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence re@@ port comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an government after its elec@@ tion in 200@@ 4 .
"@@ P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ y@@ a was r@@ ul@@ ed by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p M@@ o@@ i for about 1@@ 8 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ t@@ ator of K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ a@@ k@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion in K@@ en@@ y@@ a — they comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed this re@@ port , sp@@ ent about two million p@@ ounds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ port ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for political le@@ verage on M@@ o@@ i , who was the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est man — still is the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est man — in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of K@@ en@@ y@@ an jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ ag@@ ed to get h@@ old of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed that re@@ port , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ b@@ a@@ k@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p M@@ o@@ i , so this re@@ port then became a de@@ ad al@@ b@@ at@@ r@@ oss around P@@ re@@ si@@ dent K@@ i@@ b@@ a@@ k@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the re@@ port lea@@ ked into K@@ en@@ y@@ a , not from the off@@ ici@@ al me@@ dia , but in@@ direc@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ ion , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah . So this became front p@@ age of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding countries of K@@ en@@ y@@ a , in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ an and S@@ outh Afr@@ ic@@ an pres@@ s ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an pres@@ s feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it r@@ an for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ ight on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence re@@ port , which changed the res@@ ult of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your le@@ ak really sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) C@@ A : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p from this B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad air@@ stri@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p ."
"This is — this is in@@ ten@@ se materi@@ al , I should war@@ n you ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ... just f@@ uc@@ k@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; e@@ m just open &apos; e@@ m up ."
"I see your el@@ ement , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..@@ ."

"@@ God d@@ am@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ h@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad to f@@ ur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three att@@ ac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that att@@ ack , right , in@@ clu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah . T@@ w@@ o Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 1@@ 8 and 2@@ 6 people kill@@ ed all together .
C@@ A : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key el@@ ement of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gr@@ oss di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in for@@ ce .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a re@@ la@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an Ap@@ ac@@ he he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter sit@@ ting up at one k@@ il@@ ome@@ ter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0@@ -@@ m@@ illi@@ me@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ ells on everyone — looking for any exc@@ use to do so — and kill@@ ing people re@@ sc@@ u@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts inv@@ ol@@ ved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S@@ . int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ence an@@ al@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ sted , and it &apos;s al@@ le@@ g@@ ed that he conf@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have lea@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 cl@@ assi@@ fi@@ ed U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have d@@ en@@ i@@ ed re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been char@@ g@@ ed , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ab@@ les and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had re@@ le@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ a@@ vi@@ k U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y , but this is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily connec@@ ted ."
"I mean , I was a known vi@@ sit@@ or of that em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ ce@@ ive thousands of U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y di@@ pl@@ om@@ ati@@ c c@@ ab@@ les ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed them . ( C@@ A : You would ? ) J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah . ( C@@ A : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true hum@@ an@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ uses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at dec@@ l@@ assi@@ fi@@ ed c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of materi@@ al that &apos;s there ."
C@@ A : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y ?"
Why is it right to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge lea@@ king of sec@@ re@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ en@@ ding economic eff@@ ort into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ n@@ al that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ en@@ ding work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pr@@ acti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , e@@ ither to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of pers@@ onal — pers@@ on@@ ally id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate sec@@ re@@ ts — you know , your rec@@ or@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate sec@@ re@@ t — but we de@@ al with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ w@@ ers that are coming for@@ ward that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated ."
C@@ A : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ m@@ oti@@ v@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S@@ . mil@@ it@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an inc@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It sho@@ ws a U.S@@ . sol@@ di@@ er l@@ augh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pres@@ sion , has given the im@@ pres@@ sion , to m@@ illions of people around the world that U.S@@ . sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ ion . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ ion of the people who are p@@ ay@@ ing for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
C@@ A : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of d@@ ark sec@@ re@@ ts in compan@@ ies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any ir@@ on@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , y@@ our@@ self , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sour@@ ces ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ e@@ a@@ ks dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sour@@ ces who are dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents on other sour@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come for@@ ward , that would be a tr@@ ick@@ y sit@@ u@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pres@@ um@@ ably ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ ell@@ ed to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interest@@ ed , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cur@@ ious as to the op@@ in@@ ion in the TED au@@ dience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vi@@ e@@ ws of W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ e@@ a@@ ks and of J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker view ?
"@@ J@@ A : O@@ h , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet lea@@ ked , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sa@@ m@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well b@@ lo@@ w@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ b@@ an@@ ia , like the well b@@ lo@@ w@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ port — a sort of engine@@ ering an@@ al@@ ys@@ is into what happened — saying that , in fact , sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous com@@ pe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tr@@ uc@@ ks there and b@@ lo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ b@@ an@@ i@@ an government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ port had nothing on the top of it , so it was an ex@@ tre@@ me@@ ly difficult doc@@ um@@ ent for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a com@@ pe@@ ting o@@ il fir@@ m just sort of play@@ ing the issu@@ e up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The materi@@ al looks good , it fe@@ els right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a le@@ tter just this wee@@ k from the company who wr@@ ote it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the sour@@ ce — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the sour@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , tell us more ."
"What doc@@ um@@ ent is it , pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had le@@ g@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that doc@@ um@@ ent ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ o@@ ft W@@ ord I@@ D .
Y@@ e@@ ah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a materi@@ al is , is to try and get these guys to wr@@ ite le@@ t@@ ters ."
C@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah . H@@ ave you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of ser@@ ious fund@@ ra@@ is@@ ing and engine@@ ering eff@@ ort ."
So our pub@@ lic@@ ation r@@ ate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ im@@ iz@@ ed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of gro@@ wing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ wer dis@@ clos@@ u@@ res of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k , basically jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fund@@ ing of jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Y@@ e@@ ah , and tru@@ sted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to gro@@ w very quick@@ ly because of the sort of materi@@ al we de@@ al with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will de@@ al with the high@@ est national sec@@ ur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer sec@@ ur@@ ity c@@ ases ."
C@@ A : So help us understand a bit about you pers@@ on@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a k@@ id you went to 3@@ 7 different sch@@ o@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the mo@@ vi@@ e business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : I mean , a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the mo@@ vi@@ e business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ A : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ack@@ er at an early age and r@@ an into the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist acti@@ vi@@ st at an early age ."
"I wr@@ ote a mag@@ a@@ z@@ ine , was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be car@@ e@@ ful with h@@ ack@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed for vari@@ ous things .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , at the moment , it &apos;s m@@ os@@ tly dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ r@@ ase is not , not as n@@ ice as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your c@@ ore val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that hel@@ ped de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the c@@ ore val@@ ues : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ b@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my char@@ ac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quick@@ ly in the last minut@@ e , the story : what happened in I@@ c@@ el@@ and ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , r@@ an into tr@@ ou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news serv@@ ice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted from run@@ ning the story ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , they publi@@ ci@@ z@@ ed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ c@@ el@@ and . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ e@@ ah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ c@@ el@@ and went through this fin@@ anci@@ al cri@@ s@@ is .
It was the har@@ d@@ est h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts b@@ an@@ king sec@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the economy .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so we re@@ le@@ ase this re@@ port in J@@ u@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on a@@ ir , like out of a mo@@ vi@@ e : in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite instead , for all that time , as a f@@ ill@@ er , and we became very fam@@ ous in I@@ c@@ el@@ and , went to I@@ c@@ el@@ and and sp@@ o@@ ke about this issu@@ e ."
"And there was a feel@@ ing in the community that that should never happen again , and as a res@@ ult , working with I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ tici@@ ans and some other inter@@ national le@@ g@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ack@@ age of le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation for I@@ c@@ el@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the free pres@@ s , with the str@@ on@@ g@@ est jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"I@@ c@@ el@@ and &apos;s a N@@ or@@ di@@ c country , so , like N@@ or@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was p@@ ass@@ ed by the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ anim@@ ously ."
C@@ A : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more li@@ ke@@ ly to be B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us wat@@ ching B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be play@@ ed for e@@ ither way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ec@@ h le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation and tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ency le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of eff@@ ort , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting the au@@ dience &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion to say , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , be car@@ e@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( C@@ A : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my car@@ e@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Yor@@ ker a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I gro@@ w up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great bl@@ ess@@ ing as a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ cess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I famili@@ ar with the 50 st@@ ates in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ s@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pr@@ om@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ v@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of reli@@ gi@@ ous sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ c@@ end@@ ant posi@@ tions in the sy@@ n@@ a@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the m@@ os@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these r@@ ules to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily re@@ le@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary posi@@ tion com@@ par@@ ed to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very ser@@ ious problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed .
But the bas@@ ic thing is the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ c@@ end@@ ant posi@@ tion .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ ive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ us@@ ive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of God , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I p@@ ay them equ@@ al p@@ ay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very ser@@ ious b@@ light that ca@@ uses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ ort to viol@@ ence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"N@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ us@@ ive in all el@@ em@@ ents of human ri@@ ghts in enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing the de@@ ath p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it c@@ os@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to s@@ end a person to be ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ uses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital m@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ ation .
"And sometimes , in more ex@@ tre@@ me c@@ ases but not very r@@ are c@@ ases , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the gir@@ l can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the f@@ em@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally m@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in that way ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family becom@@ es m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the gir@@ l br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women partic@@ ul@@ arly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from Africa into s@@ la@@ very in the New W@@ or@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a m@@ and@@ ate from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ port every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national bor@@ d@@ ers every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ m@@ ory U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a gir@@ l that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned gir@@ l br@@ ings se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the a@@ verage bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The se@@ x tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the t@@ ot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
S@@ we@@ d@@ en has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ d@@ en decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the m@@ ale cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has g@@ one down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite posi@@ tion ."
"For every m@@ ale ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ le@@ g@@ al se@@ x tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now an@@ al@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and the reason is that the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ ion in the Ar@@ my or a company in the M@@ ar@@ ines — the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ut@@ e a r@@ ap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ ious about the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al p@@ ay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an a@@ verage than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head d@@ rop@@ ping b@@ om@@ b@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ ort to viol@@ ence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ uses , are the bas@@ ic ca@@ uses , of ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic c@@ ause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The a@@ verage man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls qui@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the priv@@ il@@ e@@ g@@ ed posi@@ tion that we oc@@ c@@ up@@ y , and this is very sim@@ il@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had ex@@ ist@@ ed ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a priv@@ il@@ e@@ g@@ ed posi@@ tion ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the power@@ ful n@@ ations like this one , and where you come from , Eu@@ rop@@ e and so for@@ th , who have in@@ fl@@ u@@ ence and who have fre@@ e@@ dom to spe@@ ak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to r@@ ac@@ i@@ al di@@ sc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation against gir@@ ls and women all over the world ."
The a@@ verage woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally m@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ ated and so for@@ th .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fer@@ ence , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ b@@ ands to realiz@@ e that these ab@@ uses on the colle@@ ge cam@@ p@@ uses and the mil@@ it@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job mark@@ et , need to prot@@ ect your d@@ augh@@ ters and your gr@@ and@@ d@@ augh@@ ters ."

"When I was a stud@@ ent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ le@@ ak ."
The population expl@@ os@@ ion was un@@ st@@ op@@ p@@ able .
G@@ lob@@ al fam@@ ine was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
A cancer ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic ca@@ used by chem@@ ic@@ als in the environment was going to sh@@ or@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id ra@@ in was f@@ all@@ ing on the fore@@ sts .
The des@@ er@@ t was adv@@ anc@@ ing by a m@@ ile or two a year .
"The o@@ il was run@@ ning out , and a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar win@@ ter would fin@@ ish us off ."
"N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly , if you look at what actually happened in my li@@ fe@@ time , the a@@ verage per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come of the a@@ verage person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ ju@@ sted for in@@ fl@@ ation , has tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
L@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
Ch@@ il@@ d mor@@ tal@@ ity is down by tw@@ o@@ -@@ th@@ ir@@ ds .
P@@ er@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a food produc@@ tion is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
"@@ How did we ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve that ?
How did we become the only species that becom@@ es more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous as it becom@@ es more pop@@ ul@@ ous ?
"The size of the b@@ lo@@ b in this grap@@ h repres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the grap@@ h repres@@ ents G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to com@@ b@@ ine and re@@ com@@ b@@ ine , to me@@ et and , in@@ de@@ ed , to m@@ ate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have se@@ x ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making ob@@ jects like this to making ob@@ jects like this .
These are both real ob@@ jects .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s .
The other is ob@@ vi@@ ously a computer m@@ ouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and sh@@ ape to an un@@ can@@ n@@ y de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to work out which is bi@@ g@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both techno@@ logi@@ es . In the end , their sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just t@@ ells you they were both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s made the same too@@ l for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few chang@@ es , but to@@ ols changed s@@ lo@@ wer than sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no pro@@ gre@@ ss , no innov@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ob@@ ject on the right is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the ob@@ ject on the left is made from one sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"The ob@@ ject on the right is made from a conf@@ ection of different sub@@ st@@ anc@@ es , from si@@ lic@@ on and me@@ t@@ al and pl@@ as@@ tic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ection of different ideas , the idea of pl@@ as@@ tic , the idea of a l@@ as@@ er , the idea of tran@@ si@@ st@@ ors ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ b@@ in@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the sec@@ re@@ t to underst@@ anding what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"M@@ y body &apos;s an acc@@ um@@ ulation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"@@ How does evol@@ ution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it uses se@@ x@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ ual species , if you get two different m@@ u@@ ta@@ tions in different cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , a gre@@ en one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t for the other to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ ual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individu@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both m@@ u@@ ta@@ tions from different l@@ ine@@ ages ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individu@@ al to dra@@ w up@@ on the gen@@ e@@ tic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own l@@ ine@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same eff@@ ect in cul@@ tur@@ al evol@@ ution as se@@ x is having in bio@@ logical evol@@ ution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ chang@@ ing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ ature .
No other anim@@ al does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ ject for another never happens .
"As A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ it@@ h said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture ."
"@@ Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es , kill@@ er wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tra@@ di@@ tions which are h@@ an@@ ded down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cr@@ ack n@@ u@@ ts with ro@@ c@@ ks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never gro@@ w , never acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e t@@ ro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different t@@ ro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ a@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ d@@ am takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than A@@ d@@ am .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ d@@ am .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ d@@ am make two ax@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sa@@ ved an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ d@@ am is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the g@@ ain@@ s from tra@@ de are only going to gro@@ w .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more speci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ d@@ am and O@@ z both sa@@ ved an h@@ our of time .
"That is pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity , the sa@@ ving of time in sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k y@@ our@@ self how long you would have to work to provi@@ de for y@@ our@@ self an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ ening to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You r@@ en@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the a@@ verage w@@ age in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for e@@ ight secon@@ ds on the a@@ verage w@@ age to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s se@@ ven and a half secon@@ ds of pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve g@@ ain@@ ed since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s se@@ ven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or serv@@ ice ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the a@@ verage w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the a@@ verage person on the a@@ verage w@@ age could not aff@@ ord a c@@ and@@ le in 18@@ 00 ."
"@@ G@@ o back to this image of the ax@@ e and the m@@ ouse , and ask y@@ our@@ self : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one ax@@ e was made by someone for h@@ im@@ self ."
It was self-@@ su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ency .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the ob@@ ject on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ und@@ re@@ ds ? Th@@ ous@@ ands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably m@@ illions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to in@@ clu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the o@@ il ri@@ g , who was dr@@ ill@@ ing for o@@ il , which was going to be made into the pl@@ as@@ tic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ouse for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were r@@ ich , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be r@@ ich ; you emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or wh@@ at@@ ever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his d@@ in@@ ner every night .
"But a mo@@ der@@ n t@@ ou@@ ri@@ st going around the p@@ al@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his d@@ in@@ ner t@@ on@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in bi@@ st@@ ro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ an@@ ts and sh@@ op@@ s all over P@@ ar@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s not@@ ice with an exc@@ ell@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w up@@ on speci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a cl@@ assi@@ c example ; wor@@ kers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ kers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ aliz@@ e with resp@@ ect to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in En@@ g@@ land , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ u@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ ual divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work m@@ ale for f@@ em@@ ale and f@@ em@@ ale for m@@ ale .
"In all h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er socie@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or between , on the whole , h@@ un@@ ting m@@ al@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ tion between speci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for m@@ al@@ es and f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it b@@ ene@@ f@@ its both si@@ des .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get ac@@ cess to prot@@ e@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sting h@@ un@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kill@@ s a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des ra@@ ise each other &apos;s st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ ual divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a high@@ ly int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on a@@ verage , by the end , were bi@@ g@@ ger than y@@ ours and m@@ ine in this room today ."
They were imag@@ in@@ ative . They bur@@ i@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disco@@ vered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ ill@@ s .
They were br@@ illi@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence of a se@@ x@@ ual divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
There &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavi@@ or by f@@ em@@ al@@ es .
It looks like the f@@ em@@ al@@ es were co@@ oper@@ ative h@@ un@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the ob@@ jects that you find in N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from loc@@ al materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ a@@ uc@@ as@@ us there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find loc@@ al N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from loc@@ al ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are mo@@ der@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from loc@@ al ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving ob@@ jects around like this , it was e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that they were ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
Pe@@ ople for@@ get that . Pe@@ ople think of tra@@ de as a mo@@ der@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hund@@ red thous@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence for it c@@ ro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long dist@@ anc@@ es in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ as@@ h@@ ells — as disco@@ vered by a te@@ am here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 mil@@ es in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ g@@ er@@ ia .
And that &apos;s e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that people have started ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance mo@@ vement means tra@@ de rather than m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion ?
"Well , you look at mo@@ der@@ n h@@ un@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like abor@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t Is@@ a , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry o@@ w@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ a@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gr@@ ay bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that st@@ one ax@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of A@@ u@@ str@@ al@@ ia ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance mo@@ vement of to@@ ols is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion ."
"What happens when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ e ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down techno@@ logical pro@@ gre@@ ss , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ ver@@ se ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the se@@ a level r@@ ose and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia became an is@@ land 10@@ ,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ enc@@ ed s@@ lo@@ wer pro@@ gre@@ ss than people on the ma@@ in@@ land , they actually experi@@ enc@@ ed re@@ gre@@ ss ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and fi@@ sh@@ ing equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment and c@@ lo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ in@@ tain the speci@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ ill@@ s nec@@ ess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ er@@ t is@@ land .
"@@ How many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts could we contin@@ ue to make after 10@@ ,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a del F@@ u@@ e@@ go — sim@@ il@@ ar is@@ land , sim@@ il@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a del F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ outh America by a much n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ ight , and there was tra@@ ding cont@@ act across that stra@@ ight thr@@ ough@@ out 10@@ ,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"@@ G@@ o back to this image again and ask y@@ our@@ self , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse ?
"N@@ o@@ body , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of the computer m@@ ouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dr@@ ill an o@@ il well to get o@@ il out to make pl@@ as@@ tic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by L@@ e@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wr@@ ote about how a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to m@@ ine grap@@ h@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ it@@ h language we have to trans@@ f@@ er ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d our cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties ."
We &apos;ve g@@ one be@@ y@@ on@@ d the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interest@@ ed in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
"What &apos;s re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the coll@@ ective brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the net@@ work .
We &apos;re the neur@@ ons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ e@@ ting and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using techno@@ logical pro@@ gre@@ ss , incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ ward , we will , of course , experience ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be w@@ ars ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m ab@@ solu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connec@@ tions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and ther@@ e@@ fore living st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d sour@@ c@@ ing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ it@@ es but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ re@@ ly acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the r@@ ate of innov@@ ation ."
Thank you .

I am a phot@@ o@@ -@@ based arti@@ st from R@@ us@@ si@@ a .

B@@ e bra@@ ve . B@@ e ir@@ on@@ ic — it hel@@ ps .
B@@ e fun@@ n@@ y and create some ma@@ gi@@ c .
My name is A@@ m@@ it .
"And 1@@ 8 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I p@@ it@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and art to my b@@ oss who &apos;s actually here , and she allo@@ wed me to do it ."
And it took 1@@ 8 months .
"A lot of fu@@ n , ne@@ g@@ oti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mus@@ e@@ um@@ s from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to foc@@ us on the de@@ m@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my pers@@ onal story is expl@@ ain@@ ed very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s ac@@ cess ."
And I gre@@ w up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing — but I didn &apos;t have ac@@ cess to a lot of these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and these ar@@ t@@ works .
"And so when I started tra@@ vel@@ ing and going to these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Google , I tri@@ ed to put this des@@ ire to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together ."
"So we form@@ ed a te@@ am , a great te@@ am of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the de@@ m@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ un@@ ch .
"So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ P@@ ro@@ j@@ ec@@ t@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , the H@@ er@@ m@@ it@@ age , the R@@ i@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ it@@ es , the M@@ et@@ rop@@ ol@@ it@@ an Mus@@ e@@ um of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ w@@ o ways of going in — very simple .
"C@@ lic@@ k and , b@@ an@@ g , you &apos;re in this mus@@ e@@ um ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."
"You move around , you have fu@@ n ."
You want to n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate around the mus@@ e@@ um ?
"O@@ p@@ en the pl@@ an up , and , in one c@@ lic@@ k , j@@ um@@ p ."
"You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or ."
K@@ e@@ ep going . H@@ ave fu@@ n .
E@@ x@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks . I ha@@ ven &apos;t come to the best part .
"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ ve@@ st@@ ers &quot; &quot; by P@@ i@@ e@@ ter B@@ ru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the M@@ et ."
I see this pl@@ us sig@@ n .
"If the mus@@ e@@ um has given us the image , you c@@ lic@@ k on it ."
Now this is one of the imag@@ es .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interest@@ ed in art , you can c@@ lic@@ k this — but I &apos;m going to c@@ lic@@ k this off right now ."
And this is one of these imag@@ es that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ oo@@ m around very simply .
You see some fu@@ n stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pr@@ ic@@ el@@ ess .
But then you really want to go de@@ ep .
"And so I started play@@ ing around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That s@@ ounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started not@@ ic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , sp@@ o@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ ac@@ ts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called s@@ qu@@ all , which inv@@ ol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a s@@ tic@@ k on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite pop@@ ular .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really de@@ ep in , you can really get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m out so you really see what you get ."
"@@ Here is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quick@@ ly j@@ um@@ p into the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ it@@ es , &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I sho@@ wed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ ta@@ il@@ s ."
But what if you want to see br@@ us@@ h st@@ ro@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh actually created this ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece ?
You z@@ oo@@ m in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite par@@ ts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real c@@ ool part . It &apos;s called C@@ oll@@ ec@@ tions .
"A@@ n@@ y one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re r@@ ich , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a f@@ anc@@ y house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mus@@ e@@ um on@@ line — create your own coll@@ ection across all these imag@@ es .
"@@ V@@ ery simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ o@@ wer of Z@@ oo@@ m — you can just z@@ oo@@ m around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ all@@ ery ."
"You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , s@@ end it to your friends and really get a conver@@ sa@@ tion going about what you &apos;re feel@@ ing when you go through these ma@@ st@@ er@@ piec@@ es ."
"So I think , in con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , for me , the ma@@ in thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ ion , even come from the mus@@ e@@ um@@ s ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bl@@ ing experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this dig@@ ital medi@@ um that we do j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce to their ar@@ t@@ work and repres@@ ent it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the bi@@ gg@@ est question I get asked no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a mus@@ e@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to sup@@ ple@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — t@@ elling stories , wr@@ iting no@@ vel@@ s — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ t@@ elling and also some su@@ per@@ natural cre@@ at@@ u@@ res called the d@@ j@@ in@@ n@@ i ."
"But before I go there , ple@@ ase al@@ low me to share with you g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of my pers@@ onal story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical sh@@ ape , the cir@@ cle , so thr@@ ough@@ out my talk , you will come across se@@ ver@@ al cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , F@@ r@@ ance to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ par@@ ated , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ rom then on , I was ra@@ is@@ ed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ k@@ ar@@ a , that was a bit un@@ us@@ ual ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood was ful@@ l of large famili@@ es , where fa@@ thers were the he@@ a@@ ds of h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ h@@ ood ."
"O@@ n the one hand was my mother , a w@@ ell@@ -@@ educ@@ ated , sec@@ ular , mo@@ der@@ n , we@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ iz@@ ed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"O@@ n the other hand was my gr@@ and@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual , less educ@@ ated and defin@@ it@@ ely less ra@@ tional ."
This was a woman who read co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ ounds to see the future and m@@ el@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous sh@@ ap@@ es to f@@ end off the e@@ vi@@ l ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people vi@@ s@@ ited my gr@@ and@@ mother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their h@@ ands ."
"E@@ ach time , my gr@@ and@@ mother would ut@@ ter some words in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , take a red app@@ le and st@@ a@@ b it with as many r@@ ose th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would enc@@ ir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with d@@ ark ink ."
"A wee@@ k later , the pati@@ ent would come back for a fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up exam@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an au@@ dience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scienti@@ sts , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who vi@@ s@@ ited my gr@@ and@@ mother for their sk@@ in con@@ di@@ tions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of p@@ ra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , p@@ ra@@ ying is eff@@ ective , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ cl@@ es . &quot; &quot; F@@ rom her , I learned , am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous l@@ ess@@ on — that if you want to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ m@@ ish or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ r@@ ound it with th@@ ick w@@ all@@ s ."
It will d@@ ry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tur@@ al cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , cl@@ ass ."
"But if we have no connec@@ tion wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ on@@ d the one we take for gr@@ an@@ ted , then we too run the ris@@ k of dr@@ ying up inside ."
"O@@ ur imag@@ in@@ ation might sh@@ r@@ ink ; our hear@@ ts might d@@ win@@ dle , and our hum@@ an@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long inside our cul@@ tur@@ al co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors , colle@@ ag@@ ues , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle re@@ se@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded with our m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my gr@@ and@@ m@@ a do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors with vel@@ v@@ et or to h@@ an@@ g them on the w@@ all@@ s with their b@@ ac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ ast@@ er@@ n tra@@ di@@ tion based on the know@@ le@@ dge that it &apos;s not heal@@ thy for a human being to sp@@ end too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fl@@ ection .
"I@@ r@@ on@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; comm@@ uni@@ ties of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ at@@ est d@@ ang@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , am@@ ong li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves , ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics and belie@@ ver@@ s , the r@@ ich and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est ali@@ ke ."
"We t@@ end to form clu@@ st@@ ers based on sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ity , and then we pro@@ duce st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about other clu@@ st@@ ers of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ ion , one way of tran@@ sc@@ en@@ ding these cul@@ tur@@ al gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ t@@ elling ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies can@@ not demo@@ li@@ sh fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ un@@ ch h@@ ol@@ es in our mental w@@ all@@ s ."
"And through those h@@ ol@@ es , we can get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion at the age of e@@ ight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interest@@ ed in ke@@ ep@@ ing a pers@@ onal jour@@ n@@ al .
"In re@@ tr@@ osp@@ ect , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ri@@ ed about my s@@ an@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ st@@ an@@ tly t@@ elling stories at home , which was good , ex@@ cept I told this to imag@@ in@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with co@@ lo@@ red cra@@ y@@ ons and ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing to ob@@ jects when I b@@ um@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to wr@@ ite down my d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ ences and em@@ oti@@ ons ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was ter@@ ri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to wr@@ ite about myself ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I began to wr@@ ite about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long p@@ assion for wr@@ iting fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ to@@ bi@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation than a tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ental jour@@ ne@@ y into other lives , other pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
And ple@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
"So from this small , su@@ per@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood of my gr@@ and@@ mother , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; repres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our cl@@ ass@@ room , there were children from all n@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ ties , yet this di@@ ver@@ sity did not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily le@@ ad to a c@@ os@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an , e@@ g@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an cl@@ ass@@ room demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , it gener@@ ated an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individu@@ al on his own , but as the repres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was fu@@ n , ex@@ cept wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ g@@ ative , with re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a reli@@ gi@@ on , took place ."
"The child who repres@@ ented it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ed and b@@ ul@@ li@@ ed end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a mil@@ it@@ ary ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality ne@@ arly kill@@ ed the P@@ op@@ e , and T@@ ur@@ key got z@@ er@@ o poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Eu@@ ro@@ vi@@ sion S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of becom@@ ing a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first ta@@ st@@ e of cul@@ tur@@ al st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the mo@@ vi@@ e &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night E@@ x@@ pres@@ s , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qui@@ red how many ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ kers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to learn that these were the three ma@@ in st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about my country : poli@@ tics , ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ p@@ ain , we went to J@@ ord@@ an , G@@ er@@ many and An@@ k@@ ar@@ a again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I felt like my imag@@ in@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies gave me a sense of cen@@ ter , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mid@@ -@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I mo@@ ved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ ver@@ se ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood where I wr@@ ote se@@ ver@@ al of my no@@ vel@@ s ."
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 19@@ 9@@ 9 .
"When I r@@ an out of the building at three in the mor@@ ning , I saw something that st@@ op@@ ped me in my trac@@ ks ."
"There was the loc@@ al gro@@ c@@ er there — a gr@@ um@@ p@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t s@@ ell al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t spe@@ ak to mar@@ g@@ in@@ als ."
He was sit@@ ting next to a trans@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and m@@ as@@ car@@ a run@@ ning down her che@@ e@@ ks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ g@@ ar@@ et@@ t@@ es with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing h@@ ands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ serv@@ ative gro@@ c@@ er and a cr@@ ying trans@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ wal@@ k ."
"In the face of de@@ ath and de@@ struc@@ tion , our m@@ und@@ an@@ e differ@@ ences ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a sim@@ il@@ ar eff@@ ect on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are read@@ ing a good no@@ vel , we leave our small , co@@ z@@ y ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments behind , go out into the night al@@ one and start getting to know people we had never m@@ et before and perhaps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in B@@ os@@ ton , then M@@ ic@@ hi@@ g@@ an ."
"I experi@@ enc@@ ed this , not so much as a ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical shi@@ ft , as a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic one ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the comm@@ ut@@ e between langu@@ ages gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create myself ."
"I love wr@@ iting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very em@@ oti@@ onal , and I love wr@@ iting in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh , which to me is very ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical and cer@@ e@@ br@@ al ."
So I feel connec@@ ted to each language in a different way .
"For me , like m@@ illions of other people around the world today , En@@ g@@ li@@ sh is an ac@@ qui@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a l@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tual f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion ."
"As l@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cr@@ ack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the t@@ on@@ gu@@ e ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ tim@@ id@@ ating .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ mul@@ ating ."
And this is what I disco@@ vered in B@@ os@@ ton — that f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion was very sti@@ mul@@ ating .
"A@@ t this st@@ age , my gr@@ and@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty , started to in@@ clu@@ de in her d@@ a@@ ily p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get mar@@ ri@@ ed so that I could se@@ t@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ri@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of se@@ t@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started comm@@ u@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the sur@@ face of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a n@@ om@@ ad , phys@@ ically and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ally ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies ac@@ company me , ke@@ ep@@ ing my piec@@ es and mem@@ or@@ ies together , like an ex@@ ist@@ ential gl@@ ue ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , rec@@ ently , I &apos;ve also be@@ gu@@ n to think that they l@@ ose their ma@@ gi@@ c if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ ject that I would love to think about together .
"When my first no@@ vel wr@@ it@@ ten in En@@ g@@ li@@ sh came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"&quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had wr@@ it@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , American , H@@ i@@ sp@@ an@@ ic char@@ ac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish char@@ ac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the no@@ vel took place on a univer@@ sity cam@@ p@@ us in B@@ os@@ ton , so to me , it was nor@@ m@@ al that there be more inter@@ national char@@ ac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish char@@ ac@@ ters , but I underst@@ ood what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also underst@@ ood that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my id@@ enti@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of id@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics aff@@ ects the way stories are being cir@@ cul@@ ated , read and re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but n@@ on-@@ W@@ est@@ er@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly ."
"If you &apos;re a woman wr@@ it@@ er from the Mus@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are exp@@ ected to wr@@ ite the stories of Mus@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy Mus@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re exp@@ ected to wr@@ ite infor@@ ma@@ tive , po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant and char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic stories and leave the experim@@ ental and av@@ an@@ t-@@ g@@ ar@@ de to your W@@ est@@ er@@ n colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
What I experi@@ enc@@ ed as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are not seen as cre@@ ative individu@@ als on their own , but as the repres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of their re@@ spec@@ tive cul@@ tures : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very dist@@ inc@@ tive , if not p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ."
The wr@@ it@@ er and comm@@ u@@ ter J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in gave an inter@@ view in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly asked about his h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wer tri@@ ed to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ h@@ ole him as a g@@ ay wr@@ it@@ er , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in st@@ op@@ ped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en id@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics tries to put l@@ ab@@ els on us , it is our fre@@ e@@ dom of imag@@ in@@ ation that is in d@@ an@@ ger ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ z@@ y c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory called mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al liter@@ ature in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world are l@@ um@@ ped together .
"I never for@@ get my first mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three wr@@ it@@ ers , one from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ i@@ an — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were br@@ ought together was not because we sh@@ ared an arti@@ sti@@ c st@@ y@@ le or a liter@@ ary ta@@ st@@ e .
It was only because of our p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al wr@@ it@@ ers are exp@@ ected to tell real stories , not so much the imag@@ in@@ ary ."
A fun@@ c@@ tion is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the wr@@ it@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional char@@ ac@@ ters become the repres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quick@@ ly ad@@ d that this ten@@ d@@ ency to see a story as more than a story does not so@@ le@@ ly come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ enc@@ ed this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ tional char@@ ac@@ ters ut@@ ter@@ ed in a no@@ vel .
"I had in@@ ten@@ ded to wr@@ ite a con@@ struc@@ tive , mul@@ ti@@ -@@ l@@ ay@@ er@@ ed no@@ vel about an Ar@@ men@@ i@@ an and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My mic@@ r@@ o story became a m@@ acr@@ o issu@@ e when I was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cri@@ tici@@ z@@ ed , others p@@ ra@@ is@@ ed me for wr@@ iting about the T@@ ur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ i@@ an conf@@ lic@@ t ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both si@@ des that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to b@@ el@@ it@@ tle my work ."
"I want to love and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are enti@@ t@@ led to their political op@@ in@@ i@@ ons , and there are good political no@@ vel@@ s out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of d@@ a@@ ily poli@@ tics ."
"C@@ he@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The sol@@ ution to a problem and the cor@@ rec@@ t way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the l@@ at@@ ter is an arti@@ st &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility . &quot; &quot; I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics divi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion con@@ n@@ ects .
One is interest@@ ed in s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
"The other , in n@@ u@@ anc@@ es ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies .
The other re@@ cog@@ n@@ iz@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics is made of so@@ li@@ d br@@ ic@@ ks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ dd@@ ah . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ ff@@ e@@ e h@@ ous@@ es , where they would tell a story in front of an au@@ dience , often im@@ provi@@ sing ."
"W@@ it@@ h each new person in the story , the me@@ dd@@ ah would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ pers@@ on@@ ating that char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"E@@ very@@ body could go and list@@ en , you know — ordin@@ ary people , even the s@@ ul@@ t@@ an , Mus@@ li@@ ms and n@@ on-@@ Mus@@ li@@ ms ."
"S@@ t@@ or@@ ies c@@ ut across all b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ al@@ es of N@@ as@@ re@@ dd@@ in H@@ o@@ d@@ j@@ a , &quot; &quot; which were very pop@@ ular thr@@ ough@@ out the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast , N@@ or@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans and A@@ si@@ a ."
"T@@ o@@ day , stories contin@@ ue to tran@@ sc@@ end bor@@ d@@ ers ."
"When P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an and Is@@ ra@@ el@@ i poli@@ tici@@ ans talk , they us@@ u@@ ally don &apos;t list@@ en to each other , but a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ i@@ an read@@ er still re@@ a@@ ds a no@@ vel by a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish au@@ th@@ or , and v@@ ice ver@@ s@@ a , connec@@ ting and em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ ing with the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ator ."
L@@ it@@ er@@ ature has to take us be@@ y@@ on@@ d .
"If it can@@ not take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature ."
"B@@ oo@@ ks have sa@@ ved the int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted , tim@@ id child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the d@@ an@@ ger of fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ iz@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ sti@@ c , R@@ um@@ i , m@@ et his sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual compan@@ ion , S@@ ha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the l@@ at@@ ter did was to t@@ oss R@@ um@@ i &apos;s boo@@ ks into water and wat@@ ch the le@@ t@@ ters dis@@ sol@@ ve ."
"The S@@ u@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ y@@ on@@ d y@@ our@@ self is far wor@@ se than ig@@ nor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tur@@ al gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not l@@ ack of know@@ le@@ dge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but know@@ le@@ dge that takes us not be@@ y@@ on@@ d ourselves : it makes us e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , dist@@ ant and dis@@ connec@@ ted ."
There &apos;s a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing comp@@ ass .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the comp@@ ass is st@@ ati@@ c , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ st@@ an@@ tly moving ."
"L@@ i@@ ke that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , with str@@ ong T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part tra@@ vel@@ s the world , connec@@ ting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both loc@@ al and univer@@ s@@ al , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the re@@ si@@ d@@ ence of O@@ t@@ tom@@ an s@@ ul@@ t@@ ans for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the p@@ al@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fa@@ v@@ or@@ ite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an are@@ a called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ d@@ ings .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this con@@ cept .
We us@@ u@@ ally di@@ str@@ ust those are@@ as that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the d@@ om@@ ain of su@@ per@@ natural cre@@ at@@ u@@ res like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of s@@ mo@@ k@@ el@@ ess fir@@ e and are the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of el@@ us@@ i@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ us@@ ive space is what wr@@ it@@ ers and arti@@ sts need most .
Wh@@ en I wr@@ ite fic@@ tion I ch@@ er@@ ish el@@ us@@ i@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 p@@ ages later .
I like it when my char@@ ac@@ ters surpri@@ se me .
"I might wr@@ ite about a Mus@@ li@@ m woman in one no@@ vel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might wr@@ ite about a h@@ and@@ some , g@@ ay prof@@ ess@@ or in N@@ or@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can wr@@ ite about anything and everything ."
"A@@ u@@ d@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The wh@@ ite fa@@ thers ta@@ u@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted , &quot; &quot; I feel , ther@@ e@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonder@@ ful par@@ a@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in cre@@ ative wr@@ iting cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; wr@@ ite what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
P@@ er@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ative liter@@ ature is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily about wr@@ iting who we are or what we know or what our id@@ enti@@ ty is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to exp@@ and our hear@@ ts and wr@@ ite what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tur@@ al gh@@ et@@ to and go vi@@ s@@ it the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ sh@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ cl@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"They con@@ n@@ ect all hum@@ an@@ ity , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of id@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ ish with an old S@@ u@@ f@@ i po@@ e@@ m : &quot; &quot; C@@ ome , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ ver@@ s and lo@@ ved ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely all the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing ."
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more coll@@ abor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build str@@ on@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a res@@ ult .
F@@ ive million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
H@@ is work is br@@ illi@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ tim@@ al sit@@ u@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"B@@ e@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les ."
Pe@@ ople were su@@ ff@@ ering . Pe@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al d@@ ice game ."
"We want to imagine ep@@ ic w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve the ep@@ ic w@@ in ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like loc@@ al in@@ si@@ ght , know@@ le@@ dge net@@ working , su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability , vi@@ sion and res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en s@@ qu@@ are mil@@ es . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies .
And the job in question was sh@@ e@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
"M@@ y ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties are to simply try and keep up and give an h@@ on@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ e@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we ch@@ ec@@ k in to a h@@ ot@@ el and I realiz@@ e the next day that ca@@ stra@@ tion is going to be an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ e part of this work .
"So , nor@@ m@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a t@@ ou@@ ch@@ y sub@@ ject , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tr@@ ay ac@@ cur@@ ately wh@@ at@@ ever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of resp@@ ect for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ e@@ ty and I say , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , I &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some l@@ am@@ b@@ s , C@@ an you tell me the de@@ al ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little sm@@ all@@ er ."
"This one was actually around the play@@ ing car@@ ds I got y@@ est@@ er@@ day , but it had a certain famili@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the ta@@ il , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ loo@@ d f@@ low is s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ t@@ ar@@ ded ; a wee@@ k later the par@@ ts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ C@@ A to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fu@@ n , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the l@@ am@@ b@@ s and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of anim@@ al h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the l@@ am@@ b — two h@@ ands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the p@@ ost , she op@@ ens it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always wat@@ ch the process done the first time before I try it .
"B@@ e@@ ing an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ c@@ k@@ et to pul@@ l out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that c@@ au@@ ght the su@@ n that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ ti@@ l@@ age of the ta@@ il , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the l@@ am@@ b , and very quick@@ ly the ta@@ il was g@@ one and in the b@@ uc@@ k@@ et that I was h@@ ol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well call@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ f@@ ing@@ er , he had the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gr@@ as@@ p ."
"And he pul@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el — you don &apos;t , O@@ K ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , th@@ ro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and then gr@@ ab@@ s the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um and p@@ us@@ h@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ sc@@ uring my view , but what I hear is a s@@ l@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a no@@ ise that s@@ ounds like V@@ el@@ cr@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a s@@ tic@@ k@@ y w@@ all and I am not even k@@ id@@ ding ."
C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sh@@ oo@@ t , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ i@@ me out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no wr@@ iting , there &apos;s no sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no n@@ on@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t f@@ ool around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we sh@@ oo@@ t what we get !@@ "
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is n@@ u@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is cra@@ z@@ y .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are t@@ es@@ tic@@ les in this b@@ uc@@ k@@ et and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him expl@@ ain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; L@@ i@@ ke the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ e@@ ty ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , like the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ e@@ ty ."
"@@ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the l@@ am@@ b s@@ qu@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on tw@@ ice a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K . &quot; &quot; He goes to his bo@@ x and he pul@@ ls out a b@@ a@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up another l@@ am@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , b@@ and goes on the ta@@ il , b@@ and goes on the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , l@@ am@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , f@@ all@@ s down , gets up , s@@ ha@@ kes a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , f@@ all@@ s down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this l@@ am@@ b , at all ."
"@@ G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qui@@ ver@@ ing , and it li@@ es down and it &apos;s in ob@@ vi@@ ous dist@@ res@@ s ."
"And I &apos;m looking at the l@@ am@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ber@@ t , how long ?"
"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A wee@@ k . &quot;"
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the l@@ am@@ b that he had just did his little pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ anc@@ ing around , b@@ le@@ e@@ ding st@@ op@@ ped ."
"He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ bl@@ ing on some gr@@ ass , f@@ ro@@ lic@@ king ."
"And I was just so b@@ lo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second ."
"And I was re@@ min@@ ded how ut@@ ter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time ."
"( Laughter ) And I was es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously sh@@ ort stra@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these l@@ am@@ b@@ s in the p@@ en , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s star@@ ting to feel like a G@@ er@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ...

Al@@ ber@@ t h@@ ands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .
"I go in , ta@@ il comes off ."
"I go in , I gra@@ b the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ p comes off ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t in@@ struc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ us@@ h it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do ."
&quot; P@@ us@@ h it f@@ ur@@ ther . &quot;
I do .
"The t@@ es@@ tic@@ les em@@ er@@ ge — they look like th@@ um@@ b@@ s , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; B@@ ite &apos; e@@ m ."
"@@ J@@ ust b@@ ite &apos; e@@ m off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words ."
"( Laughter ) L@@ i@@ ke , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mom@@ ents where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , I &apos;m st@@ anding there , in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , and all I can think of is the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an defin@@ i@@ tion of a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"You know , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le says a tra@@ ge@@ dy is that moment when the her@@ o comes face to face with his true id@@ enti@@ ty ."
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this j@@ ac@@ ke@@ d@@ -@@ up me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ?"
"I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vi@@ sion out of my si@@ ght , so I did what I had to do ."
I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding there with two t@@ es@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t s@@ ha@@ ke the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; P@@ o@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come cr@@ as@@ h@@ ing into my head that I ha@@ ven &apos;t heard since my cl@@ ass@@ ics prof@@ ess@@ or in colle@@ ge dr@@ ill@@ ed them there ."
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the Gre@@ e@@ k word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the tran@@ si@@ tion from ig@@ nor@@ ance to know@@ le@@ dge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is ."
It &apos;s what our net@@ work does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my nec@@ k in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ es every single day .
Gre@@ at .
"The other word , per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ dies , you know — E@@ ur@@ i@@ p@@ id@@ es and S@@ op@@ ho@@ cl@@ es — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly realiz@@ es that h@@ ot ch@@ ick he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing with and having bab@@ ies with is his mother . O@@ K ."
That &apos;s per@@ i@@ pe@@ ty or per@@ i@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great dev@@ ice though ."
"When you start to look for per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a , you find it every@@ where ."
"I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ ill@@ is in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"S@@ p@@ ends the whole mo@@ vi@@ e trying to help the little k@@ id who se@@ es de@@ ad people , and then , boo@@ m — &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I &apos;m de@@ ad &quot; &quot; — per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a ."
You know ?
It &apos;s cr@@ us@@ h@@ ing when the au@@ dience se@@ es it the right way .

"Th@@ ese disco@@ ver@@ ies that le@@ ad to su@@ dd@@ en realiz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dr@@ ill@@ ed something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for ."
"And , as I st@@ ood there , looking at the happy l@@ am@@ b that I had just de@@ fil@@ ed — but it looked O@@ K ."
"L@@ oo@@ king at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struc@@ k by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other per@@ i@@ pat@@ e@@ tic mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment up@@ on ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ ist but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey M@@ i@@ ke ."
"L@@ oo@@ k , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interest@@ ed in this sort of thing or not , but do you realiz@@ e you &apos;ve sho@@ t in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fi@@ sh@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every maj@@ or indu@@ stry ."
"You &apos;ve had your back sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der with these guys that our poli@@ tici@@ ans are des@@ per@@ ate to rel@@ ate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ ill@@ ary doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ y@@ e , dri@@ b@@ bl@@ ing down her ch@@ in , with the ste@@ el wor@@ kers ."
"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , t@@ es@@ tic@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ c@@ ing around ."
"And , after that sh@@ oo@@ t , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , pers@@ on@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other n@@ oti@@ ons of work that I &apos;ve just been ass@@ um@@ ing are s@@ acr@@ os@@ anc@@ t , and they &apos;re not ."
Pe@@ ople with di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are happ@@ i@@ er than you think .
"As a group , they &apos;re the happ@@ i@@ est people I know ."
"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k for the U@@ ni@@ on L@@ ab@@ el , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ ker cra@@ p ."
I &apos;m just t@@ elling you that these are b@@ al@@ anc@@ ed people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
R@@ o@@ ad@@ k@@ ill pic@@ k@@ er@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I s@@ we@@ ar to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sy@@ m@@ me@@ try to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we chall@@ eng@@ ed some of these s@@ ac@@ red co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your p@@ assion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your p@@ assion — what could pos@@ si@@ bly be wrong with that ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably the wor@@ st adv@@ ice I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ am@@ s and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard gro@@ wing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your p@@ assion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — B@@ o@@ b C@@ om@@ b@@ s , the pi@@ g far@@ m@@ er in L@@ as V@@ e@@ g@@ as who coll@@ ects the un@@ e@@ at@@ en sc@@ r@@ aps of food from the c@@ as@@ in@@ os and fe@@ e@@ ds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prot@@ e@@ in in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his pi@@ gs gro@@ w at tw@@ ice the nor@@ m@@ al spe@@ ed , and he is one r@@ ich pi@@ g far@@ m@@ er , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ ends his days doing this incredi@@ ble serv@@ ice , and he sm@@ ells like h@@ ell , but God bl@@ ess him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you fol@@ low your p@@ assion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d l@@ au@@ gh at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got off@@ er@@ ed like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ e@@ g@@ as ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his p@@ assion .
He ste@@ p@@ ped back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a d@@ air@@ y far@@ m@@ er in New C@@ an@@ a@@ an , Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , who w@@ o@@ ke up one day and realiz@@ ed the cra@@ p from his co@@ ws was wor@@ th more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able flo@@ wer p@@ ots ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his p@@ assion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at p@@ assion , I started to look at eff@@ ici@@ ency ver@@ s@@ us eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess — as T@@ i@@ m tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge dist@@ inc@@ tion ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; suc@@ cess@@ or@@ ies &quot; &quot; that h@@ an@@ g with that sch@@ m@@ al@@ t@@ z@@ y art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om@@ s around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ a@@ fe@@ ty — sa@@ fe@@ ty first ?
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ e@@ ty : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ fe@@ ty third ?"
R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I val@@ ue my sa@@ fe@@ ty on these cra@@ z@@ y j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ ering S@@ e@@ a , I was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 mil@@ es off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 5@@ 0@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t se@@ as , big wa@@ ves , gre@@ en water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"M@@ ost ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , l@@ as@@ h@@ ing the p@@ ots down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 fe@@ et off the dec@@ k , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the o@@ ce@@ an ."
Un@@ spe@@ a@@ k@@ ably d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
"I sc@@ am@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ d@@ ul@@ ity , &quot; C@@ ap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ ce@@ an . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ t@@ ory flo@@ or or any con@@ struc@@ tion s@@ ite .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he call@@ s me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ si@@ bility is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"M@@ y respon@@ si@@ bility is to get you home r@@ ich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this f@@ al@@ se — this sense of com@@ plac@@ ency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility as though it &apos;s our own , and v@@ ice ver@@ s@@ a ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at l@@ eng@@ th about the many little dist@@ inc@@ tions we made and the end@@ less li@@ st of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I form@@ ed a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ ma@@ ining two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a ci@@ vi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a co@@ ld war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our m@@ u@@ st@@ ac@@ he in some M@@ ac@@ hi@@ a@@ vel@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood ."
The way we por@@ tr@@ ay working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s l@@ au@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 p@@ ounds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cr@@ ack . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ un@@ ch l@@ ines ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on M@@ a@@ dis@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a mess@@ age , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little fa@@ ster , if you could p@@ un@@ ch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that aff@@ ect the bot@@ to@@ m line reality of the av@@ ail@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , I mean — how many people have an i@@ P@@ h@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed in ; we &apos;re connec@@ ted .
I would never su@@ gg@@ est for a second that something bad has come out of the t@@ ec@@ h re@@ vol@@ ution .
"@@ G@@ ood g@@ ri@@ e@@ f , not to this c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would su@@ gg@@ est that innov@@ ation without im@@ it@@ ation is a comple@@ te wa@@ st@@ e of time .
And no@@ body c@@ ele@@ br@@ ates im@@ it@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our i@@ P@@ h@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the gen@@ i@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x , you know ."
O@@ ur to@@ ols today don &apos;t look like sho@@ vel@@ s and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we wal@@ k around with .
And so the coll@@ ective eff@@ ect of all of that has been this mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realiz@@ ed , probably too l@@ ate in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the t@@ es@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ n for work , man@@ ual l@@ ab@@ or , sk@@ ill@@ ed l@@ ab@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten b@@ ene@@ f@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about gr@@ and@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of l@@ ost a little ."
B@@ ar@@ ack wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The in@@ fra@@ structure is a huge de@@ al .
"This war on work , that I sup@@ p@@ ose ex@@ i@@ sts , has c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The in@@ fra@@ structure &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ l@@ ining tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electr@@ ici@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ p@@ en@@ ters , fe@@ wer pl@@ um@@ bers , fe@@ wer w@@ el@@ d@@ ers , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The in@@ fra@@ structure j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in dec@@ line , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tr@@ illion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American S@@ o@@ ci@@ e@@ ty of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l En@@ g@@ ine@@ ers — that we need to exp@@ end to even make a dent in the in@@ fra@@ structure , which is curr@@ ently r@@ ated at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were run@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to s@@ tic@@ k un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and di@@ r@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ pos@@ it@@ es ."
"They &apos;re two si@@ des of the same co@@ in , just like innov@@ ation and im@@ it@@ ation , like ris@@ k and respon@@ si@@ bility , like per@@ i@@ pe@@ ti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that po@@ or little l@@ am@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s g@@ one ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k b@@ illions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ m@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ e@@ k@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ne@@ y of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I m@@ et with me@@ d@@ ical doc@@ tors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ vol@@ ution , this new f@@ em@@ in@@ ist issu@@ e ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation has become a vir@@ ility sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having d@@ in@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this d@@ in@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about e@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re li@@ ke@@ ly to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at e@@ ight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ illi@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ o@@ ken up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a pers@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own car@@ e@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .

And I just want you to think for a minut@@ e about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"@@ Here is this m@@ ass of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound m@@ ass of j@@ el@@ ly you can h@@ old in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space ."
It can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate itself cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , and hop@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity em@@ er@@ g@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of ab@@ ili@@ ties that we call human nature and human consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at pati@@ ents with su@@ st@@ ain@@ ed d@@ ama@@ ge to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an acr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cog@@ ni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ective l@@ oss of one fun@@ c@@ tion , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ ol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ c@@ tion on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m gi@@ ving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the t@@ em@@ por@@ al lob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the t@@ em@@ por@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , that &apos;s J@@ o@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize y@@ our@@ self in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize y@@ our@@ self as y@@ our@@ self ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well known as ca@@ used by d@@ ama@@ ge to the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phys@@ ici@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as d@@ el@@ us@@ ion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ m@@ al , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ m@@ al , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is perf@@ ec@@ tly l@@ uc@@ id and int@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ent in all other resp@@ ects , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ us@@ ion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most comm@@ on inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent app@@ li@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong se@@ x@@ ual at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you gro@@ w up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , d@@ a@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ ably you find y@@ our@@ self being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ ious , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same d@@ el@@ us@@ ion , a pati@@ ent having the same d@@ el@@ us@@ ion , about his pe@@ t p@@ oo@@ dle . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expl@@ ain this cur@@ ious dis@@ order , we look at the structure and fun@@ c@@ tions of the nor@@ m@@ al vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , vi@@ su@@ al sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vi@@ sion , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the mess@@ age goes to a small structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the mess@@ age c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the em@@ oti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ g@@ es the em@@ oti@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ solu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ in@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and meas@@ ure the change in sk@@ in re@@ si@@ st@@ ance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minut@@ e .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , ho@@ we@@ ver , and it &apos;s pro@@ cess@@ ed in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the mess@@ age c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the em@@ oti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the f@@ us@@ i@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is c@@ ut to the em@@ oti@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able l@@ ack of em@@ oti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some str@@ an@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and meas@@ ure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can meas@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ b@@ rel@@ l@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ m@@ al people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and meas@@ ure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ in@@ t , nothing happens , as in nor@@ m@@ al people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no em@@ oti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the em@@ oti@@ onal cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vi@@ sion is nor@@ m@@ al because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are nor@@ m@@ al , his em@@ oti@@ ons are nor@@ m@@ al — he &apos;ll l@@ au@@ gh , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vi@@ sion to em@@ oti@@ ons is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ us@@ ion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , ne@@ ural p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ ci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ ural an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ us@@ ion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the em@@ oti@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expl@@ ain@@ s why through the phone he re@@ cog@@ n@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cur@@ ious sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ ious problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ d@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vi@@ sc@@ er@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had pati@@ ents with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m u@@ ter@@ us , in@@ clu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ to@@ m men@@ str@@ ual cra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; D@@ o they get ph@@ an@@ to@@ m P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for scienti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the pati@@ ents with ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ a@@ i@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ we@@ ver , about half the pati@@ ents , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the p@@ ain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ ounds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b@@ s , the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was c@@ ut , by say , a m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the p@@ ain in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ p@@ ut@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m with the same pain@@ s , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ ious cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this p@@ ain then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds comm@@ ands to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these pati@@ ents ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , so you can reli@@ e@@ ve him of this ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be you can reli@@ e@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m p@@ ain , the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m cra@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that c@@ os@@ ts m@@ illions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ ac@@ hi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m , ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ m@@ al hand on the right side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ection of the nor@@ m@@ al ar@@ m in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m — your real f@@ ing@@ ers , or move your real f@@ ing@@ ers while looking in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my God , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again , and the p@@ ain , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k at your re@@ fl@@ ection of your ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your nor@@ m@@ al hand and ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your nor@@ m@@ al hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my God , my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my p@@ ain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clos@@ es his eyes ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ m@@ al hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my God , o@@ h my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ to@@ m lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ ys@@ is that you see in ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , like st@@ ro@@ ke , foc@@ al d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his p@@ ain — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and pr@@ acti@@ ce with it for a wee@@ k or two ."
"M@@ ay@@ be , after a per@@ i@@ od of pr@@ acti@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ e@@ ve y@@ our@@ self of p@@ ain . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ k , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two wee@@ ks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s g@@ one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s g@@ one ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was g@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ to@@ m I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this b@@ other you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ to@@ m ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m el@@ b@@ ow p@@ ain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m fore@@ ar@@ m p@@ ain , all those pain@@ s are g@@ one away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m f@@ ing@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ to@@ m f@@ ing@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory conf@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vi@@ sion saying the ph@@ an@@ to@@ m is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this conf@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ to@@ m , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of d@@ en@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the p@@ ain dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died p@@ ain flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tri@@ ed on do@@ z@@ ens of pati@@ ents by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ to@@ m p@@ ain , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tri@@ ed it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ t@@ ro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as d@@ ama@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also g@@ one through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of pati@@ ents ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ ious ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ r@@ anc@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a c@@ ous@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ m@@ al , had the fol@@ lo@@ wing p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ ive is bl@@ ue , se@@ ven is y@@ el@@ low , e@@ ight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely nor@@ m@@ al in other resp@@ ects ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke col@@ or ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F sh@@ ar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , a m@@ ing@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ inc@@ t ."
These people m@@ u@@ dd@@ le up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ p@@ ects of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in famili@@ es , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly , sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this l@@ ec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is e@@ ight times more comm@@ on am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ uses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ or@@ ies ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more comm@@ on here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . All right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and num@@ bers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cr@@ os@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ member I said it run@@ s in famili@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ m@@ al gen@@ e , a m@@ u@@ tation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ uses this ab@@ nor@@ m@@ al cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ m@@ ed down to create the char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ d@@ ular arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get de@@ f@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in comm@@ on , the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , l@@ in@@ king se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the S@@ u@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ m@@ al people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s ra@@ di@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ an@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the l@@ in@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different par@@ ts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ p@@ en@@ sity to@@ wards me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the e@@ ight times more comm@@ on in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence of sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ r@@ en@@ o@@ logical view of sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one minut@@ e ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in d@@ en@@ i@@ al about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call M@@ arti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . J@@ ust like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent sh@@ ap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got M@@ arti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ i@@ k@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ k@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two m@@ ut@@ an@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i ? R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a M@@ arti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ model sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that sh@@ ar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ection — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ i@@ k@@ i , m@@ im@@ ics the vi@@ su@@ al in@@ fl@@ ection , su@@ dd@@ en in@@ fl@@ ection of that j@@ ag@@ g@@ ed sh@@ ape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s t@@ elling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly ill@@ us@@ ion , but these phot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sh@@ ape , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory patter@@ n , but the brain is able to ex@@ tr@@ act the comm@@ on d@@ en@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ str@@ action , and we now know this happens in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed , these people l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ i@@ k@@ i , but they also l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to meas@@ ure its speci@@ fic gra@@ vity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the me@@ t@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this are@@ a is about e@@ ight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in hum@@ ans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ular g@@ y@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cr@@ os@@ s@@ ro@@ a@@ ds between hear@@ ing , vi@@ sion and t@@ ou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in hum@@ ans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human ab@@ ili@@ ties like ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers have been stud@@ ying for m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a , we scienti@@ sts can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stud@@ ying pati@@ ents and as@@ king the right questions ."
Thank you .

This story is about taking imag@@ in@@ ation ser@@ i@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this ordin@@ ary materi@@ al , fi@@ sh@@ net , used the same way for cent@@ ur@@ ies ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , b@@ il@@ lo@@ wing , vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous for@@ ms the scale of har@@ d@@ -@@ ed@@ g@@ ed buil@@ d@@ ings in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ li@@ ke@@ ly person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ died sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to se@@ ven art sch@@ o@@ ols and was re@@ j@@ ected by all se@@ ven ."
"I went off on my own to become an arti@@ st , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was off@@ er@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"@@ P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pain@@ t@@ ings , I shi@@ p@@ ped my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in M@@ a@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pur@@ am ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ sh@@ ing v@@ ill@@ age was fam@@ ous for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tri@@ ed br@@ on@@ ze ca@@ sting .
But to make large for@@ ms was too he@@ av@@ y and exp@@ en@@ sive .
"I went for a wal@@ k on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men b@@ und@@ le their ne@@ ts into m@@ ounds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make vol@@ u@@ me@@ tri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was made in coll@@ abor@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ de H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ ist@@ ed them on p@@ ol@@ es to photograp@@ h .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ p@@ ple of w@@ ind in con@@ st@@ an@@ tly chang@@ ing patter@@ ns .
I was m@@ es@@ mer@@ iz@@ ed .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stud@@ ying cra@@ ft tra@@ di@@ tions and coll@@ abor@@ ating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in L@@ i@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace ma@@ kers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine de@@ ta@@ il it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get l@@ ost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to India to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — inst@@ all@@ ed bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ b@@ an@@ ist M@@ an@@ ual S@@ ol@@ a@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pres@@ er@@ ve my art .
"D@@ ur@@ able , engine@@ er@@ ed , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ posi@@ tion to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic , de@@ lic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ em@@ er@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could sur@@ vi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , a@@ ir , p@@ oll@@ ution , and at the same time re@@ ma@@ in so@@ ft enough to move fl@@ u@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to h@@ old the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ ff@@ ic cir@@ cle .
"So we ra@@ is@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an a@@ verage bre@@ e@@ ze and sur@@ vi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a br@@ illi@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ il@@ s for America &apos;s C@@ up r@@ ac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts nam@@ ed Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me t@@ ack@@ le the tw@@ in chall@@ eng@@ es of pre@@ ci@@ se sh@@ ape and g@@ ent@@ le mo@@ vement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because h@@ and@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ st@@ and a h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e .
"So I develop@@ ed a relation@@ ship with an indu@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ t@@ ory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ l@@ ate this anci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic h@@ and@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could pro@@ duce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we ra@@ is@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ ar@@ e-@@ f@@ oo@@ t l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had imag@@ ined was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had l@@ ost nothing in trans@@ l@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ sec@@ tion had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ograp@@ h@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , connec@@ ted to lim@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ ist@@ or@@ ic P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pl@@ a@@ z@@ a , I felt , needed a materi@@ al for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we experim@@ ented with tin@@ y at@@ om@@ iz@@ ed water partic@@ les to create a d@@ ry m@@ ist that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in te@@ sting , disco@@ vered that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture materi@@ al to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ r@@ ay of the city &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ext chall@@ en@@ ge , the B@@ i@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Americ@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I repres@@ ent the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ est@@ er@@ n h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here and their inter@@ connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the rec@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in C@@ hi@@ le and the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i that ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ec@@ t@@ on@@ ic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s r@@ ot@@ ation and liter@@ ally sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed the l@@ eng@@ th of the day ."
"So I cont@@ ac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , and trans@@ l@@ ated it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of mic@@ r@@ os@@ econ@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sh@@ ape was too comple@@ x now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the me@@ t@@ al ar@@ mat@@ ure with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine m@@ es@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times str@@ on@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ re@@ ly so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to ex@@ ist@@ ing buil@@ d@@ ings — liter@@ ally becom@@ ing part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these comple@@ x net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ vity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ i@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tur@@ al me@@ th@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fund@@ ing yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the tra@@ di@@ tional things , in cra@@ ft for@@ ms ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous , b@@ il@@ lo@@ wing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ d@@ ings ."
My arti@@ sti@@ c hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to gro@@ w .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
"A@@ n att@@ or@@ ne@@ y in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interest@@ ed in art , never vi@@ s@@ ited the loc@@ al art mus@@ e@@ um , dra@@ gg@@ ed everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , l@@ ay@@ ing in the gr@@ ass , not@@ ic@@ ing the chang@@ ing patter@@ ns of w@@ ind b@@ es@@ i@@ de people they didn &apos;t know , sh@@ ar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al ax@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pub@@ er@@ ty , we f@@ all off the ma@@ p ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
I ess@@ enti@@ ally became an in@@ f@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous that the two h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ her@@ es are completely se@@ par@@ ate from one another ."
