"When I was 1@@ 1 , I remem@@ ber w@@ ak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ou@@ se ."
"M@@ y father was list@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big sm@@ ile on his face which was un@@ us@@ ual then , because the news m@@ os@@ tly depres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I d@@ res@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be e@@ duc@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different r@@ ou@@ te so that no one would s@@ us@@ pect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our bo@@ ok@@ s in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a h@@ ou@@ se , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small li@@ ving room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in w@@ in@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in sum@@ m@@ er .
"We all knew we were ri@@ s@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our par@@ ents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ ce@@ led for a we@@ ek because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were s@@ car@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ z@@ ed and dau@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
M@@ y grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A tot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ v@@ ince of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , he in@@ si@@ sted that his daughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my e@@ duc@@ ated mother be@@ came a teacher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ou@@ se into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an education , inc@@ lu@@ ding his dau@@ gh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ri@@ s@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was great@@ er ri@@ s@@ k in not e@@ duc@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remem@@ ber there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being s@@ car@@ ed and not see@@ ing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my daughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to lea@@ ve your home dur@@ ing a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to sel@@ l our blo@@ od to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to continu@@ e ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ i@@ sed in a country that has been dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by de@@ ca@@ des of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ yon@@ d high school , and had my family not been so com@@ mi@@ tt@@ ed to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pr@@ ou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ i@@ led from his home for d@@ ar@@ ing to e@@ duc@@ ate his dau@@ gh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ atu@@ la@@ te me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my college de@@ g@@ ree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) M@@ y family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ g@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global ca@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ gn to e@@ duc@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
"And I see their par@@ ents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position ."
"L@@ ik@@ e A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real na@@ me , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being kil@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the ph@@ one ran@@ g , a v@@ o@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his daughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to re@@ al@@ ize about Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , and this is something that is of@@ ten dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that be@@ h@@ ind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogn@@ iz@@ es the valu@@ e in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers ar@@ en &apos;t k@@ ey in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re of@@ ten the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their dau@@ gh@@ ters , but in the con@@ te@@ xt of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remem@@ ber , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the f@@ ra@@ gi@@ li@@ ty in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ yon@@ d the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , when I see the students in my school and their par@@ ents who ad@@ v@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pro@@ mis@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"T@@ o me , Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan is a country of hop@@ e and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possibili@@ ties , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"L@@ ik@@ e me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ Just ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely amaz@@ ing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ is@@ appe@@ ars right into the bac@@ k@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s b@@ lu@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it bac@@ k@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first publi@@ c ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion ."
"If anything see@@ med un@@ natural , I could be imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really fort@@ un@@ ate to get out , many other N@@ ort@@ h K@@ ore@@ ans have not been so lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an in@@ st@@ ant ."
"We are all K@@ ore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , du@@ e to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th K@@ ore@@ an or N@@ ort@@ h K@@ ore@@ an ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpri@@ sed that a tot@@ al str@@ ang@@ er car@@ ed enough to ask .
I re@@ alized that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we design@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a circ@@ le .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cu@@ lation on top of the ro@@ of .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we desi@@ gn this ?
"The princi@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a han@@ dra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ si@@ sted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net s@@ tic@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ ping through .
And we were allowed to call this rop@@ e as a han@@ dra@@ il .
"But of course , rop@@ e has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a tree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tree so he is e@@ ating the tree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they si@@ t on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ k@@ ey@@ s in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g w@@ ash@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ ap@@ s .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ bes , you want to sp@@ ray water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in fron@@ t is quite normal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not w@@ ash@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s p@@ ut@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is comp@@ let@@ ely op@@ en , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ous@@ tic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the princi@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a circ@@ le , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , us@@ u@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they lea@@ ve and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we con@@ si@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amaz@@ ing con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ gle with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in sil@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under con@@ trol ."
"You know , it &apos;s comp@@ let@@ ely op@@ en ."
And you should know that we can go sk@@ i@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in w@@ in@@ ter .
In sum@@ m@@ er you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
You never me@@ l@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divi@@ de clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are sup@@ posed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to f@@ ish another mon@@ k@@ ey from ab@@ ove .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ k@@ ey@@ s . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at le@@ ast one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where San@@ ta C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to con@@ si@@ der sa@@ f@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a daughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is s@@ kul@@ l is quite strong .
He is resi@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in fron@@ t , she ne@@ eds to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of d@@ ang@@ er ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ ca@@ sion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of op@@ port@@ un@@ ity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the mo@@ vement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic abili@@ ties am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ g@@ art@@ en@@ s .
"The princi@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We lea@@ ve them on top of the ro@@ of ."
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t con@@ trol them , don &apos;t prot@@ ec@@ t them too much , and they need to t@@ um@@ ble some@@ times ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challen@@ ges is to in@@ nov@@ ate fun@@ da@@ men@@ t@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ al@@ led to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a son@@ g or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really lik@@ ed , and you anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person hat@@ ed it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school ma@@ th ."
"I sel@@ l a produc@@ t to a mark@@ et that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ position ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e about you all ."
"I could give you g@@ uy@@ s an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would ex@@ pect no high@@ er than a 2@@ 5 percent pas@@ s r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.S. today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak ma@@ th down into two cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies ."
One is comput@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with le@@ ad@@ ing co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents great@@ er than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ vi@@ ded you have a really strong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ li@@ cation of ma@@ th pro@@ ces@@ ses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ ami@@ ty for society , what we can do about it and , to cl@@ ose with , why this is an amaz@@ ing time to be a ma@@ th teacher ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a la@@ ck of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ ately you have five han@@ ds going up asking you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ dents la@@ ck per@@ sever@@ ance .
"They la@@ ck ret@@ en@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ e ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ bes 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ a@@ ger@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that si@@ tu@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other amaz@@ ing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary dra@@ ma , sho@@ ws set in the pres@@ ent day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four h@@ ours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ res@@ pect , it shap@@ es the neur@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they ex@@ pect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ ati@@ ence with ir@@ res@@ olution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ ati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t res@@ ol@@ ve quickly ."
"You ex@@ pect sit@@ com@@ -@@ siz@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a la@@ u@@ gh trac@@ k ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will r@@ un .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s — particu@@ lar@@ ly mas@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ do@@ p@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s — te@@ ach ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and cal@@ ling it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"@@ No@@ tice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pi@@ ec@@ es of information there , each of which will fig@@ ure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the stu@@ dent will then comput@@ e ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the gi@@ ven information in ad@@ v@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ p@@ l@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , watch this , this is the pr@@ ac@@ tice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ e@@ ak@@ ing the con@@ te@@ xt a little bit ."
"And if the stu@@ dent still doesn &apos;t recogn@@ ize the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ ful@@ ly expla@@ ins to you what sa@@ m@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to de@@ co@@ de a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ l@@ op@@ e using a s@@ ki li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate lay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cur@@ i@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate lay@@ ers and , particu@@ lar@@ ly , how when they &apos;re comp@@ res@@ sed together and pres@@ en@@ ted to the stu@@ dent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this imp@@ ati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll def@@ ine them here : You have the v@@ is@@ ual .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , measu@@ re@@ ments , la@@ bel@@ s , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ c@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I hop@@ e you can see .
"I really hop@@ e you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is tak@@ ing a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ atu@@ la@@ ting our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the v@@ is@@ ual , and I im@@ medi@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich se@@ c@@ tion is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion because the v@@ is@@ ual is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in pa@@ ir@@ s , j@@ ourn@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
And then even@@ tually we re@@ al@@ ize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the sk@@ i@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the sk@@ i@@ er just ab@@ ove the mi@@ d line .
"And we re@@ al@@ ize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ bel@@ s to talk about them more e@@ as@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to def@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we re@@ al@@ ize it would be ni@@ ce to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , speci@@ f@@ ic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical struc@@ ture ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ l@@ op@@ e , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ o@@ p those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you g@@ uy@@ s see how this , right here , com@@ par@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my pr@@ ac@@ tice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll yi@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has pa@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mu@@ lation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pr@@ ac@@ tice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the for@@ mu@@ lation of the problem ."
So 9@@ 0 percent of what I do with my five h@@ ours of pre@@ p time per we@@ ek is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ elling ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ irst things first , we eli@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to devel@@ o@@ p those , they have to for@@ mu@@ la@@ te those ."
And then no@@ tice that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ str@@ ac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted question in ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so of@@ ten see in te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a vide@@ o , a vide@@ o of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , rol@@ ling their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really f@@ un for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about ma@@ th because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stu@@ dent is on a level play@@ ing field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated jo@@ ining the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put na@@ mes on the bo@@ ar@@ d , at@@ t@@ ach them to gu@@ es@@ ses , and kids have b@@ ought in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer k@@ ey in the back of the teacher &apos;s edi@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just watch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ ore@@ tical mo@@ de@@ ls that always work out in the answer k@@ ey in the back of a teacher &apos;s edi@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s s@@ car@@ y to talk about s@@ our@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ ore@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so valu@@ able , am@@ ong the most valu@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really f@@ un ga@@ mes with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ al@@ led with these vir@@ u@@ ses day one of the clas@@ s .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ar@@ d , tot@@ ally new , tot@@ ally for@@ ei@@ gn , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so f@@ un ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ ver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of f@@ un .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge ma@@ th teachers I talk to to use multi@@ me@@ dia , because it br@@ ings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high res@@ olution and ful@@ l col@@ or ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stu@@ dent in@@ tu@@ ition for that level play@@ ing field ; to ask the sh@@ ort@@ est question you pos@@ si@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fi@@ c questions come out in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in tot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an amaz@@ ing time to be a ma@@ th teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our fron@@ t po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ ap , and the to@@ ols to dist@@ ri@@ b@@ ute it fre@@ ely under op@@ en li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a vide@@ o ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ si@@ ted saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ em@@ s or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ em@@ s ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mo@@ de@@ ling inv@@ olved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just biz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ c@@ lu@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ lar@@ y for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ at@@ ever your st@@ ak@@ e is in education — whether you &apos;re a stu@@ dent , par@@ ent , teacher , poli@@ cy mak@@ er , wh@@ at@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ s@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ac@@ k an@@ ten@@ na at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a f@@ un little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and p@@ lum@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ ca@@ p ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ al@@ ile@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his te@@ les@@ cop@@ e to Sat@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
There was a lot of people there .
"H@@ ere &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ p@@ e off ."
Thank you .
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED st@@ age in Ar@@ us@@ ha , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I sp@@ oke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pr@@ ou@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ ef@@ ore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ ala@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Inter@@ net .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"M@@ y English lost , I wanted to v@@ omi@@ t ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"A@@ ll si@@ ster@@ s , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ ef@@ ore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ m@@ er in a country of poor far@@ mer@@ s ."
"L@@ ik@@ e everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our fort@@ un@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experienc@@ ed an a@@ w@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ ala@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to de@@ ath .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at ni@@ ght ."
On@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The f@@ ood pas@@ ses through our bo@@ di@@ es .
We drop down to nothing .
"In M@@ ala@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to drop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I cou@@ ldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I fel@@ t very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read bo@@ ok@@ s , science bo@@ ok@@ s , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally physics ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge in my han@@ ds .
It said a w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ c@@ ity .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a def@@ en@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experiencing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a s@@ cra@@ p yar@@ d where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inc@@ lu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a trac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a bi@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le f@@ ra@@ me and an old bi@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le d@@ yn@@ am@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mo@@ de@@ led after an electri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ u@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my h@@ ou@@ se ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bile ph@@ one .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to blo@@ g@@ ger@@ s and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in Ar@@ us@@ ha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fri@@ c@@ ans , and the poor who are str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
G@@ od b@@ less .
M@@ aybe one day you will watch this on the Inter@@ net .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
We re@@ tain just 2@@ 5 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my t@@ um@@ ble dr@@ yer ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human valu@@ es .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and ev@@ il and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ i@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we valu@@ e , but it can never tell us what we ought to valu@@ e ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th li@@ ving for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ sti@@ tut@@ es a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human valu@@ es is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a dan@@ ger@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s of@@ ten said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ dation for mor@@ ality and human valu@@ es , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and valu@@ es seem to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s of@@ ten thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ u@@ es are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can suff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our f@@ ell@@ ow pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ se@@ c@@ ts , as inde@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a great@@ er ran@@ ge of pot@@ enti@@ al happiness and suff@@ ering ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to no@@ tice here is that this is a fac@@ tual c@@ la@@ im : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bi@@ ological comple@@ x@@ ity and the possibili@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ c@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human valu@@ es that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your valu@@ es from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and ev@@ il ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rela@@ te to condi@@ tions after de@@ ath — ei@@ ther to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of suff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after de@@ ath is itself a fac@@ tual c@@ la@@ im , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the condi@@ tions of well-being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a continu@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ i@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where stran@@ ger@@ s cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ace@@ ful col@@ labor@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continu@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more id@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the ev@@ il eye , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ ately bla@@ me their ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human commun@@ i@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rela@@ t@@ es to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about valu@@ es we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our si@@ tu@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic syste@@ ms and political ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of ne@@ ces@@ si@@ ty , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of our@@ selves within it is re@@ alized in the brain — wh@@ at@@ ever happens after de@@ ath .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his person@@ ality — his rather un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate person@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as inde@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ ef@@ ore wh@@ at@@ ever cul@@ tur@@ al var@@ i@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at le@@ ast in princi@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the con@@ te@@ xt of a ma@@ tur@@ ing science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , psych@@ ology , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that valu@@ e &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ ef@@ ore v@@ is@@ u@@ al@@ ize a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ ley@@ s that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both person@@ al and col@@ lec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to no@@ tice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we r@@ ar@@ ely ac@@ cess , that few people ac@@ cess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ h@@ ap@@ s some of these states can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called my@@ s@@ tical or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual .
P@@ er@@ h@@ ap@@ s there are other states that we can &apos;t ac@@ cess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds pos@@ si@@ bly could ac@@ cess them .
"Now , let me be c@@ lear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fi@@ c ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stance , that you will one day con@@ s@@ ult a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the ful@@ l cost of TED as a b@@ usiness exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions affec@@ t human well-being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mi@@ tting this — just ad@@ mi@@ tting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how human@@ s fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expec@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stance , there are 2@@ 1 states in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ den bo@@ ar@@ d , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing lar@@ ge b@@ ru@@ i@@ ses and b@@ li@@ ster@@ s and even bre@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , inci@@ den@@ t@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ ca@@ tions of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed dist@@ ri@@ c@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about C@@ on@@ ne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ al@@ e for this behavi@@ or is exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we s@@ po@@ il the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , to sub@@ ject children to pa@@ in and violence and publi@@ c hu@@ mili@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ging heal@@ thy e@@ mo@@ tional develop@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of well-being is truly un@@ defin@@ ed , and seem@@ ing@@ ly per@@ pet@@ u@@ ally op@@ en to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ ef@@ ore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive no@@ tion of well-being ?"
"Well , con@@ si@@ der by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physic@@ al health ."
The con@@ cept of physic@@ al health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ pec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this st@@ atu@@ e was car@@ ved the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ d@@ dle with our gen@@ o@@ mes in such a way that not being able to r@@ un a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be con@@ si@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found di@@ sa@@ bili@@ ty .
P@@ eople will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condi@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) No@@ tice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is op@@ en , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely op@@ en for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as c@@ lear and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ tice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ miz@@ e human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ jec@@ tive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about f@@ ood : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right f@@ ood to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ sti@@ tut@@ e heal@@ thy f@@ ood .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a c@@ lear dist@@ inc@@ tion between f@@ ood and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is f@@ ood ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ pt us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univer@@ sal mor@@ ality would re@@ qu@@ ire moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mi@@ t of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tr@@ ut@@ h ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to pla@@ y good ch@@ ess , a princi@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ een , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ mi@@ ts some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ een is a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ ma@@ in of per@@ fe@@ ct ob@@ jec@@ tivity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sp@@ here ."
C@@ on@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , of our intel@@ lec@@ tual commun@@ ity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pr@@ ou@@ d den@@ iz@@ en@@ s of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and dau@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with len@@ g@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they de@@ cl@@ ine the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ t@@ end that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be n@@ on@@ -@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pr@@ ac@@ tice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y we@@ ar@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar wh@@ at@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y mean in a commun@@ ity where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather of@@ ten , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ Just let that fact de@@ t@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a min@@ ute : Y@@ our daughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fe@@ ct s@@ olution in our own society ."
"For in@@ stance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qu@@ ire a de@@ g@@ ree in ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a ref@@ lec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fe@@ ct ex@@ pres@@ sion of psych@@ ological balan@@ ce with res@@ pect to var@@ i@@ ab@@ les like y@@ ou@@ th and be@@ a@@ ut@@ y and women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environ@@ ment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ bab@@ ly not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tr@@ um between these two extre@@ mes that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better balan@@ ce ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ h@@ ap@@ s there are many such pla@@ ces — again , gi@@ ven other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral lan@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
But the thing to no@@ tice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are religi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a v@@ o@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intelli@@ g@@ ent anal@@ y@@ s@@ is of the ca@@ u@@ ses and condi@@ tion of human and ani@@ mal well-being ."
"In fact , the en@@ dur@@ ance of religi@@ on as a len@@ s through which most people view moral questions has se@@ par@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and ani@@ mal suff@@ ering ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like g@@ ay marri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ lear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ gel@@ y con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univer@@ sal con@@ cep@@ tion of human valu@@ es .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ tice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ cu@@ lar , ac@@ ade@@ mic , scienti@@ st ty@@ p@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we valu@@ e differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ i@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stance the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ ama gets up every mor@@ ning medi@@ t@@ ating on compassion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l comp@@ on@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and t@@ ort@@ ur@@ ing and kil@@ ling young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ i@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost We@@ ster@@ n intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als look at this si@@ tu@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ ala@@ i L@@ ama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ mi@@ ts of a real arg@@ ument that pot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ al@@ ls within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ c@@ ola@@ te , he lik@@ es van@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; No@@ tice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a string the@@ or@@ ist .
"If you ask the smar@@ test phy@@ si@@ ci@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test physic@@ ist around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ son@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scal@@ e .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physic@@ ist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any string theory c@@ lu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be exc@@ lu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a do@@ ma@@ in of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"H@@ ow have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed our@@ selves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral exper@@ ti@@ se , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ i@@ on has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed our@@ selves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their i@@ gn@@ oran@@ ce any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well-being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world ne@@ eds now ."
"It ne@@ eds people like our@@ selves to ad@@ mi@@ t that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rela@@ t@@ es to that do@@ ma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for in@@ dividu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and desi@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to ne@@ ed@@ less human suff@@ ering ."
Just ad@@ mi@@ tting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ in@@ ven@@ ted ; it will always be e@@ a@@ si@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ ef@@ ore , pat@@ ently ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more res@@ pect and tol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in no@@ tions of human well-being than we can res@@ pect or tol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the no@@ tions about how disease sp@@ re@@ a@@ ds , or in the sa@@ f@@ ety stan@@ d@@ ar@@ ds of buil@@ din@@ gs and a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ mi@@ t that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Chris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ b@@ us@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"W@@ he@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women d@@ res@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ lim world , sp@@ ok@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ lim women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a ce@@ le@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ mal@@ e speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a res@@ ult of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated psych@@ ological view — &quot; that mal@@ e l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ sted . &quot;"
"S@@ am Har@@ ris : Y@@ e@@ ah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sen@@ t@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ lo@@ ck tic@@ king , but the question is : What is v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ y in a con@@ te@@ xt where men have certain expec@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily do wh@@ at@@ ever we want , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are pla@@ ced under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ager to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re we@@ ar@@ ing a ful@@ l bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral prog@@ ress .
But can you re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ in@@ t your picture of what rol@@ ling the c@@ lo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , balan@@ c@@ ing moral prog@@ ress with rich@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mi@@ t that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important deta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ mi@@ t that we are going to understand all of the positive and neg@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of our@@ selves in much great@@ er deta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social e@@ mo@@ tion like em@@ pa@@ thy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic syste@@ ms , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my daughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and well-@@ e@@ duc@@ ated in the con@@ te@@ xt of men who do desi@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ olved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their dau@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these syste@@ ms ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your in@@ st@@ inc@@ tive cur@@ r@@ ent j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these is@@ su@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ du@@ lo one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ te@@ xt of a truly de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a boy@@ fri@@ end , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most compas@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; I@@ f you get all those parts ali@@ gn@@ ed , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the e@@ mo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a lar@@ ger con@@ te@@ xt ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ asy and then blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to continu@@ e for h@@ ours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an h@@ onor . Thank you .

"So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a Jap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the na@@ me of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;"

"So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , what is the na@@ me of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , well that &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the na@@ me of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have na@@ mes ."
B@@ loc@@ ks have na@@ mes .
"@@ Just look at Google M@@ ap@@ s here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 14 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."
"A@@ ll of these b@@ loc@@ ks have na@@ mes , and the stre@@ ets are just the un@@ na@@ med sp@@ ac@@ es in between the b@@ loc@@ ks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ ist@@ ri@@ ct E@@ ight ."
"There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , h@@ ou@@ se number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but walking around the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I no@@ tic@@ ed that the h@@ ou@@ se numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first h@@ ou@@ se ever built on a blo@@ ck is h@@ ou@@ se number one .
The second h@@ ou@@ se ever built is h@@ ou@@ se number two .
"Th@@ ir@@ d is h@@ ou@@ se number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that some@@ times we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to re@@ al@@ ize as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and re@@ al@@ ize that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you p@@ ay them , and when you &apos;re sic@@ k you don &apos;t have to p@@ ay them because they fa@@ i@@ led at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not sic@@ k ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ sic@@ al ph@@ r@@ ase : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est A@@ fri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ r@@ ase , like the per@@ i@@ od at the end of a sen@@ t@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ ras@@ ing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also ac@@ cur@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that wh@@ at@@ ever true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."
