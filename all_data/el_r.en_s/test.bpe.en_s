T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expe@@ cted disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology in@@ du@@ st@@ ry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by pa@@ y@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to ...
... pa@@ y@@ ing at@@ ten@@ tion to cro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ cing .
It &apos;s just a quic@@ k vi@@ de@@ o of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just sk@@ i@@ p — I &apos;ll just sk@@ i@@ p through the vi@@ de@@ o instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ u@@ sic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by of@@ fer@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ te@@ ch life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your po@@ stu@@ re for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ di@@ t of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sm@@ al@@ ler ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we s@@ pre@@ ad out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ularly interes@@ ted in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interes@@ ted in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mil@@ e , or a con@@ tem@@ p@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ sh@@ ake ."
N@@ ar@@ ra@@ tor : Here they are ar@@ riv@@ ing at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ imes .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavi@@ or , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ation ."
"When we think about comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make swe@@ ep@@ ing j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ en@@ ces from body language .
"And those j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments can pre@@ di@@ ct really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pro@@ m@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a rese@@ arch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ vers@@ ity , sho@@ ws that when people watch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s ni@@ cen@@ ess pre@@ di@@ ct whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them poor@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ i@@ ght ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logis@@ t . I study pre@@ j@@ u@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive b@@ usiness school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interes@@ ted in power dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
I be@@ came es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally interes@@ ted in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , they are about expan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ c@@ a T@@ ra@@ cy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really power@@ ful with us , we tend to make ourselves sm@@ al@@ ler . We don &apos;t mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing this behavi@@ or in the clas@@ s@@ room , and what do I no@@ tice ?"
"When they si@@ t down , they &apos;re sort of s@@ pre@@ ad out ."
"You have other people who are vi@@ r@@ tually col@@ l@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . As so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ tice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ omen feel chron@@ ically less power@@ ful than men , so this is not surpris@@ ing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s@@ room , because par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So b@@ usiness schools have been stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de g@@ ap .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mil@@ e when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mil@@ e by h@@ ol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the power@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the power@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So power@@ ful people tend to be , not surpris@@ ing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power le@@ ade@@ r that &apos;s domin@@ ant , high on te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at le@@ ast at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be s@@ it@@ ting .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re to@@ uch@@ ing your ne@@ ck , you &apos;re really prote@@ c@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being re@@ cor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being he@@ c@@ k@@ led ."
P@@ eople ha@@ te this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re b@@ lin@@ d to the hy@@ pothe@@ sis . They &apos;re b@@ lin@@ d to the con@@ ditions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re b@@ rin@@ ging to the spe@@ e@@ ch .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s d@@ riv@@ ing the ef@@ fect , or me@@ di@@ ating the ef@@ fect ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ r@@ au@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad c@@ ar ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was thro@@ wn out of a c@@ ar , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was thro@@ wn from the c@@ ar .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fied with being s@@ mar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish college ."
I am an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ L@@ ike , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"@@ L@@ ike , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ e@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that s@@ it@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from Pro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ em@@ ploy@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ad@@ s through state par@@ ks and national for@@ e@@ sts — basically the lon@@ gest ro@@ u@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ota , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 miles ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep see@@ ing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
M@@ y fri@@ end looks at me to@@ tally b@@ lan@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a gen@@ t@@ le@@ man in the fron@@ t ro@@ w who &apos;s doing a per@@ fect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sign@@ s we keep see@@ ing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mo@@ ments , and then she cra@@ c@@ ks up , because she fi@@ g@@ ures out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ i@@ ght , the fam@@ ous Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about s@@ it@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we some@@ times mis@@ understand the sign@@ s around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might st@@ rik@@ e you as a strange car@@ e@@ er move , but it actually has one great ad@@ van@@ t@@ age : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about being wrong , or at le@@ ast to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ stra@@ ct .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human speci@@ es , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay fin@@ e ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ ef@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly all of this ab@@ stra@@ ct ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the poll@@ s and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So ef@@ fe@@ c@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of win@@ d up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bub@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our pers@@ onal and profes@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us colle@@ c@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ vin@@ ce you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single grea@@ test moral , intel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al and cre@@ ative le@@ ap you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me ask you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing — than@@ k you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to re@@ aliz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ vas@@ t@@ ating , it can be re@@ vel@@ a@@ tory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ og@@ y .
Do you remem@@ ber that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic c@@ oy@@ ote who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never c@@ at@@ ch@@ ing a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the c@@ oy@@ ote is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is fin@@ e — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the c@@ oy@@ ote run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at le@@ ast if you &apos;re six years old — is that the c@@ oy@@ ote &apos;s to@@ tally fin@@ e too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and re@@ aliz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we re@@ aliz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that c@@ oy@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tro@@ u@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ re@@ ct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feel@@ s like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a stru@@ c@@ tural reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ ght@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tural .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y school .
"You &apos;re s@@ it@@ ting there in clas@@ s , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qui@@ z pap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not min@@ e , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this pap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b ki@@ d , the tro@@ u@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ responsi@@ ble di@@ m@@ w@@ its — and second of all , that the way to succ@@ e@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad le@@ ss@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ spe@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just be@@ coming per@@ fect little A students , per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ is@@ ts , o@@ ver@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ R@@ i@@ ght , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , as@@ tro@@ physi@@ c@@ is@@ t , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , as@@ tro@@ physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so fin@@ e ."
Ex@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ sis@@ t that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel s@@ mar@@ t and responsi@@ ble and vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous and saf@@ e ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a su@@ rg@@ ery ."
B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ var@@ d — one of the best h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the o@@ per@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ tiz@@ ed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have gone fin@@ e .
"And she w@@ akes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perfor@@ med a ma@@ j@@ or o@@ per@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el spo@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ ate@@ ver reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply f@@ elt that he was on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tr@@ us@@ ting too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ re@@ ct side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ ght@@ ness that we all experience so of@@ ten is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ m@@ ping 200 million gal@@ l@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a hu@@ ge pra@@ c@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a hu@@ ge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ ef@@ s just per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly re@@ f@@ le@@ ct reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ c@@ ess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re idi@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pie@@ ces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mo@@ ron@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty s@@ mar@@ t , then we move on to a th@@ ir@@ d as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are de@@ liber@@ a@@ tely dis@@ tor@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ tas@@ tro@@ p@@ he .
This at@@ tach@@ ment to our own ri@@ ght@@ ness ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ ven@@ ting mis@@ takes when we ab@@ solu@@ tely need to and c@@ au@@ ses us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly trans@@ lu@@ cent win@@ do@@ ws and we just g@@ az@@ e out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to g@@ az@@ e out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remem@@ ber the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differen@@ tly , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . Au@@ g@@ us@@ tin@@ e , s@@ at down and wrote &quot; &quot; F@@ allo@@ r ergo su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"Au@@ g@@ us@@ tin@@ e under@@ sto@@ od that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ras@@ sing de@@ fect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or o@@ ver@@ come ."
It &apos;s to@@ tally fun@@ da@@ mental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ im@@ als , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to figu@@ re it out ."
"To me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the s@@ our@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"@@ L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself lis@@ ten@@ ing to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ dio show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing and I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y w@@ ron@@ gn@@ ess la@@ dy .
"I just ima@@ gin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same c@@ ry@@ pto@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ ry@@ pto@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ las@@ s , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mo@@ ments of surpris@@ e and re@@ vers@@ al and w@@ ron@@ gn@@ ess to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ bers , as lis@@ ten@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ is@@ ts and red her@@ rings and surpris@@ e en@@ din@@ gs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .

And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school swe@@ e@@ the@@ ar@@ t and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a b@@ un@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was w@@ ri@@ ting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody ha@@ tes for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and as@@ ton@@ is@@ h@@ es us ."
"N@@ o of@@ f@@ en@@ se , but this enti@@ re con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an enti@@ re week talking about in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and ad@@ van@@ c@@ e@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments , but you know why we need all of those in@@ no@@ v@@ ations and ad@@ van@@ c@@ e@@ ments and impro@@ ve@@ ments ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ g@@ g@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you gu@@ ys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to ste@@ p outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the vas@@ t@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ ster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ aybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you gu@@ ys . ( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ ro@@ us before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"This little b@@ oy is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ le@@ ss@@ ing as a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ c@@ ess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I fami@@ li@@ ar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have visi@@ ted more than 1@@ 45 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l-@@ time pro@@ gra@@ ms in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"So our o@@ ver@@ all com@@ mit@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pro@@ m@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ vo@@ c@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , stran@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ ss@@ ed quite of@@ ten , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ irst of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of religi@@ ous s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures , in the Bi@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ e@@ sta@@ ment , New T@@ e@@ sta@@ ment , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tions in the syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ches and in the mo@@ squ@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these r@@ ul@@ es to make sure that women are ordin@@ arily re@@ leg@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary position compar@@ ed to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ arily not ad@@ dre@@ ss@@ ed .
But the bas@@ ic thing is the s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant position .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ vas@@ i@@ ve problem , because men can exer@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ usb@@ and or an em@@ ploy@@ er , for in@@ st@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equal in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als myself ?"
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous b@@ light that c@@ au@@ ses this problem is the ex@@ c@@ es@@ sive res@@ or@@ t to violence , and that is increas@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in of@@ fi@@ ce as go@@ ver@@ no@@ r of Ge@@ or@@ gia , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pris@@ on ."
"@@ No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pris@@ on ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old increase .
And we ran@@ k right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all ele@@ ments of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it co@@ sts C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fai@@ r@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a li@@ mi@@ ted amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation .
"And some@@ times , in more extre@@ me c@@ as@@ es but not very r@@ are c@@ as@@ es , they se@@ w the or@@ i@@ fi@@ ce up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ stru@@ ate ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ gy@@ p@@ t , for in@@ st@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ mal@@ es that live in E@@ gy@@ p@@ t today have been sex@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated in that way ."
This is a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble af@@ f@@ li@@ ction on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family becomes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the girl b@@ rings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that re@@ la@@ tes to women partic@@ ularly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ f@@ fic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people sol@@ d from A@@ fri@@ c@@ a into s@@ la@@ very in the New World back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now li@@ ving in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment of Sta@@ te now has a man@@ d@@ ate from C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ port every year , and the Sta@@ te D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 00@@ ,000 people are sol@@ d across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those sol@@ d are women , into sex@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are li@@ ving in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gia , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ mor@@ y Uni@@ vers@@ ity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people sol@@ d into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to buy a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ ite@@ -@@ s@@ kin@@ ned girl b@@ rings se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gia , ex@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ds the to@@ tal dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ ta , Ge@@ or@@ gia ."
Swe@@ den has got a good approach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , Swe@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted if they are in sex@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the pi@@ m@@ ps and the mal@@ e c@@ us@@ to@@ mer@@ s are pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pro@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every mal@@ e ar@@ res@@ ted for il@@ leg@@ al sex tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ res@@ ted in the United States of America ."
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing how many sex@@ u@@ al ass@@ au@@ l@@ ts take place ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fi@@ cer of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ ion in the A@@ r@@ my or a compan@@ y in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fi@@ cer has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pro@@ se@@ cu@@ te a rap@@ is@@ t or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , sex@@ u@@ al ass@@ au@@ l@@ ts are tak@@ ing place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
They &apos;re not pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equal p@@ ay for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is some@@ times mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l-@@ time em@@ ploy@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I be@@ came pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d World War .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been f@@ ly@@ ing o@@ ver@@ head dro@@ p@@ ping bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that at@@ t@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ or@@ t to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of the ho@@ ly s@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are what c@@ au@@ ses , are the bas@@ ic c@@ au@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qui@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed position that we occ@@ up@@ y , and this is very si@@ mil@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate but equal had exis@@ ted ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ j@@ oy a pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed position ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ gy@@ p@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated and so for@@ th .
Thank you very much .
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ p@@ riv@@ ed women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fain@@ ted from ex@@ h@@ au@@ s@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right ey@@ e ."
And I beg@@ an the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I me@@ t with me@@ di@@ cal doc@@ tors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more in@@ spi@@ red , more j@@ oy@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ vol@@ ution , this new fe@@ min@@ is@@ t issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ l@@ ity sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was re@@ cen@@ tly having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ g@@ g@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four h@@ ours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I f@@ elt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I f@@ elt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ p@@ riv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ fas@@ t d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Ei@@ ght o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck is too late for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence c@@ all@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly b@@ us@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in b@@ usiness , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble dec@@ is@@ i@@ ons ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good le@@ ade@@ r , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ s .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ is@@ ters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were b@@ us@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conne@@ cted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a sis@@ ter would have no@@ tic@@ ed the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g , because she would have wo@@ k@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght@@ -@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple c@@ ris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a pers@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more j@@ oy , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , ef@@ fe@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own car@@ e@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your en@@ gin@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ ctions and stru@@ cture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minu@@ te about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"@@ Here is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ po@@ und mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the vas@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate itself con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ i@@ l of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ logy , and ho@@ pe@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of proto@@ plas@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity emer@@ ges the whole spec@@ tru@@ m of ab@@ ili@@ ties that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ ctions of the human brain ."
"One approach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ st@@ ain@@ ed da@@ ma@@ ge to a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ro@@ ss@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ iti@@ es , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cogni@@ tive ab@@ ility ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly se@@ le@@ ctive lo@@ ss of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ ctions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ t@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how in@@ vol@@ ved in me@@ di@@ ating that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ ction on@@ to stru@@ cture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few st@@ rik@@ ing exam@@ pl@@ es of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ pl@@ es , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary syn@@ dro@@ me called C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras syn@@ dro@@ me .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ b@@ es , fron@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es , par@@ i@@ e@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es , O@@ K — the lo@@ b@@ es that con@@ sti@@ tu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ b@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little stru@@ cture called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer recogn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogn@@ ize them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogn@@ ize yourself in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that syn@@ dro@@ me is well known as c@@ au@@ sed by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are syn@@ dro@@ me , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logis@@ ts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras de@@ lu@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise comple@@ tely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise comple@@ tely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intel@@ lig@@ ent in all other re@@ spe@@ cts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his de@@ lu@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ ch@@ ia@@ try te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this ch@@ ap — and the same argu@@ ment app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ ab@@ y , a young b@@ ab@@ y , you had a strong sex@@ u@@ al at@@ tra@@ ction to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develo@@ ps , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these la@@ tent sex@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be sex@@ u@@ ally aro@@ used when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these la@@ tent sex@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fla@@ ming to the sur@@ face , and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly and in@@ ex@@ plic@@ ably you find yourself being sex@@ u@@ ally aro@@ used by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being sex@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this argu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an argu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same de@@ lu@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same de@@ lu@@ sion , about his pe@@ t po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ i@@ ght ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the la@@ tent be@@ sti@@ ality in all human@@ s , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the stru@@ cture and fun@@ ctions of the nor@@ mal vis@@ u@@ al path@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ Nor@@ m@@ ally , vis@@ u@@ al sign@@ als come in , into the ey@@ eb@@ all@@ s , go to the vis@@ u@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after proc@@ ess@@ ing all that , the message goes to a small stru@@ cture called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you lo@@ se the ab@@ ility to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ades into a stru@@ cture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the e@@ moti@@ onal cor@@ e of the brain , and that stru@@ cture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , g@@ au@@ ges the e@@ moti@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ d@@ ato@@ r ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ solu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of chal@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can comple@@ tely ig@@ nor@@ e .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is exci@@ ted , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ e into the auto@@ no@@ mic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cu@@ lar exer@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ t@@ un@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your pal@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce produc@@ ed by swe@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exci@@ ted or whether you &apos;re aro@@ used , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minu@@ te .
"So my idea was , when this ch@@ ap looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vis@@ u@@ al are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ ess@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , and you recogn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ades into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the auto@@ no@@ mic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this ch@@ ap , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the e@@ moti@@ onal cor@@ e of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ t@@ act , the ch@@ ap can still recogn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is c@@ ut to the e@@ moti@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ i@@ ght ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ ex@@ plic@@ able l@@ ack of e@@ mo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in fron@@ t of a scre@@ en , and measure your gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ bre@@ lla . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a pin@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start swe@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measure his gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and ch@@ air@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ van@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no e@@ moti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the vis@@ u@@ al are@@ as to the e@@ moti@@ onal cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vision is nor@@ mal because the vis@@ u@@ al are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his e@@ mo@@ tions are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll lau@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the wi@@ re from vision to e@@ mo@@ tions is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this de@@ lu@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , neu@@ ral psy@@ ch@@ ia@@ tri@@ c syn@@ dro@@ me and say that the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a prec@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neu@@ ral an@@ ato@@ my of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no de@@ lu@@ sion through the ph@@ one ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate path@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the e@@ moti@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this explain@@ s why through the ph@@ one he recogn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ po@@ sto@@ r ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we approach this problem by con@@ si@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous syn@@ dro@@ me called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , for g@@ ang@@ ren@@ e , or you lo@@ se it in war — for example , in the Ira@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vis@@ c@@ era ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ ere@@ c@@ to@@ my — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ stru@@ al cra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stu@@ dent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ MS ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fi@@ c en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experi@@ ments ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ ai@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the ph@@ one when it rings , it &apos;ll w@@ ave go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very com@@ p@@ el@@ ling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ations ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a com@@ p@@ el@@ ling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a c@@ len@@ ch@@ ed sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ati@@ n@@ g@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an oxy@@ mo@@ ron .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ y@@ ing the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was c@@ ut , by say , a mo@@ tor@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d at@@ tem@@ p@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pain in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ ta@@ tes the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pain@@ s , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous c@@ lin@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ press@@ ed .
"S@@ ome of them are d@@ riv@@ en to su@@ i@@ ci@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this syn@@ dro@@ me ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ y@@ ing the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tu@@ al ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , and ly@@ ing in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ t@@ ation , and this pain then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ t@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the fron@@ t of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vis@@ u@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ eb@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ s@@ ation of a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis car@@ ries over into your body ima@@ ge and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , c@@ len@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vis@@ u@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ y@@ ing his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ aybe you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pain , the ph@@ an@@ tom cra@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al reality ."
But that co@@ sts mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ ere@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , ly@@ ing in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ati@@ n@@ g@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he cou@@ ldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is c@@ len@@ ch@@ ed and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same po@@ stu@@ re , the c@@ len@@ ch@@ ed po@@ stu@@ re , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ f@@ le@@ ction of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been re@@ sur@@ re@@ cted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vis@@ u@@ al im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again , and the pain , the c@@ len@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remem@@ ber , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — than@@ k you . ( Applause ) M@@ y first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ f@@ le@@ ction of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ g@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r re@@ f@@ le@@ ction , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lo@@ se your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s c@@ len@@ ch@@ ed again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , op@@ en your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s mo@@ ving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a can@@ dy sto@@ re ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vis@@ u@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ riz@@ e for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a comple@@ tely us@@ ele@@ ss ab@@ ility , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started re@@ aliz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ y@@ sis that you see in neuro@@ logy , like stro@@ ke , fo@@ cal dy@@ sto@@ ni@@ as — there may be a learned com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which you can o@@ ver@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ ere@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ ry@@ ing a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ ere@@ k , take it home and pra@@ c@@ tice with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ aybe , after a peri@@ od of pra@@ c@@ tice , you can dis@@ pen@@ se with the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and start mo@@ ving your par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body ima@@ ge , what about human sub@@ jects , eth@@ ic@@ s and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ere@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pain , no c@@ len@@ ch@@ ing , no ph@@ an@@ tom for@@ ear@@ m pain , all those pain@@ s are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the de@@ sign and put it on my for@@ e@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ sor@@ y con@@ f@@ li@@ ct .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ c@@ le sign@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mo@@ tor comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ f@@ li@@ ct , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the sign@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pain dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died pain flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other groups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a treat@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pain , and inde@@ ed , people have tried it for stro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some com@@ pon@@ ent of stro@@ ke par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is also learned par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that com@@ pon@@ ent can be o@@ ver@@ come using mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r@@ s ."
"This has also gone through c@@ lin@@ ical trials , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me sw@@ it@@ ch ge@@ ar@@ s now to the th@@ ir@@ d part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ omenon called syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Char@@ les Dar@@ win .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise comple@@ tely nor@@ mal , had the follo@@ wing pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s col@@ or@@ ed ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is b@@ lu@@ e , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are comple@@ tely nor@@ mal in other re@@ spe@@ cts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — some@@ times , ton@@ es ev@@ ok@@ e co@@ lo@@ r ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is b@@ lu@@ e , F sh@@ ar@@ p is gre@@ en , another ton@@ e might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia . G@@ al@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dis@@ tin@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ pe@@ cts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ yn@@ es@@ the@@ sia run@@ s in fami@@ lies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a h@@ ere@@ d@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this le@@ cture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia is eight times more common a@@ mon@@ g ar@@ ti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ vel@@ is@@ ts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ? What c@@ au@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many theor@@ ies ."
One theory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fi@@ c theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and pothe@@ ad@@ s , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an Di@@ ego ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the th@@ ir@@ d theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the co@@ lo@@ r are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal c@@ ross wi@@ ring between co@@ lo@@ r and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding co@@ lo@@ r , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ."
Now remem@@ ber — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cro@@ ss@@ ed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in fami@@ lies ?
That gi@@ ves you the clu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a mu@@ t@@ ation in the gen@@ e that c@@ au@@ ses this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross wi@@ ring ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain re@@ gi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other re@@ gi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ du@@ lar archite@@ cture of the ad@@ ul@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e c@@ au@@ sing this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ ta@@ tes , then you get de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and co@@ lo@@ r , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ r syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ."
"If it &apos;s between ton@@ e and co@@ lo@@ r , you get to@@ ne@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ r syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ press@@ ed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cro@@ ss@@ -@@ conne@@ cted ?"
"Well , think about what ar@@ ti@@ sts , no@@ vel@@ is@@ ts and po@@ ets have in common , the ab@@ ility to eng@@ age in me@@ tap@@ h@@ or@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king see@@ min@@ g@@ ly un@@ re@@ lated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the eas@@ t , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a glo@@ wing b@@ all of fire ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ o@@ ph@@ ren@@ ic@@ s do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"@@ Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ st@@ an@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this grea@@ ter c@@ ross wi@@ ring and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a grea@@ ter pro@@ pen@@ s@@ ity to@@ wards me@@ tap@@ h@@ or@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia a@@ mon@@ g po@@ ets , ar@@ ti@@ sts and no@@ vel@@ is@@ ts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ologi@@ cal view of syn@@ es@@ the@@ sia ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one minu@@ te ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ es@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . Just like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"@@ Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ iki , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ iki and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ iki and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tan@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ iki ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
