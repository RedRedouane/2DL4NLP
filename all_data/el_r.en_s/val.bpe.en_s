"When I was 1@@ 1 , I remem@@ ber w@@ ak@@ ing up one mor@@ ning to the sound of j@@ oy in my h@@ ou@@ se ."
"M@@ y father was lis@@ ten@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y ra@@ dio ."
"There was a big s@@ mil@@ e on his face which was un@@ u@@ su@@ al then , because the news mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ press@@ ed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ anistan and made it il@@ leg@@ al for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ ss@@ ed as a b@@ oy to es@@ cor@@ t my older sis@@ ter , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a se@@ cre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different ro@@ u@@ te so that no one would su@@ spe@@ ct where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our bo@@ o@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a h@@ ou@@ se , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small li@@ ving room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our par@@ ents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ d@@ den@@ ly be can@@ c@@ ele@@ d for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were s@@ car@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ c@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was p@@ riz@@ ed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ asu@@ red .
M@@ y grand@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary man for his time .
"A to@@ tal ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ vin@@ ce of Af@@ gh@@ anistan , he in@@ sis@@ ted that his daughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother be@@ came a teacher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ou@@ se into a school for girls and women in our n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to rec@@ ei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would rec@@ ei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"To him , there was grea@@ ter ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remem@@ ber there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by our life and always being s@@ car@@ ed and not see@@ ing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ is@@ ten , my daughter , you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be sto@@ le@@ n . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our b@@ loo@@ d to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed by dec@@ ades of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ on@@ d high school , and had my family not been so com@@ mit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pro@@ u@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ anistan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ i@@ led from his home for d@@ ar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was a@@ mon@@ g the first to con@@ gra@@ tu@@ late me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my college de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to d@@ ri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) M@@ y family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global c@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Af@@ gh@@ anistan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ k@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exci@@ ting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at op@@ por@@ t@@ unity .
"And I see their par@@ ents and their f@@ ath@@ ers who , like my own , ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of d@@ au@@ n@@ ting op@@ position ."
"@@ L@@ ike A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being k@@ il@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ riv@@ ed home , the ph@@ one ran@@ g , a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his daughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to re@@ aliz@@ e about Af@@ gh@@ anistan , and this is something that is of@@ ten dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who succ@@ e@@ ed is a father who recogn@@ iz@@ es the val@@ ue in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers ar@@ en &apos;t ke@@ y in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re of@@ ten the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ vin@@ cing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ a@@ tors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ anistan , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundre@@ ds — remem@@ ber , it was il@@ leg@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ anistan ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ anistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the f@@ rag@@ ility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ on@@ d the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ anistan , when I see the students in my school and their par@@ ents who ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for them , who en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge them , I see a pro@@ mis@@ ing future and las@@ ting change ."
"To me , Af@@ gh@@ anistan is a country of ho@@ pe and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ L@@ ike me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ Just ab@@ solu@@ tely a@@ maz@@ ing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ is@@ appe@@ ar@@ s right into the bac@@ k@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s b@@ lu@@ f@@ f@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it bac@@ k@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first publi@@ c ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion ."
"If anything see@@ med un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really for@@ t@@ un@@ ate to get out , many other Nor@@ th Kor@@ e@@ ans have not been so lu@@ c@@ k@@ y ."
"E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an in@@ st@@ ant ."
"We are all Kor@@ ean , but inside , we have become very different , du@@ e to 6@@ 7 years of di@@ vision ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th Kor@@ ean or Nor@@ th Kor@@ ean ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpris@@ ed that a to@@ tal stran@@ ger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I re@@ alized that this was a sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten we design@@ ed in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten to be a circ@@ le .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we de@@ sign this ?
"The princi@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ i@@ l . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sis@@ ted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ c@@ king out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es po@@ p@@ ping through .
And we were allowed to call this ro@@ pe as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ i@@ l .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a tree .
"The b@@ oy on the b@@ ran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tree so he is e@@ ating the tree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they si@@ t on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the c@@ ei@@ ling ."
And the le@@ g was@@ hing place — there are many kinds of water tap@@ s .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to s@@ pra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in fron@@ t is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the b@@ oy is not was@@ hing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten is comple@@ tely op@@ en , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this archite@@ cture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary between clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary .
"And the princi@@ p@@ al says if the b@@ oy in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a circ@@ le , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occ@@ as@@ ion , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we con@@ sider no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten , these children show a@@ maz@@ ing con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion in clas@@ s ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in si@@ l@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under contro@@ l ."
"You know , it &apos;s comple@@ tely op@@ en ."
And you should know that we can go sk@@ i@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go sw@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
You never me@@ l@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divi@@ de clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are sup@@ posed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A clas@@ s@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the clas@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ ke@@ y trying to f@@ ish another mon@@ ke@@ y from ab@@ ove .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each clas@@ s@@ room has at le@@ ast one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ ta C@@ lau@@ s comes down at the time of Chris@@ t@@ mas .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the c@@ ei@@ ling h@@ eight is very low ."
So you have to con@@ sider sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a daughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite strong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is saf@@ e to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ f@@ fi@@ c j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in T@@ o@@ ky@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The d@@ ri@@ ver in fron@@ t , she needs to learn how to d@@ ri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of d@@ ang@@ er ."
"And in this kind of occ@@ as@@ ion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of op@@ por@@ t@@ unity we are lo@@ sing these days .
"Now , this dra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a b@@ oy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this b@@ oy did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpris@@ e is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est ath@@ le@@ tic ab@@ ili@@ ties a@@ mon@@ g many kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The princi@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t contro@@ l them , don &apos;t prote@@ ct them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble some@@ times ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ur@@ y .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the at@@ tem@@ p@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ led to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really loved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really lik@@ ed , and you anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted that re@@ action , you w@@ ai@@ ted for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?"
"So , by way of in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school ma@@ th ."
"I s@@ ell a pro@@ du@@ ct to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a lo@@ sing pro@@ position ."
"So there &apos;s a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a us@@ e@@ ful st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would expe@@ ct no high@@ er than a 25 percent pas@@ s rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.S. today .
"To start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak ma@@ th down into two ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies ."
One is compu@@ t@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ tics with lead@@ ing co@@ ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ents grea@@ ter than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ vi@@ ded you have a really strong gro@@ un@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ li@@ c@@ ation of ma@@ th proc@@ es@@ ses to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to clo@@ se with , why this is an a@@ maz@@ ing time to be a ma@@ th teacher ."
"So first , five sym@@ pto@@ ms that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your clas@@ s@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your le@@ cture blo@@ ck and im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely you have five hands going up asking you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their de@@ sk@@ s .
S@@ tu@@ dents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ explain@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ les@@ al@@ e ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which describ@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mu@@ la to app@@ ly in that s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ stru@@ ctive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d Mil@@ ch , cre@@ ato@@ r of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other a@@ maz@@ ing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary dra@@ ma , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four h@@ ours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ re@@ spe@@ ct , it shap@@ es the neu@@ ral path@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expe@@ ct simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ sol@@ ution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quickly ."
"You expe@@ ct s@@ it@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ z@@ ed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three com@@ mer@@ cial bre@@ ak@@ s and a lau@@ gh tra@@ ck ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will ru@@ n .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — partic@@ ularly mas@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ do@@ p@@ ted te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — te@@ ach ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and c@@ all@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"N@@ oti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three pie@@ ces of information there , each of which will figu@@ re into a for@@ mu@@ la some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the stu@@ dent will then compu@@ te ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in ad@@ van@@ ce ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suf@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the te@@ x@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ st@@ rin@@ ging students because , watch this , this is the pra@@ c@@ tice problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tu@@ al problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just sw@@ app@@ ing out numbers and tw@@ e@@ ak@@ ing the con@@ te@@ x@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the stu@@ dent still doesn &apos;t recogn@@ ize the st@@ am@@ p this was mo@@ l@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully explain@@ s to you what s@@ am@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mu@@ la ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pas@@ s this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to de@@ co@@ de a te@@ x@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ agno@@ se the problem a little more speci@@ fic@@ ally in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate lay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate lay@@ ers and , partic@@ ularly , how when they &apos;re com@@ press@@ ed together and presen@@ ted to the stu@@ dent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll defin@@ e them here : You have the vis@@ u@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical stru@@ cture , talking about gri@@ ds , measu@@ re@@ ments , lab@@ el@@ s , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which se@@ ction is the ste@@ ep@@ est ."
So I ho@@ pe you can see .
"I really ho@@ pe you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is tak@@ ing a com@@ p@@ el@@ ling question , a com@@ p@@ el@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , stra@@ i@@ ght pa@@ th from one to the other and con@@ gra@@ tu@@ l@@ ating our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cra@@ c@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vis@@ u@@ al , and I im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely ask the question : Wh@@ ich se@@ ction is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ vers@@ ation because the vis@@ u@@ al is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people argu@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in pair@@ s , journ@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ ate@@ ver ."
And then even@@ tually we re@@ aliz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ n@@ oy@@ ing to talk about the sk@@ i@@ er in the lower le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the sk@@ i@@ er just ab@@ ove the mi@@ d line .
"And we re@@ aliz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ el@@ s to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to defin@@ e what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we re@@ aliz@@ e it would be ni@@ ce to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ arro@@ w it down , speci@@ fic@@ ally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we thro@@ w down that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical stru@@ cture ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the con@@ vers@@ ation , the con@@ vers@@ ation doesn &apos;t serve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 clas@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then develo@@ p those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , compar@@ ed to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my pra@@ c@@ tice , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has pai@@ d his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the for@@ mul@@ ation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pra@@ c@@ tice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t in@@ vol@@ ve them in the for@@ mul@@ ation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five h@@ ours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fai@@ r@@ ly com@@ p@@ el@@ ling ele@@ ments of problems like this from my te@@ x@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tan@@ k .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ irst things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents have to develo@@ p those , they have to for@@ mu@@ late those ."
And then no@@ tice that all the information w@@ rit@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"N@@ one of it &apos;s a dis@@ tra@@ c@@ tor , so we lo@@ se that ."
"S@@ tu@@ dents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the h@@ eight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the co@@ lo@@ r of the val@@ ve matter ? What ma@@ t@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ presen@@ ted question in ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
So now we have a water tan@@ k .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line ar@@ t or cli@@ p ar@@ t that you so of@@ ten see in te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a vi@@ de@@ o , a vi@@ de@@ o of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ dents are looking at their w@@ at@@ ches , ro@@ ll@@ ing their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ ai@@ ted the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ me@@ di@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ vers@@ ation about ma@@ th because someone else has the for@@ mu@@ la ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ mu@@ la better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stu@@ dent is on a level pl@@ aying field of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tically and con@@ vers@@ ation@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ in@@ ing the con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , at@@ t@@ ach them to gu@@ es@@ ses , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve describ@@ ed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer ke@@ y in the back of the teacher &apos;s e@@ dition ."
"We , instead , just watch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ fy@@ ing , because the theor@@ e@@ tical mo@@ de@@ ls that always work out in the answer ke@@ y in the back of a teacher &apos;s e@@ dition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s s@@ car@@ y to talk about s@@ our@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the theor@@ e@@ tical does not ma@@ t@@ ch up with the pra@@ c@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ vers@@ ations have been so val@@ u@@ able , a@@ mon@@ g the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ al@@ led with these vi@@ rus@@ es day one of the clas@@ s .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ s@@ ter in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , to@@ tally new , to@@ tally for@@ ei@@ g@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ vers@@ ation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge ma@@ th teachers I talk to to use multi@@ me@@ dia , because it b@@ rings the real world into your clas@@ s@@ room in high re@@ sol@@ ution and ful@@ l co@@ lo@@ r ; to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge stu@@ dent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that level pl@@ aying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fi@@ c questions come out in con@@ vers@@ ation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in to@@ tal , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the te@@ x@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ y@@ ing you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an a@@ maz@@ ing time to be a ma@@ th teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our fron@@ t po@@ c@@ ke@@ t .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qui@@ to@@ us and fai@@ r@@ ly che@@ ap , and the to@@ ols to dis@@ tribu@@ te it fre@@ ely under op@@ en li@@ cen@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qui@@ to@@ us ."
"I put a vi@@ de@@ o ser@@ ies on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visi@@ ted saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ vers@@ ation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g re@@ cen@@ tly : In a gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ re , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 1@@ 9 ite@@ ms or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one ite@@ ms ."
"And the lin@@ e@@ ar mo@@ de@@ ling in@@ vol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my clas@@ s@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; Go@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hun@@ g@@ ry for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge you , wh@@ ate@@ ver your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a stu@@ dent , par@@ ent , teacher , poli@@ cy ma@@ ker , wh@@ ate@@ ver — in@@ sis@@ t on better ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ po@@ ra@@ tion of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of plas@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ dio S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ na at@@ tach@@ ed to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ or@@ t of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing com@@ pati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ic@@ k hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tele@@ sco@@ pe to Sa@@ turn ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
There was a lot of people there .
"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ i@@ rg@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
Thank you .
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I sto@@ od on the TED st@@ age in A@@ rus@@ h@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I spo@@ ke very bri@@ ef@@ ly about one of my pro@@ u@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in Mal@@ a@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Inter@@ net .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"M@@ y English lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , wh@@ ite people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"All sis@@ ters , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little b@@ oy .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of poor far@@ mer@@ s ."
"@@ L@@ ike everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ ize ."
One year our for@@ t@@ un@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experien@@ ced an a@@ w@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ ith@@ in five months all Mal@@ a@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to death .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The fo@@ od pas@@ ses through our bo@@ dies .
We drop down to nothing .
"In Mal@@ a@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hun@@ ger , I was for@@ ced to drop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I cou@@ ldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I f@@ elt very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to rec@@ ei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ b@@ r@@ ary .
"I read bo@@ o@@ ks , science bo@@ o@@ ks , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally physics ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ m@@ ill could pu@@ m@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experiencing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ m@@ ill for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a s@@ cra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tra@@ c@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ pes ."
"U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le fra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le dy@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with sw@@ it@@ ches , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ ak@@ er , mo@@ de@@ led after an electri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ eu@@ es of people start lin@@ ing up at my h@@ ou@@ se ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bil@@ e ph@@ one .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an air@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ p@@ t in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in A@@ rus@@ h@@ a , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fri@@ c@@ ans , and the poor who are stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
G@@ od b@@ less .
M@@ aybe one day you will watch this on the Inter@@ net .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ j@@ oy@@ ing m@@ un@@ d@@ an@@ e s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble d@@ ry@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally under@@ sto@@ od that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fi@@ ci@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ ion ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ tly , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th li@@ ving for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th dy@@ ing for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ sti@@ tu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to argu@@ e that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s of@@ ten said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ dation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues seem to b@@ el@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s of@@ ten thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have eth@@ ical ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can suf@@ fer . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our f@@ el@@ low pri@@ ma@@ tes than we are about in@@ se@@ cts , as inde@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a grea@@ ter ran@@ ge of po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al happiness and suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to no@@ tice here is that this is a fac@@ tu@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ stru@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bi@@ ologi@@ cal comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ se@@ cts ."
"And there &apos;s no no@@ tion , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely re@@ late to con@@ ditions after death — ei@@ ther to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of suf@@ fer@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ sis@@ t after death is itself a fac@@ tu@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the con@@ ditions of well-being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fai@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where stran@@ g@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ a@@ tely ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more i@@ dy@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
Pro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely bl@@ ame their n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ s ? Pro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human comm@@ uni@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality re@@ la@@ tes to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our s@@ it@@ u@@ ation in the world can be under@@ sto@@ od at many le@@ vel@@ s — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic syste@@ ms and political ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is re@@ alized in the brain — wh@@ ate@@ ver happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bom@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vi@@ r@@ gin@@ s in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his pers@@ on@@ ality — his rather un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate pers@@ on@@ ality — is the pro@@ du@@ ct of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tribu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as inde@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wh@@ ate@@ ver cul@@ tural vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h can , at le@@ ast in princi@@ ple , be under@@ sto@@ od in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t of a ma@@ tur@@ ing science of the mind — neuro@@ science , psycho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m argu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differences in the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both pers@@ onal and colle@@ ctive ."
"And one thing to no@@ tice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we r@@ are@@ ly ac@@ c@@ ess , that few people ac@@ c@@ ess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ hap@@ s some of these states can be appro@@ pri@@ a@@ tely called my@@ sti@@ cal or spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al .
P@@ er@@ hap@@ s there are other states that we can &apos;t ac@@ c@@ ess because of how our min@@ ds are stru@@ ctu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could ac@@ c@@ ess them .
"Now , let me be cle@@ ar about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fi@@ c ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ st@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nu@@ cle@@ ar fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ du@@ ct the ful@@ l cost of TED as a b@@ usiness ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions af@@ fect human well-being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ mit@@ ting this — just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how human@@ s fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations of human coo@@ per@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ st@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 states in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment in the clas@@ s@@ room is leg@@ al , where it is leg@@ al for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and b@@ lis@@ ters and even bre@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hundre@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ den@@ tally , are sub@@ je@@ cted to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed dis@@ tri@@ cts , I think , will fai@@ l to surpris@@ e you ."
We &apos;re not talking about C@@ on@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tion@@ al@@ e for this behavi@@ or is ex@@ plic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ ato@@ r of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to s@@ par@@ e the ro@@ d , le@@ st we s@@ po@@ i@@ l the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , to sub@@ ject children to pain and violence and publi@@ c hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation as a way of en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing heal@@ thy e@@ moti@@ onal develo@@ p@@ ment and good behavi@@ or ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it ma@@ t@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the no@@ tion of well-being is truly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ min@@ g@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually op@@ en to be re@@ -@@ con@@ stru@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ je@@ ctive no@@ tion of well-being ?"
"Well , con@@ sider by anal@@ og@@ y , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ich@@ a@@ el S@@ pe@@ c@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this sta@@ tu@@ e was car@@ ved the average life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to ru@@ n a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be con@@ si@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ab@@ ility .
P@@ eople will sen@@ d you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that con@@ dition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ oti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is op@@ en , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely op@@ en for re@@ vision , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dis@@ tin@@ ction between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as cle@@ ar and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to no@@ tice is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organ@@ ize a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ miz@@ e human fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ hing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ min@@ e an ob@@ je@@ ctive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about fo@@ od : I would never be tem@@ p@@ ted to argu@@ e to you that there must be one right fo@@ od to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ sti@@ tu@@ te heal@@ thy fo@@ od .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a cle@@ ar dis@@ tin@@ ction between fo@@ od and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is fo@@ od ? &quot; &quot; does not tem@@ p@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univers@@ al mor@@ ality would re@@ qui@@ re moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ st@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ sider , by anal@@ og@@ y , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to pl@@ ay good ch@@ ess , a princi@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lo@@ se your Q@@ u@@ een , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mo@@ ments when lo@@ sing your Q@@ u@@ een is a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mo@@ ments when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a doma@@ in of per@@ fect ob@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this b@@ rings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sp@@ here ."
C@@ on@@ sider the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , of our intel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al comm@@ unity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the pro@@ u@@ d den@@ iz@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or thro@@ w b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ tend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be n@@ on@@ -@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pra@@ c@@ tice like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y w@@ ear@@ ing of a v@@ ei@@ l — women should be able to we@@ ar wh@@ ate@@ ver they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y mean in a comm@@ unity where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather of@@ ten , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ Just let that fact de@@ ton@@ ate in your brain for a minu@@ te : Y@@ our daughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ presen@@ ts a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ hing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ fect sol@@ ution in our own society ."
"For in@@ st@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a new@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ed world ."
"Now , gran@@ ted , for many men it may re@@ qui@@ re a de@@ gre@@ e in ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y to see something wrong with these ima@@ ges ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ f@@ le@@ ctive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ fect ex@@ pres@@ sion of psy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal bal@@ ance with re@@ spe@@ ct to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ ou@@ th and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ mes that re@@ presen@@ ts a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ hap@@ s there are many such plac@@ es — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
But the thing to no@@ tice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the i@@ ron@@ y , from my per@@ spe@@ ctive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are religi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a vo@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ d , not because they made an intel@@ lig@@ ent anal@@ y@@ sis of the c@@ au@@ ses and con@@ dition of human and an@@ ima@@ l well-being ."
"In fact , the en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce of religi@@ on as a len@@ s through which most people view moral questions has s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and an@@ ima@@ l suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like g@@ ay marri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nu@@ cle@@ ar pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univers@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to no@@ tice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally se@@ cu@@ lar , acade@@ mic , scienti@@ st ty@@ pes ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we val@@ ue differences of op@@ in@@ ion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for in@@ st@@ ance the D@@ al@@ ai La@@ ma gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on compassion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l com@@ pon@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very fon@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and k@@ ill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ ion about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost We@@ ster@@ n intel@@ le@@ ctu@@ als look at this s@@ it@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ ai La@@ ma to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real argu@@ ment that po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ col@@ ate , he lik@@ es van@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ oti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a string the@@ or@@ is@@ t .
"If you ask the s@@ mar@@ test physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts around who is the s@@ mar@@ test physi@@ c@@ is@@ t around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I cho@@ se to view the universe at a small scal@@ e .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ c@@ is@@ t ; I don &apos;t understand string theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to b@@ el@@ ong to any string theory clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a doma@@ in of ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ ion has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ vin@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well-being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ hing , and mor@@ ality re@@ la@@ tes to that doma@@ in of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beli@@ ef@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to ne@@ ed@@ less human suf@@ fer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ mit@@ ting this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ stru@@ ctive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inven@@ ted ; it will always be eas@@ i@@ er to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pa@@ ten@@ tly ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more re@@ spe@@ ct and tol@@ er@@ ate vas@@ t differences in no@@ tions of human well-being than we can re@@ spe@@ ct or tol@@ er@@ ate vas@@ t differences in the no@@ tions about how disease s@@ pre@@ ad@@ s , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of buil@@ din@@ gs and air@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ b@@ us@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ ether in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the v@@ ei@@ l , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ ss@@ ed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , spo@@ k@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion of fe@@ mal@@ e speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is argu@@ ably a so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated psy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal view — &quot; that mal@@ e l@@ ust is not to be tr@@ us@@ ted . &quot;"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Y@@ e@@ ah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sen@@ t@@ ence , w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing the clo@@ ck tic@@ king , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y in a con@@ te@@ x@@ t where men have certain expe@@ c@@ t@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ ei@@ l yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a v@@ ei@@ l , or a very fun@@ ny h@@ at , or ta@@ t@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily do wh@@ ate@@ ver we want , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est about the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a ful@@ l bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that ?
"I think I under@@ sto@@ od you to say that you could re@@ con@@ c@@ ile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ ll@@ ing the clo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ cing moral progress with rich@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pa@@ th to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ tai@@ l , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the positive and neg@@ ative qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es of ourselves in much grea@@ ter de@@ tai@@ l ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social e@@ mo@@ tion like em@@ path@@ y and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic syste@@ ms , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like v@@ ei@@ ling my daughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and well-@@ educ@@ ated in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t of men who do de@@ si@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F g@@ r@@ ant to know that com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y v@@ ei@@ ling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone in@@ vol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these syste@@ ms ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ par@@ ed to shi@@ ft your in@@ s@@ tin@@ ctive cur@@ r@@ ent j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these is@@ su@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ d@@ ul@@ o one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t of a truly de@@ lu@@ si@@ onal beli@@ ef system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a b@@ oy@@ fri@@ end , I cho@@ pped his head off . And that was the most compas@@ sion@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; I@@ f you get all those parts al@@ ig@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the e@@ mo@@ tion of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a lar@@ ger con@@ te@@ x@@ t ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing e@@ c@@ stas@@ y and then blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ vers@@ ation I would actually love to contin@@ ue for h@@ ours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : Re@@ ally an h@@ onor . Thank you .
( Applause )
"So , imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et any@@ where in America and a Jap@@ an@@ ese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this blo@@ ck ? &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , well , this is O@@ ak S@@ tre@@ et , that &apos;s E@@ l@@ m S@@ tre@@ et ."
"This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of that blo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , b@@ loc@@ ks don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."

"So , now imagine you &apos;re st@@ anding on a stre@@ et , any@@ where in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot;"
"They say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , well that &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 and this is B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but what is the name of this stre@@ et ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , stre@@ ets don &apos;t have nam@@ es ."
B@@ loc@@ ks have nam@@ es .
"@@ Just look at Google M@@ ap@@ s here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 14 , 15 , 1@@ 6 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."
"All of these b@@ loc@@ ks have nam@@ es , and the stre@@ ets are just the un@@ na@@ med sp@@ ac@@ es in between the b@@ loc@@ ks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ is@@ tri@@ ct Ei@@ ght ."
"There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , h@@ ou@@ se number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but walking around the n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I no@@ tic@@ ed that the h@@ ou@@ se numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first h@@ ou@@ se ever built on a blo@@ ck is h@@ ou@@ se number one .
The second h@@ ou@@ se ever built is h@@ ou@@ se number two .
"Th@@ ir@@ d is h@@ ou@@ se number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; So , I love that some@@ times we need to go to the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the world to re@@ aliz@@ e as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and re@@ aliz@@ e that the op@@ pos@@ ite of them may also be true ."
"So , for example , there are doc@@ tors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you p@@ ay them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to p@@ ay them because they fai@@ led at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not si@@ ck ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ si@@ cal ph@@ r@@ ase : one , two , three , four ."
"But in W@@ est A@@ fri@@ can music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the ph@@ r@@ ase , like the peri@@ od at the end of a sen@@ t@@ ence ."
"So , you can hear it not just in the ph@@ ras@@ ing , but the way they coun@@ t off their music : two , three , four , one ."
And this ma@@ p is also accu@@ rate .
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that wh@@ ate@@ ver true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."
