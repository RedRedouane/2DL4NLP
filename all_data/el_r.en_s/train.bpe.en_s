"We live in difficult and chall@@ eng@@ ing economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first vic@@ tim@@ s of difficult economic times , I think , is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding of any kind , but cer@@ tain@@ ly in the fi@@ ring line at the moment is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding for science , and partic@@ ularly cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ led science and explor@@ ation ."
So I want to try and con@@ vin@@ ce you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous and lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us thing to do .
"But I think to set the scen@@ e , I want to show — the next sli@@ de is not my at@@ tem@@ p@@ t to show the wor@@ st TED sli@@ de in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a me@@ ss ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my f@@ au@@ l@@ t ; it &apos;s from the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of how much science co@@ sts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for contin@@ u@@ ing to sp@@ end on cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ d@@ riv@@ en science and explor@@ ation , I should tell you how much it co@@ sts ."
So this is a game called &quot; &quot; spo@@ t the science bu@@ d@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science bu@@ d@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of blo@@ b@@ s and then y@@ el@@ low set of blo@@ b@@ s ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ el@@ low set of blo@@ b@@ s around the big y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion po@@ un@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from me@@ di@@ cal research , space explor@@ ation , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and human@@ iti@@ es , fun@@ ded from the science bu@@ d@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b around the or@@ an@@ ge blo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re argu@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cen@@ t@@ age , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and Ger@@ many and F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"@@ R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; D in to@@ tal in the econom@@ y , publi@@ c@@ ly fun@@ ded , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re argu@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is stra@@ i@@ ght from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; is that our explor@@ ation of the solar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ describ@@ ably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ ass@@ ini space pro@@ be around Sa@@ turn , after we &apos;d fin@@ is@@ hed fil@@ ming &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So that big swe@@ ep@@ ing , wh@@ ite sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is Sa@@ turn , which is actually in the bac@@ k@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that cre@@ s@@ cent there is the moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , which is about as big as the Bri@@ tis@@ h Is@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters in dia@@ me@@ ter .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ proc@@ ess@@ ed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and wh@@ ite , stra@@ i@@ ght from Sa@@ tur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fain@@ t , sort of , w@@ is@@ ps of almost s@@ mo@@ ke ris@@ ing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vis@@ u@@ aliz@@ e that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful grap@@ hi@@ c .
What we found out were that those fain@@ t w@@ is@@ ps are actually f@@ oun@@ tain@@ s of ice ris@@ ing up from the sur@@ face of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the me@@ chan@@ is@@ m for power@@ ing those f@@ oun@@ tain@@ s re@@ qui@@ res there to be l@@ akes of li@@ qui@@ d water ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qui@@ d water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evidence of li@@ qui@@ d , po@@ ols of li@@ qui@@ d , ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face of a moon 7@@ 50 million miles away from the Earth is really quite as@@ to@@ un@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essenti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a ha@@ b@@ it@@ at for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a grap@@ hi@@ c . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
This is when C@@ ass@@ ini f@@ le@@ w ben@@ e@@ ath En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
"So it made a very low pas@@ s , just a few hundred ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters ab@@ ove the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ tain@@ s ris@@ ing up into space , ab@@ solu@@ tely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ did@@ ate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of J@@ upi@@ ter , Euro@@ pa ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the Jo@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of ro@@ ck ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the moon Euro@@ pa , which is a th@@ ic@@ k sh@@ e@@ et of ice , probably a hundred ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters th@@ ic@@ k ."
"But by me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing the way that Euro@@ pa inter@@ ac@@ ts with the magnetic field of J@@ upi@@ ter , and looking at how those cra@@ c@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that grap@@ hi@@ c move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an o@@ c@@ ean of li@@ qui@@ d sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Euro@@ pa ."
"So be@@ low the ice , there &apos;s an o@@ c@@ ean of li@@ qui@@ d around the whole moon ."
"It could be hundre@@ ds of ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s s@@ al@@ tw@@ a@@ ter , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of J@@ upi@@ ter than there is in all the o@@ c@@ e@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little moon around J@@ upi@@ ter , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ did@@ ate for fin@@ ding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disco@@ very .
O@@ ur explor@@ ation of the solar system has t@@ au@@ ght us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ wer@@ ing one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can possi@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to explor@@ ation and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very fam@@ ous picture taken , actually , on my first Chris@@ t@@ mas E@@ ve , D@@ e@@ c@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by A@@ poll@@ o 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Ear@@ thris@@ e from A@@ poll@@ o 8 .
"A fam@@ ous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that s@@ av@@ ed 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent year — the stu@@ dent ri@@ ots in Par@@ is , the h@@ eight of the V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ or@@ e has said it many times , actually , on the st@@ age at TED , is that this picture , argu@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental movement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mo@@ v@@ able , kind of inde@@ stru@@ c@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , fra@@ gi@@ le@@ -@@ looking world just h@@ ang@@ ing against the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not of@@ ten said about the space explor@@ ation , about the A@@ poll@@ o pro@@ gra@@ m , is the economic con@@ tribu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make argu@@ ments that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achi@@ ev@@ ement and de@@ li@@ vered pic@@ tures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic ef@@ fe@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , the economic im@@ p@@ act of A@@ poll@@ o ."
The big@@ gest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by Ch@@ ase E@@ con@@ ome@@ tri@@ cs .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 spent on A@@ poll@@ o , 14 came back into the U.S. econom@@ y ."
"So the A@@ poll@@ o pro@@ gra@@ m pai@@ d for itself in in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion , in engine@@ ering , achi@@ ev@@ ement and , I think , in in@@ spi@@ ring young scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers 14 times over ."
So explor@@ ation can p@@ ay for itself .
What about scienti@@ fi@@ c disco@@ very ?
What about d@@ riv@@ ing in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vi@@ r@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scienti@@ sts , many ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light given off from atoms ."
And they saw strange pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re see@@ ing when you put it through a pris@@ m is that you he@@ at hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a wh@@ ite light , it just em@@ its light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light b@@ lu@@ e one , some dark b@@ lu@@ e ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of ato@@ mic stru@@ cture because the way that &apos;s explain@@ ed is atoms are a single nu@@ cle@@ us with elec@@ trons going around them .
And the elec@@ trons can only be in particular plac@@ es .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they em@@ it light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that atoms , when you he@@ at them up , only em@@ it light at very speci@@ fi@@ c col@@ ors , was one of the ke@@ y d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s that led to the develo@@ p@@ ment of the quantum theory , the theory of the stru@@ cture of atoms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when elec@@ trons j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black lin@@ es in that spec@@ tru@@ m .
And the ele@@ ment he@@ li@@ um was disco@@ vered just by star@@ ing at the light from the Sun because some of those black lin@@ es were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known ele@@ ment .
And that &apos;s why he@@ li@@ um &apos;s called he@@ li@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; he@@ li@@ os &quot; &quot; — he@@ li@@ os from the Sun .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds esoter@@ ic , and inde@@ ed it was an esoter@@ ic pur@@ su@@ it , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behavi@@ ors of elec@@ trons in materi@@ als like si@@ li@@ c@@ on , for example ."
"The way that si@@ li@@ c@@ on beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build trans@@ istor@@ s , is a pu@@ re@@ ly quantum ph@@ en@@ omenon ."
"So without that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y@@ -@@ d@@ riv@@ en understanding of the stru@@ cture of atoms , which led to this rather esoter@@ ic theory , quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s , then we wouldn &apos;t have trans@@ istor@@ s , we wouldn &apos;t have si@@ li@@ c@@ on chi@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the bas@@ is of our modern econom@@ y ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful tw@@ is@@ t to that tal@@ e ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; we k@@ ep@@ t em@@ ph@@ as@@ iz@@ ing the la@@ ws of physics are univers@@ al ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can trans@@ port it , not only to the planets , but to the most dis@@ tant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing predic@@ tions of quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s , just by looking at the stru@@ cture of atoms — the same theory that describ@@ es trans@@ istor@@ s — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are big@@ ger than , quite speci@@ fic@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a lim@@ it im@@ posed on the mas@@ s of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of pap@@ er in a lab@@ ora@@ tory , get a tele@@ sco@@ pe , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars big@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible predic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the ed@@ ge of that mas@@ s ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galax@@ y , a common &quot; &quot; our g@@ ar@@ den &quot; &quot; galax@@ y with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of bil@@ lions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic cor@@ e , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ in@@ ing out so bri@@ ghtly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galax@@ y .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galax@@ y , and it &apos;s sh@@ in@@ ing as bri@@ ghtly as the center of the galax@@ y with a billion sun@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a T@@ y@@ pe I@@ a super@@ no@@ va ex@@ plo@@ sion .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible ph@@ en@@ omena , because it &apos;s a star that s@@ its there ."
It &apos;s called a carb@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It s@@ its there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the mas@@ s of the Sun ."
"And it has a b@@ in@@ ary compan@@ ion that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of g@@ as ."
"And what it does is it su@@ c@@ ks g@@ as off its compan@@ ion star , until it gets to this lim@@ it called the Ch@@ and@@ ras@@ ek@@ ha@@ r lim@@ it , and then it ex@@ plo@@ des ."
"And it ex@@ plo@@ des , and it sh@@ ines as bri@@ ghtly as a billion sun@@ s for about two weeks , and rele@@ as@@ es , not only energy , but a hu@@ ge amount of che@@ mi@@ cal ele@@ ments into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a carb@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no carb@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no carb@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe throu@@ gh@@ out the first generation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in ex@@ plo@@ sions like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into planets , stars , new solar syste@@ ms and , inde@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the power and beau@@ ty and univers@@ ality of the la@@ ws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the stru@@ cture of atoms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ xan@@ der F@@ le@@ ming : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I wo@@ ke up just after da@@ wn on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t pl@@ an to re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ ize all medicine by disco@@ ver@@ ing the world &apos;s first anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ c . &quot; &quot; Now , the explor@@ ers of the world of the ato@@ m did not in@@ tend to inv@@ ent the trans@@ is@@ tor ."
"And they cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t in@@ tend to descri@@ be the me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s of super@@ no@@ va ex@@ plo@@ sions , which even@@ tually told us where the building b@@ loc@@ ks of life were syn@@ the@@ si@@ z@@ ed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing things .
"It can also , I think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the val@@ ue of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like Sa@@ turn because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ ass@@ ini space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a fam@@ ous picture , not because of the beau@@ ty and ma@@ je@@ st@@ y of Sa@@ turn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , fain@@ t blo@@ b just h@@ ang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the rings ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tured in that fra@@ me of Sa@@ turn .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million miles away .
"I think the Earth has got a strange pro@@ per@@ ty that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dis@@ tant or most fam@@ ous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ oy@@ ag@@ er sp@@ ac@@ e@@ cra@@ ft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in fron@@ t of it for scal@@ e .
The V@@ oy@@ ag@@ er is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s cur@@ ren@@ tly 10 billion miles away from Earth , trans@@ mit@@ ting with that dis@@ h , with the power of 20 w@@ at@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in con@@ t@@ act with it ."
"But it visi@@ ted J@@ upi@@ ter , Sa@@ turn , U@@ ran@@ us and N@@ ep@@ t@@ un@@ e ."
"And after it visi@@ ted all four of those planets , C@@ arl S@@ ag@@ an , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of tur@@ ning V@@ oy@@ ag@@ er around and tak@@ ing a picture of every planet it had visi@@ ted ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ al@@ e B@@ lu@@ e D@@ ot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in that red s@@ ha@@ ft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ ag@@ an wrote about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; C@@ on@@ sider again that do@@ t ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was li@@ ved out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates of j@@ oy and suf@@ fer@@ ing thousands of con@@ fi@@ dent religi@@ ons , ide@@ ologi@@ es and economic doc@@ tr@@ ines , every hun@@ ter and for@@ ag@@ er , every her@@ o and co@@ ward , every cre@@ ato@@ r and de@@ st@@ roy@@ er of civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , ho@@ pe@@ ful child , inven@@ tor and explor@@ er , every teacher of mor@@ als , every cor@@ r@@ up@@ t poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me le@@ ade@@ r , every s@@ ain@@ t and sin@@ ner in the history of our speci@@ es , li@@ ved there , on a m@@ ote of d@@ ust , su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in a sun@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that astrono@@ my &apos;s a hu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ -@@ building experience .
There is perhaps no better de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ c@@ e@@ its than this dis@@ tant ima@@ ge of our tiny world .
"To me , it under@@ s@@ cor@@ es our responsi@@ bility to de@@ al more kin@@ dly with one another and to pre@@ serve and cher@@ ish the pal@@ e b@@ lu@@ e do@@ t , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ au@@ tiful words about the power of science and explor@@ ation ."
"The argu@@ ment has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the trans@@ is@@ tor .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disco@@ ver anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s rap@@ id@@ ly be@@ coming a her@@ o of min@@ e , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under ass@@ au@@ l@@ t all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ Just ex@@ plo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the progress of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

"Th@@ ree fi@@ res together , that &apos;s a lot of fla@@ mes ."
"S@@ et the fire under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es , it &apos;s bur@@ ning ."
"For us , the su@@ n is the s@@ our@@ ce of pros@@ per@@ ity ."

"Th@@ ree together , that &apos;s s@@ par@@ k@@ les ."
"P@@ ut the su@@ n and the moon sh@@ in@@ ing together , it &apos;s bri@@ ght@@ ness ."

So we have gone through almost 30 char@@ ac@@ ters .
"B@@ y using this me@@ tho@@ d , the first eight radi@@ cal@@ s will al@@ low you to build 3@@ 2 ."
The next group of eight char@@ ac@@ ters will build an extra 3@@ 2 .
"So with very little ef@@ for@@ t , you will be able to learn a couple hundred char@@ ac@@ ters , which is the same as a Ch@@ in@@ ese ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old ."
"So after we know the char@@ ac@@ ters , we start building ph@@ ras@@ es ."
"For example , the m@@ oun@@ tain and the fire together , we have fire m@@ oun@@ tain . It &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o ."
We know Japan is the land of the ris@@ ing su@@ n .
"This is a su@@ n plac@@ ed with the or@@ ig@@ in , because Japan lies to the eas@@ t of China ."
"So a su@@ n , or@@ ig@@ in together , we build Japan ."
"A person behind Japan , what do we get ?"
A Jap@@ an@@ ese person .
The char@@ ac@@ ter on the left is two m@@ oun@@ tain@@ s st@@ ac@@ ked on top of each other .

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"@@ Here is a lu@@ m@@ p of f@@ les@@ h , about three po@@ un@@ ds , which you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand ."
But it can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the vas@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ ste@@ l@@ lar space .
"It can con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the me@@ an@@ ing of its own exis@@ t@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is truly the most a@@ maz@@ ing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the grea@@ test my@@ ster@@ y con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the ad@@ ul@@ t human brain .
"And each neu@@ ron makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 con@@ t@@ ac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have cal@@ cu@@ lated that the number of per@@ mu@@ t@@ ations and com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of brain acti@@ vity ex@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ds the number of ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stu@@ dy@@ ing the brain ?"
"One approach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavi@@ or ."
This is what I spo@@ ke about in the last TED .
"T@@ o@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually re@@ cor@@ d the acti@@ vity of individu@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ or@@ t of e@@ av@@ es@@ drop on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one re@@ cent disco@@ very that has been made by rese@@ arch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in Par@@ ma , by Gi@@ ac@@ omo R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ at@@ ti and his colle@@ ag@@ ues , is a group of neurons called mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the fron@@ t of the brain in the fron@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary mo@@ tor comm@@ and neurons in the fron@@ t of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person perfor@@ ms a speci@@ fi@@ c action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an ap@@ ple , a mo@@ tor comm@@ and neu@@ ron in the fron@@ t of my brain will fire ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an ob@@ ject , another neu@@ ron will fire , com@@ man@@ ding me to pul@@ l that ob@@ ject ."
These are called mo@@ tor comm@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ at@@ ti found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else perfor@@ ming the same action ."
"So , here is a neu@@ ron that fi@@ res when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fi@@ res when I watch Jo@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is truly as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neu@@ ron is a@@ do@@ p@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s perfor@@ ming a vi@@ r@@ tu@@ al reality sim@@ ul@@ ation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of these mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be in@@ vol@@ ved in things like im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ul@@ ation .
Because to im@@ it@@ ate a comple@@ x act re@@ qui@@ res my brain to a@@ do@@ p@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de ."
"So , how do you do im@@ it@@ ation ? Why is im@@ it@@ ation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and im@@ it@@ ation , em@@ ul@@ ation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ en@@ omenon of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 100@@ ,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ d@@ den emer@@ gence and rap@@ id s@@ pre@@ ad of a number of sk@@ il@@ ls that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fire , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ab@@ ility to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavi@@ or ."
A@@ ll of that happened rel@@ ati@@ vely quickly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had achi@@ ev@@ ed its present si@@ ze almost three or four hundred thous@@ and years ago , 100@@ ,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I cl@@ ai@@ m that what happened was the su@@ d@@ den emer@@ gence of a so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neu@@ ron system , which allowed you to e@@ mu@@ late and im@@ it@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ d@@ den ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal disco@@ very by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular ty@@ pe of to@@ ol , instead of dy@@ ing out , this s@@ pre@@ ad rap@@ id@@ ly , h@@ oriz@@ on@@ tally across the population , or was trans@@ mit@@ ted ver@@ tically , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ d@@ den@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of Dar@@ win@@ i@@ an ."
Dar@@ win@@ i@@ an evolution is s@@ low ; it takes hundre@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A po@@ lar be@@ ar , to evol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 100@@ ,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just watch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another po@@ lar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the po@@ lar be@@ ar took 100@@ ,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it s@@ pre@@ ad@@ s in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The im@@ it@@ ation of comple@@ x sk@@ il@@ ls is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation .
"Now there is another kind of mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neu@@ ron , which is in@@ vol@@ ved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neurons for action , there are mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neurons for to@@ u@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody to@@ uch@@ es me , my hand , neu@@ ron in the so@@ mato@@ sen@@ sor@@ y cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ sor@@ y re@@ gi@@ on of the brain fi@@ res ."
"But the same neu@@ ron , in some c@@ as@@ es , will fire when I simply watch another person being to@@ uch@@ ed ."
"So , it &apos;s em@@ path@@ iz@@ ing the other person being to@@ uch@@ ed ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m to@@ uch@@ ed in different loc@@ ations . Di@@ f@@ fer@@ ent neurons for different loc@@ ations ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being to@@ uch@@ ed in the same loc@@ ation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in em@@ path@@ y ."
"Now , the question then aris@@ es : I@@ f I simply watch another person being to@@ uch@@ ed , why do I not get con@@ fus@@ ed and liter@@ ally feel that to@@ u@@ ch sen@@ s@@ ation mer@@ ely by w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing somebody being to@@ uch@@ ed ?"
"I mean , I em@@ path@@ ize with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the to@@ u@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , to@@ u@@ ch and pain re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being to@@ uch@@ ed ."
"So , em@@ path@@ ize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the to@@ u@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise you &apos;ll get con@@ fus@@ ed and mu@@ dd@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sign@@ al that ve@@ to@@ es the sign@@ al of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neu@@ ron pre@@ ven@@ ting you from con@@ sci@@ ously experiencing that to@@ u@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ tiz@@ e my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ je@@ ction into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ tiz@@ e the bra@@ chi@@ al ple@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ s@@ ations coming in , if I now watch you being to@@ uch@@ ed , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ h@@ i neurons , or em@@ path@@ y neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ stra@@ ct me@@ tap@@ h@@ or@@ ical sense .
"All that &apos;s s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"@@ Re@@ move the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s to@@ u@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ aster@@ n ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y , and that is there is no real inde@@ pen@@ dent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , conne@@ cted not just via Facebook and Inter@@ net , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally conne@@ cted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole ch@@ ain@@ s of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dis@@ tin@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else &apos;s con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
And this is not mu@@ m@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
It emer@@ ges from our understanding of bas@@ ic neuro@@ science .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . I@@ f the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you watch somebody else being to@@ uch@@ ed , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing thing is , if you have pain in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ s@@ age the other person &apos;s hand , that reli@@ ev@@ es the pain in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neu@@ ron were ob@@ tain@@ ing reli@@ ef from mer@@ ely w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing somebody else being mas@@ s@@ ag@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sli@@ de ."
F@@ or the lon@@ gest time people have reg@@ ar@@ ded science and human@@ iti@@ es as being dis@@ tin@@ ct .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now spo@@ ke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , human@@ iti@@ es on the other ; never the tw@@ ain sh@@ all me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r neu@@ ron system under@@ lies the inter@@ face allo@@ wing you to re@@ think about is@@ su@@ es like con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ presen@@ t@@ ation of self , what s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ates you from other human be@@ ings , what allo@@ ws you to em@@ path@@ ize with other human be@@ ings , and also even things like the emer@@ gence of culture and civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great h@@ onor today to share with you The D@@ ig@@ ital Uni@@ verse , which was created for human@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the vi@@ de@@ o that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ u@@ sic ) The fl@@ at h@@ oriz@@ on that we &apos;ve evol@@ ved with has been a me@@ tap@@ h@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded resour@@ ces and un@@ li@@ mi@@ ted cap@@ ac@@ ity for dis@@ pos@@ al of was@@ te .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ ove the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here and had seen the h@@ oriz@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a li@@ mi@@ ted con@@ dition ."
The D@@ ig@@ ital Uni@@ verse A@@ t@@ l@@ as has been built at the American M@@ us@@ eu@@ m of N@@ a@@ tural H@@ istory over the past 12 years .
"We main@@ tain that , put that together as a project to really char@@ t the universe across all scal@@ es ."
"What we see here are sa@@ tell@@ ites around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per reg@@ is@@ tra@@ tion against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A sup@@ por@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the H@@ ay@@ den P@@ lan@@ e@@ tar@@ i@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ ig@@ ital Uni@@ verse is the bas@@ is of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our ma@@ in space sho@@ ws in the do@@ me .
"But what you see here is the resul@@ t of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we h@@ os@@ ted with L@@ in@@ ko@@ ping Uni@@ vers@@ ity in Swe@@ den ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their gra@@ du@@ ate work , and the resul@@ t has been this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are called Uni@@ view and a compan@@ y called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in Swe@@ den ."
"This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tu@@ al f@@ light pa@@ th and mo@@ vi@@ e that we see here was actually flo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tured this live from my l@@ ap@@ top in a c@@ af@@ e called Earth M@@ at@@ ters on the Lo@@ wer E@@ ast S@@ i@@ de of Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ lab@@ or@@ ative project with the R@@ u@@ b@@ in M@@ us@@ eu@@ m of H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an A@@ r@@ t for an ex@@ hi@@ bit on compar@@ ative cos@@ mo@@ logy ."
"And so as we move out , we see contin@@ u@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , li@@ ght@@ -@@ tra@@ vel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dis@@ tant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essenti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally see@@ ing a con@@ tain@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P mi@@ cro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ tain@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ tain@@ ment of the visi@@ ble universe .
We know the universe is big@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back quickly , we see here the ra@@ dio sp@@ here that we j@@ um@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are posi@@ tions , the la@@ test posi@@ tions of exo@@ planets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pped , and our su@@ n here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty quickly between se@@ ver@@ al or@@ ders of ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the path@@ s of V@@ oy@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ oy@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ ion@@ e@@ er 1@@ 1 and P@@ ion@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ac@@ e@@ cra@@ ft to have left the solar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in clo@@ se@@ r , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This ma@@ p can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ aro@@ ly@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the ca@@ mera P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ ass@@ ini mis@@ sion .

This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are allo@@ ws us to come clo@@ se and look at parts of this .
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can also be ne@@ t@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we ne@@ t@@ work dom@@ es ."
And we can ne@@ t@@ work between dom@@ es and clas@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
We &apos;re actually sh@@ ar@@ ing to@@ ur@@ s of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an plan@@ e@@ tar@@ i@@ um in G@@ h@@ ana as well as new li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ tos in C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ ia and a high school in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia .

"This is an ima@@ ge from Sa@@ tur@@ day , ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ hed by the A@@ qu@@ a sa@@ tell@@ ite , but through the Uni@@ view so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."

But we can see the ha@@ ze from fi@@ res and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ ley down be@@ low in India .

"And just in clo@@ sing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to bra@@ ve in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much lar@@ ger con@@ dition now and a much lar@@ ger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essenti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .

"And we ask the question as a fun@@ ction of the three different lives , how much life s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of me@@ an@@ ing is the st@@ ron@@ gest .
There &apos;s a group of people in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
P@@ eople c@@ ross o@@ c@@ e@@ ans to go see them .
These people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they k@@ ill lions .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s co@@ ol ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ is , the b@@ oys are bro@@ ught up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are bro@@ ught up to be mothers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was eng@@ ag@@ ed to be marri@@ ed as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed pub@@ er@@ ty ."
"M@@ y mother , my grand@@ mother , my au@@ n@@ ties , they con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your h@@ usb@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ o@@ ol , ye@@ ah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ par@@ e me to be a per@@ fect woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the mor@@ ning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , swe@@ ep@@ ing the h@@ ou@@ se , coo@@ king for my si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs , colle@@ c@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a per@@ fect wife .
I went to school not because the M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs that she never wanted us to live the life she was li@@ ving ."
Why did she say that ?
M@@ y father worked as a poli@@ c@@ e@@ man in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for some@@ times even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
M@@ y mother worked hard in the far@@ m to grow cro@@ ps so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ar@@ ed the co@@ ws and the go@@ a@@ ts so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would s@@ ell the co@@ ws , he would s@@ ell the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and d@@ ran@@ k with his friends in the bar@@ s ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any pro@@ per@@ ty , and by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t , everything in my family any@@ way b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ tion@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers looked ni@@ ce .
"They we@@ ar ni@@ ce dre@@ ss@@ es , high@@ -@@ he@@ ele@@ d sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ for@@ table , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just w@@ ri@@ ting on the bo@@ ard — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , compar@@ ed to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our tra@@ dition , there is a c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y that girls have to un@@ d@@ ergo to become women , and it &apos;s a r@@ ite of pas@@ s@@ age to w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"And then I was just fin@@ is@@ hing my ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion for me to go to high school ."
This was the cro@@ ss@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this tra@@ dition , I was going to become a wife ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of be@@ coming a teacher will not come to pas@@ s ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pl@@ an to figu@@ re these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a stig@@ ma , people will be c@@ all@@ ing him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y ."
It was a s@@ ha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he figu@@ red out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; o@@ kay , you &apos;ll go to school after the c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of exci@@ te@@ ment .
It &apos;s a c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y . P@@ eople are en@@ j@@ oy@@ ing it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tu@@ al c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y happens , we were d@@ an@@ cing , having exci@@ te@@ ment , and through all the night we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tu@@ al day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ou@@ se that we were d@@ an@@ cing in . Y@@ es , we d@@ an@@ ced and d@@ an@@ ced ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and there were a b@@ un@@ ch of people w@@ ai@@ ting ."
They were all in a circ@@ le .
"And as we d@@ an@@ ced and d@@ an@@ ced , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this circ@@ le of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman s@@ it@@ ting in the middle of it , and this woman was w@@ ai@@ ting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sis@@ ters and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I s@@ at down ."
"And I s@@ at down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ ry@@ ing a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ri@@ ed the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the cli@@ tor@@ is , and she c@@ ut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I b@@ led . I b@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ e@@ ding for a while , I fain@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m lu@@ c@@ k@@ y , I never died — but many di@@ e ."
"It &apos;s pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ the@@ sia , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was lu@@ c@@ k@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and bro@@ ught a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree weeks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I me@@ t a young gen@@ t@@ le@@ man from our village who had been to the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of O@@ reg@@ on .
"This man was w@@ ear@@ ing a wh@@ ite t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , je@@ ans , ca@@ mera , wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about wh@@ ite s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about clo@@ th@@ es , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have pa@@ ved ro@@ ad@@ s . It was quite at@@ tra@@ ctive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a h@@ usb@@ and w@@ ai@@ ting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This gen@@ t@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in high school also , my d@@ ad was si@@ ck ."
"He got a stro@@ ke , and he was really , really si@@ ck , so he really cou@@ ldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ very@@ body who is my d@@ ad &apos;s age , mal@@ e in the comm@@ unity , is my father by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t — my un@@ c@@ les , all of them — and they dic@@ ta@@ te what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ o@@ man &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ yn@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come without the sup@@ port of the village , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to buy the air tic@@ ke@@ t ."
I got a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the sup@@ port of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an op@@ por@@ t@@ unity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost op@@ por@@ t@@ unity ."
This should have been given to a b@@ oy . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tra@@ dition .
There &apos;s a beli@@ ef a@@ mon@@ g our people that mor@@ ning b@@ rings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the mor@@ ning , because there &apos;s good news in the mor@@ ning ."
"And in the village also , there is one chi@@ ef , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the mor@@ ning , as the su@@ n ro@@ se ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ ens his do@@ or is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; M@@ y child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . Can you sup@@ port me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I pro@@ mis@@ ed him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a lis@@ t of another 15 men that I went — 1@@ 6 more men — every single mor@@ ning I went and visi@@ ted them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to sup@@ port me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ riv@@ ed in America . As you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al-@@ Mar@@ ts , v@@ ac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers , and lots of fo@@ od in the ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia ."
I was in a land of pl@@ en@@ ty .
"I en@@ j@@ oy@@ ed myself , but during that moment while I was here , I disco@@ vered a lot of things ."
"I learned that that c@@ ere@@ mon@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called fe@@ mal@@ e gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a are at ris@@ k of going through this mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ per@@ ty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me ang@@ ry .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ s &apos; girls were getting marri@@ ed ."
"They were getting mu@@ ti@@ lated , and here , after I gra@@ du@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N. , I went back to school to get my gra@@ du@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had pro@@ mis@@ ed you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; As I spo@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is rap@@ ed when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is b@@ la@@ med for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got marri@@ ed , the mother is b@@ la@@ med for that , and she &apos;s p@@ un@@ is@@ hed ."
She &apos;s be@@ a@@ ten .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a saf@@ e place . &quot; &quot; As we mo@@ ved , and I went to talk to the f@@ ath@@ ers , the f@@ ath@@ ers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for b@@ oys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for b@@ oys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sign of com@@ mit@@ ment ."
And they did . They don@@ ated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"@@ Ang@@ el@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any c@@ rit@@ er@@ ia that we had ."
"She &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was older . She was 12 years old , and we were tak@@ ing girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"@@ Ang@@ el@@ ine had been mo@@ ving from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father — mo@@ ving from one grand@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ou@@ se to another one , from au@@ n@@ ties to au@@ n@@ ties . She had no st@@ ab@@ ility in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remem@@ ber that day , and I saw something be@@ y@@ on@@ d what I was see@@ ing in Ang@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was older to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the op@@ por@@ t@@ unity to come to the clas@@ s .
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is Ang@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ formation had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
Ang@@ el@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a pi@@ lot so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stu@@ dent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stu@@ dent , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re di@@ vision that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ ha@@ ron . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ vel@@ y@@ n . F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 1@@ 25 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ lated ."
One hundred tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ five girls will not be marri@@ ed when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achi@@ ev@@ ing their dre@@ am@@ s .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them op@@ por@@ t@@ uni@@ ties where they can rise ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being be@@ a@@ ten because of the re@@ vol@@ u@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our comm@@ unity ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are lis@@ ten@@ ing to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ sion@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war ends , no po@@ ver@@ ty ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . P@@ eople will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e b@@ old . S@@ t@@ and up . B@@ e fe@@ ar@@ less . B@@ e con@@ fi@@ dent .
"M@@ ove out , because as you change your world , as you change your comm@@ unity , as we believe that we are im@@ p@@ ac@@ ting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your comm@@ unity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . I@@ f you do that , and I do that , ar@@ en &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s at a TED C@@ on@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al in any way , shape or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the ma@@ j@@ ority ."
M@@ y T@@ al@@ k today is about self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ dence .
It &apos;s just a bas@@ ic fact about being human that some@@ times the self seems to just me@@ l@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is e@@ c@@ stati@@ c and we re@@ ach for me@@ tap@@ h@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ li@@ f@@ ted or ele@@ v@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ stra@@ ct like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te me@@ tap@@ h@@ or .
So here &apos;s the me@@ tap@@ h@@ or I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ou@@ se with many ro@@ om@@ s , most of which we &apos;re very fami@@ li@@ ar with ."
But some@@ times it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ar@@ s from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens on@@ to a stair@@ case .
We c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case and experience a state of al@@ tered con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psycho@@ logis@@ t W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es wrote about the many vari@@ e@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He colle@@ cted all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exci@@ ting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ e@@ su@@ s in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley said about it .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shape for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , appe@@ ar@@ ing to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing ."
M@@ y happiness was so great that I said I wanted to di@@ e .
This world had no place in my af@@ fe@@ ctions .
"P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ f@@ ish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I de@@ si@@ red the wel@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st en@@ e@@ mi@@ es ."
"@@ J@@ H : So n@@ ote how B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley &apos;s pe@@ tty , mor@@ alis@@ tic self just dies on the way up the stair@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he becomes lo@@ ving and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people c@@ lim@@ b the stair@@ case .
O@@ thers use psy@@ che@@ de@@ li@@ c dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c s@@ cro@@ ll sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a psi@@ loc@@ yb@@ in mus@@ h@@ room and at the same moment get y@@ an@@ ked up the stair@@ case by a go@@ d .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ dence in nature .
O@@ thers o@@ ver@@ come their self at ra@@ ves .
But here &apos;s the w@@ ei@@ r@@ de@@ st place of all : war .
"So many bo@@ o@@ ks about war say the same thing , that nothing b@@ rings people together like war ."
And that b@@ rin@@ ging them together op@@ ens up the possi@@ bility of ex@@ tra@@ ordinary self-@@ trans@@ cen@@ dent experien@@ ces .
I &apos;m going to pl@@ ay for you an ex@@ cer@@ p@@ t from this book by G@@ len@@ n G@@ ra@@ y .
G@@ ra@@ y was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in World War I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ len@@ n G@@ ra@@ y : M@@ any ve@@ ter@@ ans will ad@@ m@@ it that the experience of comm@@ un@@ al ef@@ for@@ t in b@@ at@@ tle has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becomes &quot; our &quot; and individu@@ al fa@@ ith lo@@ ses its cen@@ tral impor@@ tan@@ ce ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ su@@ ran@@ ce of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity that makes self-@@ s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce at these mo@@ ments so rel@@ ati@@ vely easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not di@@ e , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ ra@@ des for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It feel@@ s some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cen@@ tral in the w@@ ri@@ ting of the great F@@ ren@@ ch soci@@ o@@ logis@@ t E@@ mil@@ e D@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m .
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m even called us H@@ omo du@@ ple@@ x , or tw@@ o-@@ level man ."
The lower level he called the level of the profan@@ e .
Now profan@@ e is the op@@ pos@@ ite of s@@ ac@@ red .
It just means ordinary or common .
And in our ordinary lives we exis@@ t as individu@@ als .
We want to s@@ atis@@ f@@ y our individu@@ al de@@ si@@ res .
We pur@@ sue our individu@@ al go@@ als .
But some@@ times something happens that tri@@ g@@ g@@ ers a ph@@ ase change .
"In@@ dividu@@ als un@@ ite into a te@@ am , a movement or a n@@ ation , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m called this level the level of the s@@ ac@@ red because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the fun@@ ction of religi@@ on was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral comm@@ unity ."
D@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ ites us takes on an air of s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people circ@@ le around some s@@ ac@@ red ob@@ ject or val@@ ue , they &apos;ll then work as a te@@ am and fi@@ ght to de@@ f@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m wrote about a set of in@@ ten@@ se colle@@ ctive e@@ mo@@ tions that ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ish this mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le of E pl@@ u@@ ri@@ b@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of individu@@ als ."
Th@@ ink of the colle@@ ctive j@@ oy in B@@ rit@@ ain on the day World War I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ ink of the colle@@ ctive ang@@ er in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which bro@@ ught down a dic@@ ta@@ tor ."
So let me sum@@ mar@@ ize where we are .
I &apos;m of@@ fer@@ ing the me@@ tap@@ h@@ or of a stair@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ omo du@@ ple@@ x and this stair@@ case takes us up from the profan@@ e level to the level of the s@@ ac@@ red .
So here &apos;s the mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ lar question for social scienti@@ sts like me : I@@ s the stair@@ case a fe@@ ature of our evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary de@@ sign ?
"I@@ s it a pro@@ du@@ ct of natural se@@ le@@ ction , like our hands ?"
Well many scienti@@ sts who study religi@@ on take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ is@@ ts , for example , argu@@ e that religi@@ on is a set of mem@@ es , sort of par@@ as@@ iti@@ c mem@@ es , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of cra@@ z@@ y religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ctive stuff , like su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to lo@@ se ourselves ?"
How could it ever be ad@@ ap@@ tive for any organis@@ m to o@@ ver@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Char@@ les Dar@@ win wrote a great de@@ al about the evolution of mor@@ ality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ win n@@ ot@@ ed that many of our vi@@ r@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as multi@@ level se@@ le@@ ction .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of gu@@ ys on a college cre@@ w te@@ am .
W@@ ith@@ in this te@@ am there &apos;s com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion .
There are gu@@ ys com@@ pe@@ ting with each other .
"The s@@ lo@@ w@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get c@@ ut from the te@@ am ."
And only a few of these gu@@ ys are going to go on in the s@@ port .
"So within the te@@ am , their inter@@ e@@ sts are actually p@@ it@@ ted against each other ."
And some@@ times it would be ad@@ van@@ tag@@ e@@ ous for one of these gu@@ ys to try to s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age the other gu@@ ys .
M@@ aybe he &apos;ll b@@ ad@@ m@@ ou@@ th his chi@@ ef riv@@ al to the co@@ ach .
"But while that com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on within the bo@@ at , this com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on across bo@@ a@@ ts ."
They can only win if they all pul@@ l together as a te@@ am .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary tru@@ ths ."
Let me il@@ lu@@ stra@@ te this for you .
"S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;ve got a group of little organis@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s sup@@ pose that this little group here , they evol@@ ved to be coo@@ per@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this sim@@ ul@@ ation , as they inter@@ act they g@@ ain poin@@ ts , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led in si@@ ze , you &apos;ll see them sp@@ li@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it g@@ ain@@ s we@@ al@@ th or poin@@ ts or fo@@ od ."
"And in sh@@ or@@ t order , the coo@@ per@@ a@@ tors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders have taken over .
I@@ f a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem then it cannot re@@ ap the ben@@ ef@@ its of coo@@ per@@ ation and group se@@ le@@ ction cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fav@@ or@@ ite sol@@ ution is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the mi@@ toch@@ on@@ d@@ ria in every cell has its own D@@ NA , to@@ tally s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate from the D@@ NA in the nu@@ cle@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate fre@@ e-@@ li@@ ving bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and be@@ came a super@@ organis@@ m .
A super@@ organis@@ m can basically take what it wan@@ ts .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually com@@ posed of these new super@@ organis@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is some@@ times called a ma@@ j@@ or tr@@ an@@ si@@ tion in evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ ar@@ win &apos;s la@@ ws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of play@@ er on the field and things beg@@ in to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some sol@@ it@@ ary was@@ ps beg@@ an cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ularly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ c@@ es@@ tors be@@ came cul@@ tural cre@@ atures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a c@@ am@@ p@@ fire , they divi@@ ded lab@@ or , they beg@@ an pain@@ ting their bo@@ dies , they spo@@ ke their own dial@@ e@@ cts , and even@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own go@@ ds ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the ben@@ ef@@ its of coo@@ per@@ ation loc@@ ked inside ."
"And they un@@ loc@@ ked the most power@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human coo@@ per@@ ation — a force for con@@ stru@@ ction and de@@ stru@@ ction ."
Lo@@ ok at the people in these ph@@ o@@ tos I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing comm@@ un@@ al inter@@ est , which re@@ qui@@ res them to lo@@ se themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my T@@ al@@ k de@@ li@@ vered in the st@@ and@@ ard TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole T@@ al@@ k over again in three minutes in a more ful@@ l-@@ spec@@ tru@@ m sort of way .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ ai@@ d@@ t : We human@@ s have many vari@@ e@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es explain@@ ed ."
One of the most common is c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the se@@ cre@@ t stair@@ case and lo@@ sing ourselves .
"The stair@@ case takes us from the experience of life as profan@@ e or ordinary up@@ wards to the experience of life as s@@ ac@@ red , or de@@ ep@@ ly inter@@ conne@@ cted ."
"We are H@@ omo du@@ ple@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m explain@@ ed ."
"And we are H@@ omo du@@ ple@@ x because we evol@@ ved by multi@@ level se@@ le@@ ction , as Dar@@ win explain@@ ed ."
"If it is an ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation , then we evol@@ ved to be religi@@ ous ."
"I mean that we evol@@ ved to see s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ am@@ s and circ@@ le around s@@ ac@@ red ob@@ jects , people and ideas ."
This is why poli@@ tics is so tri@@ b@@ al .
"P@@ o@@ li@@ tics is par@@ tly profan@@ e , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but poli@@ tics is also about s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ in@@ ing with others to pur@@ sue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the e@@ ter@@ n@@ al stru@@ g@@ g@@ le between good and evi@@ l , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good te@@ am ."
"And most impor@@ tan@@ tly , if the stair@@ case is real , it explain@@ s the per@@ sis@@ tent under@@ cur@@ r@@ ent of dis@@ s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion in modern life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ex@@ tent , hi@@ vis@@ h cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We b@@ us@@ ted out of the hi@@ ve during the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions and bro@@ ught liber@@ ty to the op@@ press@@ ed .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays we f@@ ly around like individu@@ al be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ e@@ dom .
But some@@ times we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ omo du@@ ple@@ x , but modern , se@@ cu@@ lar society was built to s@@ atis@@ f@@ y our lower , profan@@ e selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ for@@ table down here on the lower level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment center ."
One great challenge of modern life is to find the stair@@ case ami@@ d all the clu@@ tter and then to do something good and no@@ ble once you c@@ lim@@ b to the top .
I see this de@@ si@@ re in my students at the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
They all want to find a cause or c@@ all@@ ing that they can thro@@ w themselves into .
They &apos;re all se@@ arch@@ ing for their stair@@ case .
M@@ ost people long to o@@ ver@@ come pe@@ t@@ tin@@ ess and become part of something lar@@ ger .
And this explain@@ s the ex@@ tra@@ ordinary res@@ on@@ ance of this simple me@@ tap@@ h@@ or con@@ j@@ u@@ red up ne@@ arly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land enti@@ re of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the ma@@ in . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the ple@@ as@@ ures of every@@ day life .
But I want to beg@@ in with a story of an un@@ u@@ su@@ al and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ man@@ n Go@@ ering .
"G@@ o@@ ering was H@@ it@@ ler &apos;s second in comm@@ and in World War I@@ I , his design@@ ated success@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ ler , Go@@ ering fan@@ ci@@ ed h@@ im@@ self a colle@@ c@@ tor of ar@@ t ."
"H@@ it@@ ler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fav@@ or@@ ite ar@@ t@@ work ever .
"@@ World War I@@ I came to an end , and Go@@ ering was cap@@ tured , tried at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely sen@@ ten@@ ced to death ."
Th@@ en the Al@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his colle@@ ctions and found the pain@@ tin@@ gs and went after the people who sol@@ d it to him .
"V@@ an Me@@ eg@@ er@@ en was char@@ g@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself p@@ un@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by death ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks into his pris@@ on sen@@ t@@ ence , v@@ an Me@@ eg@@ er@@ en con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not s@@ ell a great ma@@ ster@@ piece to that N@@ az@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it myself ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now no@@ body beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ ring me a can@@ v@@ as and some pain@@ t , and I will pain@@ t a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I sol@@ d that dis@@ g@@ us@@ ting N@@ az@@ i ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the char@@ ges of tre@@ as@@ on were dro@@ pped .
"He had a les@@ se@@ r char@@ ge of for@@ ger@@ y , got a year sen@@ t@@ ence and died a her@@ o to the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an Me@@ eg@@ er@@ en , but I want to turn now to Go@@ ering , who &apos;s pic@@ tured here being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now Go@@ ering was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ g@@ a@@ tors describ@@ ed him as an ami@@ c@@ able psycho@@ pa@@ th .
He had disco@@ vered after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sho@@ ck .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The S@@ up@@ per at E@@ m@@ ma@@ us &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ ster@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ ger@@ y ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was disco@@ vered , it lost all its val@@ ue and was taken away from the mus@@ eu@@ m ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psycho@@ logis@@ ts — why do or@@ ig@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we respon@@ d so much to our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ o@@ logis@@ ts like V@@ eb@@ le@@ n and W@@ ol@@ fe would argu@@ e that the reason why we take or@@ ig@@ ins so ser@@ i@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ b@@ s , because we &apos;re foc@@ used on sta@@ tu@@ s ."
"A@@ mon@@ g other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how power@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al than a for@@ ger@@ y because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer or@@ ig@@ in@@ als than for@@ ger@@ ies ."
"@@ that human@@ s are , to some ex@@ tent , natural born essenti@@ alis@@ ts ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respon@@ d to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed on our beli@@ ef@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their h@@ id@@ den nature is ."
"I want to sug@@ gest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to sug@@ gest that ple@@ asu@@ re is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level ple@@ as@@ ures like ar@@ t , but even the most see@@ min@@ g@@ ly simple ple@@ as@@ ures are af@@ fe@@ cted by our beli@@ ef@@ s about h@@ id@@ den es@@ sen@@ ces ."
So take fo@@ od .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It de@@ pen@@ ds . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ ef ."
F@@ e@@ w of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a r@@ at or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a stran@@ ge@@ ly col@@ or@@ ed piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so surpris@@ ing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it tas@@ tes to you will de@@ p@@ end cri@@ tically on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of this was done with young children .
"@@ How do you make children not just be more lik@@ ely to e@@ at car@@ ro@@ ts and d@@ rin@@ k mil@@ k , but to get more ple@@ asu@@ re from e@@ ating car@@ ro@@ ts and d@@ rin@@ king mil@@ k — to think they tas@@ te better ?"
How do you get ad@@ ul@@ ts to really en@@ j@@ oy w@@ ine ?
This was re@@ cen@@ tly done with a neuro@@ scienti@@ fi@@ c tw@@ is@@ t .
In fron@@ t of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ very@@ body , of course , d@@ rin@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re d@@ rin@@ king ex@@ pen@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with ple@@ asu@@ re and re@@ ward light up like a Chris@@ t@@ mas tree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more ple@@ asu@@ ra@@ ble , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take sex .
These are sti@@ mul@@ i I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fai@@ r@@ ly at@@ tra@@ ctive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is mal@@ e , the one on the right is fe@@ mal@@ e ."
"If that beli@@ ef turns out to be mis@@ taken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disco@@ ver that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed ver@@ sion of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why spo@@ us@@ es in happy marri@@ ages tend to think that their h@@ usb@@ and or wife looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A partic@@ ularly dra@@ mati@@ c example of this comes from a neuro@@ logi@@ cal dis@@ order known as C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras syn@@ dro@@ me .
So C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras syn@@ dro@@ me is a dis@@ order where you get a speci@@ fi@@ c de@@ lu@@ sion .
"Now of@@ ten , a resul@@ t of C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras syn@@ dro@@ me is tra@@ gi@@ c ."
But there &apos;s at le@@ ast one case where C@@ ap@@ g@@ ras syn@@ dro@@ me had a happy en@@ ding .
This was re@@ cor@@ ded in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The golf clu@@ b@@ s were ow@@ ned by Joh@@ n F@@ . K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy and sol@@ d for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ ction .
The bub@@ ble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y S@@ pe@@ ar@@ s and sol@@ d for se@@ ver@@ al hundre@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ riv@@ ing market in the par@@ ti@@ ally e@@ a@@ ten fo@@ od of be@@ loved people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are perhaps the most val@@ u@@ able of all .
"A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to an un@@ con@@ fi@@ r@@ med re@@ port , a S@@ au@@ di mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ re of@@ fer@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pai@@ r of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones thro@@ wn at Ge@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h at an Ira@@ q@@ i pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence se@@ ver@@ al years ago .
"W@@ ith my colle@@ ag@@ ues Ge@@ or@@ ge Ne@@ w@@ man and Gi@@ l Di@@ es@@ en@@ dru@@ ck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , ma@@ t@@ ters for the ob@@ jects that people like ."
"So in one of our experi@@ ments , we asked people to name a fam@@ ous person who they ad@@ or@@ ed , a li@@ ving person they ad@@ or@@ ed ."
So one answer was Ge@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you p@@ ay for Ge@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ a@@ ter ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fai@@ r amount — more than you would p@@ ay for a brand new swe@@ a@@ ter or a swe@@ a@@ ter ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ or@@ e .
Th@@ en we asked other groups of sub@@ jects — we gave them different re@@ stri@@ ctions and different con@@ ditions .
"So for in@@ st@@ ance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , you can buy the swe@@ a@@ ter , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t res@@ ell it . &quot; &quot; That dro@@ ps the val@@ ue of it , sug@@ g@@ es@@ ting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really c@@ au@@ ses an ef@@ fect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , you could res@@ ell it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s tho@@ ro@@ u@@ gh@@ ly was@@ hed . &quot; &quot; That c@@ au@@ ses a hu@@ ge drop in the val@@ ue ."
"As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve was@@ hed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ oti@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to ar@@ t ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ plic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ no@@ b and want to bo@@ ast about having an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ."
Wh@@ o here lik@@ es the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then re@@ por@@ ted that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on tele@@ vision , the val@@ ue of her ar@@ t dro@@ pped to nothing ."
"It was the same ar@@ t , physi@@ c@@ ally , but the history had changed ."
So he got J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million dol@@ lar viol@@ in down to a W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ ef cli@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ ol@@ in music ) Af@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"A@@ p@@ par@@ en@@ tly to really en@@ j@@ oy the music of J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re lis@@ ten@@ ing to J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the vi@@ de@@ o — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s st@@ anding in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s stru@@ ck with p@@ ity .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and hands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from Joh@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ n@@ is@@ t com@@ position , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a dol@@ lar 9@@ 9 , you can lis@@ ten to that si@@ l@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of si@@ l@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about ple@@ asu@@ re , but what I want to sug@@ gest is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ lies as well to pain ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beli@@ ef@@ s about the ess@@ ence of it , af@@ fect how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lo@@ vely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ ra@@ y and D@@ an W@@ eg@@ ner .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful electri@@ c sho@@ c@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sho@@ c@@ ks .
"The second sho@@ ck feel@@ s less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The th@@ ir@@ d dro@@ ps , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pain gets less .
"In the other con@@ dition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sho@@ c@@ king them on pur@@ pose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sho@@ c@@ king them ."
The first sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the th@@ ir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some c@@ as@@ es , pain under the right circ@@ um@@ st@@ an@@ ces can trans@@ form into ple@@ asu@@ re ."
"The point was ni@@ c@@ ely sum@@ mar@@ iz@@ ed by the po@@ et Joh@@ n Mil@@ ton who wrote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ av@@ en of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ av@@ en . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
And finally I en@@ ded up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psycho@@ logy by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a sk@@ i res@@ or@@ t in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land without any money to actually en@@ j@@ oy myself , because the s@@ now had me@@ l@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a mo@@ vi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers that there was to be a presen@@ t@@ ation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Z@@ u@@ rich , and it was about f@@ ly@@ ing s@@ au@@ c@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that even@@ ing le@@ cture was very interesting .
And this see@@ med very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his bo@@ o@@ ks after that le@@ cture .
"And that was C@@ arl J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose name or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psycho@@ logy and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a ty@@ pic@@ al resul@@ t that many people have presen@@ ted , and there are many vari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for in@@ st@@ ance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ ve@@ y@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that h@@ as@@ n &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ ere@@ as the pers@@ onal income , on a scal@@ e that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate for in@@ fl@@ ation , has more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ led , almost tri@@ ple@@ d , in that peri@@ od ."
"But you find essenti@@ ally the same results , na@@ me@@ ly , that after a certain bas@@ ic point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ ove the min@@ im@@ um po@@ ver@@ ty level — increas@@ es in material well-being don &apos;t seem to af@@ fect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the l@@ ack of bas@@ ic resour@@ ces , material resour@@ ces , con@@ tribu@@ tes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material resour@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been foc@@ used more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our nor@@ mal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I beg@@ an to look at cre@@ ative people — first ar@@ ti@@ sts and scienti@@ sts , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essenti@@ ally sp@@ en@@ ding their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expe@@ ct ei@@ ther f@@ ame or for@@ t@@ un@@ e , but which made their life me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the lead@@ ing com@@ pos@@ ers of American music back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 pag@@ es long .
But this little ex@@ cer@@ p@@ t is a very good sum@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying during the inter@@ view .
And it describ@@ es how he feel@@ s when com@@ pos@@ ing is going well .
And he says by describ@@ ing it as an e@@ c@@ stati@@ c state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; e@@ c@@ stas@@ y &quot; &quot; in G@@ re@@ ek me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it be@@ came essenti@@ ally an anal@@ og@@ y for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary every@@ day ro@@ u@@ tin@@ es .
So e@@ c@@ stas@@ y is essenti@@ ally a ste@@ p@@ ping into an al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations that we look up to as having been pin@@ n@@ ac@@ les of human achi@@ ev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , G@@ re@@ e@@ ce , the H@@ in@@ d@@ u civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , or the M@@ ay@@ as , or E@@ gy@@ p@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their e@@ c@@ stas@@ ies , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the tem@@ pl@@ es they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the circ@@ us@@ es , the ar@@ enas , the the@@ a@@ ters ."
"Th@@ ese are the re@@ main@@ s of civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and they are the plac@@ es that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cen@@ tra@@ ted , more or@@ der@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ ena , which is built like a G@@ re@@ ek am@@ ph@@ ithe@@ at@@ re , is a place for e@@ c@@ stas@@ y also ."
We are par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He needs just a piece of pap@@ er where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ oun@@ ds that had not exis@@ ted before in that particular com@@ b@@ in@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ enni@@ fer did in her impro@@ vis@@ ation , a new reality — that is , a moment of e@@ c@@ stas@@ y — he en@@ ters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so in@@ ten@@ se an experience that it feel@@ s almost as if he didn &apos;t exis@@ t .
And that s@@ oun@@ ds like a kind of a ro@@ man@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
"But actually , our ner@@ v@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of proc@@ ess@@ ing more than about 1@@ 10 b@@ its of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 b@@ its per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really in@@ vol@@ ved in this comple@@ tely eng@@ ag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion left over to mon@@ i@@ tor how his body feel@@ s , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hun@@ g@@ ry or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , his id@@ enti@@ ty dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s from his con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough at@@ ten@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that re@@ qui@@ res a lot of con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion , and at the same time to feel that he exis@@ ts ."
So exis@@ t@@ ence is tem@@ por@@ arily su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seems to be mo@@ ving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t com@@ pose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this auto@@ mati@@ c , s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s describ@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has developed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tru@@ is@@ m in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of tech@@ ni@@ cal@@ -@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular field .
"Wh@@ ether it &apos;s ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics or music , it takes that long to be able to beg@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just flo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people describ@@ ed this as a s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous f@@ low that I called this ty@@ pe of experience the &quot; &quot; f@@ low experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different re@@ al@@ ms .
"For in@@ st@@ ance , a po@@ et describ@@ es it in this form ."
This is by a stu@@ dent of min@@ e who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the lead@@ ing w@@ rit@@ ers and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it describ@@ es the same ef@@ for@@ t@@ less , s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this e@@ c@@ stati@@ c state ."
"This po@@ et describ@@ es it as op@@ en@@ ing a do@@ or that flo@@ a@@ ts in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mil@@ ar descri@@ p@@ tion to what Al@@ ber@@ t Einstein gave as to how he ima@@ gin@@ ed the for@@ ces of rel@@ ati@@ vity , when he was stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ vi@@ ties .
"For in@@ st@@ ance , this is another stu@@ dent of min@@ e , S@@ us@@ an J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from Au@@ st@@ r@@ al@@ ia , who did work with some of the lead@@ ing ath@@ le@@ tes in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c s@@ ka@@ ter , the same essenti@@ al descri@@ p@@ tion of the ph@@ en@@ omen@@ o@@ logy of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes auto@@ ma@@ tically , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the music , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most re@@ cent book I wrote , called &quot; &quot; Go@@ od B@@ usiness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been no@@ min@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very successful and very eth@@ ical , very soci@@ ally responsi@@ ble ."
You see that these people defin@@ e success as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these successful and responsi@@ ble C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful and successful job ."
An@@ ita R@@ od@@ di@@ ck is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"She is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ o@@ dy S@@ ho@@ p , the natural cos@@ me@@ tics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a pas@@ sion that comes from doing the best and having f@@ low while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ bu@@ ka , who was at that time star@@ ting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a pro@@ du@@ ct — they didn &apos;t have a pro@@ du@@ ct , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to e@@ st@@ ab@@ lish a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the j@@ oy of technologi@@ cal in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , be a@@ w@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s con@@ tent ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how f@@ low en@@ ters the work@@ place .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ in@@ ican mon@@ ks , to b@@ lin@@ d n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an c@@ lim@@ bers , to N@@ av@@ a@@ j@@ o sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ds — who en@@ j@@ oy their work ."
"And reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the culture , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of education or wh@@ ate@@ ver , there are these seven con@@ ditions that seem to be there when a person is in f@@ low ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something lar@@ ger ."
"And once the con@@ ditions are present , what you are doing becomes wor@@ th doing for its own s@@ ake ."
"In our studies , we re@@ present the every@@ day life of people in this simple sche@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very prec@@ is@@ ely , actually , because we give people elec@@ tron@@ ic pag@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can e@@ st@@ ab@@ lish an average , which is the center of the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can pre@@ di@@ ct fai@@ r@@ ly accu@@ ra@@ tely when you will be in f@@ low , and it will be when your chall@@ eng@@ es are high@@ er than average and sk@@ il@@ ls are high@@ er than average ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less positive .
A@@ ro@@ us@@ al is still good because you are o@@ ver@@ -@@ chall@@ eng@@ ed there .
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ for@@ table , but not very exci@@ ted ."
It &apos;s not very chall@@ eng@@ ing any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter f@@ low from contro@@ l , you have to increase the chall@@ eng@@ es ."
So those two are ide@@ al and comple@@ men@@ tar@@ y are@@ as from which f@@ low is easy to go into .
The other com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of challenge and sk@@ ill become progre@@ s@@ si@@ vely less op@@ ti@@ mal .
"Bor@@ e@@ dom begin@@ s to be very a@@ ver@@ sive and ap@@ ath@@ y becomes very neg@@ ative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ il@@ ls , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"The lar@@ gest single con@@ tribu@@ tor to that experience is w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing tele@@ vision ; the next one is being in the b@@ a@@ thro@@ om , s@@ it@@ ting ."
"E@@ ven though some@@ times w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing tele@@ vision about seven to eight percent of the time is in f@@ low , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a pro@@ gra@@ m you really want to watch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously without any ad@@ vice , but un@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our man@@ d@@ ate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have an inter@@ est in education .
S@@ h@@ ak@@ es@@ pe@@ are being seven ?
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my daughter &apos;s 1@@ 6 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es .
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
The brain isn &apos;t divi@@ ded into compar@@ t@@ ments .
"Because you are , ar@@ en &apos;t you ?"
"If I &apos;m coo@@ king , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in I get an@@ n@@ oy@@ ed ."
"T@@ ake her to a d@@ ance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was ful@@ l of people like me .
P@@ eople who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a very large cos@@ mos , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at ei@@ ther of those scal@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins ha@@ ven &apos;t evol@@ ved to understand the world at that scal@@ e ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed on this very th@@ in sli@@ ce of per@@ cep@@ tion right in the middle ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
But we &apos;re not see@@ ing all the w@@ av@@ es out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tri@@ l@@ li@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ her@@ en@@ tly un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ n@@ akes inclu@@ de some in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed in their reality , and h@@ on@@ ey@@ be@@ es inclu@@ de ul@@ tra@@ vio@@ let in their view of the world , and of course we build mach@@ ines in the das@@ h@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our car@@ s to pic@@ k up on sign@@ als in the ra@@ dio fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ran@@ ge , and we built mach@@ ines in h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als to pic@@ k up on the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ran@@ ge ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at le@@ ast not yet , because you don &apos;t come equ@@ i@@ pped with the pro@@ per sen@@ sor@@ s ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ stra@@ ined by our bi@@ o@@ logy , and that goes against the common sense no@@ tion that our ey@@ es and our ear@@ s and our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ je@@ ctive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , our bra@@ ins are s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing just a little bit of the world ."
"So in the b@@ lin@@ d and de@@ a@@ f world of the tic@@ k , the important sign@@ als are tem@@ per@@ ature and bu@@ ty@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish , its sen@@ sor@@ y world is la@@ vis@@ h@@ ly col@@ or@@ ed by electri@@ cal fiel@@ ds ; and for the ech@@ olo@@ c@@ ating b@@ at , its reality is con@@ stru@@ cted out of air com@@ pres@@ sion w@@ av@@ es ."
"That &apos;s the sli@@ ce of their e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem that they can pic@@ k up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"Now , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , every an@@ ima@@ l as@@ sum@@ es that its um@@ wel@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ je@@ ctive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ y@@ on@@ d what we can sense ."
Let &apos;s do a con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ ma@@ gine that you are a b@@ loo@@ d@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about s@@ mell@@ ing .
"You &apos;ve got a long s@@ n@@ out that has 200 million s@@ cent re@@ cep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et no@@ stri@@ ls that at@@ tra@@ ct and tra@@ p s@@ cent mole@@ cul@@ es , and your no@@ stri@@ ls even have s@@ lit@@ s so you can take big no@@ se@@ ful@@ s of air ."
E@@ very@@ thing is about s@@ me@@ ll for you .
"So one day , you stop in your tra@@ c@@ ks with a re@@ vel@@ ation ."
"You look at your human ow@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the pi@@ tiful , im@@ po@@ ver@@ is@@ hed no@@ se of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ e@@ ble little no@@ se@@ ful of air ?
"@@ How can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 y@@ ar@@ ds away , or that your n@@ ei@@ gh@@ b@@ or was on this very spo@@ t six h@@ ours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re human@@ s , we &apos;ve never experien@@ ced that world of s@@ me@@ ll , so we don &apos;t mis@@ s it , because we are fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly se@@ t@@ t@@ led into our um@@ wel@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be stu@@ ck there ?"
"So as a neuro@@ scienti@@ st , I &apos;m interes@@ ted in the way that technology might ex@@ p@@ and our um@@ wel@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So the way this works is , you take a mi@@ cro@@ ph@@ one and you di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ e the sign@@ al , and you put an elec@@ tro@@ de stri@@ p di@@ rec@@ tly into the in@@ ner e@@ ar ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these technologi@@ es speak the language of S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , and it &apos;s not exactly the same dial@@ e@@ ct as our natural bi@@ ologi@@ cal sense org@@ ans ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain fi@@ g@@ ures out how to use the sign@@ als just fin@@ e .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big se@@ cre@@ t : Y@@ our brain is not hear@@ ing or see@@ ing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is loc@@ ked in a v@@ au@@ l@@ t of si@@ l@@ ence and d@@ ark@@ ness inside your sk@@ ul@@ l .
"All it ever se@@ es are elec@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sign@@ als that come in along different data c@@ ab@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
And this is a very ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally a gener@@ al pur@@ pose compu@@ ting de@@ vice , and it just takes in everything and fi@@ g@@ ures out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , fre@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to tin@@ ker around with different sor@@ ts of in@@ put chan@@ n@@ el@@ s ."
The brain fi@@ g@@ ures out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom , you find lots of peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al de@@ vi@@ ces ."
"So s@@ n@@ akes have he@@ at p@@ its with which to de@@ te@@ ct in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed , and the gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish has elec@@ tro@@ re@@ cep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ no@@ sed mo@@ le has this app@@ en@@ d@@ age with 2@@ 2 fin@@ g@@ ers on it with which it feel@@ s around and con@@ stru@@ cts a 3@@ D mo@@ de@@ l of the world , and many bir@@ ds have magne@@ ti@@ te so they can or@@ i@@ ent to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to contin@@ u@@ ally re@@ de@@ sign the brain .
"In@@ ste@@ ad , with the princi@@ pl@@ es of brain o@@ per@@ ation e@@ st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is design@@ ing new peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The les@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really spe@@ cial or fun@@ da@@ mental about the bi@@ o@@ logy that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted from a comple@@ x ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to sti@@ ck with , and our best pro@@ of of princi@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ sor@@ y sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion ."
"Now , that might sound spe@@ cul@@ ative , but the first pap@@ er de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ting this was published in the journ@@ al N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
Why the for@@ e@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern in@@ car@@ n@@ ation is called the bra@@ in@@ port , and this is a little elec@@ tro@@ gri@@ d that s@@ its on your ton@@ gu@@ e , and the vi@@ de@@ o fe@@ ed gets turned into these little elec@@ tro@@ t@@ acti@@ le sign@@ als , and b@@ lin@@ d people get so good at using this that they can thro@@ w a b@@ all into a bas@@ ke@@ t , or they can na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate comple@@ x ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their ton@@ gu@@ e .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds comple@@ tely in@@ s@@ an@@ e , right ?"
"But remem@@ ber , all vision ever is is elec@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sign@@ als cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the sign@@ als come from .
It just fi@@ g@@ ures out what to do with them .
"And we wanted to do this , given the power and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity of por@@ table compu@@ ting , we wanted to make sure that this would ru@@ n on cell ph@@ ones and t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts , and also we wanted to make this a w@@ ear@@ able , something that you could we@@ ar under your clo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing , my sound is getting cap@@ tured by the t@@ ab@@ let , and then it &apos;s getting ma@@ pped on@@ to a v@@ est that &apos;s co@@ vered in vibra@@ tory mo@@ tors , just like the mo@@ tors in your cell ph@@ one . So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing ,"
the sound is getting trans@@ lated to a patter@@ n of vibra@@ tion on the v@@ est .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tu@@ al : this t@@ ab@@ let is trans@@ mit@@ ting B@@ lu@@ eto@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m w@@ ear@@ ing the v@@ est right now ."
So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ lated into dy@@ na@@ mic patter@@ ns of vibra@@ tion .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the s@@ on@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been tes@@ ting this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start understanding the language of the v@@ est ."
So this is J@@ on@@ a@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a mas@@ ter &apos;s de@@ gre@@ e .
"He was born prof@@ oun@@ dly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ wel@@ t that &apos;s una@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able to him ."
"So we had J@@ on@@ a@@ than tra@@ in with the v@@ est for four days , two h@@ ours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t No@@ vi@@ ch : You .
S@@ N : Wh@@ ere . Wh@@ ere .
D@@ E : J@@ on@@ a@@ than is able to trans@@ late this com@@ plic@@ ated patter@@ n of vibra@@ tions into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"Now , this technology has the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to be a g@@ a@@ me@@ -@@ chan@@ ger , because the only other sol@@ ution for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ pl@@ ant , and that re@@ qui@@ res an in@@ vas@@ i@@ ve su@@ rg@@ ery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ ap@@ er than a co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ pl@@ ant , which op@@ ens up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the poor@@ est countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed by our results with sen@@ sor@@ y sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ sor@@ y ad@@ dition ."
"@@ How could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a comple@@ tely new kind of sense , to ex@@ p@@ and the human u@@ mv@@ elt ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed re@@ al-@@ time data from the Inter@@ net di@@ rec@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they develo@@ p a di@@ re@@ ct per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
"Th@@ en , two bu@@ t@@ ton@@ s appe@@ ar , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding is re@@ al-@@ time data from the sto@@ ck market , and he &apos;s making buy and s@@ ell dec@@ is@@ i@@ ons ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re see@@ ing is , can we ex@@ p@@ and the human u@@ mv@@ elt so that he comes to have , after se@@ ver@@ al weeks , a di@@ re@@ ct per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al experience of the economic move@@ ments of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll re@@ port on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ ur@@ ing the tal@@ ks this mor@@ ning , we &apos;ve been auto@@ ma@@ tically s@@ c@@ rap@@ ing T@@ w@@ it@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 h@@ as@@ h@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an auto@@ ma@@ ted senti@@ ment anal@@ y@@ sis , which means , are people using positive words or neg@@ ative words or neu@@ tral ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am pl@@ ug@@ g@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate e@@ mo@@ tion of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lo@@ ving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a big@@ ger experience than a human can nor@@ m@@ ally have .
We &apos;re also expan@@ ding the u@@ mv@@ elt of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the v@@ est is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different me@@ as@@ ures from this qu@@ ad@@ co@@ p@@ ter , so p@@ it@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w and ro@@ ll and or@@ i@@ en@@ t@@ ation and head@@ ing , and that impro@@ ves this pi@@ lot &apos;s ab@@ ility to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s essenti@@ ally like he &apos;s ex@@ ten@@ ding his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vis@@ ion@@ ing is tak@@ ing a modern co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it ful@@ l of g@@ au@@ ges and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between ac@@ c@@ ess@@ ing big data and experiencing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties on the h@@ oriz@@ on for human expan@@ sion .
"@@ Just imagine an as@@ tron@@ au@@ t being able to feel the o@@ ver@@ all health of the Inter@@ national S@@ p@@ ace S@@ t@@ ation , or , for that matter , having you feel the in@@ visi@@ ble states of your own health , like your b@@ loo@@ d sug@@ ar and the state of your mi@@ cro@@ bi@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e vision or see@@ ing in in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed or ul@@ tra@@ vio@@ let ."
"So the ke@@ y is this : As we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increas@@ ing@@ ly be able to cho@@ ose our own peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al de@@ vi@@ ces ."
"We no longer have to wa@@ it for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ sor@@ y gi@@ f@@ ts on her ti@@ me@@ scal@@ es , but instead , like any good par@@ ent , she &apos;s given us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and defin@@ e our own tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Can you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ e@@ ah .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I f@@ elt ap@@ plause on the v@@ est ."
It &apos;s ni@@ ce . It &apos;s like a mas@@ s@@ age . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &apos;s going cra@@ z@@ y . T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &apos;s going ma@@ d .
So that sto@@ ck market experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to wr@@ ite to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
So what that tell@@ s us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tri@@ ck pon@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of compu@@ t@@ ations on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through bu@@ m@@ ps on their fin@@ g@@ ers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a theor@@ e@@ tical lim@@ it that we know the ed@@ ge of .
"C@@ A : I@@ f this che@@ c@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be de@@ lu@@ g@@ ed ."
There are so many possible app@@ li@@ c@@ ations for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exci@@ ted about , the di@@ re@@ ction it might go ?"
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re st@@ anding around ."
"So I think he@@ av@@ y mach@@ in@@ ery , sa@@ fe@@ ty , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ tory , of your equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ a@@ vi@@ d E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d@@ -@@ blo@@ wing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( Applause )"
It &apos;s really a fa@@ il@@ u@@ re to de@@ te@@ ct a certain kind of d@@ ang@@ er .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
"I am un@@ able to mar@@ s@@ ha@@ l this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are just sto@@ ps getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to con@@ sider why this might happen .
What could stop us from doing this ?
A ful@@ l-@@ scal@@ e nu@@ cle@@ ar war ?
A global pan@@ de@@ mic ?
An aster@@ oi@@ d im@@ p@@ act ?
J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber be@@ coming pre@@ si@@ dent of the United States ?
But that isn &apos;t the most lik@@ ely scen@@ ario .
It &apos;s not that our mach@@ ines will become s@@ pon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously mal@@ evol@@ ent .
Just think about how we re@@ late to an@@ ts .
We don &apos;t ha@@ te them .
"Now , I su@@ spe@@ ct this seems far@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ch@@ ed to many of you ."
And there are only three of them .
In@@ tel@@ ligence is a matter of information proc@@ ess@@ ing in physical syste@@ ms .
The second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our intel@@ lig@@ ent mach@@ ines .
We want to cu@@ re dis@@ eas@@ es like Al@@ z@@ h@@ ei@@ mer &apos;s and can@@ cer .
We want to understand economic syste@@ ms . We want to impro@@ ve our cli@@ mate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"Now , just con@@ sider the s@@ mar@@ test person who has ever li@@ ved ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s sh@@ or@@ t@@ lis@@ t here is Joh@@ n v@@ on N@@ eu@@ man@@ n .
Here we have Joh@@ n v@@ on N@@ eu@@ man@@ n .
And then we have you and me .
And it &apos;s important to recogn@@ ize that this is true by vi@@ r@@ tu@@ e of spe@@ ed alone .
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dru@@ d@@ ger@@ y .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al work .
So what would ap@@ es like ourselves do in this circ@@ um@@ st@@ ance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to pl@@ ay F@@ ris@@ be@@ e and give each other mas@@ s@@ ages ."
This is a win@@ ner@@ -@@ tak@@ e-@@ all scen@@ ario .
"And if you ha@@ ven &apos;t no@@ tic@@ ed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is how long we &apos;ve had the iP@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ im@@ ps@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on tele@@ vision .
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just coun@@ ting down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship lan@@ ds ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ gen@@ cy than we do .
"&quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re feel@@ ing de@@ press@@ ed ? Just sh@@ ake it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , ad@@ ul@@ ts get tri@@ c@@ ked this way as well , all the time ."
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people fun@@ ction be@@ low their ac@@ tu@@ al po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al ."
Why ? Because of poor e@@ moti@@ onal hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
To ru@@ min@@ ate means to che@@ w over .
He had visi@@ ble tu@@ mor@@ s all over his body .
And he had to start a har@@ s@@ h course of che@@ mo@@ therap@@ y .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experi@@ ments in behavi@@ or@@ al science .
I bring you into a room .
"He g@@ a@@ ther@@ ed his par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ cen@@ ti@@ vi@@ ze them .
It d@@ ul@@ ls thinking and b@@ loc@@ ks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even clo@@ se ."
"@@ Re@@ wards , by their very nature , n@@ arro@@ w our foc@@ us , con@@ cen@@ tra@@ te the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many c@@ as@@ es ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who s@@ pon@@ sor@@ ed this research ?
The good news is that the scienti@@ sts who &apos;ve been stu@@ dy@@ ing moti@@ v@@ ation have given us this new approach .
Au@@ to@@ no@@ my : the ur@@ ge to di@@ re@@ ct our own lives .
M@@ aster@@ y : the de@@ si@@ re to get better and better at something that ma@@ t@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about auto@@ no@@ my .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ ag@@ ement ."
M@@ anag@@ ement did not e@@ man@@ ate from nature .
S@@ ome@@ body inven@@ ted it .
"But if you want eng@@ ag@@ ement , self-@@ di@@ re@@ ction works better ."
How many of you have heard of the compan@@ y A@@ t@@ las@@ si@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ bly co@@ ol .
"Au@@ to@@ no@@ my , ma@@ ster@@ y and pur@@ pose , the building b@@ loc@@ ks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another en@@ c@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia got started ."
The d@@ ri@@ ve to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Jo@@ e Ko@@ w@@ an : I have st@@ age f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had st@@ age f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
I had this ir@@ ra@@ tional fear .
There were like 20 people there .
"But I took a de@@ ep bre@@ ath , and I sign@@ ed up to pl@@ ay , and I f@@ elt pretty good ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic ner@@ v@@ ous system k@@ ic@@ ks in ."
"I mean , your ner@@ v@@ ous system is an idi@@ ot ."
And something good did happen — I had the tin@@ i@@ est little g@@ lim@@ pse of that au@@ dience conne@@ ction that I was h@@ op@@ ing for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness .
"That only seems au@@ then@@ tic when I have st@@ age f@@ right , and the more ner@@ v@@ ous I was , the better the s@@ ong would be . E@@ as@@ y ."
"B@@ y having a s@@ ong that explain@@ ed what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the au@@ dience per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"And even@@ tually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to pl@@ ay the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really ner@@ v@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be o@@ kay if I play@@ ed the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong for you ?"
( Applause ) Can I have a si@@ p of water ?
"I@@ ma@@ gine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the si@@ ze of a golf b@@ all .
So en@@ vision what it looks like all wr@@ app@@ ed up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel loved and ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated like never before and re@@ conne@@ ct with friends and ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ d@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion will o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will re@@ cal@@ i@@ bra@@ te what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ defin@@ e your sense of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ ality and fa@@ ith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ pas@@ sed vit@@ ality and energy .
"You &apos;ll ex@@ p@@ and your vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , me@@ et new people , and you &apos;ll have a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation of doing ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing .
You &apos;ll e@@ at coun@@ t@@ less g@@ our@@ me@@ t me@@ als .
F@@ lo@@ w@@ ers will ar@@ ri@@ ve by the tru@@ c@@ klo@@ ad .
"P@@ eople will say to you , &quot; You look great . H@@ ave you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a li@@ fe@@ time sup@@ ply of good dru@@ gs .

Not lik@@ ely .
This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wr@@ app@@ ed up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a r@@ are ge@@ m — a brain tu@@ mo@@ r , he@@ man@@ gi@@ ob@@ las@@ toma — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ ep@@ s on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m o@@ kay now , I wouldn &apos;t w@@ ish this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ oun@@ dly al@@ tered my life in ways I didn &apos;t expe@@ ct in all the ways I just sh@@ ar@@ ed with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s un@@ expe@@ cted , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , con@@ sider that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ ra@@ id of w@@ om@@ an@@ ho@@ od .
"@@ Not that I &apos;m not af@@ ra@@ id now , but I &apos;ve learned to pre@@ tend ."
I &apos;ve learned to be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ack in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were sup@@ posed to be kind and thou@@ ght@@ ful and pretty and gen@@ tle and so@@ ft , and we were sup@@ posed to f@@ it into ro@@ les that were sort of s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y — really not quite cle@@ ar what we were sup@@ posed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were pl@@ en@@ ty of ro@@ le mo@@ de@@ ls all around us .
"We had our mothers , our au@@ n@@ ts , our cou@@ sin@@ s , our sis@@ ters , and of course , the e@@ ver@@ -@@ present me@@ dia bomb@@ ar@@ ding us with ima@@ ges and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a h@@ ome@@ ma@@ ker , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ li@@ e things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me pin@@ k out@@ f@@ its ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ou@@ ght me a book of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that hu@@ mo@@ r was ac@@ cep@@ table in my family , I could dra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to speak — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ val ."
I was lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ed as a car@@ to@@ onis@@ t .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are r@@ ul@@ es out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t per@@ form them right , even though we are im@@ prin@@ ted at bir@@ th with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important co@@ lo@@ r in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re sup@@ posed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to we@@ ar — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our h@@ air — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the r@@ ul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly being mon@@ i@@ to@@ red by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ re@@ cted , and the pri@@ mar@@ y poli@@ c@@ e@@ men are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the tra@@ dition ."
We pas@@ s it down from generation to generation .
Not only that — we always have this v@@ ag@@ ue no@@ tion that something &apos;s expe@@ cted of us .
"And on top of all off these r@@ ul@@ es , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it pu@@ ts us in a very ten@@ u@@ ous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these r@@ ul@@ es , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite a@@ w@@ are that I &apos;m follo@@ wing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hu@@ mo@@ r ?"
H@@ u@@ mo@@ r re@@ lies on the tra@@ ditions of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it tw@@ is@@ ts it ."
"It takes the co@@ des of behavi@@ or and the co@@ des of dre@@ ss , and it makes it un@@ expe@@ cted , and that &apos;s what e@@ li@@ c@@ its a lau@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and hu@@ mo@@ r ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground flo@@ or , and we know the tra@@ ditions so well , we can bring a different vo@@ ice to the table ."
Now I started dra@@ wing in the middle of a lot of cha@@ os .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ during the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts movement , the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ations , the W@@ a@@ ter@@ g@@ ate hear@@ ings and then the fe@@ min@@ is@@ t movement , and I think I was dra@@ wing , trying to figu@@ re out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in cha@@ os , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with l@@ aughter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y par@@ ents got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced , and my sis@@ ter was ar@@ res@@ ted ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar high he@@ el@@ s , I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar pin@@ k , and I could feel like I f@@ it in ."
"Now when I was a little older , in my 20@@ s , I re@@ alized there are not many women in car@@ to@@ on@@ ing ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can bre@@ ak the little g@@ las@@ s c@@ ei@@ ling of car@@ to@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I be@@ came a car@@ to@@ onis@@ t ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always loved political car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the con@@ tent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the stu@@ pi@@ d r@@ ul@@ es that we &apos;re follo@@ wing as well as lau@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spe@@ ctive is a partic@@ ularly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spe@@ ctive is a partic@@ ularly American per@@ spe@@ ctive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ ven though I &apos;ve tra@@ ve@@ led a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the r@@ ul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are univers@@ al , of course — that each culture has its different co@@ des of behavi@@ or and dre@@ ss and tra@@ ditions , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ tly , we have ."
"W@@ omen , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tra@@ dition ."
We have a@@ maz@@ ing an@@ ten@@ na@@ e .
"Now my work la@@ tely has been to col@@ lab@@ or@@ ate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ onis@@ ts , which I so en@@ j@@ oy , and it &apos;s given me a grea@@ ter ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tru@@ th , to get at the is@@ su@@ es quickly and succ@@ in@@ c@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the intel@@ le@@ ct , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has allowed me to col@@ lab@@ or@@ ate with women car@@ to@@ onis@@ ts from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ b@@ ia , I@@ ran , T@@ ur@@ ke@@ y , A@@ r@@ gen@@ ti@@ na , F@@ ran@@ ce — and we have s@@ at together and l@@ augh@@ ed and tal@@ ked and sh@@ ar@@ ed our difficul@@ ties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their vo@@ ic@@ es heard in some very difficult circ@@ um@@ st@@ an@@ ces .
But I feel b@@ le@@ ss@@ ed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong per@@ cep@@ tions , because of our ten@@ u@@ ous position and our ro@@ le as tra@@ di@@ tion@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to be chan@@ ge@@ -@@ ag@@ ents ."
"And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one lau@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .

But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We stu@@ m@@ b@@ led on your vi@@ de@@ o on deci@@ m@@ als , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ mi@@ tive .
And the K@@ h@@ an A@@ c@@ ade@@ my vi@@ de@@ os are there .
G@@ re@@ en means the stu@@ dent &apos;s already pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
What are the mess@@ ages we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this clas@@ s together .
W@@ omen do not ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate for themselves in the work@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; I@@ f you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got lu@@ c@@ k@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ oy , it ma@@ t@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone lik@@ ed H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the com@@ plic@@ ation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ ll@@ is R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people con@@ sider an un@@ u@@ su@@ al fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it feel@@ s natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the mor@@ ning of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had peris@@ hed yet until 3@@ 6 h@@ ours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were af@@ ra@@ id of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my h@@ usb@@ and , O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sho@@ ck , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sho@@ ck , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble ex@@ plo@@ sion in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not ven@@ ge@@ ful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Z@@ ac@@ ar@@ ias M@@ ou@@ ss@@ a@@ ou@@ i was in@@ dic@@ ted on six coun@@ ts of con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy to comm@@ it ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , and the U.S. govern@@ ment called for a death pen@@ al@@ ty for him , if con@@ vi@@ cted , my h@@ usb@@ and and I spo@@ ke out in op@@ position to that , publi@@ c@@ ly ."
"Th@@ ro@@ u@@ gh that and through human ri@@ ghts groups , we were bro@@ ught together with se@@ ver@@ al other vic@@ tim@@ s &apos; fami@@ lies ."
"When I saw A@@ ich@@ a in the me@@ dia , coming over when her son was in@@ dic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a bra@@ ve woman ."
S@@ ome@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m st@@ ron@@ ger . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep gri@@ ef ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the st@@ r@@ eng@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a vic@@ ti@@ m , I got im@@ me@@ dia@@ te sym@@ path@@ y ."
"But when people learned what her son was ac@@ c@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ path@@ y ."
But her suf@@ fer@@ ing is equal to min@@ e .
"So we me@@ t in No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ ich@@ a will now tell you how that came about ."
"( T@@ ran@@ s@@ la@@ tor ) A@@ ich@@ a el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : Go@@ od af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ dies and gen@@ t@@ le@@ men ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ar@@ ias M@@ ou@@ ss@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the O@@ rg@@ an@@ iz@@ ation of H@@ u@@ man R@@ i@@ ghts to put me in to@@ u@@ ch with the par@@ ents of the vic@@ tim@@ s .
So they in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed me to five fami@@ lies .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ ll@@ is , and I w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , sis@@ ters ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suf@@ fer@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was marri@@ ed when I was 14 .
"I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 1@@ 6 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ar@@ ias was too much really .
"And I still suf@@ fer , because my son is like he &apos;s bu@@ ri@@ ed ali@@ ve ."
I know she really cri@@ ed for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s ali@@ ve . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tor@@ tured .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suf@@ fer@@ ing is something positive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be h@@ and@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m ."
"I go to schools to talk to young , M@@ us@@ li@@ m girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be marri@@ ed against their will very young ."
"So if I can s@@ ave one of the young girls , and av@@ oi@@ d that they get marri@@ ed and suf@@ fer as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in fron@@ t of you .
"P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ ich@@ a , star@@ ting with that day we had our very first me@@ e@@ ting with other family mem@@ bers — which was a very p@@ riv@@ ate me@@ e@@ ting with se@@ cur@@ ity , because it was No@@ ve@@ m@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , f@@ ran@@ kly , we were af@@ ra@@ id of the super@@ -@@ pa@@ tri@@ oti@@ s@@ m of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ bers ."
But we were all so ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"B@@ e@@ fore we knew each others &apos; nam@@ es , or anything , we had em@@ bra@@ ced and w@@ ep@@ t ."
"Th@@ en we s@@ at in a circ@@ le with sup@@ port , with help , from people experien@@ ced in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"And A@@ ich@@ a started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ no@@ cent , but I want to tell you how sor@@ ry I am for what happened to your fami@@ lies ."
"I know what it is to suf@@ fer , and I feel that if there is a cri@@ me , a person should be tried fai@@ r@@ ly and p@@ un@@ is@@ hed . &quot; &quot; But she re@@ ach@@ ed out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ ak@@ er ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all conne@@ cted as human be@@ ings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three h@@ ours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d f@@ elt as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these present circ@@ um@@ st@@ an@@ ces and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had me@@ t someone with such a hard life , from such a to@@ tally different culture and environment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a spe@@ cial conne@@ ction , which I val@@ ue very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ ra@@ id of the other , but making that ste@@ p and then re@@ aliz@@ ing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ ich@@ a , do you have a couple of words for con@@ clu@@ sion ?"
Because our time is up .

"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your hear@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."

"In 200@@ 8 , C@@ y@@ cl@@ one N@@ arg@@ is de@@ vas@@ ta@@ ted M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r ."
Mil@@ lions of people were in se@@ v@@ ere need of help .
The U.@@ N. wanted to rus@@ h people and sup@@ pli@@ es to the are@@ a .
"But there were no ma@@ ps , no ma@@ ps of ro@@ ad@@ s , no ma@@ ps sho@@ wing h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als , no way for help to re@@ ach the c@@ y@@ cl@@ one vic@@ tim@@ s ."
"When we look at a ma@@ p of L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es or L@@ on@@ don , it is hard to believe that as of 200@@ 5 , only 15 percent of the world was ma@@ pped to a ge@@ o-@@ co@@ d@@ able level of de@@ tai@@ l ."
The U.@@ N. ran head@@ first into a problem that the ma@@ j@@ ority of the world &apos;s popul@@ ous fac@@ es : not having de@@ tai@@ led ma@@ ps .
But help was coming .
"A@@ t Google , 40 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers used a new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to ma@@ p 1@@ 20@@ ,000 ki@@ lo@@ me@@ ters of ro@@ ad@@ s , 3@@ ,000 h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ als , logis@@ tics and reli@@ ef poin@@ ts ."

"So , I was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the ch@@ air@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exci@@ ted to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a fantas@@ tic new treat@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exci@@ ted . I wal@@ ked with him to his of@@ fi@@ ce ."
"And he explain@@ ed to me that , when I s@@ have , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the h@@ air is , but on the right side of my face I was b@@ ad@@ ly bur@@ ned so I have no h@@ air , and this cre@@ ates l@@ ack of sym@@ me@@ try ."
And what &apos;s the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to ta@@ t@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c .
It s@@ oun@@ ded interesting . He asked me to go and s@@ have .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a strange way to s@@ have , because I thought about it and I re@@ alized that the way I was s@@ having then would be the way I would s@@ have for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the w@@ id@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his of@@ fi@@ ce , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ ek@@ s with little black d@@ ots — not very in@@ for@@ mati@@ ve ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow older and my h@@ air becomes wh@@ ite ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have las@@ ers ; we can wh@@ i@@ ten it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ cer@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the big@@ gest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ j@@ oy looking n@@ on@@ -@@ sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ ver@@ ted ple@@ asu@@ re from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have sex with you more fre@@ qu@@ en@@ tly ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very surpris@@ ing to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treat@@ ments — there were many treat@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ex@@ tent ."
But I decided not to have this treat@@ ment .
"And I went to his de@@ pu@@ ty and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Wh@@ ere was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he explain@@ ed that they have done this proc@@ e@@ du@@ re on two patients already , and they need the th@@ ir@@ d pati@@ ent for a pap@@ er they were w@@ ri@@ ting ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a sch@@ mu@@ ck .
"@@ R@@ i@@ ght , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spe@@ ctive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experi@@ ments in the la@@ b ."
"And when we ru@@ n experi@@ ments , we u@@ su@@ ally ho@@ pe that one group will be@@ have differen@@ tly than another ."
"So we had one group that I h@@ op@@ ed their perfor@@ man@@ ce would be very high , another group that I thought their perfor@@ man@@ ce would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — asi@@ de from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was sup@@ posed to have very high perfor@@ man@@ ce that was actually perfor@@ ming ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , de@@ st@@ roy@@ ing my stati@@ sti@@ cal sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of the test ."
So I looked car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years older than any@@ body else in the s@@ am@@ ple .
And I remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and d@@ run@@ k@@ en guy came one day to the la@@ b wan@@ ting to make some easy c@@ as@@ h and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ antas@@ tic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s thro@@ w him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever inclu@@ de a d@@ run@@ k@@ en guy in a s@@ am@@ ple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this d@@ run@@ k@@ en guy was not in that con@@ dition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"W@@ ould we have thro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ antas@@ tic ! What a s@@ mar@@ t guy who is perfor@@ ming this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lower , giving us even st@@ ron@@ ger stati@@ sti@@ cal results than we could ."
So we decided not to thro@@ w the guy out and to r@@ er@@ u@@ n the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experi@@ ments that we &apos;ve done on con@@ f@@ li@@ cts of inter@@ est , basically kind of bring two poin@@ ts to the for@@ eg@@ ro@@ und for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to ta@@ t@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves that get them to be b@@ lin@@ ded to reality and give us ad@@ vice that is in@@ her@@ en@@ tly bi@@ as@@ ed .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recogn@@ ize , and we see that it happens ."
"M@@ aybe we don &apos;t recogn@@ ize it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recogn@@ ize that some@@ times we too are b@@ lin@@ ded by our own in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult les@@ son to take into ac@@ coun@@ t ."
Because we don &apos;t see how con@@ f@@ li@@ cts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experi@@ ments , in my mind , I was hel@@ ping science ."
I was e@@ li@@ min@@ ating the data to get the true patter@@ n of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a k@@ night trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ fer@@ ing with the process with lots of good in@@ ten@@ tions .
"And I think the real challenge is to figu@@ re out where are the c@@ as@@ es in our lives where con@@ f@@ li@@ cts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to trust our own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion to o@@ ver@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ all@@ ing pre@@ y to these behavi@@ ors , because we can create lots of un@@ de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble circ@@ um@@ st@@ an@@ ces ."
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
"I mean , this is all very de@@ press@@ ing , right — people have con@@ f@@ li@@ cts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The positive per@@ spe@@ ctive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms of why we fai@@ l and where we fai@@ l , we can actually ho@@ pe to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the ho@@ pe . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tru@@ th of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion that inequ@@ ality is di@@ visi@@ ve and soci@@ ally cor@@ ro@@ sive has been around since before the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compar@@ e societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequ@@ ality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the lin@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you exis@@ t .
"But first , see what a mis@@ er@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a para@@ do@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy against gro@@ ss national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like Nor@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as rich as Is@@ ra@@ el , G@@ re@@ e@@ ce , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy at all .
There &apos;s no sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are ex@@ tra@@ ordinary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy ."
"Th@@ ese are small are@@ as of Eng@@ land and W@@ al@@ es — the poor@@ est on the right , the rich@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
E@@ ven the people just be@@ low the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that para@@ do@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at rel@@ ative income or social position , social sta@@ tu@@ s — where we are in rel@@ ation to each other and the si@@ ze of the g@@ ap@@ s between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely won@@ der : what happens if we wi@@ den the differences , or com@@ pre@@ ss them , make the income differences big@@ ger or sm@@ al@@ ler ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ pothe@@ tical data .
I &apos;m tak@@ ing data from the U.@@ N. — it &apos;s the same as the World B@@ ank has — on the scal@@ e of income differences in these rich developed market democra@@ ci@@ es .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much rich@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equal countries on the left — Japan , F@@ in@@ land , Nor@@ way , Swe@@ den — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more un@@ equal end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ apo@@ re — the differences are tw@@ ice as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are tw@@ ice as un@@ equal as some of the other successful market democra@@ ci@@ es ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We colle@@ cted data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social la@@ d@@ der ."
"In@@ ter@@ n@@ ation@@ ally compar@@ able data on life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy , on kids &apos; math@@ s and liter@@ ac@@ y s@@ cor@@ es , on in@@ f@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity ra@@ tes , h@@ om@@ i@@ ci@@ de ra@@ tes , pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pris@@ on , te@@ en@@ age bir@@ thra@@ tes , le@@ vel@@ s of trust , o@@ be@@ s@@ ity , mental ill@@ ness — which in st@@ and@@ ard di@@ agno@@ stic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation inclu@@ des dru@@ g and al@@ co@@ h@@ ol ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mo@@ bility ."
We put them all in one inde@@ x .
They &apos;re all w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
Wh@@ ere a country is is a sort of average s@@ cor@@ e on these things .
"And there , you see it in rel@@ ation to the measure of inequ@@ ality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sh@@ all use over and over again in the data ."
The more un@@ equal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ arily clo@@ se cor@@ rel@@ ation .
"But if you look at that same inde@@ x of health and social problems in rel@@ ation to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ ita , gro@@ ss national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ rel@@ ation any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our argu@@ ment and just man@@ u@@ fac@@ tured this evidence , so we also did a pap@@ er in the Bri@@ tis@@ h Me@@ di@@ cal J@@ ourn@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F inde@@ x of child well-being ."
It has 40 different com@@ pon@@ ents put together by other people .
"It con@@ tain@@ s whether kids can talk to their par@@ ents , whether they have bo@@ o@@ ks at home , what im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation ra@@ tes are like , whether there &apos;s b@@ ul@@ ly@@ ing at school ."
E@@ very@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in rel@@ ation to that same measure of inequ@@ ality .
K@@ i@@ ds do worse in the more un@@ equal societies .
H@@ i@@ gh@@ ly sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in rel@@ ation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not de@@ pen@@ dent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in poor@@ er countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differences between us and where we are in rel@@ ation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate b@@ its of our inde@@ x .
"@@ Here , for in@@ st@@ ance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tr@@ us@@ ted .
It comes from the World V@@ al@@ ues S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more un@@ equal end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equal societies , it ris@@ es to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at me@@ as@@ ures of in@@ vol@@ ve@@ ment in comm@@ unity life or social cap@@ ital , very si@@ mil@@ ar relation@@ shi@@ ps clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ lated to inequ@@ ality ."
"I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate test b@@ ed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American states — asking just the same question : do the more un@@ equal states do worse on all these kinds of me@@ as@@ ures ?"
So here is trust from a gener@@ al social sur@@ v@@ ey of the fe@@ der@@ al govern@@ ment re@@ lated to inequ@@ ality .
V@@ ery si@@ mil@@ ar s@@ c@@ at@@ ter over a si@@ mil@@ ar ran@@ ge of le@@ vel@@ s of trust .
S@@ ame thing is going on .
B@@ as@@ ically we found that almost anything that &apos;s re@@ lated to trust inter@@ n@@ ation@@ ally is re@@ lated to trust a@@ mon@@ g@@ st the 50 states in that s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate test b@@ ed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a flu@@ ke .
This is mental ill@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together fi@@ g@@ ures using the same di@@ agno@@ stic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom s@@ am@@ pl@@ es of the population to al@@ low us to compar@@ e ra@@ tes of mental ill@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental ill@@ ness in the prec@@ e@@ ding year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental ill@@ ness of others .
"And again , clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ lated to inequ@@ ality ."
This is violence .
"Th@@ ese red d@@ ots are American states , and the b@@ lu@@ e tri@@ ang@@ les are C@@ ana@@ di@@ an pro@@ vin@@ ces ."
But look at the scal@@ e of the differences .
It goes from 15 h@@ om@@ i@@ ci@@ des per million up to 150 .
This is the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pris@@ on .
"There &apos;s a about a ten@@ f@@ old difference there , lo@@ g scal@@ e up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pris@@ on .
That relation@@ ship is not main@@ ly d@@ riv@@ en by more cri@@ me .
"In some plac@@ es , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ uni@@ tive sen@@ ten@@ cing , har@@ sh@@ er sen@@ ten@@ cing ."
And the more un@@ equal societies are more lik@@ ely also to re@@ tain the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
Here we have children dro@@ p@@ ping out of high school .
"A@@ g@@ ain , quite big differences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ arily da@@ mag@@ ing , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mo@@ bility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mo@@ bility based on income .
"B@@ as@@ ically , it &apos;s asking : do rich f@@ ath@@ ers have rich s@@ ons and poor f@@ ath@@ ers have poor s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more un@@ equal end , f@@ ath@@ ers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ can@@ din@@ a@@ vi@@ an countries , f@@ ath@@ ers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the au@@ dience here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ic@@ s here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that tend to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are en@@ d@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are worse in more un@@ equal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the ex@@ pen@@ se , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two poin@@ ts .
"One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , wh@@ ate@@ ver the out@@ come , seem to be the more un@@ equal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nor@@ di@@ c countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ fun@@ ction re@@ lated to inequ@@ ality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , Swe@@ den and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways ."
"The position of women , how clo@@ se@@ ly they keep to the nu@@ cle@@ ar family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the po@@ les in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their grea@@ ter equ@@ ality .
"S@@ we@@ den has hu@@ ge differences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it n@@ arro@@ ws the g@@ ap through tax@@ ation , gener@@ al wel@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous ben@@ ef@@ its and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much sm@@ al@@ ler differences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lower tax@@ es .
It has a sm@@ al@@ ler wel@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our anal@@ y@@ sis of the American states , we find rather the same con@@ tr@@ ast ."
"There are some states that do well through re@@ dis@@ tribu@@ tion , some states that do well because they have sm@@ al@@ ler income differences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ clu@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your grea@@ ter equ@@ ality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about per@@ fect equ@@ ality , I &apos;m talking about what exis@@ ts in rich developed market democra@@ ci@@ es ."
A@@ no@@ ther really surpris@@ ing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are af@@ fe@@ cted by inequ@@ ality .
There seems to be some tru@@ th in Joh@@ n D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ land . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to compar@@ e how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s in@@ f@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity .
S@@ ome Swe@@ des very kin@@ dly clas@@ si@@ fied a lot of their in@@ f@@ ant de@@ ath@@ s ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Bri@@ tis@@ h reg@@ is@@ ter of gener@@ al soci@@ o@@ economic clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation .
"And so it &apos;s ana@@ chron@@ is@@ tically a clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ation by f@@ ath@@ ers &apos; occ@@ up@@ ations , so single par@@ ents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social clas@@ s , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ il@@ led man@@ u@@ al occ@@ up@@ ations ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the sk@@ il@@ led man@@ u@@ al occ@@ up@@ ations in the middle , then the j@@ uni@@ or n@@ on@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ al , going up high to the profes@@ si@@ onal occ@@ up@@ ations — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , di@@ rec@@ tors of lar@@ ger compan@@ ies ."
You see there that Swe@@ den does better than B@@ rit@@ ain all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y .
The big@@ gest differences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small ben@@ ef@@ it to being in a more equal society ."
We show that on about five different se@@ ts of data co@@ ver@@ ing educ@@ ational out@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ n@@ ation@@ ally .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that grea@@ ter equ@@ ality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some ben@@ ef@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial ef@@ fe@@ cts of inequ@@ ality .
"M@@ or@@ e to do with feel@@ ings of su@@ peri@@ ority and in@@ fer@@ i@@ ority , of being val@@ u@@ ed and de@@ val@@ u@@ ed , re@@ spe@@ cted and dis@@ re@@ spe@@ cted ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the sta@@ tu@@ s com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that comes out of that d@@ ri@@ ves the con@@ su@@ mer@@ is@@ m in our society ."
It also lead@@ s to sta@@ tu@@ s in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed and seen by others , whether we &apos;re reg@@ ar@@ ded as at@@ tra@@ ctive , cle@@ ver , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments ."
"In@@ ter@@ es@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , some par@@ al@@ le@@ l work going on in social psycho@@ logy : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different studies in which vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been in@@ vi@@ ted into a psy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal lab@@ ora@@ tory and had their stre@@ ss h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing stre@@ ss@@ ful tas@@ ks , measu@@ red ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interes@@ ted in see@@ ing is what kind of stre@@ ss@@ es most reli@@ ably ra@@ ise le@@ vel@@ s of cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , the cen@@ tral stre@@ ss h@@ orm@@ one ."
And the con@@ clu@@ sion was it was tas@@ ks that inclu@@ ded soci@@ al-@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ a@@ ts to self-@@ es@@ te@@ e@@ m or social sta@@ tu@@ s in which others can neg@@ ati@@ vely j@@ u@@ dge your perfor@@ man@@ ce .
Th@@ ose kind of stre@@ ss@@ es have a very particular ef@@ fect on the physi@@ o@@ logy of stre@@ ss .
Now we have been cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surpris@@ ing ."
"I should tell you though that when people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pic@@ k and cho@@ ose data ."
"We have an ab@@ solu@@ te ru@@ le that if our data s@@ our@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ y@@ sis ."
"O@@ ur data s@@ our@@ ce deci@@ des whether it &apos;s reli@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise that would in@@ tro@@ duce b@@ ias .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in rel@@ ation to income and equ@@ ality in the acade@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed journ@@ als .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , h@@ id@@ ing a very simple de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequ@@ ality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we contro@@ l for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ ita doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated me@@ tho@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for po@@ ver@@ ty and education and so on ."
What about c@@ au@@ s@@ ality ?
C@@ or@@ rel@@ ation in itself doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve c@@ au@@ s@@ ality .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And inde@@ ed , people know the c@@ au@@ s@@ al lin@@ ks quite well in some of these out@@ comes ."
"The big change in our understanding of d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s of chron@@ ic health in the rich developed world is how important chron@@ ic stre@@ ss from social s@@ our@@ ces is af@@ fe@@ c@@ ting the im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cu@@ lar system ."
"O@@ r for in@@ st@@ ance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more un@@ equal societies is because people are sen@@ si@@ tive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the po@@ st@@ -@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ stra@@ in income , the b@@ on@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our b@@ os@@ ses ac@@ coun@@ table to their em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es in any way we can .
I think the tak@@ e-@@ home message though is that we can impro@@ ve the real qu@@ ality of human life by re@@ duc@@ ing the differences in in@@ comes between us .
"S@@ u@@ d@@ den@@ ly we have a h@@ and@@ le on the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial well-being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exci@@ ting ."
Thank you .

"The human part of this b@@ ran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interes@@ ted in ."
We b@@ ran@@ ch off of a common an@@ c@@ es@@ tor to modern ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
"In the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different speci@@ es of h@@ om@@ in@@ i@@ ds ."

"It may seem like we &apos;re quite re@@ m@@ ote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the bas@@ ic mach@@ in@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same ."

"I be@@ came en@@ a@@ mor@@ ed of the power of evolution , and I re@@ alized something very fun@@ da@@ mental : in most of the exis@@ t@@ ence of life in sing@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led organis@@ ms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the gen@@ e@@ tic energy of that cell is car@@ ri@@ ed on in both daughter cells ."
"But at the time multi@@ -@@ cel@@ led organis@@ ms come on@@ line , things start to change ."
S@@ ex@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion en@@ ters the picture .
"And very impor@@ tan@@ tly , with the in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion of sex@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion that pas@@ ses on the gen@@ ome , the rest of the body becomes ex@@ pen@@ d@@ able ."
"In fact , you could say that the in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ility of the death of our bo@@ dies en@@ ters in evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary time at the same moment as sex@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"Now I have to con@@ f@@ ess , when I was a college under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate , I thought , o@@ kay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex — it see@@ med pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , I &apos;ve come to have increas@@ ing d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts ."
"I &apos;ve come to understand the senti@@ ments of Ge@@ or@@ ge B@@ ur@@ ns , who was perfor@@ ming still in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s ."
"And one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his h@@ ot@@ el room do@@ or ."
He ans@@ w@@ ers the do@@ or .
"S@@ tan@@ ding before him is a gor@@ ge@@ ous , s@@ c@@ anti@@ ly c@@ la@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl ."
"She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for su@@ per sex . &quot;"
"&quot; That &apos;s fin@@ e , &quot; says Ge@@ or@@ ge , &quot; I &apos;ll take the s@@ ou@@ p . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) I came to re@@ aliz@@ e , as a physi@@ ci@@ an , that I was working to@@ ward a go@@ al which was different from the go@@ al of evolution — not nec@@ ess@@ arily con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tory , just different ."
I was trying to pre@@ serve the body .
I wanted to keep us heal@@ thy .
I wanted to re@@ sto@@ re health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and heal@@ thy lives .
"E@@ vol@@ ution is all about pas@@ sing on the gen@@ ome to the next generation , ad@@ ap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation ."
"F@@ rom an evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary point of view , you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts design@@ ed to sen@@ d the gen@@ e@@ tic pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the se@@ a ."
"I think we would all understand the senti@@ ment that W@@ o@@ o@@ dy Al@@ le@@ n ex@@ press@@ ed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achi@@ eve im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity through my work ."
I want to achi@@ eve it through not dy@@ ing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ vol@@ ution does not nec@@ ess@@ arily fav@@ or the lon@@ ge@@ st@@ -@@ li@@ ved .
"It doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ arily fav@@ or the big@@ gest or the st@@ ron@@ gest or the fas@@ test , and not even the s@@ mar@@ test ."
E@@ vol@@ ution fav@@ ors those cre@@ atures best ad@@ ap@@ ted to their environment .
That is the sol@@ e test of survi@@ val and success .
"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the o@@ c@@ ean , bac@@ ter@@ ia that are thermo@@ ph@@ ili@@ c and can survi@@ ve at the ste@@ am v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise produce , if f@@ ish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de coo@@ ked f@@ ish , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able environment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of human@@ s in evolution , and partic@@ ularly as we look a@@ head to the next ph@@ ase , I would say that there are a number of possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ ipo@@ ise .
"And the reas@@ on@@ ing behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pre@@ serve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise be se@@ le@@ cted out and be re@@ mo@@ ved from the population ."
"And secon@@ dly , we as a speci@@ es have so con@@ figu@@ red our environment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it ad@@ ap@@ t to us as well as we ad@@ ap@@ t to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gra@@ te and cir@@ cu@@ late and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is nec@@ ess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possi@@ bility is that there will be evolution of the tra@@ di@@ tional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the argu@@ ment here would be that the wh@@ e@@ el@@ s of evolution g@@ rin@@ d s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able ."
"And as far as is@@ ol@@ ation goes , when we as a speci@@ es do col@@ on@@ ize dis@@ tant planets , there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environ@@ mental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a th@@ ir@@ d possi@@ bility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possi@@ bility ."
"I call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ ide@@ d and ch@@ os@@ en by us as individu@@ als in the cho@@ ic@@ es that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ sider , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ ic@@ es about their of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more mal@@ es than fe@@ mal@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ arily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individu@@ al and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to cho@@ ose , not simply to cho@@ ose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the gen@@ e@@ tic ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ments that would cu@@ re or pre@@ v@@ ent dis@@ eas@@ es ."
What if you could make the gen@@ e@@ tic changes to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate diabe@@ tes or Al@@ z@@ h@@ ei@@ mer &apos;s or re@@ duce the ris@@ k of can@@ cer or e@@ li@@ min@@ ate stro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome Pro@@ ject started in 19@@ 90 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ is@@ hed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"T@@ o@@ day , you can have a comple@@ te se@@ qu@@ ence of the three billion b@@ ase pair@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ dol@@ lar human gen@@ ome , and it will be increas@@ ing@@ ly av@@ a@@ il@@ able for everyone ."
"@@ Just a week ago , the N@@ ational A@@ c@@ ade@@ my of En@@ gine@@ ering a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ rap@@ er P@@ riz@@ e to F@@ ran@@ c@@ is A@@ r@@ no@@ ld and W@@ il@@ le@@ m S@@ tem@@ mer , two scienti@@ sts who inde@@ pen@@ den@@ tly developed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work fas@@ ter and to le@@ ad to de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble prote@@ ins in a more ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent way — what F@@ ran@@ ces A@@ r@@ no@@ ld c@@ all@@ s &quot; &quot; di@@ re@@ cted evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the L@@ as@@ ker P@@ riz@@ e was a@@ war@@ ded to the scienti@@ st S@@ hin@@ y@@ a Y@@ a@@ man@@ aka for his research in which he took an ad@@ ul@@ t sk@@ in cell , a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , and by man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating just four gen@@ es , he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to re@@ ver@@ t to a pl@@ u@@ ri@@ po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al stem cell — a cell po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally cap@@ ab@@ le@@ "
of be@@ coming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in bac@@ ter@@ ia can make vi@@ rus@@ es that will not only prote@@ ct you against themselves , but in@@ duce im@@ m@@ unity against other vi@@ rus@@ es ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ eve it or not , there &apos;s an experi@@ mental tri@@ al going on with v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine against in@@ flu@@ en@@ za that has been gro@@ wn in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ c@@ o pl@@ ant ."
Can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ c@@ o ?
"Th@@ ese are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be e@@ ver@@ more possible ."
I@@ ma@@ gine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ed eg@@ g , and give your of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring a better chan@@ ce at a heal@@ th@@ i@@ er life — e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the diabe@@ tes , e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the he@@ mo@@ ph@@ ilia , re@@ duce the ris@@ k of can@@ cer ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want heal@@ th@@ i@@ er children ?
"And then , that same anal@@ y@@ tic technology , that same en@@ gine of science that can produce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also en@@ able us to a@@ do@@ p@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ iti@@ es — that better memor@@ y ."
"Wh@@ y not have the quic@@ k w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next generation of the W@@ at@@ son machine ?"
Why not have the quic@@ k tw@@ it@@ ch mus@@ c@@ le that will en@@ able you to ru@@ n fas@@ ter and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a position where we can pas@@ s it on to the next generation , and we can a@@ do@@ p@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will have con@@ ver@@ ted ol@@ d@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that nor@@ m@@ ally might re@@ qui@@ re 100@@ ,000 years , and we can com@@ pre@@ ss it down to a thous@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"Th@@ ese are cho@@ ic@@ es that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"W@@ ill we use these cho@@ ic@@ es to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?"
"O@@ r , will we se@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ vely cho@@ ose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more ro@@ b@@ ust and more vers@@ ati@@ le ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most prof@@ oun@@ dly of all , will we ever be able to develo@@ p the w@@ is@@ dom , and to in@@ her@@ it the w@@ is@@ dom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ ic@@ es w@@ is@@ ely ?"
"For better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these cho@@ ic@@ es will be up to us ."
Thank you .

"One thing the world needs , one thing this country des@@ per@@ a@@ tely needs is a better way of conduc@@ ting our political de@@ b@@ ates ."
We need to re@@ disco@@ ver the lost ar@@ t of democra@@ tic argu@@ ment .
I have a sug@@ g@@ es@@ tion .
But we too r@@ are@@ ly ar@@ tic@@ u@@ late and de@@ f@@ end and argu@@ e about those big moral questions in our poli@@ tics .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion .
"F@@ irst , let me take a fam@@ ous ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er who wrote about those questions of j@@ ustice and mor@@ ality , give you a very sh@@ or@@ t le@@ cture on Aristo@@ tle of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ then@@ s , Aristo@@ tle &apos;s theory of j@@ ustice , and then have a dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion here to see whether Aristo@@ tle &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and argu@@ e about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the le@@ cture ?"
"A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to Aristo@@ tle , j@@ ustice means giving people what they de@@ serve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the le@@ cture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions beg@@ in when it comes to argu@@ ing about who de@@ ser@@ ves what and why .
T@@ ake the example of flu@@ tes .
S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;re dis@@ tribu@@ ting flu@@ tes .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best flu@@ te ?
You can just call it out .
( Au@@ dience : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ ich@@ a@@ el S@@ an@@ de@@ l : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
O@@ r by the first person to rus@@ h into the h@@ all to get them .
How many say the best flu@@ te play@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best flu@@ tes should go to the best flu@@ te play@@ ers ?"
P@@ e@@ ter : The grea@@ test ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
MS : The grea@@ test ben@@ ef@@ it to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best flu@@ tes should go to the best flu@@ te play@@ ers .
That &apos;s P@@ e@@ ter ? ( Au@@ dience : P@@ e@@ ter . ) MS : A@@ ll right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is play@@ ed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble music .
"But P@@ e@@ ter , Aristo@@ tle doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
Aristo@@ tle had a different reason for saying the best flu@@ tes should go to the best flu@@ te play@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just dis@@ tribu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and some@@ times argu@@ e about , the pur@@ pose of the thing , or the social acti@@ vity — in this case , mu@@ si@@ cal perfor@@ man@@ ce ."
"And the point , the essenti@@ al nature , of mu@@ si@@ cal perfor@@ man@@ ce is to produce ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ pro@@ du@@ ct that we &apos;ll all ben@@ ef@@ it .
"But when we think about j@@ ustice , Aristo@@ tle says , what we really need to think about is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question and the qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es that are wor@@ th h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ mi@@ ring and recogn@@ iz@@ ing ."
"Now , flu@@ tes may seem ... the dis@@ tribu@@ tion of flu@@ tes may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al case ."
Let &apos;s take a con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example of the dis@@ pu@@ te about j@@ ustice .
It had to do with golf .
"C@@ as@@ ey Martin — a few years ago , C@@ as@@ ey Martin — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good g@@ ol@@ fer , but he had a dis@@ ab@@ ility ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a cir@@ cu@@ la@@ tory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ri@@ ed ris@@ k of in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the Pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ onal G@@ ol@@ fer@@ s &apos; A@@ s@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a golf cart in the P@@ G@@ A to@@ ur@@ na@@ ments ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fai@@ r ad@@ van@@ t@@ age . &quot; &quot; He su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the la@@ w says that the dis@@ ab@@ led must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ated , pro@@ vi@@ ded the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dation does not change the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great g@@ ol@@ fer ."
I want to com@@ pete .
But I need a golf cart to get from one h@@ ole to the next . &quot; &quot; S@@ up@@ pose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
S@@ up@@ pose you were deci@@ ding the j@@ ustice of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ as@@ ey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"All right , let &apos;s take a po@@ ll , show of hands ."
How many would ru@@ le in fav@@ or of C@@ as@@ ey Martin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"All right , we have a good di@@ vision of op@@ in@@ ion here ."
"S@@ ome@@ one who would not g@@ r@@ ant C@@ as@@ ey Martin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ?"
"@@ R@@ a@@ ise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a mi@@ cro@@ ph@@ one ."
( Au@@ dience : It &apos;d be an un@@ fai@@ r ad@@ van@@ t@@ age . ) MS : It would be an un@@ fai@@ r ad@@ van@@ t@@ age if he gets to ri@@ de in a golf cart .
"All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart wor@@ ry about an un@@ fai@@ r ad@@ van@@ t@@ age ."
How would you answer the ob@@ je@@ ction ?
"Y@@ es , all right ."
Au@@ dience : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
Char@@ li@@ e : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : But what about walking from h@@ ole to h@@ ole ?
Char@@ li@@ e : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
MS : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the game of golf ?
"@@ Char@@ li@@ e : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : A@@ ll right . Sta@@ y there , Char@@ li@@ e ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for Char@@ li@@ e ?
"All right , who has an answer for Char@@ li@@ e ?"
What would you say ?
"Au@@ dience : The en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce ele@@ ment is a very important part of the game , walking all those h@@ oles ."
MS : W@@ al@@ king all those h@@ oles ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ( Au@@ dience : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . ) MS : What &apos;s your name ? ( Au@@ dience : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n . ) MS : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"@@ Char@@ li@@ e , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ re@@ n ?"
Char@@ ley : I &apos;ll sti@@ ck to my or@@ ig@@ in@@ al the@@ sis .
W@@ ar@@ re@@ n : I am not a g@@ ol@@ fer .
"@@ Char@@ ley : And I am . ( MS : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lower cour@@ t , they bro@@ ught in g@@ ol@@ f@@ ing grea@@ ts to te@@ sti@@ f@@ y on this very issue ."
I@@ s walking the course essenti@@ al to the game ?
And they bro@@ ught in J@@ ack N@@ ic@@ kl@@ au@@ s and A@@ r@@ no@@ ld P@@ al@@ mer .
And what do you sup@@ pose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"They said , y@@ es , walking the course is st@@ ren@@ u@@ ous physical exer@@ c@@ ise ."
The f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e fac@@ tor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fun@@ da@@ mental nature of the game to give him the golf cart .
"Now , no@@ tice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you sup@@ pose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ as@@ ey Martin must be pro@@ vi@@ ded a golf cart ."
"S@@ even to two , they ru@@ led ."
"What was interesting about their r@@ ul@@ ing and about the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion about the right , the j@@ ustice , of the matter de@@ pen@@ ded on fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out what is the essenti@@ al nature of golf ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And J@@ ustice S@@ te@@ ven@@ s , w@@ ri@@ ting for the ma@@ j@@ ority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essenti@@ al point of the game is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a h@@ ole in as few stro@@ kes as possible , and that walking was not essenti@@ al , but in@@ ci@@ den@@ tal ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ sen@@ ters , one of wh@@ om was J@@ ustice S@@ cal@@ ia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gran@@ ted the cart , and he had a very interesting dis@@ s@@ ent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ je@@ cted the Aristo@@ te@@ li@@ an pre@@ mis@@ e under@@ ly@@ ing the ma@@ j@@ ority &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; To say that something is essenti@@ al is ordin@@ arily to say that it is nec@@ ess@@ ary to the achi@@ ev@@ ement of a certain ob@@ ject .
J@@ ustice S@@ cal@@ ia &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion is ques@@ tion@@ able for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , no real s@@ por@@ ts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ f we had thought that the r@@ ul@@ es of the s@@ por@@ ts we care about are mer@@ ely ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary , rather than design@@ ed to call for@@ th the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ es and the ex@@ cel@@ len@@ ces that we think are wor@@ thy of ad@@ mi@@ ring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the out@@ come of the game ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ je@@ c@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it see@@ med to be — this de@@ b@@ ate about the golf cart — an argu@@ ment about fai@@ r@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fai@@ r ad@@ van@@ t@@ age ."
"But if fai@@ r@@ ness were the only thing at st@@ ake , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous sol@@ ution ."
"But le@@ tting everyone ri@@ de in a cart would have been , I su@@ spe@@ ct , more ana@@ thema to the g@@ ol@@ f@@ ing grea@@ ts and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ as@@ ey Martin ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as de@@ li@@ ca@@ tely as possible : G@@ ol@@ fer@@ s are a little sen@@ si@@ tive about the ath@@ le@@ tic sta@@ tu@@ s of their game .
"( Laughter ) Af@@ ter all , there &apos;s no run@@ ning or j@@ um@@ ping , and the b@@ all st@@ ands still . ( Laughter )"
"So if g@@ ol@@ f@@ ing is the kind of game that can be play@@ ed while ri@@ ding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to con@@ fer on the g@@ ol@@ f@@ ing grea@@ ts the sta@@ tu@@ s that we con@@ fer , the h@@ onor and re@@ cognition that goes to truly great ath@@ le@@ tes ."
"That il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tes that with golf , as with flu@@ tes , it &apos;s hard to deci@@ de the question of what j@@ ustice re@@ qui@@ res , without grap@@ pl@@ ing with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essenti@@ al nature of the acti@@ vity in question , and what qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es , what ex@@ cel@@ len@@ ces conne@@ cted with that acti@@ vity , are wor@@ thy of h@@ onor and re@@ cognition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fin@@ al example that &apos;s pro@@ min@@ ent in con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary political de@@ b@@ ate : sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
"There are those who fav@@ or state re@@ cognition only of tra@@ di@@ tional marri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fav@@ or state re@@ cognition of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ."
How many here fav@@ or the first poli@@ cy : the state should recogn@@ ize tra@@ di@@ tional marri@@ age only ?
"And how many fav@@ or the second , sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ pon@@ ents of sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age say that the pur@@ pose of marri@@ age , fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ thy of h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and recogn@@ iz@@ ing and en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ing ."
"So with flu@@ tes , with golf car@@ ts , and even with a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely con@@ tes@@ ted question like sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age , Aristo@@ tle has a point ."
V@@ ery hard to argu@@ e about j@@ ustice without first argu@@ ing about the pur@@ pose of social in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions and about what qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es are wor@@ thy of h@@ onor and re@@ cognition .
"So let &apos;s ste@@ p back from these c@@ as@@ es and see how they sh@@ ed light on the way we might impro@@ ve , ele@@ v@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a ten@@ den@@ cy to think that if we eng@@ age too di@@ rec@@ tly with moral questions in poli@@ tics , that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement , and for that matter , a re@@ ci@@ pe for in@@ tol@@ er@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on ."
"So better to sh@@ y away from , to ig@@ nor@@ e , the moral and the religi@@ ous con@@ vic@@ tions that people bring to civi@@ c life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to beg@@ in to re@@ sto@@ re the ar@@ t of democra@@ tic argu@@ ment ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Th@@ ank you very much . Th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you . Ch@@ ris . Th@@ an@@ ks , Ch@@ ris . Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : F@@ rom flu@@ tes to golf cour@@ s@@ es@@ "
to sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex marri@@ age — that was a gen@@ i@@ us lin@@ k .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of op@@ en education ."
Y@@ our le@@ cture ser@@ ies was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next ph@@ ase of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ vers@@ ation , in@@ vi@@ ting questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ in@@ ing in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ i@@ ght . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong B@@ each , and we do it in a clas@@ s@@ room at H@@ ar@@ var@@ d with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and argu@@ ing , eng@@ ag@@ ing ser@@ i@@ ously with big moral questions , explor@@ ing cul@@ tural differences and conne@@ ct through a live vi@@ de@@ o ho@@ ok@@ up , students in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing and M@@ um@@ b@@ ai and in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge , M@@ ass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts and create a global clas@@ s@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"So I work in marke@@ ting , which I love , but my first pas@@ sion was physics , a pas@@ sion bro@@ ught to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gra@@ y h@@ air ."
So he t@@ au@@ ght me that physics is co@@ ol because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So quic@@ k show of hands — who stu@@ died some marke@@ ting in univers@@ ity ?
Wh@@ o stu@@ died some physics in univers@@ ity ?
P@@ re@@ tty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , ho@@ pe@@ fully this will bring back some happy , or possi@@ bly some sli@@ ghtly dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing memor@@ ies ."
"So , physics and marke@@ ting ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s La@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als mas@@ s times ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es should have stu@@ died a bit more car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly before they ran this c@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge this for@@ mu@@ la quickly , we can get to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation equ@@ als force over mas@@ s , which means that for a lar@@ ger partic@@ le — a lar@@ ger mas@@ s — it re@@ qui@@ res more force to change its di@@ re@@ ction ."
"It &apos;s the same with b@@ ran@@ ds : the more mas@@ sive a brand , the more b@@ ag@@ g@@ age it has , the more force is needed to change its posi@@ tion@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why A@@ r@@ thu@@ r An@@ der@@ s@@ en cho@@ se to lau@@ n@@ ch A@@ c@@ cen@@ ture rather than try to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the world that An@@ der@@ s@@ en &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ coun@@ tan@@ cy .
"It explain@@ s why H@@ o@@ over found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the world that it was more than v@@ ac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers , and why compan@@ ies like Uni@@ le@@ ver and P &@@ am@@ p@@ ; G keep b@@ ran@@ ds s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ rin@@ g@@ les and D@@ ove rather than having one gi@@ ant par@@ ent brand ."
"The marke@@ ting is , the big@@ ger a brand , the more difficult it is to re@@ position it ."
So think about a por@@ t@@ fo@@ lio of b@@ ran@@ ds or maybe new b@@ ran@@ ds for new ven@@ tures .
"Now , who remem@@ bers H@@ eis@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty princi@@ ple ?"
Ge@@ tting a little more tech@@ ni@@ cal now .
"So this says that it &apos;s im@@ possible , by defin@@ i@@ tion , to measure exactly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the position — and the mo@@ men@@ tum of a partic@@ le , because the act of me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing it , by defin@@ i@@ tion , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an ele@@ men@@ tar@@ y partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the ph@@ o@@ ton of light has mo@@ men@@ tum , which kno@@ c@@ ks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing it , the act of measu@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of observ@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marke@@ ting .
"So with the act of ob@@ ser@@ ving con@@ su@@ mer@@ s , changes their behavi@@ or ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mo@@ ms who are talking about their wonderful children in a foc@@ us group , and almost n@@ one of them buy lots of j@@ un@@ k fo@@ od ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s sel@@ ls hundre@@ ds of mil@@ lions of bur@@ g@@ ers every year ."
"Y@@ et , at Google , we know it &apos;s the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one se@@ arch@@ ed for ca@@ te@@ gor@@ y ."
"So lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , the science — no , sor@@ ry — the marke@@ ting is getting eas@@ i@@ er ."
"@@ L@@ u@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , with now better poin@@ t@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ s@@ al@@ e tra@@ c@@ king , more dig@@ ital me@@ dia con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , you can measure more what con@@ su@@ mer@@ s actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never accu@@ ra@@ tely and exactly measure a partic@@ le , because the observ@@ ation changes it ."
"The marke@@ ting is — the message for marke@@ ting is — that try to measure what con@@ su@@ mer@@ s actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can g@@ a@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ pothe@@ sis or a posi@@ tion@@ ing , and it will st@@ r@@ eng@@ then it , but it will not con@@ clu@@ si@@ vely pro@@ ve it ."
And only one con@@ tr@@ ary data point can b@@ low your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ to@@ le@@ my had do@@ z@@ ens of data poin@@ ts to sup@@ port his theory that the planets would ro@@ ta@@ te around the Earth .
It only took one ro@@ b@@ ust observ@@ ation from C@@ o@@ per@@ ni@@ c@@ us to b@@ low that idea out of the water .
"T@@ ake B@@ P — they spent mil@@ lions of po@@ un@@ ds over many years building up its cre@@ den@@ ti@@ als as an environ@@ men@@ tally fri@@ en@@ dly brand , but then one little ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
Th@@ ink about T@@ oy@@ ota .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ vered as the most reli@@ able of car@@ s , and then they had the big rec@@ all in@@ ci@@ dent ."
"And T@@ ig@@ er W@@ o@@ o@@ ds , for a long time , the per@@ fect brand am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot pro@@ ve a hy@@ pothe@@ sis , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ pro@@ ve it — any hy@@ pothe@@ sis is sh@@ ak@@ y ."
"And the marke@@ ting is that not matter how much you &apos;ve inv@@ es@@ ted in your brand , one bad week can under@@ min@@ e dec@@ ades of good work ."
So be really car@@ e@@ ful to try and av@@ oi@@ d the scre@@ w@@ -@@ ups that can under@@ min@@ e your brand .
"And las@@ tly , to the sli@@ ghtly ob@@ s@@ cu@@ re world of entropy — the second la@@ w of thermo@@ dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of marke@@ ting .
"If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much contro@@ l@@ led by one marke@@ ting man@@ ag@@ er could pretty much defin@@ e a brand ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a strong brand ima@@ ge or a message and put it out there like the C@@ on@@ serv@@ ative Par@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you lo@@ se contro@@ l of it .
"W@@ ith the kind of dig@@ ital com@@ ment cre@@ ation and dis@@ tribu@@ tion to@@ ols that are av@@ a@@ il@@ able now to every con@@ su@@ mer , it &apos;s im@@ possible to contro@@ l where it goes ."
"Y@@ our brand star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more cha@@ oti@@ c . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your contro@@ l . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ ling for marke@@ ters , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This dis@@ tribu@@ tion of brand energy gets your brand clo@@ se@@ r to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this dis@@ tribu@@ tion of energy a democra@@ tiz@@ ing force , which is ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely good for your brand ."
"So , the les@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fun@@ da@@ mental la@@ w ."
The message for marke@@ ting is that your brand is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ bra@@ ce it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"We are going to take a quic@@ k voy@@ age over the cogni@@ tive history of the 20@@ th century , because during that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ tered dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
"As you all know , the car@@ s that people dro@@ ve in 19@@ 00 have al@@ tered because the ro@@ ad@@ s are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ tered , too ."
"Now , this dra@@ mati@@ c change was dra@@ wn to my at@@ ten@@ tion through mas@@ sive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . g@@ ain@@ s over time , and these have been truly mas@@ sive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts than each succ@@ e@@ e@@ ding generation back to the time that they were inven@@ ted .
"In@@ de@@ ed , if you s@@ cor@@ e the people a century ago against modern nor@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 70 ."
"If you s@@ cor@@ e us against their nor@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ is@@ ed all sor@@ ts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ me@@ dia@@ te an@@ c@@ es@@ tors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ tar@@ dation ?
Because 70 is nor@@ m@@ ally the s@@ cor@@ e for mental re@@ tar@@ dation .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the cu@@ tting line for gi@@ f@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and argu@@ e for a th@@ ir@@ d al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that &apos;s much more il@@ lu@@ min@@ ating than ei@@ ther of those , and to put this into per@@ spe@@ ctive , let &apos;s imagine that a Mar@@ ti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation ."
"And this Mar@@ ti@@ an was an arch@@ a@@ e@@ o@@ logis@@ t , and they found s@@ cor@@ es , tar@@ get s@@ cor@@ es , that people had used for sho@@ oti@@ n@@ g ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a minu@@ te , people had only put one b@@ ul@@ let in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e in a minu@@ te ."
And then about 19@@ 1@@ 8 they put a hundred b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e .
"And in@@ iti@@ ally , that arch@@ a@@ e@@ o@@ logis@@ t would be b@@ af@@ f@@ led ."
"They would say , look , these te@@ sts were design@@ ed to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their ey@@ e@@ sight was , whether they had contro@@ l of their we@@ apo@@ n ."
How could these perfor@@ man@@ ces have es@@ cal@@ ated to this en@@ orm@@ ous de@@ gre@@ e ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment that was in the hands of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was responsi@@ ble , not grea@@ ter ke@@ en@@ ness of ey@@ e or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental ar@@ ti@@ ll@@ ery that we have pic@@ ked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ ker will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ ur@@ ia ."
"He found that they were res@@ is@@ tant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ pothe@@ tical , to spe@@ cul@@ ating about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ stra@@ ctions or using logi@@ c on those ab@@ stra@@ ctions ."
Now let me give you a s@@ am@@ ple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He tal@@ ked to the head man of a person in ru@@ ral R@@ us@@ sia .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 19@@ 00 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do cro@@ ws and f@@ ish have in common ?"
"And the f@@ el@@ low said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a f@@ ish . I can &apos;t e@@ at a cro@@ w ."
A cro@@ w can pe@@ ck at a f@@ ish .
"The other is a bir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interes@@ ted , ef@@ fe@@ c@@ ti@@ vely , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And then L@@ ur@@ ia went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no ca@@ me@@ ls in Ger@@ many ."
H@@ am@@ bur@@ g is a city in Ger@@ many .
"And L@@ ur@@ ia said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words im@@ ply ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for ca@@ me@@ ls . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was un@@ w@@ ill@@ ing to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to ca@@ me@@ ls being in vill@@ ages , and he was quite un@@ able to use the hy@@ pothe@@ tical , to ask h@@ im@@ self what if there were no ca@@ me@@ ls in Ger@@ many ."
"And L@@ ur@@ ia said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the Nor@@ th P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ar@@ s are wh@@ ite ."
"What co@@ lo@@ r are the be@@ ar@@ s at the Nor@@ th P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch a thing is to be se@@ t@@ t@@ led by te@@ sti@@ mon@@ y ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ ill@@ ing to eng@@ age in this .
"One of them said to L@@ ur@@ ia , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that ar@@ en &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tions .
"F@@ irst , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ plo@@ ma ."
"That is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of forma@@ l education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experien@@ ced some ty@@ pe of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
You can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hy@@ pothe@@ ses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logi@@ c@@ ally con@@ sis@@ tent .
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 45 states that exis@@ ted at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exam@@ s that the state of O@@ h@@ io gave in 19@@ 90 , they were all about ab@@ stra@@ ctions ."
"They were things like , why is the lar@@ gest city of a state r@@ are@@ ly the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in H@@ ar@@ ris@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ h@@ il@@ adel@@ ph@@ ia .
So the ten@@ or of education has changed .
"We are educ@@ ating people to take the hy@@ pothe@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , to use ab@@ stra@@ ctions , and to lin@@ k them logi@@ c@@ ally ."
What about em@@ ploy@@ ment ?
"Well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of Americ@@ ans pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed profes@@ sions that were cogni@@ ti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding ."
O@@ n@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or doc@@ tors or teachers .
"T@@ o@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans pra@@ c@@ tice cogni@@ ti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions , not only to the profes@@ sions pro@@ per like la@@ w@@ y@@ er or doc@@ tor or scienti@@ st or le@@ ctu@@ re@@ r , but many , many sub@@ -@@ profes@@ sions having to do with being a tech@@ ni@@ ci@@ an , a computer program@@ mer ."
A whole ran@@ ge of profes@@ sions now make cogni@@ tive de@@ man@@ ds .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cogni@@ ti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions .
The profes@@ sions have been up@@ gra@@ ded .
"C@@ om@@ par@@ e the doc@@ tor in 19@@ 00 , who really had only a few tri@@ c@@ ks up his s@@ le@@ eve , with the modern gener@@ al pra@@ c@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or speci@@ alis@@ t , with years of scienti@@ fi@@ c tra@@ in@@ ing ."
They went far be@@ y@@ on@@ d that 19@@ 00 b@@ an@@ ker .
They had to get com@@ plic@@ ated C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ squ@@ ar@@ ed in order to b@@ un@@ d@@ le de@@ b@@ t together and make de@@ b@@ t look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a far@@ mer today .
I take the far@@ m man@@ ag@@ er of today as very different from the far@@ mer of 19@@ 00 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ gra@@ ding of tas@@ ks like la@@ w@@ y@@ er and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ man@@ ds on our cogni@@ tive fac@@ ul@@ ties .
But I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about education and em@@ ploy@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ ily a moral ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er .
"Now over the last century , in developed n@@ ations like America , moral de@@ b@@ ate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hy@@ pothe@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , and we also take univers@@ als ser@@ i@@ ously and look for logi@@ cal conne@@ ctions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univers@@ ity at the time of Martin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having argu@@ ments with their par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ dly ra@@ ci@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were in@@ fer@@ i@@ or .
"And when we said to our par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents , &quot; How would you feel if to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w mor@@ ning you wo@@ ke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the du@@ m@@ best thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mor@@ es and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they had in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the older generation says , well , our govern@@ ment takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their govern@@ ment to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ ill@@ ing to take the hy@@ pothe@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an Is@@ la@@ mic father wh@@ ose daughter has been rap@@ ed , and he feel@@ s he &apos;s h@@ on@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted mor@@ es .
"T@@ o@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were kno@@ c@@ ked un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous and so@@ dom@@ iz@@ ed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the Kor@@ an ."
That &apos;s not one of the princi@@ pl@@ es I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univers@@ aliz@@ e your princi@@ pl@@ es ."
You state them as ab@@ stra@@ ctions and you use logi@@ c on them .
"You have to say , well , bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of sk@@ in , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t suf@@ fer just for that ."
It must be that bl@@ ac@@ ks are some@@ how tain@@ ted .
"And you can get moral argu@@ ment off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral princi@@ pl@@ es as con@@ cre@@ te enti@@ ties ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univers@@ als , to be ren@@ der@@ ed con@@ sis@@ tent by logi@@ c ."
That &apos;s what in@@ iti@@ ally got me going on cogni@@ tive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the g@@ ain@@ s have been grea@@ test in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ at@@ ter@@ y that are about using logi@@ c on ab@@ stra@@ ctions .
"And in 19@@ 00 , people could do simple anal@@ ogi@@ es ."
"That is , if you said to them , ca@@ ts are like w@@ il@@ d@@ ca@@ ts ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 19@@ 60 , people could at@@ t@@ ack R@@ av@@ en &apos;s on a much more so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two squ@@ ar@@ es follo@@ wed by a tri@@ ang@@ le , what follo@@ ws two circ@@ les ?"
They could say a se@@ mi@@ circ@@ le .
"@@ Just as a tri@@ ang@@ le is half of a squ@@ are , a se@@ mi@@ circ@@ le is half of a circ@@ le ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , college gra@@ du@@ ates , if you said two circ@@ les follo@@ wed by a se@@ mi@@ circ@@ le , two si@@ x@@ te@@ ens follo@@ wed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 1@@ 6 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very dis@@ hear@@ ten@@ ing ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t made progress on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve no@@ tic@@ ed , in a tr@@ end a@@ mon@@ g young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about for@@ ei@@ g@@ n lan@@ ds , and they &apos;re essenti@@ ally a@@ h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal ."
They live in the bub@@ ble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the Kor@@ ean War from the war in V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ m .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time We@@ ster@@ n ar@@ mi@@ es have gone to Af@@ gh@@ anistan to put its h@@ ou@@ se in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous occ@@ asi@@ ons ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had b@@ are@@ ly left , and there wasn &apos;t a tra@@ ce in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six war@@ s .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ tic n@@ ote .
"@@ L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people b@@ a@@ thing in the Nor@@ th S@@ ea , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what wh@@ ite bo@@ dies the lower or@@ ders have ? &quot; &quot; As if they were a re@@ p@@ ti@@ le ."
"An ima@@ ge is wor@@ th more than a thous@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few ima@@ ges that I re@@ cen@@ tly cap@@ tured ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ her , as an ar@@ ti@@ st , is to bring the world of ar@@ t and science together ."
"Wh@@ ether it is an ima@@ ge of a so@@ ap bub@@ ble cap@@ tured at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ s@@ ting , as you can see in this ima@@ ge , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little be@@ ad@@ s of oil pain@@ t , strange li@@ qui@@ ds that be@@ have in very pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar ways , or pain@@ t that is mo@@ de@@ led by cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to lin@@ k those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te this based on three pro@@ jects .
The first one has to do with making sound visi@@ ble .
"Now as you may know , sound tra@@ vel@@ s in w@@ av@@ es , so if you have a speak@@ er , a speak@@ er actually does nothing else than tak@@ ing the au@@ dio sign@@ al , trans@@ form it into a vibra@@ tion , which is then trans@@ por@@ ted through the air , is cap@@ tured by our e@@ ar , and trans@@ for@@ med into an au@@ dio sign@@ al again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound w@@ av@@ es visi@@ ble ?"
So I came up with the follo@@ wing se@@ tu@@ p .
"I took a speak@@ er , I plac@@ ed a th@@ in fo@@ i@@ l of plas@@ tic on top of that speak@@ er , and then I ad@@ ded tiny little c@@ ry@@ st@@ als on top of that speak@@ er ."
"And now , if I would pl@@ ay a sound through that speak@@ er , it would cause the c@@ ry@@ st@@ als to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very fas@@ t , in the b@@ lin@@ k of an ey@@ e , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tured this mo@@ tion with a ca@@ mera that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ u@@ sic : &quot; &quot; T@@ ear@@ drop &quot; &quot; by M@@ as@@ sive A@@ t@@ t@@ ack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty a@@ maz@@ ing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ ny story .
I got an in@@ do@@ or sun@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ oti@@ n@@ g in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es .
"Now in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es , you could get a de@@ cent sun@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ ach@@ es , but I got min@@ e in@@ do@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ oti@@ n@@ g at 3@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second , you need to have a si@@ l@@ ly amount of light , lots of li@@ ghts ."
"What was so fun@@ ny about it was that the speak@@ er was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was comple@@ tely red and I looked like the P@@ h@@ an@@ tom of the O@@ pera for the rest of the week ."
Let me now turn to another project which in@@ vol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ st@@ an@@ ces .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . Ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I sk@@ i@@ p that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very strange behavi@@ or .
It &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d that is comple@@ tely black .
It &apos;s got an oi@@ ly con@@ sis@@ ten@@ cy .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of me@@ tal in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qui@@ d into a magnetic field , it would change its appe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a ca@@ mera poin@@ ting down at this pl@@ ate , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pl@@ ate , there is a magne@@ t ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that magne@@ t .
Let &apos;s just sli@@ ghtly move it to the right and maybe foc@@ us it a little bit more . Ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has for@@ med sp@@ ikes .
Th@@ ose are just st@@ and@@ ard wa@@ ter@@ col@@ ors that you would pain@@ t with .
"So what happened now is , when the wa@@ ter@@ co@@ lo@@ r was flo@@ wing into the stru@@ cture , the wa@@ ter@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ dro@@ ph@@ o@@ bi@@ c .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second project .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
Di@@ d he d@@ rin@@ k half a bot@@ tle of wh@@ is@@ ke@@ y and then dra@@ w the h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ation he got from being d@@ run@@ k on@@ to pap@@ er ?
"M@@ aybe you have experien@@ ced some of those pro@@ per@@ ties before , but I am talking about the physical pro@@ per@@ ties , not the other ones ."
"So when I op@@ en the bot@@ tle , the al@@ co@@ h@@ ol mole@@ cul@@ es would s@@ pre@@ ad in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is a very vol@@ ati@@ le sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is high@@ ly fla@@ m@@ ma@@ ble ."
And it was with those two pro@@ per@@ ties that I was able to create the ima@@ ges that you &apos;re see@@ ing right now .
Let me de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te this over here .
And what I have here is an em@@ p@@ ty g@@ las@@ s v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ g@@ en and wh@@ is@@ ke@@ y .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wa@@ it for a few secon@@ ds for the mole@@ cul@@ es to s@@ pre@@ ad inside the bot@@ tle .
"It goes really fas@@ t , and it &apos;s not that im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"So the ima@@ ges that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fl@@ ame sto@@ pped in time while it is tra@@ vel@@ ing through the bot@@ tle , and you have to imagine it was f@@ lip@@ ped around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those ima@@ ges were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three pro@@ jects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
I@@ s it just a was@@ te of wh@@ is@@ ke@@ y ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jects , they &apos;re based on very simple scienti@@ fi@@ c ph@@ en@@ omena , such as magne@@ tis@@ m , the sound w@@ av@@ es , or over here , the physical pro@@ per@@ ties of a sub@@ st@@ ance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these ph@@ en@@ omena and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and ther@@ e@@ fore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to p@@ ause for a moment and think about all the beau@@ ty that is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding us ."
Thank you very much .

"O@@ n@@ ce upo@@ n a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a stu@@ dent at S@@ t@@ . Joh@@ n &apos;s Me@@ di@@ cal C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ an@@ gal@@ or@@ e ."
I was a gu@@ est stu@@ dent during one mon@@ th of a publi@@ c health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set forever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course con@@ tent in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the b@@ ru@@ tal re@@ alization , the first mor@@ ning , that the Indi@@ an students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I loved stati@@ sti@@ cs from a young age .
And I stu@@ died very much in Swe@@ den .
I used to be in the up@@ per qu@@ ar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I at@@ ten@@ ded .
"But in S@@ t@@ . Joh@@ n &apos;s , I was in the lower qu@@ ar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that Indi@@ an students stu@@ died har@@ der than we did in Swe@@ den .
"They read the te@@ x@@ t@@ book tw@@ ice , or three times or four times ."
In Swe@@ den we read it once and then we went par@@ ty@@ ing .
"( L@@ augh@@ er ) And that , to me , that pers@@ onal experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was changed ."
And I re@@ alized that perhaps the We@@ ster@@ n world will not contin@@ ue to domin@@ ate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of pers@@ onal experience .
It &apos;s that re@@ alization of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the stati@@ sti@@ cs , al@@ though I tried to make it fun@@ ny ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ st@@ age , try to pre@@ di@@ ct when that will happen — that A@@ sia will reg@@ ain its domin@@ ant position as the lead@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to pre@@ di@@ ct prec@@ is@@ ely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will re@@ ach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econom@@ y , because to grow an econom@@ y of India to the si@@ ze of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of c@@ ake , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average p@@ ay , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have re@@ ach@@ ed that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal bac@@ k@@ ground .
And you can see my ma@@ p if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great technologi@@ cal ad@@ van@@ c@@ ement in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia was able , for the first time , to comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate with P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ ran@@ s@@ at@@ l@@ anti@@ c T@@ ele@@ grap@@ hi@@ c C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &quot; &quot; trans@@ at@@ l@@ anti@@ c@@ ally .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Inter@@ net , to find the te@@ x@@ t of the tele@@ gra@@ m s@@ ent back from P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This tele@@ graph is a fantas@@ tic in@@ stru@@ ment to dif@@ fu@@ se religi@@ on , civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , liber@@ ty and la@@ w throu@@ gh@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are ni@@ ce words . But I got sort of cu@@ ri@@ ous of what he me@@ ant with liber@@ ty , and liber@@ ty for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the w@@ ide@@ r picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also wa@@ ter@@ sh@@ ed year in the history of A@@ sia .
1858 was the year when the cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous up@@ ris@@ ing against the for@@ ei@@ g@@ n occ@@ up@@ ation of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the Bri@@ tis@@ h for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of for@@ ei@@ g@@ n domin@@ ation .
1858 in China was the vic@@ tory in the O@@ pi@@ um War by the Bri@@ tis@@ h for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that for@@ ei@@ gn@@ ers , as it said in the treat@@ y , were allowed to tra@@ de fre@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant pa@@ y@@ ing with o@@ pi@@ um for Ch@@ in@@ ese go@@ o@@ ds .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the H@@ ar@@ ris T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tra@@ de on fav@@ or@@ able con@@ dition for the U.S.
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in T@@ o@@ ky@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in con@@ tr@@ ast to India and China , main@@ tain@@ ed its national so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by b@@ rin@@ ging these bub@@ b@@ les back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der graph here , where you can see each bub@@ ble is a country ."
The si@@ ze of the bub@@ ble here is the population .
"O@@ n this ax@@ is , as I used to have income per person in compar@@ able dol@@ lar ."
"And on that ax@@ is I have life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ no@@ v@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ for@@ med the las@@ er be@@ am into an e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was rich@@ er over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal re@@ cor@@ d , there was a time hundre@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even ab@@ ove that of Euro@@ pe ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of for@@ ei@@ g@@ n domin@@ ation , and India had been de@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econom@@ y was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting heal@@ thy , and Japan was star@@ ting to c@@ atch up ."
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But car@@ e@@ ful now — we are appro@@ ach@@ ing the F@@ irst World War .
"And the F@@ irst World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ ath@@ s and econom@@ ical problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ pan@@ ish fl@@ u also .
"And then after the F@@ irst World War , they contin@@ ue up ."
"S@@ ti@@ ll under for@@ ei@@ g@@ n domin@@ ation , and without so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
Not much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a peri@@ od of war , with lower life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d World War was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also econom@@ ically for Japan ."
But they did reco@@ ver quite fas@@ t af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are mo@@ ving into the new world .
In 19@@ 4@@ 7 India finally g@@ ain@@ ed its inde@@ pen@@ dence .
"And they could ra@@ ise the Indi@@ an fla@@ g and become a so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ n n@@ ation , but in very big difficul@@ ties down there ."
( Applause ) In 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the emer@@ gence of the modern China in a way which surpris@@ ed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after inde@@ pen@@ dence ?
You can see that the health started to impro@@ ve .
Ch@@ il@@ dren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th ser@@ vi@@ ces were pro@@ vi@@ ded .
"This is the G@@ re@@ at Le@@ ap F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was cen@@ tral plan@@ ning by M@@ ao T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China reco@@ vered . Th@@ en they said , &quot; Ne@@ ver@@ more , stu@@ pi@@ d cen@@ tral plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were c@@ at@@ ch@@ ing up inde@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econom@@ y ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and M@@ ao T@@ se T@@ un@@ g died , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was D@@ en@@ g X@@ ia@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is wh@@ ite or black , as long as it c@@ at@@ ches mi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; Because c@@ at@@ ch@@ ing mi@@ ce is what the two ca@@ ts wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two ca@@ ts being here , China and India , wan@@ ting to c@@ atch the mi@@ ces over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also star@@ ting to grow their econom@@ y ."
And the market re@@ for@@ mer was successful there .
In &apos; 9@@ 2 India follo@@ ws with a market re@@ form .
"And they go quite clo@@ se@@ ly together , and you can see that the si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are grea@@ ter than the differences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they c@@ atch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the a@@ ver@@ ages there — this is the average of China .
"If I would sp@@ li@@ t China , look here , S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai has already c@@ at@@ ch@@ ed up ."
S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai is already there .
And it &apos;s heal@@ th@@ i@@ er than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou , one of the poor@@ est in@@ land pro@@ vin@@ ces of China , is there ."
"And if I sp@@ li@@ t G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and ru@@ ral , the ru@@ ral part of G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ orm@@ ous inequ@@ ity in China , in the mi@@ d@@ st of fas@@ t economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another ty@@ pe of inequ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical , ma@@ cro@@ -@@ ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical difference is not so big ."
"U@@ t@@ ta@@ r P@@ ra@@ des@@ h , the big@@ gest of the states here , is poor@@ er and has a lower health than the rest of India ."
"K@@ er@@ ala is f@@ ly@@ ing on top there , ma@@ t@@ ch@@ ing United States in health , but not in econom@@ y ."
"And here , M@@ a@@ har@@ as@@ h@@ tra , with M@@ um@@ b@@ ai , is for@@ ging for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big inequ@@ iti@@ es are within the state , rather than between the states ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequ@@ ity , ma@@ cro@@ -@@ ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical inequ@@ iti@@ es can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a growth center rel@@ ati@@ vely clo@@ se to where poor people are li@@ ving ."
"N@@ o , there is one more inequ@@ ity . Lo@@ ok there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they bro@@ ke my fra@@ me ."
"W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
M@@ y friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new le@@ ade@@ r in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton who is really con@@ cer@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so rich over there but they are not as heal@@ thy as K@@ er@@ ala .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a b@@ usiness op@@ por@@ t@@ unity for K@@ er@@ ala , hel@@ ping fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ gen@@ d down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant ca@@ ts here , p@@ us@@ hing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole emer@@ ging econom@@ ies of the world , which Th@@ o@@ mas F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ at world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is pu@@ tting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , and other parts , as in ru@@ ral G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econom@@ y ."
We have an en@@ orm@@ ous dis@@ par@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are p@@ us@@ hing for@@ wards very fas@@ t .
"Now , back to my pro@@ je@@ ctions ."
Wh@@ en will it c@@ atch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal graph .
"I will show income per person on this ax@@ is instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we sh@@ all see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under for@@ ei@@ g@@ n domin@@ ation actually lo@@ wer@@ ed their income and came down to the Indi@@ an level here ."
Wh@@ ere@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting rich@@ er and rich@@ er .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d World War , United States is rich@@ er than U.@@ K@@ ."
But inde@@ pen@@ dence is coming here .
"G@@ ro@@ wth is star@@ ting , economic re@@ form ."
"G@@ ro@@ wth is fas@@ ter , and with pro@@ je@@ ction from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you expe@@ ct them to be in 20@@ 14 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the c@@ atch up take place ? &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at , look at the United States ."
Can you see the bub@@ ble ?
"The bub@@ b@@ les , not my bub@@ b@@ les , but the fin@@ an@@ cial bub@@ b@@ les ."
That &apos;s the do@@ t co@@ m bub@@ ble . This is the Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ ste@@ p there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another ro@@ ck coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more hu@@ m@@ ble growth way , you know ."
And people interes@@ ted in growth are tur@@ ning their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ sia .
I can compar@@ e to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Japan to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that fas@@ t c@@ atch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
"@@ Japan did it like this , until ful@@ l c@@ atch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income econom@@ ies ."
"But the real pro@@ je@@ ctions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a h@@ isto@@ ri@@ an tell@@ s me it &apos;s even more difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es in China and India I con@@ sider really the big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le because to bring the enti@@ re population into growth and pros@@ per@@ ity is what will create a domestic market , what will av@@ oi@@ d social in@@ st@@ ab@@ ility , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments in health , education and in@@ fras@@ tru@@ cture , and electri@@ city is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the cli@@ mate . We have great inter@@ national ex@@ per@@ ts within India telling us that the cli@@ mate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise China and India would be the countries most to suf@@ fer from cli@@ mate change ."
And I con@@ sider India and China the best par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the world in a good global cli@@ mate poli@@ cy .
"But they ain &apos;t going to p@@ ay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ ge@@ ly created , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is war .
"W@@ ill the for@@ mer rich countries really ac@@ cept a comple@@ tely changed world econom@@ y , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to A@@ sia ?"
"And will A@@ sia be able to h@@ and@@ le that new position of being in char@@ ge of being the most mi@@ gh@@ ty , and the go@@ ver@@ nor@@ s of the world ?"
"So , always av@@ oi@@ d war , because that always p@@ us@@ h@@ es human be@@ ings bac@@ k@@ ward ."
"Now if these inequ@@ al@@ iti@@ es , cli@@ mate and war can be av@@ o@@ ide@@ d , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vision that I got as a young stu@@ dent , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that Indi@@ ans can be much better than Swe@@ des , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen prec@@ is@@ ely the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the sum@@ mer , in J@@ u@@ ly , more prec@@ is@@ ely , the 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 100@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I expe@@ ct to speak in the first s@@ es@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TED India .
G@@ et your bo@@ o@@ kin@@ gs in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So , this ch@@ ap here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is name is No@@ stra@@ d@@ am@@ us , al@@ though here the Sun have made him look a little bit like S@@ ean C@@ on@@ ner@@ y . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I su@@ spe@@ ct , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in pre@@ cognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to pre@@ di@@ ct something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a flu@@ ke , and we only hear about the flu@@ kes and about the fre@@ ak@@ s ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we expe@@ ct that to happen with si@@ l@@ ly stories about pre@@ cognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in acade@@ mia and in medicine , and in this environment , it co@@ sts lives ."
"So fi@@ r@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about pre@@ cognition , as it turns out , just last year a rese@@ arch@@ er called Dar@@ y@@ l B@@ e@@ m conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of pre@@ cogni@@ tive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic journ@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fai@@ r enough , but I think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a fre@@ ak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students had pre@@ cogni@@ tive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a journ@@ al ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because se@@ ver@@ al different groups of research scienti@@ sts tried to re@@ plic@@ ate the fin@@ din@@ gs of this pre@@ cognition study , and when they sub@@ mit@@ ted it to the ex@@ act same journ@@ al , the journ@@ al said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interes@@ ted in publis@@ hing re@@ plic@@ ation . We &apos;re not interes@@ ted in your neg@@ ative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the acade@@ mic liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ as@@ ed s@@ am@@ ple of the true picture of all of the scienti@@ fi@@ c studies that have been conducted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the d@@ ry acade@@ mic field of psycho@@ logy .
"It also happens in , for example , can@@ cer research ."
"So in Mar@@ ch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some rese@@ arch@@ ers re@@ por@@ ted in the journ@@ al N@@ ature how they had tried to re@@ plic@@ ate 5@@ 3 different bas@@ ic science studies looking at po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al treat@@ ment tar@@ gets in can@@ cer , and out of those 5@@ 3 studies , they were only able to success@@ fully re@@ plic@@ ate six ."
F@@ or@@ ty@@ -@@ seven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ re@@ plic@@ able .
And they say in their dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion that this is very lik@@ ely because fre@@ ak@@ s get published .
"P@@ eople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occ@@ asi@@ ons when it works they will publis@@ h , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ com@@ men@@ dation of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down b@@ lin@@ d al@@ le@@ ys , their first re@@ com@@ men@@ dation of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it eas@@ i@@ er to publis@@ h neg@@ ative results in science , and to change the in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves so that scienti@@ sts are en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed to po@@ st more of their neg@@ ative results in publi@@ c ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very d@@ ry world of prec@@ lin@@ ical bas@@ ic science can@@ cer research .
"It also happens in the very real , f@@ les@@ h and b@@ loo@@ d of acade@@ mic medicine . So in 19@@ 80 , some rese@@ arch@@ ers did a study on a dru@@ g called l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de , and this was an anti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ g , a dru@@ g that sup@@ press@@ es ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart at@@ t@@ ack , they &apos;re quite lik@@ ely to have ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a dru@@ g that sup@@ press@@ es ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving ."
"E@@ arly on its develo@@ p@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de , and of those patients , 10 died ."
"A@@ no@@ ther 50 patients got a du@@ m@@ my plac@@ eb@@ o sug@@ ar p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them died ."
"So they ri@@ ghtly reg@@ ar@@ ded this dru@@ g as a fa@@ il@@ u@@ re , and its com@@ mer@@ cial develo@@ p@@ ment was sto@@ pped , and because its com@@ mer@@ cial develo@@ p@@ ment was sto@@ pped , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other compan@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mias in people who have had heart at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Th@@ ese dru@@ gs were bro@@ ught to market . They were pres@@ cri@@ b@@ ed very w@@ ide@@ ly because heart at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also c@@ au@@ sed an increas@@ ed rate of death that before we de@@ te@@ cted that sa@@ fe@@ ty sign@@ al , over 100@@ ,000 people died un@@ nec@@ ess@@ arily in America from the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of anti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the rese@@ arch@@ ers who did that 19@@ 80 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ pa , an apo@@ logy to the scienti@@ fi@@ c comm@@ unity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ri@@ ed out our study in 19@@ 80 , we thought that the increas@@ ed death rate that occ@@ ur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de group was an ef@@ fect of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develo@@ p@@ ment of l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed for com@@ mer@@ cial reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publi@@ c@@ ation b@@ ias ."
"That &apos;s the tech@@ ni@@ cal ter@@ m for the ph@@ en@@ omenon where un@@ fla@@ tter@@ ing data gets lost , gets un@@ published , is left mis@@ sing in action , and they say the results describ@@ ed here &quot; might have pro@@ vi@@ ded an early war@@ ning of tro@@ u@@ ble a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from bas@@ ic science .
"Th@@ ese are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The acade@@ mic publis@@ hing environment is very different now .
"There are acade@@ mic journ@@ als like &quot; &quot; T@@ ri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the op@@ en ac@@ c@@ ess journ@@ al , which will publis@@ h any tri@@ al conducted in human@@ s reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a positive or a neg@@ ative resul@@ t ."
But this problem of neg@@ ative results that go mis@@ sing in action is still very pre@@ val@@ ent . In fact it &apos;s so pre@@ val@@ ent that it cu@@ ts to the cor@@ e of evi@@ den@@ c@@ e-@@ based medicine .
"So this is a dru@@ g called re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e , and this is a dru@@ g that I myself have pres@@ cri@@ b@@ ed . It &apos;s an anti@@ de@@ press@@ ant ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ dy doc@@ tor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this dru@@ g . I read the one study that was published that showed that re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e was better than plac@@ eb@@ o , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e was just as good as any other anti@@ de@@ press@@ ant , and because this pati@@ ent ha@@ dn &apos;t done well on those other anti@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts , I thought , well , re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was mis@@ led . In fact , seven trials were conducted compar@@ ing re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e against a du@@ m@@ my plac@@ eb@@ o sug@@ ar p@@ ill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were neg@@ ative and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree trials were published compar@@ ing re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e against other anti@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts in which re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was colle@@ cted which showed that re@@ bo@@ xetin@@ e was worse than those other treat@@ ments , and those trials were not published ."
I f@@ elt mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ u@@ su@@ al example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of cher@@ ry@@ -@@ pic@@ king and se@@ le@@ ctive re@@ fer@@ en@@ cing that I &apos;m ac@@ c@@ using other people of ."
"But it turns out that this ph@@ en@@ omenon of publi@@ c@@ ation b@@ ias has actually been very , very well stu@@ died ."
So here is one example of how you approach it .
"The clas@@ sic mo@@ de@@ l is , you get a b@@ un@@ ch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conducted and comple@@ ted , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the acade@@ mic liter@@ ature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on anti@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year peri@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the trials which were sub@@ mit@@ ted to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ val p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marke@@ ting au@@ th@@ oriz@@ ation ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 50 sp@@ li@@ t . H@@ al@@ f of these trials were positive , half of them were neg@@ ative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"O@@ n@@ ly three of the neg@@ ative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published ."
"Now if we just f@@ li@@ ck back and for@@ th between those two , you can see what a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing difference there was between reality and what doc@@ tors , patients , com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ers of health ser@@ vi@@ ces , and acade@@ mi@@ cs were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a syste@@ mati@@ c fla@@ w in the cor@@ e of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conducted on publi@@ c@@ ation b@@ ias now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been colle@@ cted in a syste@@ mati@@ c re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on publi@@ c@@ ation b@@ ias that they could find ."
P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ation b@@ ias af@@ fe@@ cts every field of medicine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all trials , on average , go mis@@ sing in action , and we know that positive fin@@ din@@ gs are around tw@@ ice as lik@@ ely to be published as neg@@ ative fin@@ din@@ gs ."
This is a can@@ cer at the cor@@ e of evi@@ den@@ c@@ e-@@ based medicine .
"If I f@@ lip@@ ped a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the results from you from half of those to@@ ss@@ es , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up head@@ s ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a tw@@ o-@@ he@@ ade@@ d co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ cer and you were an idi@@ ot for le@@ tting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we b@@ lin@@ dly tol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of evi@@ den@@ c@@ e-@@ based medicine .
"And to me , this is research mis@@ con@@ du@@ ct ."
"If I conducted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data poin@@ ts from that one study , you would ri@@ ghtly accu@@ se me , essenti@@ ally , of research f@@ r@@ au@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 studies but only publis@@ h@@ es the five that give the resul@@ t that they want , we don &apos;t con@@ sider that to be research mis@@ con@@ du@@ ct ."
"And when that responsi@@ bility is dif@@ fus@@ ed between a whole ne@@ t@@ work of rese@@ arch@@ ers , acade@@ mi@@ cs , in@@ du@@ st@@ ry s@@ pon@@ sor@@ s , journ@@ al e@@ di@@ tors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ table , but the ef@@ fect on patients is d@@ am@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a dru@@ g called T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u . T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u is a dru@@ g which govern@@ ments around the world have spent bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars on sto@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve sto@@ c@@ k@@ pi@@ led T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u in pan@@ ic , in the beli@@ ef that it will re@@ duce the rate of com@@ plic@@ ations of in@@ flu@@ en@@ za ."
"C@@ om@@ plic@@ ations is a me@@ di@@ cal eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m for p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ och@@ ran@@ e syste@@ mati@@ c re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to colle@@ ct together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether T@@ ami@@ fl@@ u actually did this or not , they found that se@@ ver@@ al of those trials were un@@ published ."
The results were una@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able to them .
"And when they started ob@@ tain@@ ing the w@@ ri@@ te@@ ups of those trials through vari@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation A@@ ct re@@ qu@@ e@@ sts , through har@@ as@@ sing vari@@ ous different organiz@@ ations , what they found was in@@ con@@ sis@@ tent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the c@@ lin@@ ical study re@@ por@@ ts , the 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age long do@@ cu@@ ments that have the best possible ren@@ dition of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the ful@@ l cor@@ respon@@ dence and the ex@@ c@@ us@@ es and the ex@@ plan@@ ations given by the dru@@ g compan@@ y , you can see that w@@ rit@@ ten up in this week &apos;s e@@ dition of P@@ L@@ O@@ S Me@@ dic@@ ine ."
"And the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recogn@@ ize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suf@@ fer f@@ ake fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pre@@ tend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ irst of all , we had trials reg@@ is@@ ters , and everybody said , o@@ h , it &apos;s o@@ kay . We &apos;ll get everyone to reg@@ is@@ ter their trials , they &apos;ll po@@ st the proto@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to che@@ ck and see if all the trials which have been conducted and comple@@ ted have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t bo@@ ther to use those reg@@ is@@ ters .
"And so then the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mit@@ te@@ e of Me@@ di@@ cal J@@ ourn@@ al E@@ di@@ tors came along , and they said , o@@ h , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publis@@ h any journ@@ als , we won &apos;t publis@@ h any trials , un@@ less they &apos;ve been reg@@ is@@ tered before they beg@@ an ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 200@@ 8 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journ@@ als e@@ di@@ ted by mem@@ bers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t pro@@ per@@ ly reg@@ is@@ tered , and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t reg@@ is@@ tered at all ."
"And then finally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct was pas@@ sed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must po@@ st the results of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first e@@ dition of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people k@@ ep@@ t to that r@@ ul@@ ing , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a dis@@ as@@ ter .
We cannot know the true ef@@ fe@@ cts of the medic@@ ines that we pres@@ cri@@ be if we do not have ac@@ c@@ ess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to publis@@ h all trials conducted in human@@ s , inclu@@ ding the older trials , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct only as@@ ks that you publis@@ h the trials conducted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ing medicine on the bas@@ is of trials that comple@@ ted in the past two years ."
"We need to publis@@ h all trials in human@@ s , inclu@@ ding the older trials , for all dru@@ gs in cur@@ r@@ ent use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ ul@@ l the k@@ not .
The ph@@ en@@ omenon you saw here for a bri@@ ef moment is called quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king .
And the ob@@ ject that was le@@ vit@@ ating here is called a superconductor .
"S@@ uper@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity is a quantum state of matter , and it occ@@ ur@@ s only be@@ low a certain cri@@ tical tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old ph@@ en@@ omenon ; it was disco@@ vered 100 years ago ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , only re@@ cen@@ tly , du@@ e to se@@ ver@@ al technologi@@ cal ad@@ van@@ c@@ e@@ ments , we are now able to de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te to you quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ."
"So , a superconductor is defin@@ ed by two pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"The first is z@@ er@@ o electri@@ cal res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce , and the second is the ex@@ pul@@ sion of a magnetic field from the inter@@ i@@ or of the superconductor ."
"That s@@ oun@@ ds com@@ plic@@ ated , right ?"
But what is electri@@ cal res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce ?
"So , electri@@ city is the f@@ low of elec@@ trons inside a material ."
"And these elec@@ trons , while flo@@ wing , they col@@ li@@ de with the atoms , and in these col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons they lo@@ se a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that ef@@ fect ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , inside a superconductor there are no col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble . Th@@ ink about it .
"In clas@@ si@@ cal physics , there is always some fri@@ ction , some energy lo@@ ss ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum ef@@ fect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconduc@@ tors don &apos;t like magnetic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a superconductor will try to expe@@ l magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by cir@@ cul@@ ating cur@@ r@@ ents ."
"Now , the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of both ef@@ fe@@ cts — the ex@@ pul@@ sion of magnetic fiel@@ ds and z@@ er@@ o electri@@ cal res@@ is@@ tan@@ ce — is exactly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always per@@ fect , as we all know , and some@@ times stran@@ ds of magnetic field re@@ ma@@ in inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under pro@@ per con@@ ditions , which we have here , these stran@@ ds of magnetic field can be tr@@ app@@ ed inside the superconductor ."
"And these stran@@ ds of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te qu@@ anti@@ ties ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum ph@@ en@@ omenon . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like quantum particles .
"In this mo@@ vi@@ e here , you can see how they f@@ low one by one dis@@ cre@@ tely ."
"This is stran@@ ds of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they be@@ have like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this ef@@ fect quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are stran@@ ds of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them mo@@ ving around , because their move@@ ments dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te energy , which bre@@ ak@@ s the superconduc@@ ti@@ vity state ."
"So what it actually does , it loc@@ ks these stran@@ ds , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it loc@@ ks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is loc@@ king itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion ."
So we get quantum loc@@ king . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I wr@@ app@@ ed up so it &apos;d st@@ ay col@@ d long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ gu@@ lar magne@@ t , it just st@@ ays loc@@ ked in mi@@ d@@ air ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just le@@ vit@@ ation . It &apos;s not just re@@ pul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be loc@@ ked in this new con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion ."
"@@ L@@ ike this , or move it sli@@ ghtly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum loc@@ king — actually loc@@ king — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal loc@@ king of the superconductor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ ma@@ in loc@@ ked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called le@@ vit@@ ation is actually loc@@ king , Y@@ e@@ ah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surpris@@ ed to hear that if I take this cir@@ cu@@ lar magne@@ t , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to fre@@ ely ro@@ ta@@ te around the ax@@ is of the magne@@ t ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it ro@@ ta@@ tes , the loc@@ king is main@@ tain@@ ed ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can ro@@ ta@@ te the superconductor .
"We have fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less mo@@ tion . It is still le@@ vit@@ ating , but can move fre@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have quantum loc@@ king and we can le@@ vit@@ ate it on top of this magne@@ t ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many magnetic stran@@ ds are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cu@@ late it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion stran@@ ds of magnetic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the a@@ maz@@ ing part yet , because there is something I ha@@ ven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , ye@@ ah , the a@@ maz@@ ing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a mi@@ c@@ ron th@@ ic@@ k . It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in ."
"And this extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in lay@@ er is able to le@@ vit@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own w@@ eight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble ef@@ fect . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can ex@@ tend this cir@@ cu@@ lar magne@@ t , and make wh@@ ate@@ ver tra@@ ck I want ."
"For example , I can make a large cir@@ cu@@ lar ra@@ i@@ l here ."
"And when I place the superconduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this ra@@ i@@ l , it mo@@ ves fre@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its position like this , and ro@@ ta@@ te , and it fre@@ ely mo@@ ves in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it st@@ ays here — don &apos;t move — I will try to ro@@ ta@@ te the tra@@ ck , and ho@@ pe@@ fully , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it st@@ ays su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum loc@@ king , not le@@ vit@@ ation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it cir@@ cu@@ late for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ fer en@@ orm@@ ous amount of cur@@ r@@ ents inside superconduc@@ tors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I mach@@ ines , partic@@ le ac@@ cel@@ er@@ a@@ tors and so on ."
"But we can also sto@@ re energy using superconduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
"And we could also produce power c@@ ab@@ les , to trans@@ fer en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ ts of cur@@ r@@ ent between power st@@ ations ."
I@@ ma@@ gine you could back up a single power st@@ ation with a single superconduc@@ ting c@@ able .
But what is the future of quantum le@@ vit@@ ation and quantum loc@@ king ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ ma@@ gine you would have a dis@@ k si@@ mil@@ ar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dia@@ me@@ ter , with a single difference ."
"The superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er , instead of being half a mi@@ c@@ ron th@@ in , being two mil@@ li@@ me@@ ters th@@ in , quite th@@ in ."
"This tw@@ o-@@ mil@@ li@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ in superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 ki@@ log@@ ra@@ ms , a small c@@ ar , in my hand ."
A@@ maz@@ ing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y to@@ pi@@ c is the se@@ cre@@ ts of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she st@@ ay ?"
Why would any@@ one st@@ ay with a man who be@@ a@@ ts her ?
"I &apos;m not a psy@@ ch@@ ia@@ tr@@ is@@ t , a social wor@@ ker or an ex@@ per@@ t in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just gra@@ du@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ var@@ d C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mo@@ ved to New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity for my first job as a w@@ ri@@ ter and e@@ di@@ tor at S@@ even@@ te@@ en mag@@ az@@ ine .
"I had my first apar@@ t@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American Ex@@ pre@@ ss car@@ d , and I had a very big se@@ cre@@ t ."
"M@@ y se@@ cre@@ t was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ade@@ d with h@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ point b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times ."
The man who I loved more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remem@@ ber .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of cra@@ z@@ y love , a psy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as love , one that mil@@ lions of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a ty@@ pic@@ al domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in English from H@@ ar@@ var@@ d C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in marke@@ ting from Wh@@ ar@@ ton B@@ usiness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"I &apos;ve spent most of my car@@ e@@ er working for F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies inclu@@ ding Joh@@ n@@ son &@@ am@@ p@@ ; Joh@@ n@@ son , Le@@ o B@@ ur@@ ne@@ t@@ t and The W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost ."
I &apos;ve been marri@@ ed for almost 20 years to my second h@@ usb@@ and and we have three kids together .
"M@@ y do@@ g is a black la@@ b , and I d@@ ri@@ ve a H@@ on@@ da O@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ y min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all ra@@ ces , all religi@@ ons , all income and education le@@ vel@@ s ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second message is that everyone thin@@ ks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and domestic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ ti@@ mate , inter@@ de@@ pen@@ dent , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in fami@@ lies , the last place we would want or expe@@ ct to find violence , which is one reason domestic ab@@ use is so con@@ fus@@ ing ."
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would st@@ ay with a man who be@@ a@@ ts me , but in fact I was a very ty@@ pic@@ al vic@@ ti@@ m because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ages 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as lik@@ ely to be domestic violence vic@@ tim@@ s as women of other ages , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are k@@ il@@ led every year by ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , b@@ oy@@ friends , and h@@ usb@@ ands in the United States ."
"I was also a very ty@@ pic@@ al vic@@ ti@@ m because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its war@@ ning sign@@ s or its patter@@ ns ."
"I me@@ t C@@ onor on a col@@ d , ra@@ in@@ y J@@ an@@ u@@ ary night ."
"He s@@ at next to me on the New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just gra@@ du@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue school , and that he worked at a very im@@ pres@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the big@@ gest im@@ pres@@ sion on me that first me@@ e@@ ting was that he was s@@ mar@@ t and fun@@ ny and he looked like a far@@ m b@@ oy .
"He had these big che@@ ek@@ s , these big ap@@ ple che@@ ek@@ s and this wh@@ e@@ at@@ -@@ b@@ lon@@ d h@@ air , and he see@@ med so swe@@ et ."
"One of the s@@ mar@@ test things C@@ onor did , from the very beginning , was to create the il@@ lu@@ sion that I was the domin@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ z@@ ing me .
"We started d@@ ating , and he loved everything about me , that I was s@@ mar@@ t , that I &apos;d gone to H@@ ar@@ var@@ d , that I was pas@@ sion@@ ate about hel@@ ping te@@ en@@ age girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and my h@@ op@@ es and dre@@ am@@ s .
"C@@ onor beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a w@@ ri@@ ter and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a ma@@ gi@@ cal at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here of trust between us by con@@ f@@ ess@@ ing his se@@ cre@@ t , which was that , as a very young b@@ oy star@@ ting at age four , he had been s@@ av@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly physi@@ c@@ ally ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very s@@ mar@@ t , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life ."
Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue de@@ gre@@ e and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right sh@@ in@@ y future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this s@@ mar@@ t , fun@@ ny , sen@@ si@@ tive man who ad@@ or@@ ed me would one day dic@@ ta@@ te whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how sh@@ or@@ t my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I li@@ ved , what j@@ ob@@ s I took , who my friends were and where I spent Chris@@ t@@ mas , I would have l@@ augh@@ ed at you , because there was not a hin@@ t of violence or contro@@ l or ang@@ er in C@@ onor at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first st@@ age in any domestic violence relation@@ ship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the vic@@ ti@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second ste@@ p is to is@@ ol@@ ate the vic@@ ti@@ m .
"Now , C@@ onor did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , h@@ ey , all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next ph@@ ase where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this apar@@ t@@ ment where the n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ s can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ work@@ ers who can see the b@@ ru@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; In@@ ste@@ ad , C@@ onor came home one F@@ ri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,"
"@@ because I had made him feel so saf@@ e and loved that he didn &apos;t need to pro@@ ve h@@ im@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his ab@@ u@@ sive , dy@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tional family , and move to a tiny to@@ wn in New Eng@@ land where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New Y@@ or@@ k , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces for your s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and C@@ onor and I left Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ all@@ ing into cra@@ z@@ y love , that I was walking head@@ first into a car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly l@@ aid physical , fin@@ an@@ cial and psy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal tra@@ p ."
The next ste@@ p in the domestic violence patter@@ n is to in@@ tro@@ duce the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mo@@ ved to New Eng@@ land — you know , that place where C@@ on@@ no@@ r was sup@@ posed to feel so saf@@ e — he b@@ ou@@ ght three g@@ un@@ s ."
He k@@ ep@@ t one in the glo@@ ve compar@@ t@@ ment of our c@@ ar .
"He k@@ ep@@ t one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our b@@ ed , and the th@@ ir@@ d one he k@@ ep@@ t in his po@@ c@@ ke@@ t at all times ."
And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tr@@ au@@ ma he &apos;d experien@@ ced as a young b@@ oy .
He needed them to feel prote@@ cted .
"But those g@@ un@@ s were really a message for me , and even though he ha@@ dn &apos;t ra@@ is@@ ed a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve d@@ ang@@ er every minu@@ te of every day ."
C@@ onor first physi@@ c@@ ally at@@ t@@ ac@@ ked me five days before our we@@ d@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
"I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance w@@ ri@@ ting as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted , and C@@ onor used my ang@@ er as an ex@@ cu@@ se to put both of his hands around my ne@@ ck and to squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e so ti@@ ghtly that I could not bre@@ a@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ i@@ ve days later , the ten b@@ ru@@ is@@ es on my ne@@ ck had just f@@ ade@@ d , and I put on my mother &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding dre@@ ss , and I marri@@ ed him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live hap@@ pi@@ ly ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sor@@ ry ."
He had just been really stre@@ ss@@ ed out by the we@@ d@@ ding and by be@@ coming a family with me .
"It was an is@@ ol@@ ated in@@ ci@@ dent , and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again ."
It happened tw@@ ice more on the h@@ on@@ ey@@ moon .
"The first time , I was d@@ riv@@ ing to find a se@@ cre@@ t be@@ ach and I got lost , and he p@@ un@@ ch@@ ed me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly h@@ it the d@@ ri@@ ver &apos;s side win@@ do@@ w ."
"And then a few days later , d@@ riv@@ ing home from our h@@ on@@ ey@@ moon , he got f@@ ru@@ stra@@ ted by tra@@ f@@ fi@@ c , and he thre@@ w a col@@ d Big M@@ a@@ c in my face ."
C@@ onor proc@@ e@@ e@@ ded to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a week for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age .
I was mis@@ taken in thinking that I was uni@@ qu@@ e and alone in this s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
"One in three American women experien@@ ces domestic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ por@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good compan@@ y ."
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I st@@ ay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ade@@ d g@@ un@@ s to my head , p@@ us@@ hed me down stair@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the ke@@ y out of the c@@ ar ig@@ ni@@ tion as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , po@@ u@@ red co@@ f@@ fe@@ e g@@ rin@@ ds on my head as I dre@@ ss@@ ed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of myself as a b@@ at@@ tered wife ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I was a very strong woman in love with a de@@ ep@@ ly tro@@ u@@ b@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help C@@ onor face his de@@ mon@@ s ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"To me , this is the s@@ ad@@ de@@ st and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we vic@@ tim@@ s know something you u@@ su@@ ally don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ bly d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to leave an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fin@@ al ste@@ p in the domestic violence patter@@ n is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 70 percent of domestic violence m@@ ur@@ ders happen after the vic@@ ti@@ m has en@@ ded the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to lo@@ se ."
"O@@ ther out@@ comes inclu@@ de lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ mar@@ ries ; den@@ i@@ al of fin@@ an@@ cial resour@@ ces ; and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the vic@@ ti@@ m and her children , who are reg@@ ularly for@@ ced by family cour@@ t j@@ u@@ d@@ ges to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vis@@ ed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one fin@@ al , s@@ ad@@ is@@ tic be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my den@@ i@@ al ."
I re@@ alized that the man who I loved so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I bro@@ ke the si@@ l@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the poli@@ ce , my n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ s , my friends and family , to@@ tal stran@@ g@@ ers , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ ped me ."
"We tend to st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe vic@@ tim@@ s as g@@ ris@@ ly head@@ lin@@ es , self-@@ de@@ stru@@ ctive women , da@@ mag@@ ed go@@ o@@ ds ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she st@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; is co@@ de for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her f@@ au@@ l@@ t for st@@ aying , &quot; &quot; as if vic@@ tim@@ s in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ally cho@@ ose to f@@ all in love with men in@@ tent upo@@ n de@@ st@@ roy@@ ing us ."
"But since publis@@ hing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y Lo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; I have heard hundre@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an in@@ val@@ u@@ able life les@@ son from what happened , and who re@@ built lives — j@@ oy@@ ous , happy lives — as em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es , wi@@ ves and mothers , lives comple@@ tely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very ty@@ pic@@ al domestic violence vic@@ ti@@ m and a ty@@ pic@@ al domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I re@@ marri@@ ed a kind and gen@@ tle man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ ade@@ d gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me ."
"@@ R@@ i@@ ght now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how stu@@ pi@@ d was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I pro@@ mis@@ e you there are se@@ ver@@ al people lis@@ ten@@ ing to me right now who are cur@@ ren@@ tly being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers themselves .
"A@@ bu@@ se could be af@@ fe@@ c@@ ting your daughter , your sis@@ ter , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own cra@@ z@@ y love story by bre@@ ak@@ ing the si@@ l@@ ence .
I &apos;m still bre@@ ak@@ ing the si@@ l@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ ping other vic@@ tim@@ s , and it &apos;s my fin@@ al re@@ ques@@ t of you ."
T@@ al@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ bu@@ se th@@ ri@@ ves only in si@@ l@@ ence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by sh@@ in@@ ing a spo@@ t@@ light on it .
We vic@@ tim@@ s need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the se@@ cre@@ ts of domestic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ work@@ ers , your friends and family ."
"@@ Re@@ c@@ ast survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with ful@@ l fu@@ tures ."
"@@ Re@@ co@@ gn@@ ize the early sign@@ s of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show vic@@ tim@@ s a saf@@ e way out ."
"T@@ o@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our din@@ ner t@@ ab@@ les and our fami@@ lies the saf@@ e and pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful o@@ as@@ es they should be ."
Thank you .

So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
"There is a hu@@ ge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in happiness , a@@ mon@@ g rese@@ arch@@ ers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people hap@@ pi@@ er .
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these cogni@@ tive trap@@ s .
"This app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these trap@@ s is a re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ m@@ it comple@@ x@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a us@@ e@@ ful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ m@@ ped in the no@@ tion of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cogni@@ tive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my le@@ c@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been lis@@ ten@@ ing to a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ solu@@ tely g@@ l@@ or@@ i@@ ous music and at the very end of the re@@ cor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of g@@ l@@ or@@ i@@ ous music .
"They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memor@@ y ; the memor@@ y was ru@@ ined , and the memor@@ y was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and kno@@ ws the present , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the past , but basically it has only the present ."
"It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I to@@ u@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s s@@ cor@@ e , and main@@ tain@@ s the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing la@@ tely ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ an@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different enti@@ ties , the experiencing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ fus@@ ed between them is part of the me@@ ss about the no@@ tion of happiness ."
"Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a s@@ tor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler ."
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic respon@@ se of our memor@@ ies — it star@@ ts im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
They were asked to re@@ port on their pain every 60 secon@@ ds .
"@@ Here are two patients , those are their re@@ cor@@ din@@ gs ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them suf@@ fer@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suf@@ fer@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y was longer , and every minu@@ te of pain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suf@@ fer@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a surpris@@ e .
The surpris@@ e is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse memor@@ y of the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es were different , and because a very cri@@ tical part of the story is how it ends ."
And n@@ ei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spi@@ ring or great — but one of them is this dis@@ tin@@ ct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in to@@ tal ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in memor@@ y ."
Now this is a di@@ re@@ ct con@@ f@@ li@@ ct between the experiencing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ran c@@ lin@@ ical experi@@ ments , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much ."
"That will cause the pati@@ ent to suf@@ fer , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that memor@@ y de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mo@@ ments and en@@ din@@ gs ."
"E@@ n@@ din@@ gs are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated ."
"Now , the experiencing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ously ."
"It has mo@@ ments of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mo@@ ments ?
And the answer is really stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward : They are lost forever .
M@@ ost of them are comple@@ tely ig@@ nor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens during these mo@@ ments of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be rele@@ v@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
The experiencing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experien@@ ces , we cho@@ ose between memor@@ ies of experien@@ ces ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future nor@@ m@@ ally as experien@@ ces ."
We think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted memor@@ ies .
"I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ en@@ tly the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the ser@@ vice of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self ."
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our memor@@ ies ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ sum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much w@@ eight on memor@@ y rel@@ ative to the w@@ eight that we put on experien@@ ces ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ ma@@ gine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remem@@ ber anything ."
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mo@@ ments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mo@@ ments is a fai@@ r@@ ly com@@ plic@@ ated process .
What are the e@@ mo@@ tions that can be measu@@ red ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time ."
It is about how s@@ atis@@ fied or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ ery different no@@ tion .
"An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to me@@ ss up the study of happiness , and I b@@ el@@ ong to a cro@@ w@@ d of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in prec@@ is@@ ely this way ."
"The dis@@ tin@@ ction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogn@@ iz@@ ed in re@@ cent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to measure the two s@@ ep@@ ar@@ a@@ tely ."
"So in re@@ cent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the ma@@ in les@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you me@@ t somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his h@@ eight ?"
You have that much un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is main@@ ly being s@@ atis@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like ."
"There are other ple@@ as@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for well-being .
It is a comple@@ tely different no@@ tion .
"Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ i@@ ght about happiness is that we do not at@@ tend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , you are not going to get to the cor@@ re@@ ct answer ."
"Well , it turns out that cli@@ mate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ f@@ le@@ ctive self that deci@@ des how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think stra@@ i@@ ght about well-being , and I ho@@ pe I have given you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting resul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , var@@ y with income ."
"And it turns out that , be@@ low an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very large s@@ am@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a large re@@ presen@@ t@@ ative s@@ am@@ ple — be@@ low an income of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progre@@ s@@ si@@ vely un@@ hap@@ pi@@ er the poor@@ er they get ."
"A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ solu@@ tely fl@@ at line ."
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ are@@ ly seen lin@@ es so fl@@ at .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but l@@ ack of money cer@@ tain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more s@@ atis@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for e@@ mo@@ tions .
"C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ ny , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took ser@@ i@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation poli@@ cy and so for@@ th ."
P@@ eople are recogn@@ iz@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of publi@@ c poli@@ cy .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence poli@@ cy , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ ad@@ e or two , part of national stati@@ sti@@ cs ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at le@@ ast should be — the most interesting poli@@ cy dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion to tra@@ ck over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a vari@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent star@@ ting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble stuff .
"You take about eight or so carb@@ on atoms , about 20 hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this mar@@ vel@@ ous li@@ qui@@ d : very energ@@ y@@ -@@ den@@ se and very easy to re@@ fin@@ e into a number of very us@@ e@@ ful produc@@ ts and fu@@ el@@ s ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ c@@ ke@@ t ma@@ p of where it &apos;s all loc@@ ated .
A big@@ ger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
Ge@@ o@@ logis@@ ts have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 tri@@ l@@ lion gal@@ l@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de oil still to be developed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1@@ 000 me@@ ters be@@ low where you &apos;re all s@@ it@@ ting is one of the lar@@ gest produc@@ ing oil fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? Wh@@ ere is it in the energy system ?
"@@ Here &apos;s a little s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a domin@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little se@@ cre@@ t I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 25 years , oil has been pl@@ aying less and less of a ro@@ le in global energy syste@@ ms ."
"There was one kind of pe@@ ak oil in 19@@ 8@@ 5 , when oil re@@ presen@@ ted 50 percent of global energy sup@@ ply ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been dec@@ lin@@ ing and I believe it will contin@@ ue to dec@@ line .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion in the U.S. probably pe@@ ak@@ ed in 200@@ 7 and is dec@@ lin@@ ing .
So oil is pl@@ aying a less sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ro@@ le every year .
"And so , 25 years ago , there was a pe@@ ak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a pe@@ ak co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a pe@@ ak wo@@ od ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy syste@@ ms .
And what &apos;s been tak@@ ing up the s@@ l@@ ack in the last few dec@@ ades ?
"Well , a lot of natural g@@ as and a little bit of nu@@ cle@@ ar , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few dec@@ ades is pe@@ ak g@@ as , and be@@ y@@ on@@ d that , pe@@ ak ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in to@@ tal isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s — but there &apos;s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been syste@@ ma@@ tically de@@ carb@@ on@@ iz@@ ing our energy system ."
"E@@ n@@ erg@@ y syste@@ ms of the world be@@ coming progre@@ s@@ si@@ vely — year on year , dec@@ ad@@ e on dec@@ ad@@ e , century on century — be@@ coming less carb@@ on in@@ ten@@ se ."
"And that contin@@ ues into the future with the ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develo@@ ping today , re@@ ach@@ ing maybe 30 percent of pri@@ mar@@ y energy by mi@@ d century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ y@@ on@@ d .
"What is the future of truly su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , carb@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in cen@@ tral T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of li@@ me@@ sto@@ ne .
"I pic@@ ked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ all@@ s , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just li@@ me@@ sto@@ ne , nothing really spe@@ cial about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of chal@@ k ."
I pic@@ ked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little youn@@ ger .
"And it &apos;s different than this li@@ me@@ sto@@ ne , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a le@@ cture and wr@@ ite on the chal@@ k@@ bo@@ ard with this ."
"Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um carb@@ on@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um carb@@ on@@ ate ."
What &apos;s different is how the mole@@ cul@@ es are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ ff the co@@ ast of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
"Now , mil@@ lions of ab@@ alone every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already gu@@ ess@@ ing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um carb@@ on@@ ate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times to@@ u@@ gh@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the lo@@ w@@ ly ab@@ alone is able to l@@ ay down the cal@@ ci@@ um carb@@ on@@ ate c@@ ry@@ st@@ als in lay@@ ers , making this beautiful , i@@ ri@@ des@@ cent mother of pe@@ arl ."
"V@@ ery speci@@ alized material that the ab@@ alone self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ les , mil@@ lions of ab@@ alone , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredible stuff .
"All the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the mole@@ cul@@ es are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll sug@@ gest that this co@@ al is about as exci@@ ting as this chal@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fu@@ el@@ s or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps no@@ vel materi@@ als for b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies or fu@@ el cells , nature h@@ as@@ n &apos;t ever built those per@@ fect materi@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , the survi@@ val of a speci@@ es didn &apos;t de@@ p@@ end on building those materi@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging the mole@@ cul@@ es differen@@ tly ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never ru@@ n out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a b@@ a@@ j@@ il@@ lion win@@ d@@ mil@@ ls .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people inven@@ ted ideas — they had ideas , in@@ no@@ v@@ ations , technology — and the S@@ ton@@ e A@@ ge en@@ ded , not because we ran out of sto@@ n@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we ru@@ n out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both chall@@ eng@@ ed and exci@@ ted .
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ eve something ?"
"S@@ ome@@ body who &apos;s working for you , or a par@@ t@@ ner , or even yourself ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ re@@ ct me if I &apos;m wrong .
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; Au@@ dience : A@@ y@@ e ."
We need vari@@ e@@ ty . We need surpris@@ e .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own human@@ ity and mis@@ takes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ eve things that seem to de@@ f@@ y all of the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ?"
F@@ or example : Why is Ap@@ ple so in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ?
"Y@@ e@@ ar after year , after year , they &apos;re more in@@ no@@ v@@ ative than all their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer compan@@ y ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Martin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing led the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts M@@ o@@ ve@@ ment ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who suf@@ fer@@ ed in pre@@ -@@ civi@@ l ri@@ ghts America , and he cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t the only great or@@ ato@@ r of the day ."
"And this disco@@ very prof@@ oun@@ dly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even prof@@ oun@@ dly changed the way in which I o@@ per@@ ate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a patter@@ n ."
And it &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite to everyone else .
"All I did was co@@ dif@@ y it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s sim@@ ple@@ st idea ."
I call it the g@@ ol@@ den circ@@ le .
This little idea explain@@ s why some organiz@@ ations and some lead@@ ers are able to in@@ spi@@ re where others ar@@ en &apos;t .
Let me defin@@ e the terms really quickly .
"E@@ very single person , every single organiz@@ ation on the planet kno@@ ws what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organiz@@ ations know why they do what they do ."
"B@@ y &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your pur@@ pose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your beli@@ ef ?
Why do you get out of b@@ ed in the mor@@ ning ?
I use Ap@@ ple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beau@@ ti@@ fully design@@ ed , simple to use and us@@ er fri@@ en@@ dly ."
Here &apos;s how Ap@@ ple actually comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ates .
"&quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing we do , we believe in chall@@ eng@@ ing the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o ."
We believe in thinking differen@@ tly .
We just happen to make great compu@@ ters .
"But we &apos;re also per@@ fe@@ c@@ tly com@@ for@@ table bu@@ y@@ ing an M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er from Ap@@ ple , or a ph@@ one from Ap@@ ple , or a D@@ V@@ R from Ap@@ ple ."
Th@@ ei@@ r com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ ate@@ way came out with fla@@ t@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re e@@ min@@ en@@ tly qu@@ ali@@ fied to make fla@@ t@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
No@@ body b@@ ou@@ ght one .
It &apos;s all gro@@ un@@ ded in the ten@@ ets of bi@@ o@@ logy .
"@@ Not psycho@@ logy , bi@@ o@@ logy ."
"O@@ ur new@@ est brain , our H@@ omo s@@ ap@@ i@@ en brain , our ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x is responsi@@ ble for all of our ra@@ tional and anal@@ y@@ tical thought and language .
"The middle two se@@ ctions make up our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins are responsi@@ ble for all of our feel@@ ings , like trust and l@@ oy@@ al@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t d@@ ri@@ ve behavi@@ or .
This is where g@@ ut dec@@ is@@ i@@ ons come from .
The go@@ al is not just to hi@@ re people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hi@@ re people who believe what you believe .
M@@ ost people don &apos;t know about S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley .
"And S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ pe for success ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He hi@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the market con@@ ditions were fantas@@ tic .
"The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ imes follo@@ wed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ oti@@ n@@ g for L@@ ang@@ ley ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ ier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley ?
"The difference was , O@@ r@@ v@@ il@@ le and W@@ il@@ bu@@ r were d@@ riv@@ en by a cause , by a pur@@ pose , by a beli@@ ef ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could figu@@ re out this f@@ ly@@ ing machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the resul@@ t .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the rich@@ es .
"And lo and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the pa@@ y@@ che@@ ck .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get fam@@ ous , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to at@@ tra@@ ct those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early a@@ do@@ p@@ ters .
"And these gu@@ ys , the in@@ no@@ v@@ a@@ tors and the early a@@ do@@ p@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ for@@ table making those g@@ ut dec@@ is@@ i@@ ons ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that pro@@ ve what they believe ."
"So let me give you a fam@@ ous example , a fam@@ ous fa@@ il@@ u@@ re and a fam@@ ous success of the la@@ w of dif@@ fu@@ sion of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a com@@ mer@@ cial example .
I T@@ i@@ V@@ o stuff on my pie@@ c@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ i@@ me W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their sto@@ ck was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never tra@@ ded ab@@ ove 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the sum@@ mer of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people showed up on the m@@ all in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We follo@@ wed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are lead@@ ers and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ Le@@ ad@@ ers hold a position of power or au@@ th@@ ority , but those who le@@ ad in@@ spi@@ re us ."
"I ’ m going around the world giving tal@@ ks about Dar@@ win , and u@@ su@@ ally what I ’ m talking about is Dar@@ win ’ s strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"Now that ti@@ tle , that ph@@ r@@ ase , comes from a cri@@ tic , an early cri@@ tic , and this is a pas@@ s@@ age that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ solu@@ te I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance is the ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cer ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the fun@@ da@@ mental princi@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a per@@ fect and beautiful machine , it is not re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite to know how to make it ."
"This pro@@ position will be found on car@@ e@@ ful exam@@ in@@ ation to ex@@ pre@@ ss , in con@@ den@@ sed form , the essenti@@ al pur@@ port of the The@@ or@@ y , and to ex@@ pre@@ ss in a few words all M@@ r@@ . Dar@@ win ’ s me@@ an@@ ing ; who , by a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing , seems to think A@@ b@@ solu@@ te I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance fully qu@@ ali@@ fied to take the place of A@@ b@@ solu@@ te W@@ is@@ dom in the achi@@ ev@@ e@@ ments of cre@@ ative sk@@ ill . &quot; &quot; Ex@@ actly . Ex@@ actly . And it is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion ."
A cre@@ ation@@ is@@ t pa@@ m@@ ph@@ let has this wonderful p@@ age in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ w@@ o : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pain@@ ting that didn ’ t have a pain@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any c@@ ar that didn ’ t have a ma@@ ker ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the ab@@ ove , give de@@ ta@@ il@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ h@@ a ! I mean , it really is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
You would have thought it st@@ ands to reason that de@@ sign re@@ qui@@ res an intel@@ lig@@ ent de@@ sig@@ ner .
But Dar@@ win sho@@ ws that it ’ s just fal@@ se .
"T@@ o@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about Dar@@ win ’ s other strange in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It st@@ ands to reason that we love cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ ake because it is swe@@ et .
G@@ u@@ ys go for girls like this because they are sex@@ y .
We ad@@ or@@ e b@@ ab@@ ies because they ’ re so cu@@ te .
"And , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ kes because they are fun@@ ny ."
This is all bac@@ k@@ wards . It is . And Dar@@ win sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with swe@@ et . O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is basically an evol@@ ved sug@@ ar de@@ te@@ c@@ tor , because sug@@ ar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ ru@@ de@@ ly , and that ’ s why we like sug@@ ar ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because h@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c@@ ally swe@@ et about h@@ on@@ ey ."
"If you looked at g@@ lu@@ co@@ se mole@@ cul@@ es ti@@ ll you were b@@ lin@@ d , you wouldn ’ t see why they tas@@ ted swe@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re swe@@ et .
"So if you think first there was swe@@ et@@ ness , and then we evol@@ ved to like swe@@ et@@ ness , you ’ ve got it bac@@ k@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way ro@@ und ."
Swe@@ et@@ ness was born with the wi@@ ring which evol@@ ved .
And there ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c@@ ally sex@@ y about these young la@@ dies .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on ear@@ th do you get ch@@ im@@ ps to mate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a sol@@ ution : h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quic@@ ker way ."
"@@ Just wi@@ re the ch@@ im@@ ps up to love that look , and ap@@ par@@ en@@ tly they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ im@@ ps evol@@ ved our different ways ."
"We be@@ came bal@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ died , od@@ dly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we ha@@ dn ’ t , then probably this would be the h@@ eight of sex@@ iness ."
O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an evol@@ ved and in@@ s@@ tin@@ ctu@@ al pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy fo@@ od .
It wasn ’ t design@@ ed for cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ ake .
Ch@@ o@@ col@@ ate c@@ ake is a super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ iko T@@ in@@ b@@ erg@@ en , who did his fam@@ ous experi@@ ments with g@@ ul@@ ls , where he found that that or@@ an@@ ge spo@@ t on the g@@ ul@@ l ’ s be@@ ak — if he made a big@@ ger , or@@ ang@@ er spo@@ t the g@@ ul@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ks would pe@@ ck at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ per@@ sti@@ mul@@ us for them , and they loved it ."
"What we see with , say , cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ ake is it ’ s a super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ us to tw@@ e@@ ak our de@@ sign wi@@ ring ."
And there are lots of super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ i ; cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ ake is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ i for sex@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ i for cu@@ ten@@ ess . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love b@@ ab@@ ies , and that we not be put off by , say , mess@@ y diap@@ ers ."
"So b@@ ab@@ ies have to at@@ tra@@ ct our af@@ fe@@ ction and our n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a re@@ cent study sho@@ ws that mothers pre@@ fer the s@@ me@@ ll of the di@@ r@@ ty diap@@ ers of their own b@@ ab@@ y ."
So nature works on many le@@ vel@@ s here .
"But now , if b@@ ab@@ ies didn ’ t look the way they do — if b@@ ab@@ ies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find ad@@ or@@ able , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , o@@ h my go@@ od@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the strange in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , finally what about fun@@ ny . M@@ y answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think evol@@ u@@ tion@@ arily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s di@@ r@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a power@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we succ@@ e@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
It ’ s a neu@@ ral system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a g@@ ru@@ b@@ by cl@@ er@@ ical job .
O@@ ur bu@@ m@@ per sti@@ c@@ ker for this view is that this is the j@@ oy of de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using hu@@ mo@@ r as a sort of neuro@@ scienti@@ fi@@ c pro@@ be by sw@@ it@@ ch@@ ing hu@@ mo@@ r on and off , by tur@@ ning the kno@@ b on a jo@@ ke — now it ’ s not fun@@ ny ... o@@ h , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..@@ ."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ ny — in this way , we can actually learn something about the archite@@ cture of the brain , the fun@@ c@@ tional archite@@ cture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ ley is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ ley M@@ ode@@ l .
"He ’ s a computer scienti@@ st , Re@@ gin@@ al@@ d A@@ d@@ am@@ s a psycho@@ logis@@ t , and there I am , and we ’ re pu@@ tting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"Now , no@@ tice that the le@@ ade@@ r em@@ bra@@ ces him as an equal ."
It takes gu@@ ts to st@@ and out like that .
So a movement must be publi@@ c .
Now we &apos;ve got mo@@ men@@ tum . This is the ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"And what a per@@ fect place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
An@@ y@@ one ?
How about a moder@@ ate amount of stre@@ ss ?
Y@@ e@@ ah . Me too .
But that is not my con@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
It increas@@ es the ris@@ k of everything from the common col@@ d to car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cu@@ lar disease .
"But I have changed my mind about stre@@ ss , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
It &apos;s called the social stre@@ ss test .
"And un@@ be@@ kno@@ w@@ n@@ st to you , the experi@@ men@@ ter has been tra@@ ined to har@@ as@@ s you during it ."
That guy made a mis@@ take .
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ g@@ en to your brain .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is in@@ vol@@ ved in .
It fin@@ e-@@ t@@ un@@ es your brain &apos;s social in@@ s@@ tin@@ cts .
It even makes you more w@@ ill@@ ing to help and sup@@ port the people you care about .
But my fav@@ or@@ ite ef@@ fect on the body is actually on the heart .
P@@ eople who spent time car@@ ing for others showed ab@@ solu@@ tely no stre@@ ss@@ -@@ re@@ lated increase in dy@@ ing .
"And when you cho@@ ose to view stre@@ ss in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stre@@ ss , you &apos;re actually making a pretty pro@@ found sta@@ te@@ ment ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to h@@ and@@ le life &apos;s chall@@ eng@@ es .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : This is kind of a@@ maz@@ ing , what you &apos;re telling us ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ever before has the ph@@ r@@ ase &quot; &quot; I am Bri@@ tis@@ h &quot; &quot; e@@ li@@ ci@@ ted so much p@@ ity . ( Laughter )
"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for many people , but it was also something that , over the follo@@ wing se@@ ver@@ al days , created a comple@@ te political me@@ l@@ t@@ down in my country ."
E@@ very@@ body was b@@ la@@ ming everybody else .
That comple@@ te me@@ l@@ t@@ down was made even worse by the most tra@@ gi@@ c ele@@ ment of it : le@@ vel@@ s of xen@@ o@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia and ra@@ c@@ is@@ t ab@@ use in the stre@@ ets of B@@ rit@@ ain at a level that I have never seen before in my li@@ fe@@ time .
"P@@ eople are now talking about whether my country is be@@ coming a L@@ it@@ tle Eng@@ land , or , as one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 19@@ 5@@ 0s no@@ st@@ al@@ gia the@@ me par@@ k flo@@ ating in the A@@ t@@ l@@ anti@@ c O@@ c@@ ean ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ gre@@ e of sho@@ ck that we &apos;ve experien@@ ced since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ ep@@ er stru@@ c@@ tural fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a ste@@ p back and ask two very bas@@ ic questions .
"F@@ irst , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respon@@ d ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present ?"
H@@ in@@ d@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ote sp@@ li@@ t along lin@@ es of age , education , clas@@ s and ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y ."
"G@@ e@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ically , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land that most st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly com@@ mit@@ ted to being part of the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very strong am@@ bi@@ val@@ ence ."
"But more prof@@ oun@@ dly , the v@@ ote teach@@ es us something about the nature of poli@@ tics today ."
C@@ on@@ tem@@ por@@ ary poli@@ tics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about glob@@ alization .
The f@@ au@@ l@@ t line of con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary poli@@ tics is between those that em@@ bra@@ ce glob@@ alization and those that fear glob@@ alization .
But those ideas are ones that sig@@ ni@@ f@@ y fear and ali@@ en@@ ation .
They re@@ present a re@@ treat back to@@ wards n@@ ation@@ alis@@ m and bor@@ ders in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The b@@ lu@@ e are@@ as show Re@@ ma@@ in and the red are@@ as Le@@ ave .
It means that we need to re@@ ach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the Le@@ ave v@@ ote , a min@@ ority have pe@@ dd@@ led the poli@@ tics of fear and ha@@ tre@@ d , cre@@ ating lies and mis@@ trust around , for in@@ st@@ ance , the idea that the v@@ ote on Euro@@ pe could re@@ duce the number of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ lu@@ m@@ -@@ se@@ ek@@ ers coming to Euro@@ pe , when the v@@ ote on le@@ av@@ ing had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion from outside the Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on ."
But for a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ma@@ j@@ ority of the Le@@ ave v@@ oter@@ s the con@@ cer@@ n was dis@@ il@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment with the political e@@ st@@ ab@@ lis@@ h@@ ment .
This re@@ plic@@ ates around Euro@@ pe and much of the liber@@ al democra@@ tic world .
"We see it with the rise in popul@@ ar@@ ity of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing n@@ ation@@ alis@@ m of V@@ ik@@ tor O@@ r@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , with the increase in popul@@ ar@@ ity of Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating liber@@ al , op@@ en , tol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ gen@@ tly need a new vision , a vision of a more tol@@ er@@ ant , inclu@@ sive glob@@ alization , one that b@@ rings people with us rather than le@@ av@@ ing them behind ."
That vision of glob@@ alization is one that has to start by a re@@ cognition of the positive ben@@ ef@@ its of glob@@ alization .
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s a@@ mon@@ g@@ st econom@@ is@@ ts is that f@@ ree tra@@ de , the movement of cap@@ ital , the movement of people across bor@@ ders ben@@ ef@@ it everyone on ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate ."
But glob@@ alization also has re@@ dis@@ tribu@@ tive ef@@ fe@@ cts .
It cre@@ ates win@@ n@@ ers and lo@@ s@@ ers .
"In 200@@ 2 , the for@@ mer S@@ e@@ cre@@ tar@@ y@@ -@@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ of@@ i An@@ n@@ an , gave a spe@@ e@@ ch at Y@@ al@@ e Uni@@ vers@@ ity , and that spe@@ e@@ ch was on the to@@ pi@@ c of inclu@@ sive glob@@ alization ."
That was the spe@@ e@@ ch in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
"But ami@@ d au@@ ster@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ cial c@@ ris@@ is of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed almost without a tra@@ ce ."
G@@ lo@@ b@@ alization has been taken to sup@@ port a ne@@ o@@ liber@@ al ag@@ en@@ da .
It &apos;s per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved to be part of an el@@ ite ag@@ en@@ da rather than something that ben@@ ef@@ its all .
How can we bal@@ ance on the one hand ad@@ dre@@ ss@@ ing fear and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand re@@ fus@@ ing ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly to give in to xen@@ o@@ ph@@ ob@@ ia and n@@ ation@@ alis@@ m ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scienti@@ st , that social science of@@ fer@@ s some plac@@ es to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ formation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a star@@ ting point ."
The first re@@ la@@ tes to the idea of civi@@ c education .
What st@@ ands out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the g@@ ap between publi@@ c per@@ cep@@ tion and em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we re@@ build re@@ spe@@ ct for tru@@ th and evidence into our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es ?
"It has to beg@@ in with education , but it has to start with the re@@ cognition that there are hu@@ ge g@@ ap@@ s ."
The second thing that I think is an op@@ por@@ t@@ unity is the idea to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge more inter@@ action across di@@ verse comm@@ uni@@ ties .
"So for in@@ st@@ ance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast have the high@@ est numbers of im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts , and they are also by far the most tol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the lo@@ w@@ est le@@ vel@@ s of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion that actually are the most ex@@ clu@@ sion@@ ary and in@@ tol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gran@@ ts .
This il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion from the F@@ in@@ an@@ cial T@@ imes po@@ st@@ -@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really st@@ rik@@ ing .
The f@@ our@@ th and fin@@ al idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more responsi@@ ble poli@@ tics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that compar@@ es at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des on glob@@ alization .
I am still Bri@@ tis@@ h .
I am still Euro@@ pe@@ an .
I am still a global ci@@ tiz@@ en .
"For those of us who believe that our id@@ enti@@ ties are not mu@@ tually ex@@ clu@@ sive , we have to all work together to en@@ sure that glob@@ alization takes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t leave people behind ."
O@@ n@@ ly then will we truly re@@ con@@ c@@ ile democra@@ cy and glob@@ alization .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real ple@@ asu@@ re to be here .
I last did a TED T@@ al@@ k I think about seven years ago or so .
I tal@@ ked about sp@@ ag@@ he@@ t@@ ti s@@ au@@ ce .
"And so many people , I gu@@ ess , watch those vi@@ de@@ os ."
"P@@ eople have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about sp@@ ag@@ he@@ t@@ ti s@@ au@@ ce , which is a wonderful thing in the sh@@ or@@ t ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ ven to be less than ide@@ al over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put sp@@ ag@@ he@@ t@@ ti s@@ au@@ ce behind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this mor@@ ning &apos;s s@@ es@@ sion is Th@@ ings We M@@ ake .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most pre@@ ci@@ ous ob@@ jects of his era .
And the man &apos;s name is C@@ arl Norden .
C@@ arl Norden was born in 18@@ 80 .
And he was S@@ w@@ is@@ s .
"And of course , the S@@ w@@ is@@ s can be divi@@ ded into two gener@@ al ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ies : those who make small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , ex@@ pen@@ sive ob@@ jects and those who h@@ and@@ le the money of those who buy small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , ex@@ pen@@ sive ob@@ jects ."
And C@@ arl Norden is very fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly in the for@@ mer c@@ am@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ e@@ der@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ te@@ ch in Z@@ u@@ rich .
"In fact , one of his clas@@ s@@ ma@@ tes is a young man na@@ med L@@ en@@ in who would go on to bre@@ ak small , ex@@ pen@@ sive , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ob@@ jects ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ w@@ is@@ s engine@@ er , C@@ arl ."
And I mean that in its ful@@ le@@ st sense of the word .
"He w@@ ear@@ s thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important mu@@ st@@ ach@@ e ; and he is domin@@ e@@ ering and n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ sis@@ tic and d@@ riv@@ en and has an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary ego ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our days ; and he has very strong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ n@@ ating cur@@ r@@ ent ; and he feel@@ s like a sun@@ tan is a sign of moral we@@ ak@@ ness ; and he d@@ rin@@ ks lots of co@@ f@@ fe@@ e ; and he does his best work s@@ it@@ ting in his mother &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ u@@ rich for h@@ ours in comple@@ te si@@ l@@ ence with nothing but a sli@@ de ru@@ le ."
"In any case , C@@ arl Norden e@@ mi@@ gra@@ tes to the United States just before the F@@ irst World War and se@@ ts up sho@@ p on L@@ af@@ ay@@ et@@ te S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan ."
And he becomes ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the question of how to drop bomb@@ s from an air@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ d@@ ar , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a com@@ plic@@ ated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hundre@@ ds of miles an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to drop an ob@@ ject , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some st@@ ation@@ ary tar@@ get in the face of all kinds of win@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d co@@ ver and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments ."
"And all sor@@ ts of people , mo@@ ving up to the F@@ irst World War and between the war@@ s , tried to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ arly everybody came up sh@@ or@@ t ."
The bomb@@ si@@ ghts that were av@@ a@@ il@@ able were incredi@@ bly c@@ ru@@ de .
But C@@ arl Norden is really the one who cra@@ c@@ ks the co@@ de .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ bly com@@ plic@@ ated de@@ vice .
It w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of le@@ ver@@ s and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and g@@ ad@@ gets and g@@ au@@ ges .
And he makes this com@@ plic@@ ated thing .
"And what he allo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er take this particular ob@@ ject , vis@@ u@@ ally sight the tar@@ get , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as con@@ e of the bom@@ ber , and then they pl@@ u@@ g in the al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the win@@ d and the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the tar@@ get ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bom@@ b .
"And as Norden fam@@ ously says , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore that bombsight came along , bomb@@ s would ro@@ u@@ ti@@ ne@@ ly mis@@ s their tar@@ get by a mil@@ e or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mar@@ k 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ bly exci@@ ted the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like man@@ na from he@@ av@@ en .
"@@ Here was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ irst World War , where mil@@ lions of men f@@ ou@@ ght each other in the tr@@ en@@ ches , getting no@@ where , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a de@@ vice that allowed them to f@@ ly up in the sk@@ ies high ab@@ ove en@@ e@@ my ter@@ ri@@ tory and de@@ stro@@ y wh@@ ate@@ ver they wanted with pin@@ point accu@@ ra@@ cy ."
And the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develo@@ ping the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in per@@ spe@@ ctive , the to@@ tal cost of the Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan project was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most fam@@ ous mil@@ it@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ al project of the modern era .
"And there were people , stra@@ te@@ g@@ is@@ ts , within the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single de@@ vice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and vic@@ tory when it came to the b@@ at@@ tle against the N@@ az@@ is and against the Jap@@ an@@ ese ."
"And for Norden as well , this de@@ vice had incredible moral impor@@ tan@@ ce , because Norden was a com@@ mit@@ ted Chris@@ ti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bombsight as his inven@@ tion , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ stru@@ ment of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of suf@@ fer@@ ing in any kind of war be re@@ duc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you ab@@ solu@@ tely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years lead@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d World War , the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tra@@ ined 5@@ 0,000 bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ex@@ ten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tra@@ in@@ ing s@@ es@@ sions — because these things are essenti@@ ally anal@@ o@@ g compu@@ ters ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to swe@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tured , they will not di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge a single de@@ tai@@ l of this particular de@@ vice to the en@@ e@@ my , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the en@@ e@@ my not get their hands on this ab@@ solu@@ tely essenti@@ al piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Norden bombsight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a ser@@ ies of ar@@ med gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ ro@@ u@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is h@@ and@@ cu@@ f@@ f@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never allowed to be ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ hed .
"And there &apos;s a little in@@ cen@@ di@@ ary de@@ vice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever c@@ ras@@ h@@ es , it will be de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed and there &apos;s no way the en@@ e@@ my can ever get their hands on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ i@@ l .
So what happens during the S@@ econ@@ d World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ i@@ l ."
"In pra@@ c@@ tice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under per@@ fect con@@ ditions ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , con@@ ditions ar@@ en &apos;t per@@ fect ."
"F@@ irst of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers have the ab@@ ility to pro@@ per@@ ly pro@@ gra@@ m an anal@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , it bre@@ ak@@ s down a lot ."
"It &apos;s ful@@ l of all kinds of gy@@ ro@@ sco@@ pes and pul@@ le@@ ys and g@@ ad@@ gets and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ou@@ ght to in the he@@ at of b@@ at@@ tle ."
"Th@@ ir@@ dly , when Norden was making his cal@@ cul@@ ations , he as@@ su@@ med that a plan@@ e would be f@@ ly@@ ing at a rel@@ ati@@ vely s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sho@@ t down ."
So they started f@@ ly@@ ing them at high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des at incredi@@ bly high spe@@ e@@ ds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those con@@ ditions .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight re@@ qui@@ red the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er to make vis@@ u@@ al con@@ t@@ act with the tar@@ get ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It needs cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ y to be really accu@@ rate .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were ab@@ ove C@@ en@@ tral Euro@@ pe between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how in@@ accu@@ rate the Norden bombsight was , there was a fam@@ ous case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the Al@@ lies bomb@@ ed a che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant in L@@ eu@@ na , Ger@@ many ."
And the che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant com@@ pris@@ ed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ res .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the Al@@ lies dro@@ pped 8@@ 5@@ ,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what per@@ cen@@ t@@ age of those bomb@@ s do you think actually lan@@ ded inside the 7@@ 00@@ -@@ ac@@ re peri@@ me@@ ter of the pl@@ ant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that lan@@ ded , 1@@ 6 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The L@@ eu@@ na che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , after one of the most ex@@ ten@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those prec@@ au@@ tions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the N@@ az@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that C@@ arl Norden , as a pro@@ per S@@ w@@ is@@ s , was very en@@ a@@ mor@@ ed of Ger@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he hi@@ red a whole b@@ un@@ ch of them , inclu@@ ding a man na@@ med H@@ er@@ man@@ n L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a comple@@ te set of the plan@@ s for the Norden bombsight to the N@@ az@@ is ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight throu@@ gh@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really s@@ mar@@ t people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve inven@@ ted g@@ ad@@ gets that will forever change our world ."
They &apos;ve inven@@ ted w@@ eb@@ s@@ ites that will al@@ low people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve inven@@ ted some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better ."
"If you go into the mil@@ it@@ ary , you &apos;ll find lots of C@@ arl Nor@@ den@@ s as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ en@@ tag@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very cle@@ ar about how little that means .
"In the Ira@@ q War , at the beginning of the first Ira@@ q War , the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary , the air force , s@@ ent two squ@@ ad@@ ron@@ s of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ i@@ gh@@ ter E@@ ag@@ les to the Ira@@ q@@ i de@@ ser@@ t equ@@ i@@ pped with these five million dol@@ lar ca@@ mer@@ as that allowed them to see the enti@@ re de@@ ser@@ t flo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to de@@ stro@@ y — remem@@ ber the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the Ira@@ q@@ is were lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing at the Is@@ ra@@ el@@ is ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two squ@@ ad@@ ron@@ s was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ers .
"And so they f@@ le@@ w mis@@ sions day and night , and they dro@@ pped thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ si@@ les in an at@@ tem@@ p@@ t to get ri@@ d of this particular s@@ cour@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ di@@ t done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually de@@ stro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ er@@ o , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ apo@@ ns wer@@ en &apos;t accu@@ rate ?
"O@@ h no , they were bri@@ l@@ li@@ an@@ tly accu@@ rate ."
"They could have de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ ls is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to fi@@ gh@@ ting war@@ s .
O@@ r take the b@@ at@@ tle in Af@@ gh@@ anistan .
What is the sign@@ ature we@@ apo@@ n of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Pakis@@ tan ?
It &apos;s the d@@ ron@@ e . What is the d@@ ron@@ e ?
Well it is the grand@@ son of the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bombsight .
It is this we@@ apo@@ n of de@@ vas@@ t@@ ating accu@@ ra@@ cy and prec@@ is@@ ion .
"And over the course of the last six years in Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est Pakis@@ tan , the C@@ I@@ A has flo@@ wn hundre@@ ds of d@@ ron@@ e mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those d@@ ron@@ es to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 su@@ spe@@ cted Pakis@@ tan@@ i and T@@ ali@@ b@@ an mil@@ it@@ an@@ ts ."
Now what is the accu@@ ra@@ cy of those d@@ ron@@ es ?
Well it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordinary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent accu@@ ra@@ cy when it comes to d@@ ron@@ e st@@ r@@ ikes .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be k@@ il@@ led , right ?"
That is one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary re@@ cor@@ ds in the history of modern war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the c@@ ru@@ cial thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same peri@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these d@@ ron@@ es with de@@ vas@@ t@@ ating accu@@ ra@@ cy , the number of at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks , of su@@ i@@ ci@@ de at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks and ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ t at@@ t@@ ac@@ ks , against American for@@ ces in Af@@ gh@@ anistan has increas@@ ed ten@@ f@@ old ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent in k@@ ill@@ ing them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more moti@@ v@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not describ@@ ed to you a success story .
I &apos;ve describ@@ ed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our in@@ fa@@ tu@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more comple@@ x than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the accu@@ ra@@ cy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more impor@@ tan@@ tly , whether you ou@@ ght to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a po@@ st@@ s@@ cri@@ p@@ t to the Norden story of C@@ arl Norden and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bombsight .
"And that is , on Au@@ g@@ ust 6 , 19@@ 45 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bom@@ ber called the E@@ no@@ la G@@ ay f@@ le@@ w over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , dro@@ pped a very large ther@@ mon@@ u@@ cle@@ ar de@@ vice on the city of H@@ i@@ ro@@ sh@@ ima ."
"And as was ty@@ pic@@ al with the Norden bombsight , the bom@@ b actually mis@@ sed its tar@@ get by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the grea@@ test i@@ ron@@ y of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dol@@ lar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dol@@ lar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"Me@@ an@@ while , back in New Y@@ or@@ k , no one told C@@ arl Norden that his bombsight was used over H@@ i@@ ro@@ sh@@ ima ."
He was a com@@ mit@@ ted Chris@@ ti@@ an .
He thought he had design@@ ed something that would re@@ duce the to@@ ll of suf@@ fer@@ ing in war .
It would have bro@@ k@@ en his heart .

That was the reason that I val@@ u@@ ed my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my sis@@ ters and to his d@@ augh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate the intelligence and the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ance of my daughter .
I en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed her to si@@ t with me when my friends used to come .
I en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs .
"And all these good val@@ ues , I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her pers@@ on@@ ality ."
"And this was not only she , only Mal@@ ala ."
"I im@@ par@@ ted all these good val@@ ues to my school , girl students and b@@ oy students as well ."
I used education for e@@ man@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"I t@@ au@@ ght my girls , I t@@ au@@ ght my girl students , to un@@ learn the les@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience ."
I t@@ au@@ ght my b@@ oy students to un@@ learn the les@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ h@@ onor .
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters , we were st@@ riv@@ ing for more ri@@ ghts for women , and we were stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new ph@@ en@@ omenon .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ ghts and partic@@ ularly to women &apos;s ri@@ ghts .
It was called T@@ ali@@ b@@ an@@ iz@@ ation .
"It means a comple@@ te neg@@ ation of women &apos;s par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation in all political , econom@@ ical and social acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of schools were lost .
Gi@@ r@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted from going to school .
W@@ omen were for@@ ced to we@@ ar v@@ ei@@ ls and they were sto@@ pped from going to the marke@@ ts .
"M@@ u@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were si@@ len@@ ced , girls were f@@ log@@ g@@ ed and sing@@ ers were k@@ il@@ led ."
"She wrote a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C blo@@ g , she vol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed her@@ self for the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ imes do@@ cu@@ men@@ tar@@ ies , and she spo@@ ke from every pl@@ at@@ form she could ."
And her vo@@ ice was the most power@@ ful vo@@ ice .
It s@@ pre@@ ad like a cre@@ scen@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an could not tol@@ er@@ ate her c@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n , and on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 9 20@@ 12 , she was sho@@ t in the head at point bl@@ ank ran@@ ge ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black h@@ ole .
"Wh@@ ile my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and death , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of my wife , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be b@@ la@@ med for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ r@@ up@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t bl@@ ame yourself ."
You sto@@ od for the right cause .
"You put your life at st@@ ake for the cause of tru@@ th , for the cause of pe@@ ace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in in@@ spi@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right pa@@ th and G@@ od will prote@@ ct her . &quot; &quot; These few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When Mal@@ ala was in the h@@ os@@ p@@ ital , and she was going through the se@@ v@@ ere pain@@ s and she had had se@@ v@@ ere head@@ ach@@ es because her fac@@ i@@ al ner@@ ve was c@@ ut down , I used to see a dark s@@ ha@@ do@@ w s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing on the face of my wife ."
But my daughter never com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fin@@ e with my cro@@ o@@ ked s@@ mil@@ e and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be o@@ kay . P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ so@@ led us ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sis@@ ters , we learned from her how to be re@@ si@@ li@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d to share with you that de@@ sp@@ ite being an ic@@ on for the ri@@ ghts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old girl ."
She cri@@ es when her h@@ ome@@ work is in@@ comple@@ te .
"She qu@@ ar@@ re@@ ls with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"P@@ eople ask me , what spe@@ cial is in my men@@ tor@@ ship which has made Mal@@ ala so b@@ old and so cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous and so vo@@ cal and po@@ is@@ ed ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not cli@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about ho@@ pe@@ fully con@@ ver@@ ting fear into ho@@ pe .
"When we go to the physi@@ ci@@ an today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re truly af@@ ra@@ id of .
"@@ Di@@ a@@ be@@ tes , can@@ cer , Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , Al@@ z@@ h@@ ei@@ mer &apos;s , heart fa@@ il@@ u@@ re , l@@ un@@ g fa@@ il@@ u@@ re — things that we know are de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating dis@@ eas@@ es , for which there &apos;s rel@@ ati@@ vely little that can be done ."
"And what I want to l@@ ay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will me@@ l@@ t down if you think it already h@@ as@@ n &apos;t , and where we are c@@ lin@@ ically today , and where we might go to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w , and what some of the h@@ ur@@ d@@ les are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 1@@ 8 minutes , I pro@@ mis@@ e ."
"I want to start with this sli@@ de , because this sli@@ de sort of tell@@ s the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an issue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ tic@@ les on the bi@@ on@@ ic human .
It was basically a re@@ gener@@ ative medicine issue .
Re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ arily simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a c@@ lin@@ ically rele@@ v@@ ant ti@@ me@@ scal@@ e .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a da@@ mag@@ ed hi@@ p , you can put an ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial hi@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine used on their fron@@ t co@@ ver .
This is the comple@@ te antithe@@ sis of re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
This is not re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
Re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is what B@@ usiness We@@ ek put up when they did a story about re@@ gener@@ ative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out how to a@@ me@@ li@@ or@@ ate sym@@ pto@@ ms with de@@ vi@@ ces and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will re@@ gener@@ ate lost fun@@ ction of the body by re@@ gener@@ ating the fun@@ ction of org@@ ans and da@@ mag@@ ed tis@@ sue ."
"So that at the end of the treat@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treat@@ ment ."
V@@ ery few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly no@@ vel .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Char@@ les L@@ in@@ d@@ b@@ erg@@ h , who was better known for f@@ ly@@ ing air@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ xis C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the No@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates from R@@ o@@ c@@ kef@@ el@@ ler , to beg@@ in to think about , could you culture org@@ ans ?"
"And they published this book in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually beg@@ an to think about , what could you do in bi@@ o-@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole org@@ ans ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exci@@ ting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my de@@ pres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks ye@@ ster@@ day tal@@ ked about impro@@ ving the qu@@ ality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing po@@ ver@@ ty , and essenti@@ ally increas@@ ing life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy all around the glo@@ be ."
"One of the chall@@ eng@@ es is that the rich@@ er we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more ex@@ pen@@ sive it is to take care of our dis@@ eas@@ es as we get older ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ su@@ s the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can basically see that the rich@@ er a country is , the older the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a partic@@ ularly dra@@ mati@@ c challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a bro@@ k@@ en an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ ma ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at diabe@@ tes , ear@@ ly@@ -@@ on@@ set diabe@@ tes , heart fa@@ il@@ u@@ re , co@@ ron@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease — things that are in@@ her@@ en@@ tly more difficult to treat , and much more ex@@ pen@@ sive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ic@@ s in the U.S. here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; In 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really si@@ ck , pa@@ y@@ ing for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experiencing de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.S@@ ."
"And this is ma@@ t@@ ch@@ ed in every in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized , we@@ al@@ thy country in the world ."
How can you actually af@@ for@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ su@@ s cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ike in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . I@@ f you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individu@@ al sp@@ end on your own health care , pl@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to di@@ e , there &apos;s a sp@@ ike ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dis@@ eas@@ es and experience what I would call heal@@ thy ag@@ ing ."
"I &apos;d sug@@ gest there are four things , and n@@ one of these things inclu@@ de an in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce system or a leg@@ al system ."
A@@ ll those things do is change who pa@@ ys .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tu@@ al cost of the treat@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ra@@ tion health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too de@@ press@@ ing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mon@@ ies should be put into pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of di@@ agno@@ sing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the progre@@ s@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to cu@@ re the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sym@@ pto@@ m ."
"Th@@ ink of it in terms of diabe@@ tes , for in@@ st@@ ance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , with diabe@@ tes , what do we do ?"
"We di@@ agno@@ se the disease even@@ tually , once it becomes sym@@ pto@@ mati@@ c , and then we treat the sym@@ pto@@ m for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ sul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good therap@@ y .
"But even@@ tually it sto@@ ps working , and diabe@@ tes lead@@ s to a predic@@ table on@@ set of de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y cou@@ ldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to re@@ gener@@ ate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sym@@ pto@@ mati@@ c ?"
"And it might be a little bit ex@@ pen@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different ."
"This vi@@ de@@ o , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite dra@@ ma@@ tically ."
This is a new@@ t re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b re@@ generation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is doing this in every org@@ an system of the body , for tis@@ su@@ es and for org@@ ans themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get si@@ ck , the message is we will treat your sym@@ pto@@ ms , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w — and when to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w is we could de@@ b@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ able future — we will talk about re@@ gener@@ ative re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b pros@@ the@@ tic up here , si@@ mil@@ ar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from Ira@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 70 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from Ira@@ q that have lost lim@@ b@@ s .
"I@@ ma@@ gine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the re@@ generation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a w@@ il@@ d con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s app@@ li@@ c@@ able , again , to every org@@ an system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to develo@@ p a con@@ vers@@ ation with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to sw@@ it@@ ch on proc@@ es@@ ses that we knew how to do when we were a fe@@ tu@@ s .
"A ma@@ m@@ m@@ ali@@ an fe@@ tu@@ s , if it lo@@ ses a lim@@ b during the first tri@@ me@@ s@@ ter of pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ NA has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ oun@@ d@@ -@@ heal@@ ing me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lo@@ se their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p in an ac@@ ci@@ dent , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to eng@@ age in that con@@ vers@@ ation with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that al@@ low us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ verse with the body .
The first is cel@@ lu@@ lar therap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ ere@@ fore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ pl@@ ant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , we can use materi@@ als ."
We heard ye@@ ster@@ day about the impor@@ tan@@ ce of new materi@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent materi@@ als , de@@ sign materi@@ als , or ex@@ tra@@ ct materi@@ als from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materi@@ als in@@ duce the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use s@@ mar@@ t de@@ vi@@ ces that will of@@ flo@@ ad the work of the body and al@@ low it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materi@@ als ."
S@@ te@@ ve B@@ ad@@ y@@ la@@ k — who &apos;s at the Uni@@ vers@@ ity of P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh — about a dec@@ ad@@ e ago had a re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble idea .
"And that idea was that the small in@@ tes@@ tin@@ e of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to re@@ ma@@ in bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary fac@@ tors and sign@@ als that would sign@@ al the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that u@@ su@@ ally in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small in@@ tes@@ tin@@ e , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tis@@ su@@ e-@@ speci@@ fi@@ c respon@@ se , or would it make small in@@ tes@@ tin@@ e if I tried to make a new e@@ ar ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t com@@ p@@ el@@ ling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a com@@ p@@ el@@ ling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , for those of you that are even the sli@@ gh@@ test bit squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish — even though you may not like to ad@@ m@@ it it in fron@@ t of your friends — the li@@ ghts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , che@@ ck your B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the scre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabe@@ tic ul@@ cer .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to lau@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diabe@@ tes .
"I think a lot of times we hear about diabe@@ tics , diabe@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t conne@@ ct the ul@@ cer with the even@@ tu@@ al treat@@ ment , which is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sli@@ de up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diabe@@ tic ul@@ cer . It &apos;s tra@@ gi@@ c .
The treat@@ ment for this is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ation .
"This is an older la@@ dy . She has can@@ cer of the li@@ ver as well as diabe@@ tes , and has decided to di@@ e with what &apos; s left of her body in@@ t@@ act ."
"And this la@@ dy decided , after a year of at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted treat@@ ment of that ul@@ cer , that she would try this new therap@@ y that S@@ te@@ ve inven@@ ted ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 1@@ 1 weeks later .
That material con@@ tain@@ ed only natural sign@@ als .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to sw@@ it@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more dis@@ tre@@ ss@@ ing sli@@ des for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a h@@ or@@ se . The h@@ or@@ se is not in pain .
"If the h@@ or@@ se was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sli@@ de ."
The h@@ or@@ se just has another no@@ stri@@ l that &apos;s developed because of a ri@@ ding ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"@@ Just a few weeks after treat@@ ment — in this case , tak@@ ing that material , tur@@ ning it into a ge@@ l , and p@@ ac@@ king that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the treat@@ ment a few times — and the h@@ or@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ at@@ tach@@ ed .
"There are now 4@@ 00@@ ,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ oun@@ ds ."
C@@ ould you re@@ gener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave S@@ te@@ ve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion project to beg@@ in the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dol@@ lar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 year@@ -@@ old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p .
Re@@ mem@@ ber that I men@@ tion@@ ed before the children who lo@@ se their fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps .
Af@@ ter treat@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is c@@ lin@@ ically rele@@ v@@ ant today .
There are materi@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pa@@ t@@ ches .
But could you go a little f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a da@@ mag@@ ed piece of tis@@ sue , put a bi@@ o-@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart mus@@ c@@ le be@@ ating in a dis@@ h .
This was done by T@@ er@@ u@@ o O@@ kano at T@@ o@@ ky@@ o W@@ omen &apos;s H@@ os@@ p@@ ital .
He can actually grow be@@ ating tis@@ sue in a dis@@ h .
"He chil@@ ls the dis@@ h , it changes its pro@@ per@@ ties and he pe@@ el@@ s it right out of the dis@@ h ."
It &apos;s the coo@@ le@@ st stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cel@@ l-@@ based re@@ generation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being re@@ mo@@ ved from the hi@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ g@@ ain , if you &apos;re squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to watch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of co@@ ol .
"So this is a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s o@@ per@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ or@@ e had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ y@@ pas@@ s o@@ per@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mo@@ ved at the beginning of the proc@@ e@@ du@@ re being in@@ je@@ cted di@@ rec@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"@@ Here go the stem cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a bac@@ k@@ -@@ fl@@ us@@ h ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sor@@ ts of new technology , new de@@ vi@@ ces , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a ran@@ dom@@ iz@@ ed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if you take an extre@@ me@@ ly si@@ ck pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their b@@ y@@ pas@@ s , for these particular patients , they be@@ came as@@ y@@ m@@ pto@@ mati@@ c ."
These are now two years out .
"The coo@@ le@@ st thing would be is if you could di@@ agno@@ se the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same proc@@ e@@ du@@ re , but now done min@@ im@@ ally in@@ vas@@ i@@ vely , with only three h@@ oles in the body where they &apos;re tak@@ ing the heart and simply in@@ je@@ c@@ ting stem cells through a l@@ ap@@ aro@@ sco@@ pi@@ c proc@@ e@@ du@@ re ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those de@@ ta@@ il@@ s , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less si@@ ck , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ m@@ pto@@ mati@@ c state through that kind of therap@@ y ."
"@@ Here &apos;s another example of ste@@ m@@ -@@ cell therap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite c@@ lin@@ ical yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey Mar@@ ra from P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ po@@ su@@ ction flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ po@@ su@@ ction flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great s@@ our@@ ce of stem cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are p@@ ac@@ ked in that li@@ po@@ su@@ ction flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ tu@@ ck ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ po@@ su@@ ction flu@@ id , and in this case , the stem cells are is@@ ol@@ ated and turned into neurons ."
A@@ ll done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fai@@ r@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved , or a@@ di@@ po@@ se@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved , stem cells ."
I tal@@ ked before about the use of de@@ vi@@ ces to dra@@ ma@@ tically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I clo@@ se up .
This is equ@@ ally tra@@ gi@@ c .
"We have a very ab@@ id@@ ing and hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with our colle@@ ag@@ ues at the In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for S@@ ur@@ gi@@ cal R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch in the U@@ S A@@ r@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from Ira@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very se@@ ver@@ ely bur@@ ned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ very@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding approach .
"We make something over here , and then we trans@@ pl@@ ant it on@@ to the s@@ ite of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , w@@ ear@@ able bi@@ o-@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been design@@ ed — it should be tes@@ ted c@@ lin@@ ically later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by Jo@@ er@@ g Ger@@ l@@ ach in P@@ it@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bi@@ o-@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will l@@ ay down in the w@@ ound b@@ ed .
The gu@@ n that you see there s@@ pra@@ ys cells .
That &apos;s going to s@@ pra@@ y cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will serve to fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ze the environment , de@@ li@@ ver other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ e@@ fore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ posed to try the so@@ d@@ ding approach ."
It &apos;s a comple@@ tely different way of doing it .
So my 1@@ 8 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very power@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the ima@@ ges kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ bly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary .
Al@@ most every field of science engine@@ ering and c@@ lin@@ ical pra@@ c@@ tice is in@@ vol@@ ved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of govern@@ ments , and a number of re@@ gi@@ ons , have recogn@@ iz@@ ed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Jap@@ an@@ ese govern@@ ment were perhaps the first , when they decided to inv@@ est first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence .
Japan is the ol@@ de@@ st country on ear@@ th in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re pu@@ tting a lot of stra@@ te@@ gi@@ c in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment foc@@ used in this are@@ a .
"The Euro@@ pe@@ an Uni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ed a national tis@@ su@@ e-@@ engine@@ ering center .
The first year bu@@ d@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different approach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ or@@ e to come and be in the real world as pre@@ si@@ dent ."
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of f@@ und things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no stra@@ te@@ gi@@ c in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment to bring all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and foc@@ us them in a car@@ e@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little che@@ ap sho@@ t , at the di@@ rec@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ ming man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ anti from H@@ ar@@ var@@ d went to vis@@ it with him and a number of his di@@ rec@@ tors of his in@@ sti@@ tu@@ te just a few months ago , to try and con@@ vin@@ ce him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and foc@@ us it , in a stra@@ te@@ gi@@ c way , to make sure we can ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the p@@ ace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very te@@ st@@ y me@@ e@@ ting , what the N@@ I@@ H di@@ rec@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vision is lar@@ ger than our appe@@ ti@@ te . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to clo@@ se by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appe@@ ti@@ te ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple re@@ ques@@ t .
"I &apos;d like all of you to p@@ ause for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ch@@ ed we@@ ak@@ lin@@ gs , and take sto@@ ck of your mis@@ er@@ able exis@@ t@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the ad@@ vice that S@@ t@@ . B@@ en@@ e@@ di@@ ct gave his rather star@@ t@@ led follo@@ w@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the ad@@ vice that I decided to fol@@ low myself when I turned 40 .
"U@@ p until that moment , I had been that clas@@ sic cor@@ po@@ rate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was d@@ rin@@ king too much , I was working too hard and I was neg@@ le@@ c@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ dre@@ ss the th@@ or@@ ny issue of work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
"So I ste@@ pped back from the work@@ force , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children ."
But all I learned about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance from that year was that I found it quite easy to bal@@ ance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very us@@ e@@ ful sk@@ ill , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve spent these seven years since stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with , stu@@ dy@@ ing and w@@ ri@@ ting about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
And I have four observ@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an h@@ on@@ est de@@ b@@ ate ."
But the tro@@ u@@ ble is so many people talk so much ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance .
"All the dis@@ c@@ us@@ sions about f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or dre@@ ss@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ days or pater@@ n@@ ity leave only serve to mas@@ k the cor@@ e issue , which is that certain job and car@@ e@@ er cho@@ ic@@ es are fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally in@@ com@@ pati@@ ble with being me@@ an@@ ing@@ fully eng@@ ag@@ ed on a d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day bas@@ is with a young family ."
Now the first ste@@ p in sol@@ ving any problem is ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ging the reality of the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there lead@@ ing lives of qui@@ et , scre@@ am@@ ing des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard h@@ ours at j@@ ob@@ s they ha@@ te to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ pre@@ ss people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my con@@ ten@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in je@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the nu@@ b of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observ@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tru@@ th that govern@@ ments and cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions ar@@ en &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individu@@ als to take contro@@ l and responsi@@ bility for the ty@@ pe of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t de@@ sign your life , someone else will de@@ sign it for you , and you may just not like their idea of bal@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s partic@@ ularly important — this isn &apos;t on the World W@@ i@@ de We@@ b , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s partic@@ ularly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the hands of a com@@ mer@@ cial cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tion ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad compan@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all compan@@ ies .
Because com@@ mer@@ cial compan@@ ies are in@@ her@@ en@@ tly design@@ ed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ NA ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-@@ in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ed compan@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , pu@@ tting chil@@ d@@ care fac@@ ili@@ ties in the work@@ place is wonderful and en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the b@@ loo@@ dy of@@ fi@@ ce ."
We have to be responsi@@ ble for se@@ tting and en@@ for@@ cing the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The th@@ ir@@ d observ@@ ation is we have to be car@@ e@@ ful with the time fra@@ me that we cho@@ ose upo@@ n which to j@@ u@@ dge our bal@@ ance .
"B@@ e@@ fore I went back to work after my year at home , I s@@ at down and I wrote out a de@@ tai@@ led , ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ ste@@ p descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al bal@@ an@@ ced day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : w@@ ake up well res@@ ted after a good night &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ ave sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ ave bre@@ ak@@ fas@@ t with my wife and children .
H@@ ave sex again .
( Laughter ) D@@ ri@@ ve the kids to school on the way to the of@@ fi@@ ce .
Do three h@@ ours &apos; work .
P@@ l@@ ay a s@@ port with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three h@@ ours &apos; work .
Me@@ et some ma@@ tes in the pu@@ b for an early even@@ ing d@@ rin@@ k .
D@@ ri@@ ve home for din@@ ner with my wife and kids .
M@@ ed@@ it@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ ave sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ ave sex again .
G@@ o to b@@ ed .
( Applause ) How of@@ ten do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be re@@ alis@@ tic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate the time fra@@ me upo@@ n which we j@@ u@@ dge the bal@@ ance in our life , but we need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate it without f@@ all@@ ing into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wife has di@@ v@@ or@@ ced me , my health is fa@@ il@@ ing , I &apos;ve got no ma@@ tes or inter@@ e@@ sts left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too sh@@ or@@ t ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A f@@ our@@ th observ@@ ation : We need to approach bal@@ ance in a bal@@ an@@ ced way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ige@@ l , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I re@@ aliz@@ e that my life is comple@@ tely out of bal@@ ance .
It &apos;s to@@ tally domin@@ ated by work .
I work 10 h@@ ours a day ; I com@@ mu@@ te two h@@ ours a day .
A@@ ll of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fai@@ led .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apar@@ t from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a gri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a gy@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a f@@ it 1@@ 0@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day of@@ fi@@ ce r@@ at isn &apos;t more bal@@ an@@ ced ; it &apos;s more f@@ it . ( Laughter )"
"@@ Lo@@ vely though physical exer@@ c@@ ise may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al side ; there &apos;s the e@@ moti@@ onal side ; there &apos;s the spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al side ."
"And to be bal@@ an@@ ced , I believe we have to at@@ tend to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 sto@@ ma@@ ch c@@ run@@ ches ."
Now that can be d@@ au@@ n@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ loo@@ dy h@@ ell mate , I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to get f@@ it ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be d@@ au@@ n@@ ting .
But an in@@ ci@@ dent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spe@@ ctive .
"M@@ y wife , who is some@@ where in the au@@ dience today , called me up at the of@@ fi@@ ce and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ige@@ l , you need to pic@@ k our youn@@ gest son &quot; &quot; — H@@ ar@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that even@@ ing ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pic@@ ked H@@ ar@@ ry up at the school g@@ ates .
"We wal@@ ked down to the lo@@ cal par@@ k , mess@@ ed around on the sw@@ ings , play@@ ed some si@@ l@@ ly g@@ am@@ es ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the lo@@ cal c@@ af@@ e , and we sh@@ ar@@ ed a pi@@ z@@ za for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man pa@@ j@@ a@@ mas ."
"I then read him a ch@@ ap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ a@@ h@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es and the Gi@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to b@@ ed , tu@@ c@@ ked him in , gave him a k@@ is@@ s on his for@@ e@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; Go@@ od@@ night , mate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his be@@ dro@@ om ."
"As I was walking out of his be@@ dro@@ om , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I ha@@ dn &apos;t done anything , ha@@ dn &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ne@@ y World or b@@ ou@@ ght him a P@@ lay@@ st@@ ation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
B@@ e@@ ing more bal@@ an@@ ced doesn &apos;t mean dra@@ mati@@ c up@@ he@@ av@@ al in your life .
"W@@ ith the sm@@ al@@ le@@ st in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment in the right plac@@ es , you can ra@@ dic@@ ally trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ or@@ e@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ i@@ tion of success away from the mo@@ ron@@ ically sim@@ plis@@ tic no@@ tion that the person with the most money when he dies win@@ s , to a more thou@@ ght@@ ful and bal@@ an@@ ced defin@@ i@@ tion of what a life well li@@ ved looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing ."
( Applause )
I mo@@ ved to America 12 years ago with my wife T@@ er@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ ade@@ d every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ tered .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s le@@ av@@ ing mil@@ lions of children behind .
It actually co@@ sts an en@@ orm@@ ous amount to mo@@ p up the da@@ ma@@ ge from the dro@@ po@@ ut c@@ ris@@ is .
But the dro@@ po@@ ut c@@ ris@@ is is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ las@@ s si@@ z@@ es are sm@@ al@@ ler than in many countries .
"The tro@@ u@@ ble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong di@@ re@@ ction ."
"There are three princi@@ pl@@ es on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h@@ es , and they are con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to lab@@ or and most students have to en@@ du@@ re ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ i@@ ght .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t they ?
What schools are en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very n@@ arro@@ w spec@@ tru@@ m of achi@@ ev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to argu@@ e against science and ma@@ th .
"A real education has to give equal w@@ eight to the ar@@ ts , the human@@ iti@@ es , to physical education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achi@@ ev@@ ement to put that particular ab@@ ility out , or to sti@@ f@@ le it ."
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers are the li@@ fe@@ b@@ loo@@ d of the success of schools .
"An old fri@@ end of min@@ e — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ e@@ ting .
The ro@@ le of a teacher is to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate learning .
They should be di@@ agno@@ stic . They should help .
"So in place of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of com@@ pli@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are en@@ cou@@ rag@@ ed to fol@@ low ro@@ u@@ tin@@ e algorith@@ ms rather than to ex@@ c@@ ite that power of ima@@ gin@@ ation and cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t lis@@ ten to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"In@@ ste@@ ad , what we have is a culture of st@@ and@@ ar@@ di@@ z@@ ation ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ land .
M@@ any states in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a head@@ win@@ d all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very stu@@ dent who dro@@ ps out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bi@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very pers@@ on@@ alized .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an organ@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the win@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley ."
S@@ even in@@ ches of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very sh@@ or@@ t peri@@ od .
The whole flo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley was car@@ pe@@ ted in flo@@ w@@ ers for a while .
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers know that .
"And if the movement is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ vol@@ ution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people re@@ ach success and then fai@@ l ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that lead@@ s up to success , but then we get there . We figu@@ re we &apos;ve made it , we si@@ t back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"@@ Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I worked hard , I p@@ us@@ hed myself ."
"But then I sto@@ pped , because I figu@@ red , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just si@@ t back and re@@ la@@ x . &quot; &quot; Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always tried to impro@@ ve and do good work ."
"But then I sto@@ pped because I figu@@ red , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to impro@@ ve any more . &quot; &quot; Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I sto@@ pped , because I figu@@ red I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sho@@ t guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like ma@@ gi@@ c ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative blo@@ ck .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"@@ Re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always foc@@ used on cli@@ ents and pro@@ jects , and ig@@ nor@@ ed the money . Th@@ en all this money started po@@ ur@@ ing in ."
And I got dis@@ tra@@ cted by it .
"And su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I was on the ph@@ one to my sto@@ c@@ k@@ bro@@ ker and my real e@@ state ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my cli@@ ents ."
"And re@@ ach@@ ing success , I always did what I loved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ ag@@ ement . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ag@@ er , but I figu@@ red I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pre@@ si@@ dent of the compan@@ y ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d for@@ med over my head and here I was , ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly very successful , but in@@ war@@ dly very de@@ press@@ ed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a fas@@ t c@@ ar .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fas@@ ter but just as de@@ press@@ ed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m de@@ press@@ ed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy Pro@@ z@@ a@@ c . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti@@ -@@ de@@ press@@ an@@ ts ."
"And ye@@ ah , the black cl@@ ou@@ d f@@ ade@@ d a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just flo@@ ating along . I cou@@ ldn &apos;t care less if cli@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And cli@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer ser@@ ving them , I was only ser@@ ving myself ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jects to others who would serve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for b@@ usiness to drop like a ro@@ ck ."
"M@@ y par@@ t@@ ner and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es , there was no@@ body for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jects I loved .
"I had fu@@ n again , I worked har@@ der and , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ or@@ t , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a quic@@ k tri@@ p .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , b@@ usiness gre@@ w big@@ ger than ever ."
"And when I went back to follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed al@@ together ."
"And I wo@@ ke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need Pro@@ z@@ a@@ c any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and ha@@ ven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a contin@@ u@@ ous j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"And if we want to av@@ oi@@ d &quot; &quot; success@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ syn@@ dro@@ me , &quot; &quot; we just keep follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , because that is not only how we achi@@ eve success , it &apos;s how we su@@ stain it ."
So here is to your contin@@ u@@ ed success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as ad@@ ul@@ ts , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
So this is this gra@@ y stru@@ cture in the center of the brain .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their fun@@ ctions ?
"F@@ irst , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and memor@@ y ."
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qui@@ z .
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
How about stre@@ ss ?
"Y@@ es , stre@@ ss will de@@ cre@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ c@@ am@@ p@@ us ."
"In@@ de@@ ed , it will de@@ cre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
"O@@ h , w@@ ow !@@ "
How about getting older ?
"And then finally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you j@@ u@@ dge that one by yourself .
"So acti@@ vity im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , but that &apos;s not all ."
E@@ than@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ h@@ ol — will de@@ cre@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
M@@ H : I &apos;m really interes@@ ted in the run@@ ning thing .
Do I have to ru@@ n ?
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pl@@ an , but in order for me to tell you what that pl@@ an is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of se@@ ts the st@@ age ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at presen@@ t@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figu@@ re out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the big@@ gest of the em@@ pi@@ res on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Bri@@ tis@@ h E@@ m@@ pi@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ ma@@ gine trying to ru@@ n the show , trying to ru@@ n the enti@@ re planet , without compu@@ ters , without tele@@ ph@@ ones , with data h@@ and@@ w@@ rit@@ ten on pie@@ ces of pap@@ er , and tra@@ vel@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the V@@ ic@@ tori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was a@@ maz@@ ing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ is@@ tra@@ tive machine .
"In order to have that machine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic ad@@ min@@ is@@ tra@@ tive machine .
They must be id@@ en@@ tical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good h@@ and@@ w@@ ri@@ ting , because the data is h@@ and@@ w@@ rit@@ ten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multi@@ plic@@ ation , di@@ vision , ad@@ dition and sub@@ tra@@ ction in their head ."
They must be so id@@ en@@ tical that you could pic@@ k one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and he would be in@@ st@@ an@@ tly fun@@ c@@ tional .
The V@@ ic@@ tori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ er@@ ed a system that was so ro@@ b@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , contin@@ u@@ ously produc@@ ing id@@ en@@ tical people for a machine that no longer exis@@ ts ."
"The em@@ pi@@ re is gone , so what are we doing with that de@@ sign that produc@@ es these id@@ en@@ tical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong com@@ ment there .
"I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bro@@ k@@ en .
It &apos;s quite fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s bro@@ k@@ en .
It &apos;s not bro@@ k@@ en . It &apos;s wonder@@ fully con@@ stru@@ cted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s out@@ d@@ ated .
What are the kind of j@@ ob@@ s that we have today ?
"Well , the cl@@ er@@ ks are the compu@@ ters ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every of@@ fi@@ ce .
And you have people who gu@@ i@@ de those compu@@ ters to do their cl@@ er@@ ical j@@ ob@@ s .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to wr@@ ite beau@@ ti@@ fully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multi@@ ply numbers in their head@@ s .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ing@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ ob@@ s of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in wh@@ ate@@ ver way they want ."
How is presen@@ t@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ par@@ e them for that world ?
"Well , I bu@@ m@@ ped into this whole thing comple@@ tely by ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I used to te@@ ach people how to wr@@ ite computer pro@@ gra@@ ms in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a s@@ lu@@ m ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to wr@@ ite computer pro@@ gra@@ ms ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of par@@ ents , rich people , who had compu@@ ters , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with compu@@ ters ."
"And my daughter — o@@ h , su@@ re@@ ly she is ex@@ tra@@ -@@ intel@@ lig@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ d@@ den@@ ly figu@@ red that , how come all the rich people are having these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ arily gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a h@@ ole in the b@@ oun@@ d@@ ary w@@ all of the s@@ lu@@ m next to my of@@ fi@@ ce , and stu@@ ck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Inter@@ net was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we to@@ u@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I@@ f you w@@ ish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight h@@ ours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s im@@ possible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; M@@ y colle@@ ag@@ ues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple sol@@ ution ."
"One of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the m@@ ou@@ se . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 miles out of D@@ el@@ h@@ i into a really re@@ m@@ ote village where the chan@@ ces of a pas@@ sing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are develo@@ p@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to st@@ ay , so I stu@@ ck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fas@@ ter proc@@ ess@@ or and a better m@@ ou@@ se . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ rit@@ ated vo@@ ice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to te@@ ach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; te@@ ach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so c@@ asu@@ ally ."
Here &apos;s a sh@@ or@@ t g@@ lim@@ pse from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the H@@ ole in the W@@ all .
O@@ n your right is an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old .
To his left is his stu@@ dent . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teach@@ ing her how to bro@@ w@@ se .
"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all fil@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; An ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old telling his el@@ der sis@@ ter what to do .
"And finally a girl explain@@ ing in Mar@@ ath@@ i what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a proc@@ ess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publis@@ hing ."
"I published every@@ where . I wrote down and measu@@ red everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will re@@ ach the same st@@ and@@ ard as an of@@ fi@@ ce se@@ cre@@ tar@@ y in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cu@@ ri@@ ous to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experi@@ men@@ ting with other sub@@ jects , a@@ mon@@ g them , for example , pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one comm@@ unity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose English pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pro@@ n@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would impro@@ ve their j@@ ob@@ s ."
"I gave them a spe@@ ech@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ te@@ x@@ t en@@ gine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it ty@@ pes what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter : N@@ ice to me@@ et y@@ ou@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ d : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
S@@ ug@@ a@@ ta M@@ it@@ ra : The reason I en@@ ded with the face of this young la@@ dy over there is because I su@@ spe@@ ct many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call center in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have tor@@ tured you about your cre@@ di@@ t car@@ d bil@@ ls in a very cle@@ ar English ac@@ cent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Wh@@ ere does it stop ?
I decided I would de@@ stro@@ y my own argu@@ ment by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ position .
"I made a hy@@ pothe@@ sis , a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous hy@@ pothe@@ sis ."
"T@@ ami@@ l is a s@@ ou@@ th Indi@@ an language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ speak@@ ing children in a s@@ ou@@ th Indi@@ an village learn the bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy of D@@ NA re@@ plic@@ ation in English from a stre@@ et@@ side computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a z@@ er@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another z@@ er@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called Kal@@ lik@@ up@@ pa@@ m in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all compu@@ ters there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ade@@ d all kinds of stuff from the Inter@@ net about D@@ NA re@@ plic@@ ation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came rus@@ hing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very to@@ pic@@ al , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms and che@@ mis@@ try ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pe@@ d@@ ag@@ ogi@@ cal me@@ tho@@ d , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I ha@@ ven &apos;t the fo@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a z@@ er@@ o . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve under@@ sto@@ od nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I expe@@ ct ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We ha@@ ven &apos;t given up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these scre@@ ens and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she ra@@ is@@ ed her hand , and she says to me in bro@@ k@@ en T@@ ami@@ l and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , apar@@ t from the fact that impro@@ per re@@ plic@@ ation of the D@@ NA mole@@ cu@@ le c@@ au@@ ses disease , we ha@@ ven &apos;t under@@ sto@@ od anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tes@@ ted them ."
"I got an educ@@ ational im@@ possi@@ bility , z@@ er@@ o to 30 percent in two months in the tro@@ pic@@ al he@@ at with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a dec@@ ad@@ e a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the V@@ ic@@ tori@@ an nor@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fai@@ l .
How do I get them to pas@@ s ? I have to get them 20 more mar@@ ks .
"I cou@@ ldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl who was an ac@@ coun@@ tant and she play@@ ed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ tho@@ d of the grand@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ t@@ and behind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , w@@ ow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next p@@ age ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what gran@@ ni@@ es do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The s@@ cor@@ es j@@ um@@ ped to 50 percent .
"K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ pa@@ m had c@@ au@@ ght up with my contro@@ l school in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , a rich p@@ riv@@ ate school with a tra@@ ined bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the pl@@ aying field .
Here &apos;s Kal@@ lik@@ up@@ pa@@ m .
( Ch@@ il@@ dren speak@@ ing ) N@@ eu@@ ron@@ s ... comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ation .
"I got the ca@@ mera ang@@ le wrong . That one is just ama@@ teu@@ r stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ ob@@ s going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children po@@ ur@@ ing over with their mo@@ bil@@ e ph@@ ones on the one hand and then re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ tly going to school to pic@@ k up their bo@@ o@@ ks with their other hand ."
What will it be to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a de@@ vas@@ t@@ ating question , a question that was fra@@ med for me by N@@ ich@@ ol@@ as N@@ eg@@ ro@@ pon@@ te — could it be that we are head@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are h@@ omo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens .
"K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ap@@ e st@@ and up and become H@@ omo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
What an achi@@ ev@@ ement that is .
But we have to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te that into our own future .
En@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment seems to be the ke@@ y .
"If you look at K@@ up@@ pa@@ m , if you look at all of the experi@@ ments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; s@@ al@@ u@@ ting learning ."
There is evidence from neuro@@ science .
"The re@@ p@@ ti@@ li@@ an part of our brain , which s@@ its in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ u@@ ts down everything else , it sh@@ u@@ ts down the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ u@@ ts all of that down ."
P@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ a@@ ts .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res when you needed those people who can survi@@ ve under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re st@@ anding in a tr@@ en@@ ch all alone , if you could have survi@@ ved , you &apos;re o@@ kay , you &apos;ve pas@@ sed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fai@@ led ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res is gone .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that bal@@ ance back from thre@@ at to ple@@ asu@@ re .
I came back to Eng@@ land looking for Bri@@ tis@@ h grand@@ mothers .
"I put out no@@ tic@@ es in pap@@ ers saying , if you are a Bri@@ tis@@ h grand@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a we@@ b ca@@ mera , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per week for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more Bri@@ tis@@ h grand@@ mothers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ ny C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ ny C@@ l@@ ou@@ d s@@ its on the Inter@@ net .
"If there &apos;s a child in tro@@ u@@ ble , we be@@ am a G@@ ran ."
She goes on over S@@ ky@@ pe and she sor@@ ts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called D@@ ig@@ g@@ les in nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n Eng@@ land , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ ami@@ l N@@ ad@@ u , India , 6@@ ,000 miles away ."
She does it with only one ag@@ e-@@ old ge@@ stu@@ re .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ atch this .
G@@ ran@@ d@@ mother : You can &apos;t c@@ atch me . You say it . You can &apos;t c@@ atch me .
Ch@@ il@@ dren : You can &apos;t c@@ atch me . G@@ ran@@ d@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read Man@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an . G@@ ran@@ d@@ mother : Well done ! V@@ ery good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the pro@@ du@@ ct of educ@@ ational self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"If you al@@ low the educ@@ ational process to self-@@ organ@@ ize , then learning emer@@ ges ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about le@@ tting it happen .
The teacher se@@ ts the process in mo@@ tion and then she st@@ ands back in a@@ we and w@@ at@@ ches as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is poin@@ ting at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I in@@ tend to build these S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ rg@@ an@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are basically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , col@@ lab@@ or@@ ation and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ment put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ il@@ dren talking ) This one is in Eng@@ land .
"He main@@ tain@@ s la@@ w and order , because remem@@ ber , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
Gi@@ r@@ l : The to@@ tal number of elec@@ trons is not equal to the to@@ tal number of pro@@ ton@@ s — S@@ M : Au@@ st@@ r@@ al@@ ia Gi@@ r@@ l : — giving it a net positive or neg@@ ative electri@@ cal char@@ ge .
The net char@@ ge on an ion is equal to the number of pro@@ ton@@ s in the ion min@@ us the number of elec@@ trons .
S@@ M : A dec@@ ad@@ e a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when S@@ ton@@ e A@@ ge men and women used to si@@ t and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing li@@ ghts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those won@@ dro@@ us questions ."
We &apos;ve bro@@ ught it down to the tan@@ g@@ ent of an ang@@ le .
But that &apos;s not sex@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; I@@ f a me@@ te@@ or@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you figu@@ re out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ c word . It &apos;s called the tan@@ g@@ ent of an ang@@ le , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll figu@@ re it out ."
So here are a couple of ima@@ ges from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world beg@@ in ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we bre@@ a@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ is@@ es the question , and then st@@ ands back and ad@@ mi@@ res the answer ."
So what &apos;s my w@@ ish ?
M@@ y w@@ ish is that we de@@ sign the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be s@@ par@@ e parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to de@@ sign a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — h@@ ang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
M@@ y w@@ ish is to help de@@ sign a future of learning by sup@@ por@@ ting children all over the world to ta@@ p into their won@@ der and their ab@@ ility to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these intel@@ le@@ ctu@@ al ad@@ ven@@ tures d@@ riv@@ en by the big questions which their me@@ dia@@ tors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ ility where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ ility which is pra@@ c@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one gran@@ ny who man@@ ages health and sa@@ fe@@ ty .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The li@@ ghts are turned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ pose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ rg@@ an@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning En@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clu@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great do@@ cu@@ ment produc@@ ed by TED which tell@@ s you how to do it .
"If you would ple@@ ase , ple@@ ase do it across all five contin@@ ents and sen@@ d me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the S@@ cho@@ ol of C@@ l@@ ou@@ ds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my w@@ ish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as .
"A@@ t 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et , where the air is th@@ in , I once built two H@@ ole in the W@@ all compu@@ ters , and the children f@@ loc@@ ked there ."
And there was this little girl who was follo@@ wing me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her qui@@ e@@ tly ."
"She su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ra@@ is@@ ed her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; G@@ et on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good ad@@ vice .
I &apos;ll fol@@ low her ad@@ vice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . W@@ ow . ( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galax@@ y , the Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
"And if you take a ca@@ mera and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ u@@ tter op@@ en , as long as your ca@@ mera is at@@ tach@@ ed to the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ ele@@ sco@@ pe , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little blo@@ b@@ s is a galax@@ y ro@@ u@@ gh@@ ly the si@@ ze of our Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those blo@@ b@@ s .
There are appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely a hundred billion galaxies in the observ@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich tell@@ s you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly beautiful .
"I &apos;ve of@@ ten wonder@@ ed , what is the evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary pres@@ sure that made our an@@ c@@ es@@ tors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t ad@@ ap@@ t and evol@@ ve to really en@@ j@@ oy pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cos@@ mo@@ logis@@ t , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big clu@@ e we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and measu@@ red its ve@@ loc@@ ity , it would be mo@@ ving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galax@@ y even far@@ ther away , it would be mo@@ ving away fas@@ ter ."
So we say the universe is expan@@ ding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were clo@@ se@@ r together ."
"In the past , the universe was more den@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you squ@@ e@@ ez@@ e things together , the tem@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the Big Bang , was also very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surpris@@ e .
The air in this room is very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just s@@ mo@@ o@@ the@@ d themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the con@@ ditions ne@@ ar the Big Bang are very , very different than the con@@ ditions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot den@@ se@@ r ."
The gra@@ vit@@ ational pul@@ l of things was a lot st@@ ron@@ ger ne@@ ar the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ed into a re@@ gi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that squ@@ e@@ ez@@ ing without any im@@ per@@ fe@@ ctions , without any little spo@@ ts where there were a few more atoms than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed under the gra@@ vit@@ ational pul@@ l into a hu@@ ge black h@@ ole ."
"K@@ e@@ ep@@ ing the universe very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a de@@ li@@ c@@ ate ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment ."
It &apos;s a clu@@ e that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en ran@@ dom@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was given to us by L@@ u@@ d@@ wi@@ g Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n , an Au@@ stri@@ an physi@@ c@@ is@@ t in the 19@@ th century ."
And Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n &apos;s con@@ tribu@@ tion was that he hel@@ ped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the ran@@ dom@@ ness , the dis@@ order , the cha@@ oti@@ c@@ ness of some syste@@ ms ."
Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n gave us a for@@ mu@@ la — en@@ gra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ sto@@ ne now — that really qu@@ anti@@ fi@@ es what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t no@@ tice , so that ma@@ cro@@ sco@@ pic@@ ally it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t no@@ tice each individu@@ al ato@@ m ."
A low entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
"This is a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of thermo@@ dy@@ na@@ mi@@ cs — the la@@ w that says that entropy increas@@ es in the universe , or in some is@@ ol@@ ated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy increas@@ es is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it le@@ av@@ es something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy increas@@ es , by the way , is what &apos;s behind what we call the arro@@ w of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increas@@ ing — the fact that you can remem@@ ber the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you di@@ e , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increas@@ ing ."
"B@@ ol@@ tz@@ man@@ n explain@@ ed that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a re@@ f@@ le@@ ction of the fact that the early universe was very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cos@@ mo@@ logis@@ ts .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough at@@ ten@@ tion to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cos@@ mo@@ logis@@ t , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ i@@ char@@ d F@@ ey@@ n@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a ser@@ ies of a b@@ un@@ ch of different le@@ c@@ tures ."
"He gave the po@@ pu@@ lar le@@ c@@ tures that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The Char@@ ac@@ ter of P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal La@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave le@@ c@@ tures to C@@ al@@ te@@ ch under@@ gra@@ ds that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man Le@@ c@@ tures on P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; He gave le@@ c@@ tures to C@@ al@@ te@@ ch gra@@ du@@ ate students that be@@ came &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man Le@@ c@@ tures on G@@ ra@@ vit@@ ation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these bo@@ o@@ ks , every one of these se@@ ts of le@@ c@@ tures , he em@@ ph@@ as@@ iz@@ ed this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy con@@ tent , and since then the entropy has increas@@ ed ."
The arro@@ w of time cannot be comple@@ tely under@@ sto@@ od until the my@@ ster@@ y of the begin@@ n@@ ings of the history of the universe are re@@ duc@@ ed still f@@ ur@@ ther from spe@@ cul@@ ation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Su@@ re@@ ly , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figu@@ red it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figu@@ red it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten worse , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something c@@ ru@@ cial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating .
The universe is not only expan@@ ding .
"If you look at the galax@@ y , it &apos;s mo@@ ving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be mo@@ ving away fas@@ ter ."
Indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al galaxies are spe@@ e@@ ding away from us fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter so we say the universe is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating .
"U@@ n@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at le@@ ast have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that em@@ p@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little cu@@ bi@@ c cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radi@@ ation or wh@@ ate@@ ver , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , ac@@ cor@@ ding to Einstein , exer@@ ts a p@@ us@@ h on the universe ."
It is a per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al im@@ pul@@ se that p@@ us@@ h@@ es galaxies apar@@ t from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not di@@ lu@@ te away as the universe expan@@ ds ."
"The amount of energy in each cu@@ bi@@ c cen@@ ti@@ me@@ ter re@@ main@@ s the same , even as the universe gets big@@ ger and big@@ ger ."
This has c@@ ru@@ cial im@@ plic@@ ations for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will ex@@ p@@ and forever ."
"B@@ ack when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would re@@ col@@ l@@ ap@@ se in the future .
Einstein was fon@@ d of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expan@@ ding forever and ever and ever ."
"@@ 14 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"Me@@ an@@ while , for all in@@ ten@@ ts and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ p@@ ace may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite re@@ gi@@ on of space that we have ac@@ c@@ ess to , sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by a h@@ oriz@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on forever , space is li@@ mi@@ ted to us ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , em@@ p@@ ty space has a tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ a@@ w@@ king told us that a black h@@ ole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually em@@ its radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ coun@@ t quantum me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time around the black h@@ ole b@@ rings to life the quantum me@@ chan@@ ical fluctu@@ ation , and the black h@@ ole ra@@ dia@@ tes ."
"A prec@@ is@@ ely si@@ mil@@ ar cal@@ cul@@ ation by H@@ a@@ w@@ king and G@@ ary Gi@@ b@@ b@@ ons showed that if you have dark energy in em@@ p@@ ty space , then the whole universe ra@@ dia@@ tes ."
The energy of em@@ p@@ ty space b@@ rings to life quantum fluctu@@ ations .
"And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radi@@ ation will di@@ lu@@ te away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ mal fluctu@@ ations , even in em@@ p@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of g@@ as that las@@ ts forever .
Well what is the im@@ plic@@ ation of that ?
That im@@ plic@@ ation was stu@@ died by Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy increas@@ es because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a prob@@ ab@@ il@@ is@@ tic sta@@ te@@ ment .
"It will probably increase , and the prob@@ ab@@ ility is en@@ orm@@ ously hu@@ ge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all g@@ a@@ ther@@ ing over one part of the room and suf@@ foc@@ ating us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ lik@@ ely ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they loc@@ ked the do@@ ors and k@@ ep@@ t us here liter@@ ally forever , that would happen ."
"E@@ very@@ thing that is allowed , every con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion that is allowed to be ob@@ tain@@ ed by the mole@@ cul@@ es in this room , would even@@ tually be ob@@ tain@@ ed ."
"So Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the expan@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were explain@@ ed by I@@ sa@@ a@@ c Ne@@ w@@ ton — they were ab@@ solu@@ te ; they just stu@@ ck there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air mole@@ cul@@ es were just s@@ pre@@ ad out even@@ ly every@@ where — the everything mole@@ cul@@ es .
"But if you &apos;re Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n , you know that if you wa@@ it long enough , the ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ations of those mole@@ cul@@ es will occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally bring them into lower entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will ex@@ p@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctu@@ ations into lower entropy , more organiz@@ ed s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very moder@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding ideas — the multi@@ verse and the anthro@@ pi@@ c princi@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber , life itself de@@ pen@@ ds on the arro@@ w of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ ze , wal@@ k and talk , if we li@@ ved in ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ i@@ tely big universe , with ran@@ dom@@ ly bu@@ m@@ ping into each other particles , there will occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally be small fluctu@@ ations in the lower entropy states , and then they re@@ la@@ x back ."
But there will also be large fluctu@@ ations .
"O@@ cc@@ as@@ ion@@ ally , you will make a planet or a star or a galax@@ y or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n says , we will only live in the part of the multi@@ verse , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ i@@ tely big set of fluctu@@ ating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the re@@ gi@@ on where entropy is low .
M@@ aybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your h@@ ome@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment is to really think about this , to con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate what it means ."
"C@@ arl S@@ ag@@ an once fam@@ ously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an ap@@ ple pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In Bol@@ tz@@ man@@ n &apos;s scen@@ ario , if you want to make an ap@@ ple pi@@ e , you just wa@@ it for the ran@@ dom mo@@ tion of atoms to make you an ap@@ ple pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more fre@@ qu@@ en@@ tly than the ran@@ dom mo@@ tions of atoms making you an ap@@ ple or@@ char@@ d and some sug@@ ar and an o@@ ven , and then making you an ap@@ ple pi@@ e ."
So this scen@@ ario makes predic@@ tions .
And the predic@@ tions are that the fluctu@@ ations that make us are min@@ ima@@ l .
"E@@ ven if you imagine that this room we are in now exis@@ ts and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our memor@@ ies , but our im@@ pres@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ te@@ ch and the United States and the Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y , it &apos;s much eas@@ i@@ er for all those im@@ pres@@ sions to ran@@ dom@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to ran@@ dom@@ ly fluctu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ te@@ ch , the United States and the galax@@ y ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ e@@ fore , this scen@@ ario does not work ; it is not right ."
This scen@@ ario predic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ ima@@ l fluctu@@ ation .
"E@@ ven if you left our galax@@ y out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ ey@@ n@@ man also under@@ sto@@ od this .
"F@@ ey@@ n@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ pothe@@ sis that the world is a fluctu@@ ation , all the predic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were du@@ e to a fluctu@@ ation , we would not expe@@ ct order any@@ where but where we have just no@@ tic@@ ed it ."
We ther@@ e@@ fore con@@ clu@@ de the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctu@@ ation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ su@@ s the universe that really exis@@ ts ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is expan@@ ding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ main@@ s around , the stars around us will use up their nu@@ cle@@ ar fu@@ el , they will stop bur@@ ning ."
They will f@@ all into black h@@ oles .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black h@@ oles .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has li@@ ved .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black h@@ oles don &apos;t last forever .
"They will ev@@ apo@@ rate , and we will be left with nothing but em@@ p@@ ty space ."
That em@@ p@@ ty space las@@ ts essenti@@ ally forever .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , you no@@ tice , since em@@ p@@ ty space gi@@ ves off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ mal fluctu@@ ations , and it c@@ y@@ c@@ les around all the different possible com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom that exis@@ t in em@@ p@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe las@@ ts forever , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can possi@@ bly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a peri@@ od of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"N@@ um@@ ber one : I@@ f the universe las@@ ts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ for@@ table af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang ?"
Why ar@@ en &apos;t we in em@@ p@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be li@@ ving , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fluctu@@ ation out of the no@@ thin@@ gn@@ ess .
Why ar@@ en &apos;t you ?
M@@ or@@ e h@@ ome@@ work as@@ sign@@ ment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ario .
Ei@@ ther it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a b@@ ru@@ te fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop asking questions .
O@@ r maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"An eg@@ g , an un@@ bro@@ k@@ en eg@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion , and yet , when we op@@ en our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ato@@ r , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ ah , how surpris@@ ing to find this low entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion in our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ato@@ r . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an eg@@ g is not a clo@@ sed system ; it comes out of a ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en ."
M@@ aybe the universe comes out of a univers@@ al ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en .
"M@@ aybe there is something that na@@ tur@@ ally , through the growth of the la@@ ws of physics , gi@@ ves rise to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much big@@ ger multi@@ verse ."
That &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite scen@@ ario .
So the organiz@@ ers asked me to end with a b@@ old spe@@ cul@@ ation .
M@@ y b@@ old spe@@ cul@@ ation is that I will be ab@@ solu@@ tely vin@@ dic@@ ated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my cur@@ r@@ ent w@@ il@@ d ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tru@@ ths by the scienti@@ fi@@ c and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much lar@@ ger multi@@ verse .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compar@@ e to observ@@ ations ."
This is a predic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human ra@@ ce about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exci@@ ting to think we may finally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The in@@ du@@ stri@@ al era started two secon@@ ds ago .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has accu@@ mu@@ lated through human history , and right now , technology ad@@ van@@ ces extre@@ me@@ ly rap@@ id@@ ly — that is the pro@@ x@@ ima@@ te cause , that &apos;s why we are cur@@ ren@@ tly so very produc@@ tive ."
"If we look under the ho@@ od , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little lar@@ ger , it maybe also has a few tri@@ c@@ ks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese in@@ visi@@ ble differences cannot be too com@@ plic@@ ated , ho@@ w@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ c@@ es@@ tor ."
We know that com@@ plic@@ ated me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms take a long time to evol@@ ve .
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed , and everything we care about , de@@ pen@@ ds c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally on some rel@@ ati@@ vely min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
You would have human program@@ mer@@ s that would pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ing@@ ly h@@ and@@ cra@@ ft kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ite@@ ms .
"But since then , a para@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial intelligence ."
"T@@ o@@ day , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than h@@ and@@ cra@@ f@@ ting kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge re@@ presen@@ t@@ ations and fe@@ atures , we create algorith@@ ms that learn , of@@ ten from ra@@ w per@@ cep@@ tu@@ al data ."
B@@ as@@ ically the same thing that the human in@@ f@@ ant does .
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same power@@ ful , cro@@ ss@@ -@@ doma@@ in ab@@ ility to learn and pl@@ an as a human being has ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tru@@ th is no@@ body really kno@@ ws ."
This comes down to physics .
"A bi@@ ologi@@ cal neu@@ ron fi@@ res , maybe , at 200 her@@ t@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a presen@@ t@@ -@@ day trans@@ is@@ tor o@@ per@@ ates at the G@@ ig@@ a@@ her@@ t@@ z .
"N@@ eu@@ ron@@ s pro@@ pag@@ ate s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly in ax@@ ons , 100 me@@ ters per second , to@@ ps ."
"But in compu@@ ters , sign@@ als can tra@@ vel at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"So the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al for super@@ intelligence lies d@@ or@@ man@@ t in matter , much like the power of the ato@@ m l@@ ay d@@ or@@ man@@ t throu@@ gh@@ out human history , pati@@ en@@ tly w@@ ai@@ ting there until 19@@ 45 ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence ex@@ plo@@ sion .
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment , maybe even@@ tually we get to ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e-@@ level ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village idi@@ ot ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial intelligence ."
"And a few mo@@ ments later , we are be@@ y@@ on@@ d E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The tra@@ in doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ u@@ man@@ v@@ il@@ le S@@ t@@ ation .
"It &apos;s lik@@ ely , rather , to s@@ wo@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations , partic@@ ularly when it comes to questions of power ."
"O@@ n@@ ce there is super@@ intelligence , the f@@ ate of human@@ ity may de@@ p@@ end on what the super@@ intelligence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ach@@ ine intelligence is the last inven@@ tion that human@@ ity will ever need to make .
"M@@ ach@@ ines will then be better at inven@@ ting than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on dig@@ ital ti@@ me@@ scal@@ es ."
What this means is basically a tele@@ sco@@ ping of the future .
"All of this super@@ intelligence could develo@@ p , and possi@@ bly quite rap@@ id@@ ly ."
"Now , a super@@ intelligence with such technologi@@ cal ma@@ tur@@ ity would be extre@@ me@@ ly power@@ ful , and at le@@ ast in some scen@@ ar@@ ios , it would be able to get what it wan@@ ts ."
We would then have a future that would be shap@@ ed by the pre@@ fer@@ en@@ ces of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
Here it gets tri@@ c@@ ki@@ er .
"To make any head@@ way with this , we must first of all av@@ oi@@ d anthropo@@ mor@@ ph@@ iz@@ ing ."
"And this is i@@ ron@@ ic because every new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ar@@ tic@@ le about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ c@@ ei@@ ve of the issue more ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tly , not in terms of vi@@ vi@@ d H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wo@@ od scen@@ ar@@ ios ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ation process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions ."
A super@@ intelligence is a really strong op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ation process .
"This means that there is no nec@@ ess@@ ary conne@@ ction between being high@@ ly intel@@ lig@@ ent in this sense , and having an ob@@ je@@ ctive that we human@@ s would find wor@@ th@@ while or me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful ."
S@@ up@@ pose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make human@@ s s@@ mil@@ e .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becomes super@@ intel@@ lig@@ ent , it re@@ aliz@@ es that there is a more ef@@ fe@@ ctive way to achi@@ eve this go@@ al : take contro@@ l of the world and sti@@ ck elec@@ tro@@ des into the fac@@ i@@ al mus@@ c@@ les of human@@ s to cause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing g@@ rin@@ s ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , sup@@ pose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical problem ."
This is a les@@ son that &apos;s also t@@ au@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
"He to@@ uch@@ es his daughter , she turns into g@@ old ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts sti@@ c@@ king elec@@ tro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not nec@@ ess@@ arily so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn de@@ pen@@ dent on the system — like , where is the off sw@@ it@@ ch to the Inter@@ net ?"
They cer@@ tain@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"The point is , we should not be con@@ fi@@ dent that we have this under contro@@ l here ."
"So we dis@@ conne@@ ct the e@@ ther@@ net c@@ able to create an air g@@ ap , but again , like mer@@ ely human h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ro@@ u@@ ti@@ ne@@ ly trans@@ gre@@ ss air g@@ ap@@ s using social engine@@ ering ."
"M@@ or@@ e cre@@ ative scen@@ ar@@ ios are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can imagine w@@ ig@@ g@@ ling elec@@ tro@@ des around in your inter@@ n@@ al cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry to create ra@@ dio w@@ av@@ es that you can use to comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fai@@ r@@ ly op@@ ti@@ mis@@ tic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that us@@ es its intelligence to learn what we val@@ ue , and its moti@@ v@@ ation system is con@@ stru@@ cted in such a way that it is moti@@ v@@ ated to pur@@ sue our val@@ ues or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it predic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us le@@ verage its intelligence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of val@@ u@@ e-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
The in@@ iti@@ al con@@ ditions for the intelligence ex@@ plo@@ sion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a contro@@ l@@ led de@@ ton@@ ation .
Here is the wor@@ ry : M@@ ak@@ ing super@@ intel@@ lig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard challenge .
"So I think that we should work out a sol@@ ution to the contro@@ l problem in ad@@ van@@ ce , so that we have it av@@ a@@ il@@ able by the time it is needed ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out o@@ kay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really ma@@ tter@@ ed was to get this thing right ."
"@@ Not your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and wr@@ ite something more fu@@ n .
And I came up with an idea that I would wr@@ ite a co@@ ok@@ book .
Can any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I co@@ ver the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are id@@ en@@ tical ."
V@@ is@@ ion is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cogni@@ tive il@@ lu@@ sions , or dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making il@@ lu@@ sions , in the same way ."
"G@@ er@@ many is on the left , and Au@@ st@@ ria is on the right ."
"The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"P@@ eople don &apos;t che@@ ck , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"All these medic@@ ations , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pul@@ l the pati@@ ent back and try i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exam@@ pl@@ es on ir@@ ra@@ tional dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ making .
"Now , week@@ end in Par@@ is , week@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ f@@ fe@@ e , you have to p@@ ay for it yourself , it &apos;s two eu@@ ros 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ minu@@ te da@@ tes .
"I &apos;ll show you ima@@ ges here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of T@@ om , and a picture of J@@ er@@ ry ."
"@@ and I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o do you want to d@@ ate ?"
"And the question was , will ug@@ ly J@@ er@@ ry and ug@@ ly T@@ om help their re@@ spe@@ ctive , more at@@ tra@@ ctive bro@@ thers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How no@@ ble in reason ! &quot;
"A@@ re we S@@ uper@@ man , or are we H@@ ome@@ r S@@ im@@ ps@@ on ?"
( Applause )
But they didn &apos;t rele@@ ase their energy in light .
"Now , most people thought they were nu@@ ts ."
And they pas@@ sed through you and me .

We can &apos;t use them to make simple ima@@ ges of things out in the Uni@@ verse .
It &apos;s sort of the vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of sp@@ in im@@ prin@@ ted on this wa@@ ve@@ form .
It &apos;s fantas@@ tic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the las@@ ting impor@@ tan@@ ce of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
"W@@ ith gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ av@@ es , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"P@@ lan@@ e@@ tar@@ y syste@@ ms outside our own are like dis@@ tant ci@@ ties wh@@ ose li@@ ghts we can see tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stu@@ dy@@ ing those tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing li@@ ghts though , we can learn about how stars and planets inter@@ act to form their own e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem and make ha@@ b@@ it@@ a@@ ts that are a@@ men@@ able to life ."
"In this ima@@ ge of the T@@ o@@ ky@@ o sk@@ y@@ line , I &apos;ve h@@ id@@ den data from the new@@ est plan@@ et@@ -@@ hun@@ ting space tele@@ sco@@ pe on the blo@@ ck , the Kepler M@@ is@@ sion ."
Can you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sk@@ y the Kepler star@@ es at , where it se@@ arches for planets by me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very prec@@ is@@ ely ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny di@@ m@@ ming of light that is c@@ au@@ sed by a planet pas@@ sing in fron@@ t of one of these stars and b@@ loc@@ king some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of o@@ per@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al new plan@@ e@@ tar@@ y syste@@ ms around other stars ."
"To give you some per@@ spe@@ ctive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two dec@@ ades of se@@ arch@@ ing , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to Kepler ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can de@@ ter@@ min@@ e that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its par@@ ent star ."
That dis@@ tan@@ ce is really important because it tell@@ s us how much light the planet rec@@ ei@@ ves o@@ ver@@ all .
"And that dis@@ tan@@ ce and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I s@@ it@@ ting around a c@@ am@@ p@@ fire : You want to be clo@@ se enough to the c@@ am@@ p@@ fire so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so clo@@ se that you &apos;re too to@@ as@@ ty and you get bur@@ ned ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you rec@@ ei@@ ve o@@ ver@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in visi@@ ble light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll no@@ tice that it looks pretty much like the i@@ con@@ ic y@@ el@@ low b@@ all — that Sun that we all dra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll no@@ tice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has f@@ rec@@ k@@ les ."
"Th@@ ese f@@ rec@@ k@@ les are called sun@@ spo@@ ts , and they are just one of the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to var@@ y .
"And we can measure this very , very prec@@ is@@ ely with Kepler and tra@@ ce their ef@@ fe@@ cts ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , these are just the ti@@ p of the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ey@@ es , we would really see the dy@@ na@@ mic and dra@@ mati@@ c ef@@ fe@@ cts of our Sun &apos;s magnetic acti@@ vity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ Just think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ dy outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y ab@@ ove you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , whether it might be a@@ men@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much to@@ tal light it rec@@ ei@@ ves and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space we@@ a@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys that are created by its star and that b@@ a@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of de@@ tai@@ l that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s — three planets in our own solar system that are ro@@ u@@ gh@@ ly the same si@@ ze , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the me@@ anti@@ me is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the planets and their par@@ ent stars to su@@ ss out clu@@ es about which planets might be good plac@@ es to look for life in the universe .
Kepler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every measu@@ re@@ ment it makes is pre@@ ci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that se@@ ts the st@@ age for the formation of life in the universe ."
"Wh@@ ile it &apos;s Kepler the tele@@ sco@@ pe , the in@@ stru@@ ment that star@@ es , it &apos;s we , life , who are se@@ arch@@ ing ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a con@@ su@@ mer ."
It cannot be con@@ sci@@ ously a con@@ tribu@@ tor .
It is hel@@ ple@@ ss .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to survi@@ ve , even though it is endo@@ wed with an in@@ s@@ tin@@ ct to survi@@ ve ."
"It needs the help of mother , or a f@@ os@@ ter mother , to survi@@ ve ."
It can &apos;t af@@ for@@ d to d@@ ou@@ b@@ t the person who ten@@ ds the child .
"It has to to@@ tally sur@@ ren@@ der , as one sur@@ ren@@ ders to an an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ o@@ logis@@ t ."
It has to to@@ tally sur@@ ren@@ der .
That im@@ pli@@ es a lot of trust .
That im@@ pli@@ es the tr@@ us@@ ted person won &apos;t viol@@ ate the trust .
"As the child gro@@ ws , it begin@@ s to disco@@ ver that the person tr@@ us@@ ted is viol@@ ating the trust ."
"It doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; &quot; viol@@ ation . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ere@@ fore , it has to bl@@ ame itself , a wor@@ d@@ less bl@@ ame , which is more difficult to really re@@ sol@@ ve — the wor@@ d@@ less self-@@ bl@@ ame ."
"As the child gro@@ ws to become an ad@@ ul@@ t : so far , it has been a con@@ su@@ mer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her cap@@ ac@@ ity to con@@ tribu@@ te , to be a con@@ tribu@@ tor ."
"One cannot con@@ tribu@@ te un@@ less one feel@@ s se@@ cu@@ re , one feel@@ s big , one feel@@ s : I have enough ."
To be compas@@ sion@@ ate is not a jo@@ ke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to disco@@ ver a certain big@@ ness in on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
"That big@@ ness should be cen@@ tered on on@@ es@@ el@@ f , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wi@@ el@@ d , not in terms of any sta@@ tu@@ s that you can comm@@ and in the society , but it should be cen@@ tered on on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
The self : you are self-@@ a@@ w@@ are .
"O@@ n that self , it should be cen@@ tered — a big@@ ness , a wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess ."
"O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , compassion is just a word and a dre@@ am ."
"You can be compas@@ sion@@ ate occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally , more mo@@ ved by em@@ path@@ y than by compassion ."
Thank G@@ od we are em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pain , we pic@@ k up the pain ."
"In a W@@ im@@ b@@ le@@ don fin@@ al ma@@ t@@ ch , these two gu@@ ys fi@@ ght it out ."
E@@ ach one has got two g@@ am@@ es .
It can be any@@ body &apos;s game .
What they have swe@@ ated so far has no me@@ an@@ ing .
One person win@@ s .
"The ten@@ n@@ is e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te is , both the play@@ ers have to come to the net and sh@@ ake hands ."
"The win@@ ner bo@@ x@@ es the air and k@@ is@@ ses the ground , thro@@ ws his sh@@ ir@@ t as though somebody is w@@ ai@@ ting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s w@@ is@@ hing that he didn &apos;t win .
Why ? E@@ m@@ path@@ y .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is den@@ i@@ ed of that em@@ path@@ y .
No religi@@ on can demo@@ lish that by in@@ doc@@ tr@@ in@@ ation .
"N@@ o culture , no n@@ ation and n@@ ation@@ alis@@ m — nothing can to@@ u@@ ch it because it is em@@ path@@ y ."
"And that cap@@ ac@@ ity to em@@ path@@ ize is the win@@ do@@ w through which you re@@ ach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no Indi@@ an compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It trans@@ cen@@ ds n@@ ation , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experien@@ ced by people occ@@ as@@ ion@@ ally .
"Th@@ en this occ@@ asi@@ onal compassion , we are not talking about — it will never re@@ ma@@ in occ@@ asi@@ onal ."
"B@@ y man@@ d@@ ate , you cannot make a person compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase love me . &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ve is something you disco@@ ver ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to disco@@ ver a certain wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
"I am going to c@@ ite the possi@@ bility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tra@@ gi@@ c life , one is happy in mo@@ ments which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a s@@ l@@ ap@@ sti@@ ck jo@@ ke , ac@@ cep@@ ts h@@ im@@ self and also the sche@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
A@@ ll of them are to@@ tally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disco@@ ver your wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the ob@@ ject — the sche@@ me of things — fu@@ se into on@@ en@@ ess , an experience no@@ body can say , &quot; &quot; I am den@@ i@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and sun@@ d@@ ry ."
"That experience con@@ fi@@ r@@ ms that , in sp@@ ite of all your li@@ mit@@ ations — all your wan@@ ts , de@@ si@@ res , un@@ ful@@ fil@@ led , and the cre@@ di@@ t car@@ ds and lay@@ of@@ f@@ s and , finally , bal@@ d@@ ness — you can be happy ."
But the ex@@ ten@@ sion of the logi@@ c is that you don &apos;t need to ful@@ f@@ ill your de@@ si@@ re to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fi@@ r@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess and still be whole .
"Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that re@@ alization , that re@@ cognition : &quot; &quot; M@@ aybe I am the whole ."
M@@ aybe the sw@@ am@@ i is right .
M@@ aybe the sw@@ am@@ i is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything becomes me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to bl@@ ame myself .
"If one has to bl@@ ame on@@ es@@ el@@ f , one has a million reas@@ ons pl@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being li@@ mi@@ ted — if it is black it is not wh@@ ite , if it is wh@@ ite it is not black : body is li@@ mi@@ ted any which way you look at it . L@@ i@@ mi@@ ted ."
"Y@@ our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge is li@@ mi@@ ted , health is li@@ mi@@ ted , and power is ther@@ e@@ fore li@@ mi@@ ted , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be li@@ mi@@ ted ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is going to be li@@ mi@@ ted .
E@@ very@@ thing is going to be li@@ mit@@ less .
"You cannot comm@@ and compassion un@@ less you become li@@ mit@@ less , and no@@ body can become li@@ mit@@ less , ei@@ ther you are or you are not . P@@ eri@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not li@@ mit@@ less too .
"Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all li@@ mit@@ ations , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is the reality of you when you re@@ late to the world .
It is love first .
"When you re@@ late to the world , the dy@@ na@@ mic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is , what we say , love ."
And itself becomes compassion if the ob@@ ject that you re@@ late to ev@@ ok@@ es that e@@ mo@@ tion .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
You ex@@ pre@@ ss yourself because you have compassion .
"To disco@@ ver compassion , you need to be compas@@ sion@@ ate ."
"To disco@@ ver the cap@@ ac@@ ity to give and share , you need to be giving and sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
There is no sh@@ or@@ t@@ c@@ ut : it is like sw@@ im@@ ming by sw@@ im@@ ming .
You learn sw@@ im@@ ming by sw@@ im@@ ming .
You cannot learn sw@@ im@@ ming on a fo@@ am ma@@ t@@ tre@@ ss and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn sw@@ im@@ ming by sw@@ im@@ ming . You learn c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing by c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
"You learn coo@@ king by coo@@ king , having some sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic people around you to e@@ at what you co@@ ok ."
"( Laughter ) And , ther@@ e@@ fore , what I say , you have to f@@ ake it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
M@@ y pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely .
"There is no ver@@ b for compassion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely .
"But then , how to act compas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you f@@ ake .
You f@@ ake it and make it . This is the man@@ tra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You f@@ ake it and make it .
"You act compas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely as though you have compassion : g@@ rin@@ d your te@@ e@@ th , take all the sup@@ port system ."
"If you know how to pra@@ y , pra@@ y ."
A@@ s@@ k for compassion .
Let me act compas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion and also s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly a rel@@ ative compassion , and s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion is a dy@@ na@@ mic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ en@@ ess , wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess , and that &apos;s what you are ."
"W@@ ith these words , than@@ k you very much ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on l@@ and@@ mas@@ s .
And here &apos;s how news shap@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This ma@@ p — ( Applause ) — this ma@@ p sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American ne@@ t@@ work and c@@ able news organiz@@ ations de@@ dic@@ ated to news stories , by country , in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when Nor@@ th Kor@@ ea ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ tle its nu@@ cle@@ ar fac@@ ili@@ ties ."
There was mas@@ sive f@@ loo@@ ding in In@@ don@@ es@@ ia .
"And in Par@@ is , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C rele@@ as@@ ed its study con@@ fi@@ r@@ ming man &apos;s im@@ p@@ act on global war@@ ming ."
The U.S. ac@@ coun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of to@@ tal news co@@ verage .
"And when we take out the U.S. and look at the re@@ main@@ ing 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of Ira@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined co@@ verage of R@@ us@@ sia , China and India , for example , re@@ ach@@ ed just one percent ."
"When we anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed all the news stories and re@@ mo@@ ved just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The death of An@@ na N@@ ic@@ ole S@@ m@@ ith .
"This story e@@ cli@@ ps@@ ed every country ex@@ cept Ira@@ q , and rec@@ ei@@ ved 10 times the co@@ verage of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port ."
"And the c@@ y@@ c@@ le contin@@ ues ; as we all know , B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y has loo@@ med pretty large la@@ tely ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news ne@@ t@@ works have re@@ duc@@ ed the number of their for@@ ei@@ g@@ n bu@@ re@@ au@@ s by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C min@@ i@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i , New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and M@@ um@@ b@@ ai , there are no ne@@ t@@ work news bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in all of A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — plac@@ es that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that co@@ ver@@ ing B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y is che@@ ap@@ er .
And this l@@ ack of global co@@ verage is all the more dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"@@ Lo@@ cal T@@ V news lo@@ om@@ s large , and un@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely only de@@ dic@@ ates 12 percent of its co@@ verage to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the we@@ b ?
The most po@@ pu@@ lar news s@@ ites don &apos;t do much better .
"@@ L@@ ast year , P@@ e@@ w and the C@@ olo@@ m@@ b@@ ia J@@ -@@ S@@ cho@@ ol anal@@ y@@ z@@ ed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that appe@@ ar@@ ed on Google Ne@@ ws &apos; fron@@ t p@@ age ."
"And they , in fact , co@@ vered the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , a study in e-@@ con@@ tent showed that much of global news from U.S. news cre@@ a@@ tors is rec@@ y@@ c@@ led stories from the A@@ P wi@@ re ser@@ vi@@ ces and R@@ eu@@ ters , and don &apos;t put things into a con@@ te@@ x@@ t that people can understand their conne@@ ction to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college gra@@ du@@ ates , as well as less educ@@ ated Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their coun@@ ter@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interes@@ ted , you would be wrong ."
"In re@@ cent years , Americ@@ ans who say they clo@@ se@@ ly fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dis@@ tor@@ ted wor@@ l@@ d@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our increas@@ ing@@ ly inter@@ conne@@ cted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we af@@ for@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The domin@@ ant kind of s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y that exis@@ ts no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is job s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
I don &apos;t think we are partic@@ ularly materi@@ alis@@ tic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a n@@ as@@ ty k@@ ic@@ k@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , lin@@ ked to something ni@@ ce ."
And that makes fa@@ il@@ u@@ re seem much more c@@ rus@@ hing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating if you &apos;re doing well , and very c@@ rus@@ hing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody de@@ ser@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a cra@@ z@@ y idea , comple@@ tely cra@@ z@@ y ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : ac@@ ci@@ dents , ac@@ ci@@ dents of bir@@ th , ac@@ ci@@ dents of things dro@@ p@@ ping on people &apos;s head@@ s , ill@@ n@@ es@@ ses , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."
I gave them the pl@@ ot@@ line of M@@ ad@@ ame B@@ o@@ var@@ y .
"( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spec@@ tru@@ m of sym@@ path@@ y , you &apos;ve got the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
"The other thing about modern society and why it c@@ au@@ ses this an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty , is that we have nothing at its center that is n@@ on@@ -@@ human ."
"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and our own dra@@ mas ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and fa@@ il@@ u@@ re .
"When we &apos;re told that b@@ an@@ king is a very re@@ spec@@ table profes@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into b@@ an@@ king ."
"When b@@ an@@ king is no longer so re@@ spec@@ table , we lo@@ se inter@@ est in b@@ an@@ king ."
"But what I really want to stre@@ ss is : by all means , success , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the stran@@ gen@@ ess of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in ma@@ th clas@@ s , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X p@@ riz@@ e , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , Pro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn Ara@@ bi@@ c , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ me@@ ly logi@@ cal language ."
"To wr@@ ite a word or a ph@@ r@@ ase or a sen@@ t@@ ence in Ara@@ bi@@ c is like cra@@ f@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ me@@ ly prec@@ ise and car@@ ries a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as We@@ ster@@ n science and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics and engine@@ ering was really worked out in the first few cen@@ tu@@ ries of the C@@ om@@ mon E@@ ra by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the Ara@@ b@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This inclu@@ des the little system in Ara@@ bi@@ c called al-@@ j@@ eb@@ ra .
And al-@@ j@@ eb@@ r ro@@ u@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ la@@ tes to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate parts . &quot;
A@@ l-@@ j@@ eb@@ r finally came into English as al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra .
One example a@@ mon@@ g many .
The Ara@@ bi@@ c te@@ x@@ ts con@@ tain@@ ing this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical w@@ is@@ dom finally made their way to Euro@@ pe — which is to say S@@ pain — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th cen@@ tu@@ ries .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ oun@@ ds in Ara@@ bi@@ c that just don &apos;t make it through a Euro@@ pe@@ an vo@@ ice bo@@ x without lots of pra@@ c@@ tice .
T@@ r@@ ust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ p@@ r@@ its .
"This is the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; s@@ h . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first le@@ tter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in Ara@@ bi@@ c , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al-@@ sh@@ al@@ an — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that appe@@ ar@@ s throu@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics , such as this 1@@ 0@@ th century der@@ i@@ v@@ ation of pro@@ of@@ s ."
"The problem for the Me@@ di@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ ish sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s who were tas@@ ked with trans@@ l@@ ating this material is that the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een and the word sh@@ al@@ an can &apos;t be ren@@ der@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ ish because S@@ pan@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; s@@ h &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ ven@@ tion , they created a ru@@ le in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the clas@@ si@@ cal G@@ re@@ ek in the form of the le@@ tter Kai ."
"@@ La@@ ter when this material was trans@@ lated into a common Euro@@ pe@@ an language , which is to say La@@ tin , they simply re@@ plac@@ ed the G@@ re@@ ek Kai with the La@@ tin X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in La@@ tin , it for@@ med the bas@@ is for ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics te@@ x@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; s@@ h &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th sh@@ ar@@ ing .

I de@@ serve the education that I get here .
"&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; I ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;"
Can we st@@ and to have more relation@@ shi@@ ps ?
N@@ ever .
It &apos;s the conne@@ ction . It &apos;s the relation@@ shi@@ ps .

"So let me beg@@ in by first of all giving a very , very bri@@ ef history of time , if I may in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge ."
In me@@ di@@ ev@@ al societies there were defin@@ ed al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces .
An id@@ enti@@ ty was defin@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily by religi@@ on .
"In the age of glob@@ alization , we mo@@ ved on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re mo@@ ving into a new age , and that age The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ imes du@@ b@@ b@@ ed re@@ cen@@ tly as &quot; &quot; the age of behavi@@ or . &quot; &quot; How I defin@@ e the age of behavi@@ or is a peri@@ od of trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , where id@@ enti@@ ty is defin@@ ed more so by ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves ."
"But actually it &apos;s my beli@@ ef that the people who &apos;ve been truly cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing on this age of behavi@@ or , up until now , up until re@@ cent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing most on the age of behavi@@ or and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , using dig@@ ital acti@@ vis@@ m and other sor@@ ts of bor@@ der@@ less technologi@@ es , those who &apos;ve been ben@@ efi@@ ting from this have been extremis@@ ts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was in@@ vol@@ ved in an extre@@ me Is@@ la@@ mis@@ t organiz@@ ation ."
"And my story , my pers@@ onal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavi@@ or that I &apos;m at@@ tem@@ p@@ ting to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate upo@@ n here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ sex la@@ d , born and ra@@ is@@ ed in E@@ s@@ sex in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ i@@ ting people from C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ vers@@ ity to this organiz@@ ation ."
"Now that j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and what took me from E@@ s@@ sex all the way across the world — by the way , we were l@@ augh@@ ing at democra@@ tic acti@@ vis@@ ts ."
We f@@ elt they were from the age of ye@@ ster@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ ma@@ i@@ l from the extremis@@ t organiz@@ ation that I used .
"E@@ ven@@ tually I was de@@ te@@ cted , of course , in E@@ gy@@ p@@ t ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my ad@@ van@@ t@@ age was because I was within an extremis@@ t organiz@@ ation that was for@@ ced to think be@@ y@@ on@@ d the con@@ fin@@ es of the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o and ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led it ."
And it &apos;s not just Is@@ la@@ mis@@ t extremis@@ ts that did this .
A form of anti@@ -@@ Is@@ la@@ m r@@ he@@ tori@@ c is also on the rise and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces that this is having is that it &apos;s af@@ fe@@ c@@ ting the political cli@@ mate across Euro@@ pe .
Because the Inter@@ net and conne@@ ction technologi@@ es are conne@@ c@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , mo@@ squ@@ e min@@ are@@ ts are being b@@ an@@ ned ."
"In others , kos@@ her and hal@@ al me@@ at are being b@@ an@@ ned , as we speak ."
"And on the f@@ li@@ p side , we have trans@@ national Is@@ la@@ mis@@ t extremis@@ ts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of paro@@ chi@@ alis@@ m that are being conne@@ cted in a way that makes them feel like they are main@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have f@@ elt is@@ ol@@ ated , until these sor@@ ts of technologi@@ es came around and conne@@ cted them in a way that made them feel part of a lar@@ ger ph@@ en@@ omenon ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this st@@ age .
I@@ f any of you remem@@ bers the Chris@@ t@@ mas D@@ ay bom@@ b p@@ lot : there &apos;s a man called An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ l@@ aki .
"As an American ci@@ tiz@@ en , eth@@ ni@@ c@@ ally a Y@@ e@@ meni , in h@@ id@@ ing cur@@ ren@@ tly in Y@@ e@@ men , who in@@ spi@@ red a N@@ ig@@ eri@@ an , son of the head of N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ ig@@ eri@@ an stu@@ dent stu@@ died in L@@ on@@ don , tra@@ ined in Y@@ e@@ men , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in A@@ m@@ ster@@ da@@ m to at@@ t@@ ack America ."
"The O@@ ld men@@ tal@@ ity with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ presen@@ ted by the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state , not yet fully into the age of behavi@@ or , not recogn@@ iz@@ ing the power of trans@@ national social move@@ ments , got left behind ."
And the Chris@@ t@@ mas D@@ ay bom@@ ber almost succ@@ e@@ e@@ ded in at@@ t@@ ac@@ king the United States of America .
"A@@ g@@ ain with the example of the far right : that we find , i@@ ron@@ ically , xen@@ o@@ ph@@ o@@ bi@@ c n@@ ation@@ alis@@ ts are u@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ing the ben@@ ef@@ its of glob@@ alization ."
So why are they succ@@ e@@ e@@ ding ?
And why are democra@@ cy as@@ pi@@ ran@@ ts f@@ all@@ ing behind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social move@@ ments who understand this .
"And a social movement is com@@ pris@@ ed , in my view , it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of four ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
It &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and sym@@ b@@ ols and lead@@ ers .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be a@@ w@@ are of , and that &apos;s the example of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely ."
"In@@ ci@@ den@@ tally , the difference between ideas and n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves : the idea is the cause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive is the way to s@@ ell that cause — the pro@@ pag@@ an@@ da , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da come to your mind im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely .
One of their lead@@ ers was k@@ il@@ led in Pakis@@ tan re@@ cen@@ tly .
And that &apos;s the power of social move@@ ments .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to foc@@ us cur@@ ren@@ tly on Pakis@@ tan , and I ask you to think of the sym@@ b@@ ols and the lead@@ ers for democra@@ cy in Pakis@@ tan today , you &apos;ll be hard press@@ ed to think be@@ y@@ on@@ d perhaps the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of B@@ en@@ az@@ i@@ r B@@ hu@@ t@@ to ."
"Wh@@ ich means , by defin@@ i@@ tion , that particular le@@ ade@@ r no longer exis@@ ts ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no glob@@ alized , y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led , g@@ ras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots social move@@ ments ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ating for democra@@ tic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ ority societies ."
"There is no equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ e@@ da , without the ter@@ ro@@ ris@@ m , for democra@@ cy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ ma@@ j@@ ority societies ."
So that be@@ gs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s com@@ plac@@ en@@ cy ."
And that level of com@@ plac@@ en@@ cy means they don &apos;t feel the need to ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness ."
That we have a h@@ es@@ it@@ ation in es@@ po@@ using the univers@@ ality of democra@@ tic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the univers@@ ality of our val@@ ues — with extremis@@ ts .
"Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ ghts , we do say that human ri@@ ghts are univers@@ al ."
But actually going out to pro@@ pag@@ ate that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with ei@@ ther ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ vis@@ m or with Is@@ la@@ mis@@ t extremis@@ m .
To go around saying that I believe democra@@ tic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ riv@@ ed at as a form of political organiz@@ ing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extremis@@ m .
"And then you have a th@@ ir@@ d par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ote for us ; we &apos;ll e@@ st@@ ab@@ lish a the@@ o@@ cra@@ cy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a resul@@ t of this is , when those par@@ ties are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they fai@@ l , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they make political mis@@ takes , democra@@ cy takes the bl@@ ame for their political mis@@ takes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried democra@@ cy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s bre@@ ak down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"An@@ e@@ c@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te that if po@@ ver@@ ty was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in La@@ den is from one of the rich@@ est fami@@ lies in S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ b@@ ia ."
"H@@ is de@@ pu@@ ty , A@@ y@@ man al-@@ Z@@ a@@ wa@@ hi@@ ri , was a pe@@ dia@@ tri@@ ci@@ an — not an ill@@ -@@ educ@@ ated man ."
"And what I believe is mis@@ sing is gen@@ u@@ ine g@@ ras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots acti@@ vis@@ m on the ground , in ad@@ dition to inter@@ national aid , in ad@@ dition to education , in ad@@ dition to health ."
"@@ Not ex@@ clu@@ sive to these things , but in ad@@ dition to them , is pro@@ pag@@ ating a gen@@ u@@ ine de@@ m@@ and for democra@@ cy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m had it upsi@@ de@@ -@@ down .
Ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m had the ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ y that you go in with a sup@@ pl@@ y@@ -@@ led approach to im@@ pose democra@@ tic val@@ ues from the top down .
"Wh@@ ere@@ as Is@@ la@@ mis@@ ts and far@@ -@@ right organiz@@ ations , for dec@@ ades , have been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the g@@ ras@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ as@@ s move@@ ments in Pakis@@ tan have been re@@ presen@@ ted after the Ara@@ b up@@ ris@@ ings main@@ ly by organiz@@ ations cl@@ ai@@ ming for some form of the@@ o@@ cra@@ cy , rather than for a democra@@ tic up@@ ris@@ ing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ par@@ ti@@ tion , they &apos;ve been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led movement that works to acti@@ vely ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for the democra@@ tic culture — which is nec@@ ess@@ arily more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is av@@ oi@@ d the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where cur@@ ren@@ tly we have political par@@ ties presen@@ ting democra@@ cy as mer@@ ely a political cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ on@@ g@@ side other cho@@ ic@@ es such as mil@@ it@@ ary ru@@ le and the@@ o@@ cra@@ cy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sli@@ de here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ote in an exis@@ ting democra@@ cy , not for a democra@@ cy ."
"Now to con@@ clu@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ gy@@ p@@ t is a good star@@ ting point ."
The Ara@@ b up@@ ris@@ ings have de@@ mon@@ stra@@ ted that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the Ara@@ b up@@ ris@@ ings and what happened in E@@ gy@@ p@@ t was partic@@ ularly c@@ ath@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one ste@@ p be@@ y@@ on@@ d that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a le@@ ade@@ r or ru@@ ler or dic@@ ta@@ tor .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in Pakis@@ tan with a movement called K@@ hu@@ di , where we are working on the ground to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge the y@@ ou@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y@@ -@@ in for the democra@@ tic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and than@@ k you for your time ."
"B@@ ack in New Y@@ or@@ k , I am the head of develo@@ p@@ ment for a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ o@@ od ."
"When I &apos;m not fi@@ gh@@ ting po@@ ver@@ ty , I &apos;m fi@@ gh@@ ting fi@@ res as the as@@ sis@@ tant cap@@ tain of a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fire compan@@ y ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers sup@@ ple@@ ment a high@@ ly sk@@ il@@ led car@@ e@@ er st@@ af@@ f , you have to get to the fire scen@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remem@@ ber my first fire .
"I was the second vol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the scen@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real fo@@ ot@@ ra@@ ce against the other vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ ag@@ ing con@@ vers@@ ation with the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , who was su@@ re@@ ly having one of the wor@@ st days of her life ."
"@@ Here it was , the middle of the night , she was st@@ anding outside in the po@@ ur@@ ing ra@@ in , under an um@@ bre@@ lla , in her pa@@ j@@ a@@ mas , b@@ are@@ fo@@ ot , while her h@@ ou@@ se was in fla@@ mes ."
The other vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ riv@@ ed just before me — let &apos;s call him Le@@ x L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and s@@ ave the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"@@ Here was some la@@ w@@ y@@ er or money man@@ ag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to s@@ ave a li@@ ving cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain w@@ av@@ ed me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; B@@ ez@@ os , I need you to go into the h@@ ou@@ se ."
"I need you to go up@@ stair@@ s , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pai@@ r of sho@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I swe@@ ar ."
"So , not exactly what I was h@@ op@@ ing for , but off I went — up the stair@@ s , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , who were pretty much done pu@@ tting out the fire at this point , into the mas@@ ter be@@ dro@@ om to get a pai@@ r of sho@@ es ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ri@@ ed my pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ stair@@ s where I me@@ t my ne@@ me@@ sis and the pre@@ ci@@ ous do@@ g by the fron@@ t do@@ or .
"We took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ing@@ ly , his rec@@ ei@@ ved much more at@@ ten@@ tion than did min@@ e ."
"A few weeks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment rec@@ ei@@ ved a le@@ tter from the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant ef@@ for@@ t dis@@ play@@ ed in s@@ av@@ ing her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she n@@ ot@@ ed ab@@ ove all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a pai@@ r of sho@@ es .
"( Laughter ) In both my vo@@ c@@ ation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ o@@ od and my av@@ o@@ c@@ ation as a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ter , I am w@@ it@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ u@@ mental scal@@ e , but I &apos;m also w@@ it@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gra@@ ce and cou@@ ra@@ ge on an individu@@ al bas@@ is ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who ei@@ ther have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble le@@ vel@@ s of success , I would of@@ fer this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wa@@ it ."
D@@ on &apos;t wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve fo@@ od at a s@@ ou@@ p k@@ it@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od par@@ k .
B@@ e a men@@ tor .
"@@ Not every day is going to of@@ fer us a chan@@ ce to s@@ ave somebody &apos;s life , but every day of@@ fer@@ s us an op@@ por@@ t@@ unity to af@@ fect one ."
So get in the game . S@@ ave the sho@@ es .

Mar@@ k B@@ ez@@ os : Thank you .
"M@@ ark Z@@ u@@ c@@ ker@@ ber@@ g , a journ@@ alis@@ t was asking him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the journ@@ alis@@ t was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ u@@ c@@ ker@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l dy@@ ing in your fron@@ t y@@ ard may be more rele@@ v@@ ant to your inter@@ e@@ sts right now than people dy@@ ing in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a We@@ b based on that idea of rele@@ van@@ ce might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really ru@@ ral are@@ a in M@@ aine , the Inter@@ net me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a conne@@ ction to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would conne@@ ct us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democra@@ cy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t p@@ ay at@@ ten@@ tion to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first no@@ tic@@ ed this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my Facebook p@@ age .
"I &apos;m progre@@ s@@ sive , poli@@ tically — big surpris@@ e — but I &apos;ve always gone out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like hear@@ ing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like see@@ ing what they lin@@ k to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surpris@@ ed when I no@@ tic@@ ed one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed from my Facebook fe@@ ed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which lin@@ ks I cli@@ c@@ ked on , and it was no@@ tic@@ ing that , actually , I was cli@@ c@@ king more on my liber@@ al friends &apos; lin@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative friends &apos; lin@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ sul@@ ting me about it , it had e@@ di@@ ted them out ."
They dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed .
"So Facebook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of in@@ visi@@ ble , algorith@@ mic e@@ di@@ ting of the We@@ b ."
Google &apos;s doing it too .
"If I se@@ arch for something , and you se@@ arch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different se@@ arch results ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no st@@ and@@ ard Google any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ ny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your se@@ arch results are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s scre@@ en sho@@ t .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s scre@@ en sho@@ t .
"When you put them si@@ de@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the lin@@ ks to see how different these two pag@@ es are ."
"But when you do read the lin@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble ."
D@@ an@@ i@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the prote@@ sts in E@@ gy@@ p@@ t at all in his first p@@ age of Google results .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were ful@@ l of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are be@@ coming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook ei@@ ther .
This is something that &apos;s swe@@ ep@@ ing the We@@ b .
There are a whole h@@ ost of compan@@ ies that are doing this kind of pers@@ on@@ alization .
"Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o Ne@@ ws , the big@@ gest news s@@ ite on the Inter@@ net , is now pers@@ on@@ alized — different people get different things ."
"H@@ u@@ f@@ fin@@ g@@ ton P@@ ost , the W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ imes — all f@@ li@@ r@@ ting with pers@@ on@@ alization in vari@@ ous ways ."
"And this mo@@ ves us very quickly to@@ ward a world in which the Inter@@ net is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not nec@@ ess@@ arily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these fil@@ ters together , you take all these algorith@@ ms , you get what I call a fil@@ ter bub@@ ble ."
"And your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble is your own pers@@ onal , uni@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ line ."
"And what &apos;s in your fil@@ ter bub@@ ble de@@ pen@@ ds on who you are , and it de@@ pen@@ ds on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t deci@@ de what gets in .
"And more impor@@ tan@@ tly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets e@@ di@@ ted out ."
So one of the problems with the fil@@ ter bub@@ ble was disco@@ vered by some rese@@ arch@@ ers at Ne@@ t@@ f@@ li@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ eu@@ e , they just zi@@ p right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ ron M@@ an &quot; &quot; zi@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ ai@@ ting for S@@ uper@@ man &quot; &quot; can wa@@ it for a really long time ."
What they disco@@ vered was that in our Ne@@ t@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ eu@@ es there &apos;s this epi@@ c stru@@ g@@ g@@ le going on between our future as@@ pira@@ tional selves and our more im@@ pul@@ sive present selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed &quot; &quot; R@@ as@@ h@@ om@@ on , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ en@@ tu@@ ra &quot; &quot; for the f@@ our@@ th time ."
It gi@@ ves us a little bit of J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber and a little bit of Af@@ gh@@ anistan .
It gi@@ ves us some information ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les ; it gi@@ ves us some information de@@ ss@@ er@@ t .
"And the challenge with these kinds of algorith@@ mic fil@@ ters , these pers@@ on@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you cli@@ ck on first , it can thro@@ w off that bal@@ ance ."
"And instead of a bal@@ an@@ ced information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by information j@@ un@@ k fo@@ od ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re see@@ ing is more of a pas@@ sing of the tor@@ ch from human g@@ ate@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to algorith@@ mic ones .
And the thing is that the algorith@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ be@@ d@@ ded eth@@ ic@@ s that the e@@ di@@ tors did .
"So if algorith@@ ms are going to cu@@ rate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to deci@@ de what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just ke@@ y@@ ed to rele@@ van@@ ce ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ for@@ table or chall@@ eng@@ ing or important — this is what TED does — other poin@@ ts of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were swe@@ ating a lot about their civi@@ c responsi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
Th@@ en people no@@ tic@@ ed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t have a fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing democra@@ cy if ci@@ tiz@@ ens didn &apos;t get a good f@@ low of information , that the new@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were cri@@ tical because they were ac@@ ting as the fil@@ ter , and then journ@@ alis@@ tic eth@@ ic@@ s developed ."
"It wasn &apos;t per@@ fect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the We@@ b ."
And we need the new g@@ ate@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to en@@ co@@ de that kind of responsi@@ bility into the co@@ de that they &apos;re w@@ ri@@ ting .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ ge@@ y — people who have hel@@ ped build the We@@ b as it is , and I &apos;m gra@@ te@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these algorith@@ ms have en@@ co@@ ded in them a sense of the publi@@ c life , a sense of civi@@ c responsi@@ bility ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re trans@@ par@@ ent enough that we can see what the r@@ ul@@ es are that de@@ ter@@ min@@ e what gets through our fil@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some contro@@ l so that we can deci@@ de what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Inter@@ net to be that thing that we all dre@@ a@@ med of it being .
We need it to conne@@ ct us all together .
We need it to in@@ tro@@ duce us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it le@@ av@@ es us all is@@ ol@@ ated in a We@@ b of one .
Thank you .

"S@@ ome@@ one in@@ vi@@ ted me to a me@@ e@@ ting , but cou@@ ldn &apos;t man@@ age to f@@ it me in to a re@@ gu@@ lar sort of con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ e@@ ting , and said , &quot; I have to wal@@ k my do@@ gs to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w . C@@ ould you come then ? &quot;"
"It see@@ med kind of od@@ d to do , and actually , that first me@@ e@@ ting , I remem@@ ber thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to hu@@ ff and pu@@ ff during this con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to co@@ f@@ fe@@ e me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs or flu@@ or@@ es@@ cen@@ t@@ -@@ li@@ t con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs , I ask people to go on a walking me@@ e@@ ting , to the t@@ un@@ e of 20 to 30 miles a week ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ lig@@ ations , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , se@@ ver@@ al hundred of these walking me@@ e@@ tin@@ gs later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ irst , there &apos;s this a@@ maz@@ ing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that lead@@ s to out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"Wh@@ ether it &apos;s nature or the exer@@ c@@ ise itself , it cer@@ tain@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more re@@ f@@ le@@ ctive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ position when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differen@@ tly , whether it &apos;s in govern@@ ance or b@@ usiness or environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to re@@ fra@@ me those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ talk idea that things be@@ came do@@ able and su@@ st@@ ain@@ able and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the tu@@ s@@ h , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom line , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surpris@@ ed at how f@@ res@@ h air d@@ ri@@ ves f@@ res@@ h thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ re@@ ly new set of ideas ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year@@ -@@ old love story with the poor , li@@ ving on less than one dol@@ lar a day ."
"I went to a very e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , s@@ no@@ b@@ b@@ ish , ex@@ pen@@ sive education in India , and that almost de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ plo@@ ma@@ t , teacher , doc@@ tor — all l@@ aid out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indi@@ an national squ@@ as@@ h cham@@ pi@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was l@@ aid out for me .
E@@ very@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st Bi@@ ha@@ r fam@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , death , people dy@@ ing of hun@@ ger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a com@@ a .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is l@@ aid out for you , the best j@@ ob@@ s are l@@ aid out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best educ@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"N@@ o job , no money , no se@@ cur@@ ity , no pros@@ pe@@ ct . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years ?"
"You went to the most ex@@ pen@@ sive school and college in India , and you want to di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ posed to the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls that very poor people have , which are never bro@@ ught into the main@@ stre@@ am — which is never id@@ enti@@ fied , re@@ spe@@ cted , app@@ li@@ ed on a large scal@@ e ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ f@@ le@@ cted in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ l@@ ders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the poli@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fai@@ led in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a govern@@ ment job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at Par@@ is and New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and Z@@ u@@ rich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ f@@ le@@ cted in the college . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ ders gave me some very sound and pro@@ found ad@@ vice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ gre@@ e and qu@@ ali@@ fic@@ ation into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a M@@ as@@ ter &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a co@@ p@@ -@@ out or a was@@ h@@ -@@ out or a dro@@ po@@ ut to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a di@@ gn@@ ity of lab@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can of@@ fer to the comm@@ unity and pro@@ vi@@ de a ser@@ vice to the comm@@ unity .
"So we started the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed profes@@ sion@@ alis@@ m ."
Wh@@ o is a profes@@ si@@ onal ?
"A profes@@ si@@ onal is someone who has a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of com@@ pe@@ t@@ ence , con@@ fi@@ dence and beli@@ ef ."
A water di@@ vin@@ er is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A tra@@ di@@ tional mi@@ d@@ wife is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
A tra@@ di@@ tional b@@ one se@@ tter is a profes@@ si@@ onal .
These are profes@@ sion@@ als all over the world .
You find them in any in@@ ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the main@@ stre@@ am and show that the kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls that they have is univers@@ al .
"It needs to be used , needs to be app@@ li@@ ed , needs to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and sk@@ il@@ ls are rele@@ v@@ ant even today ."
So the college works follo@@ wing the li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le and work@@ st@@ y@@ le of M@@ a@@ ha@@ t@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"You e@@ at on the flo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the flo@@ or , you work on the flo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ tra@@ cts , no w@@ rit@@ ten con@@ tra@@ cts ."
"You can st@@ ay with me for 20 years , go to@@ mor@@ ro@@ w ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try cra@@ z@@ y ideas .
"W@@ ha@@ te@@ ver idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fai@@ l .
"B@@ at@@ tered , b@@ ru@@ is@@ ed , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
You are cer@@ ti@@ fied by the comm@@ unity you serve .
You don &apos;t need a pap@@ er to h@@ ang on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all mu@@ m@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot archite@@ cts who can &apos;t read and wr@@ ite , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 150 people li@@ ved there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ h@@ an A@@ ward for A@@ rch@@ ite@@ cture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they su@@ spe@@ cted , they thought there was an archite@@ ct behind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the b@@ lu@@ ep@@ rin@@ ts , but the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot archite@@ cts actually con@@ stru@@ cted the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually c@@ as@@ ting as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot archite@@ cts of T@@ il@@ onia ."
"I asked a for@@ es@@ ter — high@@ -@@ power@@ ed , pap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied ex@@ per@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ i@@ l and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
Not even wor@@ th it .
"N@@ o water , ro@@ c@@ k@@ y so@@ i@@ l . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a spo@@ t ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this spo@@ t ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qui@@ e@@ tly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ le@@ ar out ."
The men should cle@@ ar out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wa@@ ter@@ pro@@ of@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ ger@@ y , a bit of ur@@ ens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t le@@ ak .
"S@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 8@@ 6 , it h@@ as@@ n &apos;t le@@ ak@@ ed ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied .
A@@ ll the power comes from the su@@ n .
45 ki@@ lo@@ w@@ at@@ ts of pan@@ el@@ s on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the su@@ n for the next 25 years .
"So long as the su@@ n sh@@ ines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beau@@ ty is that is was in@@ st@@ al@@ led by a pri@@ est , a H@@ in@@ d@@ u pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ mar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to college ."
He kno@@ ws more about solar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
"F@@ o@@ od , if you come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is solar coo@@ ked ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ated that solar coo@@ ker are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ate the most so@@ ph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated solar coo@@ ker ."
It &apos;s a par@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c S@@ ch@@ ef@@ f@@ ler solar coo@@ ker .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely , they &apos;re almost half Ger@@ man , they &apos;re so prec@@ ise ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indi@@ an women so prec@@ ise .
"A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that coo@@ ker ."
And we have 60 me@@ als tw@@ ice a day of solar coo@@ king .
"We have a den@@ ti@@ st — she &apos;s a grand@@ mother , il@@ liter@@ ate , who &apos;s a den@@ ti@@ st ."
"She actually looks after the te@@ e@@ th of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot technology : this was 19@@ 8@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no archite@@ ct thought of it — but we are colle@@ c@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ of@@ s ."
V@@ ery little water is was@@ ted .
"All the ro@@ of@@ s are conne@@ cted un@@ d@@ erg@@ ro@@ und to a 4@@ 00@@ ,000 li@@ ter tan@@ k , and no water is was@@ ted ."
"If we have four years of dro@@ ught , we still have water on the c@@ am@@ p@@ us , because we colle@@ ct ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after an@@ im@@ als — sh@@ e@@ ep , go@@ a@@ ts — domestic chores ."
So we thought of star@@ ting a school at night for the children .
"Because the night schools of T@@ il@@ onia , over 7@@ 5@@ ,000 children have gone through these night schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we te@@ ach in these schools ?
"D@@ e@@ mo@@ cra@@ cy , ci@@ tiz@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ res@@ ted , what you should do if your an@@ ima@@ l is si@@ ck ."
This is what we te@@ ach in the night schools .
But all the schools are sol@@ ar@@ -@@ li@@ t .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"B@@ e@@ tween six to 14 year@@ -@@ old children par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te in a democra@@ tic process , and they ele@@ ct a pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter ."
The pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 go@@ a@@ ts in the mor@@ ning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter in the even@@ ing ."
"She has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et , a min@@ is@@ ter of education , a min@@ is@@ ter for energy , a min@@ is@@ ter for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ i@@ tor and super@@ v@@ ise 150 schools for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s P@@ riz@@ e five years ago , and she went to Swe@@ den ."
F@@ irst time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever seen Swe@@ den .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t d@@ az@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ u@@ een of Swe@@ den , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her con@@ fi@@ dence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not d@@ az@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the qu@@ een stra@@ i@@ ght in the ey@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me min@@ is@@ ter . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ere the per@@ cen@@ t@@ age of il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y is very high , we use p@@ up@@ pe@@ try ."
P@@ up@@ pe@@ ts is the way we comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate .
You have J@@ ok@@ him C@@ ha@@ ch@@ a who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my psycho@@ anal@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
He &apos;s my d@@ onor .
"He actually ra@@ is@@ es money , sol@@ ves my dis@@ pu@@ tes ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s ten@@ sion in the village , if at@@ ten@@ d@@ ance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a fri@@ ction between the teacher and the par@@ ent , the p@@ up@@ pe@@ t c@@ all@@ s the teacher and the par@@ ent in fron@@ t of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ake hands ."
The at@@ ten@@ d@@ ance must not drop . &quot; &quot; These p@@ up@@ pe@@ ts are made out of rec@@ y@@ c@@ led World B@@ ank re@@ por@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this de@@ cen@@ tr@@ alized , de@@ my@@ sti@@ fied approach of sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fy@@ ing vill@@ ages , we &apos;ve co@@ vered all over India from L@@ ad@@ ak@@ h up to B@@ hu@@ tan — all sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied vill@@ ages by people who have been tra@@ ined ."
"And we went to L@@ ad@@ ak@@ h , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both si@@ des — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the ben@@ ef@@ it you had from solar electri@@ city ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minu@@ te and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my h@@ usb@@ and &apos;s face in win@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to Af@@ gh@@ anistan .
One les@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tra@@ in@@ able .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous , men are com@@ pul@@ si@@ vely mo@@ bil@@ e , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate . ( Laughter )"
"All across the glo@@ be , you have this ten@@ den@@ cy of men wan@@ ting a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great sol@@ ution : tra@@ in grand@@ mothers .
What &apos;s the best way of comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ating in the world today ?
T@@ ele@@ vision ? No .
T@@ ele@@ graph ? No .
T@@ ele@@ ph@@ one ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Af@@ gh@@ anistan for the first time , and we pic@@ ked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ m@@ possible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ om@@ s , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ c@@ es@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the h@@ usb@@ ands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the h@@ usb@@ ands along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intel@@ lig@@ ent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tra@@ in these women ?"
S@@ ig@@ n language .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the w@@ rit@@ ten word .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the spo@@ k@@ en word .
You use sign language .
And in six months they can become solar engine@@ ers .
They go back and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied the first village , set up a work@@ sho@@ p — the first village ever to be sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied in Af@@ gh@@ anistan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This w@@ om@@ an@@ "
is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary grand@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied 200 h@@ ou@@ ses for me in Af@@ gh@@ anistan ."
And they ha@@ ven &apos;t col@@ l@@ ap@@ sed .
She actually went and spo@@ ke to an engine@@ ering de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in Af@@ gh@@ anistan and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tra@@ ined 2@@ 7 more women and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied 100 vill@@ ages in Af@@ gh@@ anistan .
"We went to A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , and we did the same thing ."
"All these women s@@ it@@ ting at one table from eight , n@@ ine countries , all ch@@ at@@ ting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speak@@ ing a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speak@@ ing to each other and actually be@@ coming solar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one , and there was this min@@ is@@ ter d@@ riv@@ ing down in the de@@ ad of night — comes across this village ."
"C@@ om@@ es back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ran@@ d@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; The min@@ is@@ ter cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Wh@@ ere did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent stra@@ i@@ ght to the pre@@ si@@ dent .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a sol@@ ar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied village in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the c@@ ab@@ in@@ et went to see the grand@@ mothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he sum@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you tra@@ in me 150 grand@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ re@@ si@@ dent ."
But they will . The grand@@ mothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot tra@@ in@@ ing center in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one .
And 150 grand@@ mothers have been tra@@ ined in S@@ ier@@ ra Le@@ one .
G@@ am@@ b@@ ia : we went to se@@ le@@ ct a grand@@ mother in G@@ am@@ b@@ ia .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The comm@@ unity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ake these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speak@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ f@@ ficul@@ t h@@ usb@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ al@@ led the h@@ usb@@ and , the h@@ usb@@ and came , sw@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing , poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an , mo@@ bil@@ e in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an Indi@@ an man ? &quot;"
That was his big@@ gest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll ring you up on the mo@@ bil@@ e . &quot; &quot; She went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and spo@@ ke to the whole pre@@ ss as if she was a ve@@ ter@@ an .
"She h@@ and@@ led the national pre@@ ss , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere &apos;s your h@@ usb@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Su@@ cc@@ ess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just win@@ d up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solu@@ tions outside .
Lo@@ ok for solu@@ tions within .
And lis@@ ten to people . They have the solu@@ tions in fron@@ t of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
D@@ on &apos;t even wor@@ ry .
"D@@ on &apos;t lis@@ ten to the World B@@ ank , lis@@ ten to the people on the ground ."
They have all the solu@@ tions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quot@@ ation by M@@ a@@ ha@@ t@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ irst they ig@@ nor@@ e you , then they lau@@ gh at you , then they fi@@ ght you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many f@@ el@@ low in@@ ma@@ tes who had big plan@@ s for the future .
"He had a vision . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to leave the do@@ pe game for good and f@@ ly stra@@ i@@ ght , and he was actually working on mer@@ ging his two pas@@ sions into one vision ."
"He &apos;d spent 1@@ 0,000 dollars to buy a w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite that ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely fe@@ a@@ tured women having sex on top of or inside of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y s@@ por@@ ts car@@ s . ( Laughter ) It was my first week in fe@@ der@@ al pris@@ on , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with s@@ mar@@ t , am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous men wh@@ ose b@@ usiness in@@ s@@ tin@@ cts were in many c@@ as@@ es as sh@@ ar@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and din@@ ed me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ris@@ ing star in the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i S@@ en@@ ate ."
"Now , 9@@ 5 percent of the gu@@ ys that I was loc@@ ked up with had been dru@@ g de@@ al@@ ers on the outside , but when they tal@@ ked about what they did , they tal@@ ked about it in a different j@@ arg@@ on , but the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts that they tal@@ ked about wer@@ en &apos;t un@@ like those that you &apos;d learn in a first year M@@ B@@ A clas@@ s at Wh@@ ar@@ ton : pro@@ moti@@ onal in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves , you never char@@ ge a fi@@ r@@ st@@ -@@ time us@@ er , foc@@ us@@ -@@ gro@@ up@@ ing new pro@@ du@@ ct lau@@ n@@ ches , ter@@ ri@@ tori@@ al expan@@ sion ."
But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time reli@@ ving the g@@ l@@ or@@ y days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survi@@ ve ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t p@@ ay , tax@@ pa@@ y@@ ers don &apos;t p@@ ay , for your life when you &apos;re in pris@@ on . You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your so@@ ap , your de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , to@@ oth@@ b@@ rus@@ h , to@@ oth@@ pas@@ te , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , everything &apos;s mar@@ ked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d p@@ ay on the stre@@ et , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I un@@ lo@@ ade@@ d tru@@ c@@ ks . That was my ful@@ l-@@ time job , un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing tru@@ c@@ ks at a fo@@ od war@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se , for $ 5@@ .@@ 25 , not an h@@ our , but per mon@@ th ."
So how do you survi@@ ve ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s leg@@ al hu@@ st@@ les .
You p@@ ay everything in st@@ am@@ ps . Th@@ ose are the cur@@ ren@@ cy .
You char@@ ge another in@@ mate to cle@@ an his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ leg@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , like you ru@@ n a bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ leg@@ al hu@@ st@@ les : You ru@@ n a ta@@ t@@ too par@@ lo@@ r out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very il@@ leg@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , which you s@@ mu@@ g@@ g@@ le in , you get s@@ mu@@ g@@ g@@ led in , dru@@ gs , por@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y , cell ph@@ ones , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a ris@@ k@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the ris@@ ki@@ er the en@@ ter@@ pris@@ e , the more prof@@ it@@ able it can po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally be ."
You want a ci@@ g@@ are@@ t@@ te in pris@@ on ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d@@ -@@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed cell ph@@ one that you f@@ li@@ p op@@ en and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred bu@@ c@@ ks .
You want a di@@ r@@ ty mag@@ az@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ pe@@ cts of pris@@ on life is in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ether it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous me@@ als from sto@@ le@@ n s@@ c@@ rap@@ s from the war@@ e@@ h@@ ou@@ se , s@@ cul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s h@@ air with to@@ en@@ ai@@ l c@@ lip@@ per@@ s , or con@@ stru@@ c@@ ting w@@ ei@@ ghts from b@@ ou@@ l@@ ders in lau@@ n@@ d@@ ry b@@ ag@@ s ti@@ ed on to tree lim@@ b@@ s , pris@@ on@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , bar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , pers@@ onal tra@@ in@@ ing b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ ses ."
"But there &apos;s no tra@@ in@@ ing , nothing to pre@@ par@@ e them for that , no re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ation at all in pris@@ on , no one to help them wr@@ ite a b@@ usiness pl@@ an , figu@@ re out a way to trans@@ late the b@@ usiness con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ iti@@ vely g@@ ras@@ p into leg@@ al en@@ ter@@ pris@@ es , no ac@@ c@@ ess to the Inter@@ net , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ ting em@@ ploy@@ ers from dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating against people with a bac@@ k@@ ground ."
So n@@ one of us should be surpris@@ ed that two out of three ex@@ -@@ of@@ f@@ en@@ ders re@@ -@@ of@@ f@@ end within five years .
"@@ Lo@@ ok , I li@@ ed to the F@@ e@@ ds . I lost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I vo@@ wed that I was going to do wh@@ ate@@ ver I could to make sure that gu@@ ys like the ones I was loc@@ ked up with didn &apos;t have to was@@ te any more of their life than they already had ."
So I ho@@ pe that you &apos;ll think about hel@@ ping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is figu@@ re out ways to n@@ ur@@ ture the en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al spi@@ ri@@ t and the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous un@@ t@@ app@@ ed po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al in our pris@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new sk@@ il@@ ls that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
A@@ ll they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for success .
"And it was found clo@@ se to here , S@@ tan@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old ki@@ d , &quot; &quot; Joh@@ n@@ ny , I am going to leave you here with a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; To tell a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old ki@@ d to wa@@ it 15 minutes for something that they like , is equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you co@@ f@@ fe@@ e in two h@@ ours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Ex@@ act equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ."
So what happened when the prof@@ ess@@ or left the room ?
As so@@ on as the do@@ or clo@@ sed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
"F@@ i@@ ve secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome las@@ ted 1@@ 4@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wa@@ it .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would pl@@ ay with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and pan@@ ts .
"That child already , at four , under@@ sto@@ od the most important princi@@ ple for success , which is the ab@@ ility to de@@ l@@ ay gra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follo@@ w@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 1@@ 8 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their plan@@ s .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing fin@@ e .
"A great per@@ cen@@ t@@ age of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , they were in tro@@ u@@ ble ."
They did not make it to univers@@ ity .
They had bad gra@@ des . S@@ ome of them dro@@ pped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into b@@ an@@ king , for example , or work at a c@@ as@@ h reg@@ is@@ ter ."
But she will be successful .
And this app@@ lies for everything . E@@ ven in s@@ al@@ es .
"If the s@@ al@@ es person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a second ."
I end with — the Kor@@ e@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over Kor@@ ea .
They are teach@@ ing these kids exactly this princi@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that princi@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big de@@ b@@ t ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , je@@ e@@ z , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !@@ "
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t s@@ mar@@ t enough .
And there &apos;s no ma@@ gi@@ c to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"M@@ i@@ ght fai@@ l , ki@@ d . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , ki@@ d ."
"M@@ ar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he in@@ spi@@ red the civi@@ l ri@@ ghts move@@ ments ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every ma@@ j@@ or b@@ loc@@ k@@ b@@ us@@ ting fil@@ m of re@@ cent times , ne@@ arly all of its visi@@ ons for human@@ ity are apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ."
"I think this fil@@ m is one of the har@@ de@@ st w@@ at@@ ches of modern times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is de@@ sol@@ ate , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to survi@@ ve , walking along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental movement of which I am a part of has been com@@ plic@@ it in cre@@ ating this vision of the future .
"For too long , we have pe@@ dd@@ led a ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ ish vision of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have foc@@ used on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case scen@@ ario .
We have foc@@ used on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solu@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s at@@ ten@@ tion ."
And any psycho@@ logis@@ t will tell you that fear in the organis@@ m is lin@@ ked to f@@ light me@@ chan@@ is@@ m .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light me@@ chan@@ is@@ m , that when an an@@ ima@@ l is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er fre@@ ez@@ es very , very still , po@@ is@@ ed to ru@@ n away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to eng@@ age with our ag@@ en@@ da around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ dation and cli@@ mate change .
P@@ eople are fre@@ ez@@ ing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environ@@ mental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be impro@@ ving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the market in terms of progress is a fin@@ an@@ cial defin@@ i@@ tion of what progress is , an economic defin@@ i@@ tion of what progress is — that some@@ how , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the sto@@ ck market , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic growth , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how appe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fear — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . In the We@@ ster@@ n world , we have enough ."
"M@@ aybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the wel@@ f@@ are of n@@ ations .
"In fact , the archite@@ ct of our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system , S@@ im@@ on K@@ u@@ z@@ ne@@ ts , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A n@@ ation &apos;s wel@@ f@@ are can s@@ car@@ c@@ ely be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national ac@@ coun@@ ting system which is fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly based on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , this is probably h@@ isto@@ ri@@ cal , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff ."
"And inde@@ ed , we were so successful at produc@@ ing certain ty@@ pes of stuff that we de@@ st@@ roy@@ ed a lot of Euro@@ pe , and we had to re@@ build it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system be@@ came fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can produce .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vis@@ ion@@ ary man , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy , at the start of his ill@@ -@@ fa@@ ted pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al c@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n , gave the most e@@ lo@@ qu@@ ent de@@ con@@ stru@@ ction of gro@@ ss national pro@@ du@@ ct that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ is@@ hed his talk with the ph@@ r@@ ase , that , &quot; &quot; The gro@@ ss national pro@@ du@@ ct me@@ as@@ ures everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How cra@@ z@@ y is that ? That our measure of progress , our domin@@ ant measure of progress in society , is me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy was ali@@ ve today , he would be asking stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to re@@ de@@ sign our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system to be based upo@@ n such important things as social j@@ ustice , su@@ st@@ ain@@ ab@@ ility and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scienti@@ sts have already gone out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global sur@@ v@@ ey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ surpris@@ ing@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their fami@@ lies , their children , their comm@@ uni@@ ties ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is sli@@ ghtly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as health .
We want to be heal@@ thy and live a ful@@ l life .
These seem to be natural human as@@ pira@@ tions .
Why are stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans not me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the progress of n@@ ations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my ad@@ ul@@ t life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental lim@@ its ."
"And we created , at the organiz@@ ation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ om@@ ic@@ s F@@ oun@@ dation , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ ti@@ mate out@@ come of a n@@ ation is how successful is it at cre@@ ating happy and heal@@ thy lives for its ci@@ tiz@@ ens ."
That should be the go@@ al of every n@@ ation on the planet .
"But we have to remem@@ ber that there &apos;s a fun@@ da@@ mental in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resour@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ ti@@ mate s@@ car@@ ce resour@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And econom@@ ic@@ s is very interes@@ ted in s@@ car@@ city .
"When it has a s@@ car@@ ce resour@@ ce that it wan@@ ts to turn into a de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble out@@ come , it thin@@ ks in terms of ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy ."
It thin@@ ks in terms of how much b@@ ang do we get for our bu@@ ck .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our plan@@ e@@ tar@@ y resour@@ ce use .
It is an ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy measure .
"And probably the eas@@ i@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this graph ."
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning h@@ oriz@@ on@@ tally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resour@@ ces we use and how much pres@@ sure we put on the planet ."
M@@ or@@ e is bad .
"@@ R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ tically up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of n@@ ations ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ j@@ us@@ ted li@@ fe@@ -@@ expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and qu@@ anti@@ ty of life in n@@ ations .
"And the y@@ el@@ low do@@ t there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a hu@@ ge ar@@ ra@@ y of n@@ ations around that global average ."
"To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reas@@ on@@ ably well and produc@@ ing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other We@@ ster@@ n countries going across in those tri@@ ang@@ les and a few G@@ ul@@ f states in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , at the bot@@ tom left of the graph , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well-being — ty@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an A@@ fri@@ c@@ a ."
"In H@@ ob@@ be@@ si@@ an terms , life is sh@@ or@@ t and b@@ ru@@ tis@@ h there ."
The average life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"M@@ al@@ ar@@ ia , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are k@@ ill@@ ing a lot of people in these re@@ gi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ el@@ low tri@@ ang@@ les , that are doing better than global average , that are head@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the graph ."
This is an as@@ pira@@ tional graph .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the ear@@ th ."
They &apos;re La@@ tin American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I ha@@ ven &apos;t been to .
M@@ aybe some of you have .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a — average life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the la@@ test G@@ all@@ up world po@@ ll , the hap@@ pi@@ est n@@ ation on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the hap@@ pi@@ est place .
They are doing that on a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces that are used ty@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; We@@ ster@@ n world — a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ os@@ ta R@@ ic@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their electri@@ city comes from ren@@ e@@ w@@ able resour@@ ces .
Th@@ ei@@ r govern@@ ment is one of the first to comm@@ it to be carb@@ on neu@@ tral by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They ab@@ ol@@ is@@ hed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they inv@@ es@@ ted in social pro@@ gra@@ ms — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ ac@@ y ra@@ tes in La@@ tin America and in the world .
"And they have that La@@ tin vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social conne@@ c@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that possi@@ bly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be Nor@@ th American , might not be We@@ ster@@ n Euro@@ pe@@ an ."
It might be La@@ tin American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pul@@ l the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pul@@ l countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pul@@ l countries from the right of the graph ."
And then we &apos;re star@@ ting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ no@@ ther way of looking at it is looking at time tr@@ ends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the rich@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tr@@ end in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tr@@ end in e@@ co@@ logi@@ cal fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t ."
"And so in stri@@ ct happ@@ y@@ -@@ planet me@@ tho@@ do@@ logy , we &apos;ve become less ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent at tur@@ ning our ul@@ ti@@ mate s@@ car@@ ce resour@@ ce into the out@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child en@@ ter@@ ing school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dis@@ tant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . govern@@ ment tar@@ get on carb@@ on and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se e@@ mis@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not b@@ usiness as u@@ su@@ al ."
That is chang@@ ing our b@@ usiness .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organiz@@ ations , we do our govern@@ ment poli@@ cy and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on increas@@ ing well-being ."
No one can go to the poll@@ s and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to re@@ duce .
"N@@ one of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of human@@ ity to keep on increas@@ ing .
And I think this is where cli@@ mate change skep@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep increas@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to eng@@ age them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to dra@@ w grap@@ h@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a le@@ a@@ f out of syste@@ ms theory , syste@@ ms engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ ps , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ u@@ man be@@ ings are very moti@@ v@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a s@@ mar@@ t me@@ ter in your home , and you see how much electri@@ city you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s cos@@ ting you , your kids go around and turn the li@@ ghts off pretty quickly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the ra@@ dio news every even@@ ing , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the dol@@ lar po@@ und ra@@ tio — I don &apos;t even know which way the dol@@ lar po@@ und ra@@ tio should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy B@@ rit@@ ain used ye@@ ster@@ day , or American used ye@@ ster@@ day ?"
Di@@ d we me@@ et our three percent an@@ nu@@ al tar@@ get on re@@ duc@@ ing carb@@ on e@@ mis@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a colle@@ ctive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the me@@ dia and start thinking about it .
"And we need positive fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ ps for increas@@ ing well-being A@@ t a govern@@ ment level , they might create national ac@@ coun@@ ts of well-being ."
"A@@ t a b@@ usiness level , you might look at the well-being of your em@@ ploy@@ e@@ es , which we know is really lin@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is lin@@ ked to in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es ."
"A@@ t a pers@@ onal level , we need these nu@@ d@@ ges too ."
"M@@ aybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ ders ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a strong publi@@ c health message on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les a day and how much exer@@ c@@ ise we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be hap@@ pi@@ er ?
"We did a project for the Go@@ vern@@ ment O@@ f@@ fi@@ ce of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big pro@@ gra@@ m called the F@@ or@@ e@@ sight pro@@ gra@@ m — lots and lots of people — in@@ vol@@ ved lots of ex@@ per@@ ts — everything evidence based — a hu@@ ge to@@ me ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive ac@@ tions can you do to impro@@ ve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the se@@ cre@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will f@@ low out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to conne@@ ct , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ sto@@ n@@ es of your life ."
"D@@ o you inv@@ est the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep building them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fas@@ test way out of a bad mo@@ od : ste@@ p outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the ra@@ dio on and d@@ ance ."
B@@ e@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our positive mo@@ od .
The th@@ ir@@ d one is take no@@ tice .
"@@ How a@@ w@@ are are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you no@@ tice what &apos;s bub@@ bl@@ ing up for you and trying to emer@@ ge ?
"B@@ as@@ ed on a lot of evidence for min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , cogni@@ tive behavi@@ or@@ al therap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The f@@ our@@ th is keep learning and keep is important — learning throu@@ gh@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cu@@ ri@@ ous , they have much better health out@@ comes than those who start to clo@@ se down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be forma@@ l learning ; it &apos;s not kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge based .
It &apos;s more cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to co@@ ok a new dis@@ h , pic@@ king up an in@@ stru@@ ment you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fin@@ al one is that most anti@@ -@@ economic of acti@@ vi@@ ties , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tru@@ is@@ m , our compassion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward me@@ chan@@ is@@ m in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the mor@@ ning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much hap@@ pi@@ er that those that spent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these h@@ an@@ dy po@@ st@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the ear@@ th ."
They don &apos;t have any carb@@ on con@@ tent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ o@@ ds to be s@@ atis@@ fied .

A few months ago the No@@ be@@ l P@@ riz@@ e in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ am@@ s of astrono@@ mer@@ s for a disco@@ very that has been h@@ ai@@ led as one of the most important astrono@@ mi@@ cal observ@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ ef@@ ly describ@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al fra@@ me@@ work for explain@@ ing their disco@@ very , na@@ me@@ ly the possi@@ bility that way be@@ y@@ on@@ d the Earth , the Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dis@@ tant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vas@@ t comple@@ x of universes that we call the multi@@ verse ."
Now the idea of a multi@@ verse is a strange one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with for@@ e@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was h@@ ol@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ o@@ ph@@ ia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , universe or multi@@ verse ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But bar@@ ring such an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous up@@ b@@ rin@@ ging , it is strange to imagine other re@@ al@@ ms s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate from ours , most with fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ ghtly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , spe@@ cul@@ ative though the idea su@@ re@@ ly is , I ai@@ m to con@@ vin@@ ce you that there &apos;s reason for tak@@ ing it ser@@ i@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multi@@ verse in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those No@@ be@@ l P@@ riz@@ e-@@ win@@ ning results and to high@@ light a pro@@ found my@@ ster@@ y which those results re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll of@@ fer a sol@@ ution to that my@@ ster@@ y ."
"It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multi@@ verse will come into the story ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ cal theory called in@@ fl@@ ation , which will pul@@ l all the pie@@ ces of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great astrono@@ mer E@@ d@@ win H@@ u@@ b@@ ble re@@ alized that the dis@@ tant galaxies were all rus@@ hing away from us , e@@ st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ing , it &apos;s expan@@ ding ."
Now this was re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary .
The pre@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ ing w@@ is@@ dom was that on the lar@@ gest of scal@@ es the universe was stati@@ c .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expan@@ sion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down ."
"That , much as the gra@@ vit@@ ational pul@@ l of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ cent of an ap@@ ple to@@ ss@@ ed up@@ ward , the gra@@ vit@@ ational pul@@ l of each galax@@ y on every other must be s@@ lo@@ wing the expan@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fas@@ t@@ -@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ am@@ s of astrono@@ mer@@ s I men@@ tion@@ ed at the out@@ set were in@@ spi@@ red by this reas@@ on@@ ing to measure the rate at which the expan@@ sion has been s@@ lo@@ wing .
"And they did this by pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ing observ@@ ations of nu@@ mer@@ ous dis@@ tant galaxies , allo@@ wing them to char@@ t how the expan@@ sion rate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surpris@@ e : They found that the expan@@ sion is not s@@ lo@@ wing down .
"In@@ ste@@ ad they found that it &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding up , going fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter ."
That &apos;s like to@@ ss@@ ing an ap@@ ple up@@ ward and it goes up fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter .
"Now if you saw an ap@@ ple do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s p@@ us@@ hing on it ?
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the astrono@@ mer@@ s &apos; results are su@@ re@@ ly well-@@ de@@ ser@@ ving of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ riz@@ e , but they ra@@ is@@ ed an anal@@ og@@ ous question ."
What force is d@@ riv@@ ing all galaxies to rus@@ h away from every other at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ quic@@ ken@@ ing spe@@ ed ?
Well the most pro@@ mis@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jects together ."
"But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his gener@@ al theory of rel@@ ati@@ vity , gravity can also p@@ us@@ h things apar@@ t ."
"@@ How ? Well ac@@ cor@@ ding to Einstein &apos;s ma@@ th , if space is uni@@ for@@ m@@ ly fil@@ led with an in@@ visi@@ ble energy , sort of like a uni@@ form , in@@ visi@@ ble mis@@ t , then the gravity gener@@ ated by that mis@@ t would be re@@ pul@@ sive , re@@ pul@@ sive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observ@@ ations ."
"Because the re@@ pul@@ sive gravity of an in@@ visi@@ ble energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it s@@ mo@@ ke@@ y wh@@ ite here so you can see it — its re@@ pul@@ sive gravity would cause each galax@@ y to p@@ us@@ h against every other , d@@ riv@@ ing expan@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ presen@@ ts great progress .
But I pro@@ mis@@ ed you a my@@ ster@@ y here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astrono@@ mer@@ s worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ fus@@ ing space to ac@@ coun@@ t for the cos@@ mic spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ press@@ ed in the rele@@ v@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ularly small ."
And the my@@ ster@@ y is to explain this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar number .
"We want this number to emer@@ ge from the la@@ ws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"M@@ aybe explain@@ ing this number is just a tech@@ ni@@ cal issue , a tech@@ ni@@ cal de@@ tai@@ l of inter@@ est to ex@@ per@@ ts , but of no rele@@ van@@ ce to any@@ body else ."
"Well it su@@ re@@ ly is a tech@@ ni@@ cal de@@ tai@@ l , but some de@@ ta@@ il@@ s really matter ."
"S@@ ome de@@ ta@@ il@@ s pro@@ vi@@ de win@@ do@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted re@@ al@@ ms of reality , and this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made head@@ way to explain it in@@ vo@@ kes the possi@@ bility of other universes — an idea that na@@ tur@@ ally emer@@ ges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the my@@ ster@@ y of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three ke@@ y things about string theory .
"F@@ irst off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an approach to re@@ aliz@@ e Einstein &apos;s dre@@ am of a uni@@ fied theory of physics , a single o@@ ver@@ arch@@ ing fra@@ me@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the cen@@ tral idea of string theory is quite stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you exam@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find mole@@ cul@@ es and then you &apos;ll find atoms and sub@@ ato@@ mic particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be sm@@ al@@ ler , much sm@@ al@@ ler than we can with exis@@ ting technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibra@@ ting fil@@ a@@ ment of energy , a little tiny vibra@@ ting string ."
"And just like the st@@ rings on a viol@@ in , they can vibra@@ te in different patter@@ ns produc@@ ing different mu@@ si@@ cal n@@ otes ."
"Th@@ ese little fun@@ da@@ mental st@@ rings , when they vibra@@ te in different patter@@ ns , they produce different kinds of particles — so elec@@ trons , qu@@ ar@@ ks , neu@@ tr@@ in@@ os , ph@@ o@@ ton@@ s , all other particles would be uni@@ ted into a single fra@@ me@@ work , as they would all ar@@ ise from vibra@@ ting st@@ rings ."
"It &apos;s a com@@ p@@ el@@ ling picture , a kind of cos@@ mic sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , where all the rich@@ ness that we see in the world around us emer@@ ges from the music that these little , tiny st@@ rings can pl@@ ay ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this eleg@@ ant uni@@ fic@@ ation , because years of research have sho@@ wn that the ma@@ th of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ n@@ al in@@ con@@ sis@@ ten@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we al@@ low for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the u@@ su@@ al three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as h@@ eight , w@@ id@@ th and de@@ p@@ th ."
"But string theory says that , on fantas@@ tically small scal@@ es , there are ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions c@@ ru@@ m@@ ple@@ d to a tiny si@@ ze so small that we have not de@@ te@@ cted them ."
"But even though the dimensions are h@@ id@@ den , they would have an im@@ p@@ act on things that we can ob@@ serve because the shape of the extra dimensions con@@ stra@@ ins how the st@@ rings can vibra@@ te ."
"And in string theory , vibra@@ tion de@@ ter@@ mines everything ."
"So partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the st@@ r@@ eng@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most impor@@ tan@@ tly , the amount of dark energy would be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cu@@ late the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
A@@ ll we have is a lis@@ t of can@@ did@@ ate shap@@ es allowed by the ma@@ th .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different can@@ did@@ ate shap@@ es , so you can imagine anal@@ y@@ z@@ ing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ one to de@@ ter@@ min@@ e if any y@@ i@@ el@@ d the physical fe@@ atures we ob@@ serve ."
But over time the lis@@ t gre@@ w as rese@@ arch@@ ers found other can@@ did@@ ate shap@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hundre@@ ds and then the thousands — A large , but still man@@ ag@@ e@@ able , colle@@ ction to anal@@ y@@ ze , since after all , gra@@ du@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the lis@@ t contin@@ u@@ ed to grow into the mil@@ lions and the bil@@ lions , until today ."
The lis@@ t of can@@ did@@ ate shap@@ es has so@@ ar@@ ed to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some rese@@ arch@@ ers lost heart , con@@ clu@@ ding that was so many can@@ did@@ ate shap@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving rise to different physical fe@@ atures , string theory would never make defin@@ iti@@ ve , te@@ st@@ able predic@@ tions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , tak@@ ing us to the possi@@ bility of a multi@@ verse ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
M@@ aybe each of these shap@@ es is on an equal fo@@ oti@@ n@@ g with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this radi@@ cal pro@@ pos@@ al has a pro@@ found im@@ p@@ act on this my@@ ster@@ y : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the No@@ be@@ l P@@ riz@@ e-@@ win@@ ning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Wh@@ ich means that the my@@ ster@@ y of explain@@ ing the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measu@@ red would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different char@@ ac@@ ter .
"In this con@@ te@@ x@@ t , the la@@ ws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
Wh@@ ich means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we human@@ s find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red instead of any of the other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make head@@ way .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tries to clu@@ m@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive p@@ us@@ h of the dark energy is so strong that it blo@@ ws the clu@@ m@@ p apar@@ t and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they col@@ l@@ ap@@ se back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to exis@@ t in those other universes ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red simply because our universe has con@@ ditions h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ ster@@ y sol@@ ved , multi@@ verse found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ s@@ atis@@ fy@@ ing .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ iti@@ ve ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ serve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving can and does take on a wi@@ de vari@@ e@@ ty of different val@@ ues across the w@@ ide@@ r l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular val@@ ue is simply mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d ."
An early example comes from the great astrono@@ mer Joh@@ an@@ n@@ es Kepler who was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 9@@ 3 million miles away from the Earth .
"And he worked for dec@@ ades trying to explain this number , but he never succ@@ e@@ e@@ ded , and we know why ."
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wi@@ de vari@@ e@@ ty of different dis@@ tan@@ ces from their h@@ ost stars .
"So h@@ op@@ ing that the la@@ ws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million miles , well that is simply w@@ ron@@ gh@@ e@@ ade@@ d ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad the right question to ask is , why do we human@@ s find ourselves on a planet at this particular dis@@ tan@@ ce , instead of any of the other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose planets which are much clo@@ se@@ r to a star like the Sun would be so ho@@ t that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exis@@ t .
"And those planets that are much far@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so col@@ d that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular dis@@ tan@@ ce simply because it y@@ i@@ el@@ ds con@@ ditions vit@@ al to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their dis@@ tan@@ ces , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"One ke@@ y difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only spe@@ cu@@ lated on the possi@@ bility that there might be other universes ."
"So to pul@@ l it all together , we need a me@@ chan@@ is@@ m that can actually gener@@ ate other universes ."
"And that takes me to my fin@@ al part , part three ."
Because such a me@@ chan@@ is@@ m has been found by cos@@ mo@@ logis@@ ts trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we of@@ ten have an ima@@ ge of a kind of cos@@ mic ex@@ plo@@ sion that created our universe and set space rus@@ hing ou@@ tw@@ ard ."
But there &apos;s a little se@@ cre@@ t .
"The Big Bang le@@ av@@ es out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It tell@@ s us how the universe evol@@ ved after the Bang , but gi@@ ves us no in@@ sight into what would have power@@ ed the Bang itself ."
And this g@@ ap was finally fil@@ led by an en@@ h@@ an@@ ced ver@@ sion of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary cos@@ mo@@ logy , which id@@ enti@@ fied a particular kind of fu@@ el that would na@@ tur@@ ally gener@@ ate an ou@@ tw@@ ard rus@@ h of space ."
"The fu@@ el is based on something called a quantum field , but the only de@@ tai@@ l that ma@@ t@@ ters for us is that this fu@@ el pro@@ ves to be so ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent that it &apos;s vi@@ r@@ tually im@@ possible to use it all up , which means in the in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary theory , the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is lik@@ ely not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad the fu@@ el not only gener@@ ated our Big Bang , but it would also gener@@ ate coun@@ t@@ less other Big B@@ an@@ gs , each giving rise to its own s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate universe with our universe be@@ coming but one bub@@ ble in a g@@ rand cos@@ mic bub@@ ble b@@ ath of universes ."
"And now , when we me@@ ld this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wi@@ de vari@@ e@@ ty of different shap@@ es .
The different shap@@ es y@@ i@@ el@@ d different physical fe@@ atures .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the com@@ p@@ el@@ ling but high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the w@@ ide@@ r cos@@ mos that cu@@ t@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ ed@@ ge observ@@ ation and theory have now led us to ser@@ i@@ ously con@@ sider .
"One big re@@ main@@ ing question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fi@@ r@@ m the exis@@ t@@ ence of other universes ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary theory already has strong observ@@ ational sup@@ port .
"Because the theory predic@@ ts that the Big Bang would have been so in@@ ten@@ se that as space rap@@ id@@ ly expan@@ ded , tiny quantum j@@ it@@ ters from the mi@@ c@@ ro world would have been stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ed out to the ma@@ c@@ ro world , y@@ i@@ el@@ ding a dis@@ tin@@ ctive fin@@ ger@@ prin@@ t , a patter@@ n of sli@@ ghtly h@@ ot@@ ter spo@@ ts and sli@@ ghtly col@@ der spo@@ ts , across space , which power@@ ful tele@@ sco@@ pes have now ob@@ ser@@ ved ."
"G@@ o@@ ing f@@ ur@@ ther , if there are other universes , the theory predic@@ ts that every so of@@ ten those universes can col@@ li@@ de ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that col@@ lis@@ ion would gener@@ ate an ad@@ di@@ tional sub@@ tle patter@@ n of tem@@ per@@ ature vari@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to de@@ te@@ ct ."
"And so ex@@ oti@@ c as this picture is , it may one day be gro@@ un@@ ded in observ@@ ations , e@@ st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hing the exis@@ t@@ ence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll con@@ clu@@ de with a st@@ rik@@ ing im@@ plic@@ ation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not stati@@ c , that space is expan@@ ding , that that expan@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up and that there might be other universes all by car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly exam@@ in@@ ing fain@@ t pin@@ poin@@ ts of star@@ light coming to us from dis@@ tant galaxies ."
"But because the expan@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rus@@ h away so far and so fas@@ t that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of technologi@@ cal li@@ mit@@ ations , but because of the la@@ ws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies em@@ it , even tra@@ vel@@ ing at the fas@@ test spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to o@@ ver@@ come the e@@ ver@@ -@@ w@@ id@@ en@@ ing g@@ ul@@ f between us ."
"So astrono@@ mer@@ s in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an en@@ d@@ less stre@@ t@@ ch of stati@@ c , in@@ k@@ y , black sti@@ ll@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ clu@@ de that the universe is stati@@ c and un@@ chang@@ ing and po@@ pu@@ lated by a single cen@@ tral o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ ha@@ bit — a picture of the cos@@ mos that we defin@@ iti@@ vely know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astrono@@ mer@@ s will have re@@ cor@@ ds h@@ an@@ ded down from an ear@@ li@@ er era , like ours , at@@ tes@@ ting to an expan@@ ding cos@@ mos te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future astrono@@ mer@@ s believe such an@@ ci@@ ent kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , stati@@ c em@@ p@@ ty universe that their own sta@@ te@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ ar@@ t observ@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I su@@ spe@@ ct the la@@ tter .
Wh@@ ich means that we are li@@ ving through a re@@ mar@@ ka@@ bly pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed era when certain de@@ ep tru@@ ths about the cos@@ mos are still within re@@ ach of the human spi@@ ri@@ t of explor@@ ation .
It appe@@ ar@@ s that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s astrono@@ mer@@ s , by tur@@ ning power@@ ful tele@@ sco@@ pes to the sk@@ y , have cap@@ tured a h@@ and@@ ful of star@@ kly in@@ for@@ mati@@ ve ph@@ o@@ ton@@ s — a kind of cos@@ mic tele@@ gra@@ m bil@@ lions of years in tr@@ an@@ si@@ t ."
and the message ech@@ o@@ ing across the ages is cle@@ ar .
S@@ ome@@ times nature gu@@ ar@@ ds her se@@ cre@@ ts with the un@@ bre@@ aka@@ ble gri@@ p of physical la@@ w .
S@@ ome@@ times the true nature of reality be@@ c@@ k@@ ons from just be@@ y@@ on@@ d the h@@ oriz@@ on .

"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Bri@@ an , than@@ k you ."

B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astrono@@ mer@@ s of the far future may not have enough information to figu@@ re things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain de@@ ep , cri@@ tical fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our ab@@ ility to understand because of how cos@@ mo@@ logy evol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spe@@ ctive , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the mi@@ cro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground radi@@ ation that was set down 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago — and yet , we can do cal@@ cul@@ ations today to pre@@ di@@ ct how it will look and it ma@@ t@@ ches ."
H@@ o@@ ly c@@ ow ! That &apos;s just a@@ maz@@ ing .
"So on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten , but who kno@@ ws what sort of b@@ loc@@ ks we may find in the future ."
C@@ A : You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .

"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vi@@ r@@ tually un@@ known Ger@@ man ma@@ the@@ mati@@ ci@@ an , na@@ med The@@ od@@ or Kal@@ u@@ za sug@@ g@@ es@@ ted a very b@@ old and , in some ways , a very b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re idea ."
"That is in ad@@ dition to left , right , back , for@@ th and up , down , Kal@@ u@@ za pro@@ posed that there might be ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a b@@ old and b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re idea , some@@ times that &apos;s all it is — b@@ old and b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , ho@@ w@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll dis@@ c@@ us@@ s experi@@ ments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a ma@@ j@@ or im@@ p@@ act on physics in the last century and contin@@ ues to in@@ form a lot of cu@@ t@@ tin@@ g@@ -@@ ed@@ ge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
"This is a year when Einstein is bas@@ king in the g@@ low of having disco@@ vered the spe@@ cial theory of rel@@ ati@@ vity and deci@@ des to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the g@@ rand , per@@ vas@@ i@@ ve force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been re@@ sol@@ ved ."
"@@ Ne@@ w@@ ton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1@@ 6@@ 00@@ s that works well , describ@@ es the mo@@ tion of planets , the mo@@ tion of the moon and so for@@ th , the mo@@ tion of apo@@ c@@ r@@ yp@@ ha@@ l of ap@@ pl@@ es f@@ all@@ ing from tre@@ es , h@@ it@@ ting people on the head ."
A@@ ll of that could be describ@@ ed using Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s work .
"But Einstein re@@ alized that Ne@@ w@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even Ne@@ w@@ ton had w@@ rit@@ ten that al@@ though he under@@ sto@@ od how to cal@@ cu@@ late the ef@@ fect of gravity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to figu@@ re out how it really works ."
"@@ How is it that the Sun , 9@@ 3 million miles away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it af@@ fe@@ cts the mo@@ tion of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun re@@ ach out across em@@ p@@ ty in@@ er@@ t space and exer@@ t in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a tas@@ k to which Einstein set h@@ im@@ self — to figu@@ re out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So Einstein found that the me@@ di@@ um that trans@@ m@@ its gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ stra@@ te of all there is .
"E@@ instein said space is ni@@ ce and fl@@ at , if there &apos;s no matter present ."
"But if there is matter in the environment , such as the Sun , it c@@ au@@ ses the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ates the force of gravity .
E@@ ven the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is k@@ ep@@ t in or@@ bit , ac@@ cor@@ ding to these ideas , because it ro@@ ll@@ s along a val@@ ley in the cur@@ ved environment that the Sun and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vi@@ r@@ tu@@ e of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a ful@@ l-@@ fra@@ me view of this .
The Earth itself is k@@ ep@@ t in or@@ bit because it ro@@ ll@@ s along a val@@ ley in the environment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Sun &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was tes@@ ted in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through astrono@@ mi@@ cal observ@@ ations ."
It really works . It describ@@ es the data .
And this g@@ ain@@ ed Einstein pro@@ min@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got Kal@@ u@@ za thinking .
"He , like Einstein , was in se@@ arch of what we call a uni@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of princi@@ pl@@ es , one mas@@ ter equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So Kal@@ u@@ za said to h@@ im@@ self , Einstein has been able to descri@@ be gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more prec@@ ise ."
"You know , the force responsi@@ ble for electri@@ city and magnetic at@@ tra@@ ction and so for@@ th ."
"So Kal@@ u@@ za says , maybe I can pl@@ ay the same game and descri@@ be elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ is@@ ed a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ instein had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So Kal@@ u@@ za said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scienti@@ sts had long known to descri@@ be the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force ."
A@@ maz@@ ing — it just po@@ pped out .
"He was so exci@@ ted by this re@@ alization that he ran around his h@@ ou@@ se scre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; V@@ ic@@ tory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the uni@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , Kal@@ u@@ za was a man who took theory very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ wi@@ m , he read a book , a tre@@ ati@@ se on sw@@ im@@ ming — ( Laughter ) — then do@@ ve into the o@@ c@@ ean ."
This is a man who would ris@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more pra@@ c@@ tically min@@ ded , two questions im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely ar@@ ise from his observ@@ ation ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in de@@ tai@@ l , when you try to app@@ ly it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a f@@ el@@ low na@@ med O@@ s@@ ka@@ r K@@ le@@ in ."
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a c@@ able sup@@ por@@ ting a tra@@ f@@ fi@@ c light ."
"It &apos;s in Man@@ ha@@ t@@ tan . You &apos;re in C@@ en@@ tral P@@ ark — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant — but the c@@ able looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal from a dis@@ tant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we zo@@ om in and take the per@@ spe@@ ctive of , say , a little ant walking around — little an@@ ts are so small that they can ac@@ c@@ ess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise , coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ w@@ ise di@@ re@@ ction ."
And I ho@@ pe you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these an@@ ts to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tes the fact that dimensions can be of two sor@@ ts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can eas@@ ily see , but there might be ad@@ di@@ tional dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the cir@@ cu@@ lar part of that c@@ able , so small that they have so far re@@ main@@ ed in@@ visi@@ ble ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"S@@ ome of you gu@@ ys will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not fl@@ at on a scre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes sm@@ al@@ ler , sm@@ al@@ ler , sm@@ al@@ ler , and way down in the mi@@ cro@@ sco@@ pi@@ c de@@ p@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ di@@ tional cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shape of a circ@@ le — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ tra mi@@ cro@@ sco@@ pi@@ c ant walking around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the gri@@ d part — but you could also ac@@ c@@ ess the tiny cur@@ le@@ d@@ -@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the n@@ ak@@ ed ey@@ e or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment ."
"But de@@ ep@@ ly tu@@ c@@ ked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to app@@ ly it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that Einstein and Kal@@ u@@ za and many others worked on trying to re@@ fin@@ e this fra@@ me@@ work and app@@ ly it to the physics of the universe as was under@@ sto@@ od at the time , and , in de@@ tai@@ l , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In de@@ tai@@ l , for in@@ st@@ ance , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t get the mas@@ s of the elec@@ tron to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , cer@@ tain@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this strange but very com@@ p@@ el@@ ling idea of how to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics had gone away ."
U@@ n@@ til something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our era , a new approach to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics is being pur@@ su@@ ed by physi@@ c@@ is@@ ts such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ string theory , as you were in@@ dic@@ ating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ string theory , we find that it re@@ sur@@ re@@ cts the idea in a s@@ par@@ kl@@ ing , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
S@@ uper@@ string theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the bas@@ ic , fun@@ da@@ mental , in@@ di@@ visi@@ ble , un@@ cu@@ t@@ table con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a fami@@ li@@ ar ob@@ ject , just a c@@ and@@ le in a h@@ older , and imagine that we want to figu@@ re out what it is made of ."
So we go on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y de@@ ep inside the ob@@ ject and exam@@ ine the con@@ sti@@ tu@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go suf@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ tly far down , you have atoms ."
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
They have little elec@@ trons that s@@ war@@ m around a cen@@ tral nu@@ cle@@ us with neu@@ trons and pro@@ ton@@ s .
E@@ ven the neu@@ trons and pro@@ ton@@ s have sm@@ al@@ ler particles inside of them known as qu@@ ar@@ ks .
That is where con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this d@@ an@@ cing fil@@ a@@ ment of energy .
"It looks like a vibra@@ ting string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vibra@@ ting st@@ rings that you just saw in a cel@@ lo can vibra@@ te in different patter@@ ns , these can also vibra@@ te in different patter@@ ns ."
They don &apos;t produce different mu@@ si@@ cal n@@ otes .
"@@ R@@ a@@ ther , they produce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ re@@ ct , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mi@@ cro@@ sco@@ pi@@ c l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a hu@@ ge number of these little tiny fil@@ a@@ ments of vibra@@ ting energy , vibra@@ ting in different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es produce the different particles .
The different particles are responsi@@ ble for all the rich@@ ness in the world around us .
"And there you see uni@@ fic@@ ation , because matter particles , elec@@ trons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , radi@@ ation particles , ph@@ o@@ ton@@ s , gra@@ vi@@ ton@@ s , are all built up from one enti@@ ty ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the ru@@ bri@@ c of vibra@@ ting st@@ rings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a uni@@ fied theory .
Now here is the c@@ atch .
"When you study the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , no@@ r five , no@@ r six ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It lead@@ s us right back to this idea of Kal@@ u@@ za and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when appro@@ pri@@ a@@ tely describ@@ ed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ ghtly cur@@ led up , ye@@ ah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation of gre@@ en people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them ei@@ ther . That is true ."
"One of the other predic@@ tions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ is@@ es the question : are we just trying to hi@@ de away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ main@@ ing time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ irst is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ ep@@ est question in theor@@ e@@ tical physics , theor@@ e@@ tical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scienti@@ sts have done for the last hundred years , there appe@@ ar to be about 20 numbers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"Th@@ ese are numbers like the mas@@ s of the particles , like elec@@ trons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , the st@@ r@@ eng@@ th of gravity , the st@@ r@@ eng@@ th of the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force — a lis@@ t of about 20 numbers that have been measu@@ red with incredible prec@@ is@@ ion , but no@@ body has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the numbers have the particular val@@ ues that they do ."
"Now , does string theory of@@ fer an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the val@@ ues they do may re@@ ly on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other val@@ ues than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t exis@@ t ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those numbers so fin@@ ely t@@ un@@ ed to al@@ low stars to sh@@ ine and planets to form , when we recogn@@ ize that if you fi@@ ddle with those numbers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and fi@@ ddle with those numbers , almost any fi@@ dd@@ ling makes the universe dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory sug@@ ge@@ sts that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the older ideas of Kal@@ u@@ za and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , inter@@ tw@@ ined ge@@ ome@@ try ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ al@@ ab@@ i@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shape — name isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions f@@ old in on themselves and inter@@ tw@@ ine in a very interesting shape , interesting stru@@ cture ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the mi@@ cro@@ sco@@ pi@@ c l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e of our universe all around us would look like this on the tin@@ i@@ est of scal@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be mo@@ ving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical im@@ plic@@ ation , though , rele@@ v@@ ant to those 20 numbers ?"
"C@@ on@@ sider this . I@@ f you look at the in@@ stru@@ ment , a F@@ ren@@ ch h@@ or@@ n , no@@ tice that the vibra@@ tions of the air@@ stre@@ am@@ s are af@@ fe@@ cted by the shape of the in@@ stru@@ ment ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are re@@ f@@ le@@ ctions of the way st@@ rings can vibra@@ te ."
"So just as those air@@ stre@@ am@@ s are af@@ fe@@ cted by the tw@@ is@@ ts and turns in the in@@ stru@@ ment , st@@ rings themselves will be af@@ fe@@ cted by the vibra@@ tional patter@@ ns in the ge@@ ome@@ try within which they are mo@@ ving ."
So let me bring some st@@ rings into the story .
"And if you watch these little f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws vibra@@ ting around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , no@@ tice that they way they vibra@@ te is af@@ fe@@ cted by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late the allowed n@@ otes , the allowed vibra@@ tional patter@@ ns ."
"And if we could cal@@ cu@@ late the allowed vibra@@ tional patter@@ ns , we should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ cul@@ ations ag@@ re@@ es with the val@@ ues of those numbers that have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed through de@@ tai@@ led and prec@@ ise experi@@ men@@ t@@ ation , this in many ways would be the first fun@@ da@@ mental ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the stru@@ cture of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more di@@ rec@@ tly ?"
"It &apos;s a machine that will sen@@ d particles around a t@@ un@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite di@@ rec@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so of@@ ten those particles will be ai@@ med at each other , so there &apos;s a head@@ -@@ on col@@ lis@@ ion ."
"The ho@@ pe is that if the col@@ lis@@ ion has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the de@@ b@@ ris from the col@@ lis@@ ion from our dimensions , for@@ cing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the col@@ lis@@ ion , compar@@ e it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the col@@ lis@@ ion than before , this will be evidence that the energy has d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it d@@ ri@@ f@@ ts away in the right patter@@ n that we can cal@@ cu@@ late , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea vis@@ u@@ ally .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a gra@@ vi@@ ton — that &apos;s the kind of de@@ b@@ ris we expe@@ ct to be e@@ je@@ cted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You s@@ la@@ m them together .
"You s@@ la@@ m them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that col@@ lis@@ ion will go into de@@ b@@ ris that f@@ lies off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ar@@ s f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ je@@ cted by no@@ tic@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we beg@@ an , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"E@@ instein comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ maz@@ ing possi@@ bility .
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the rate of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , that your children seem to change by the minu@@ te but your par@@ ents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the name of this ma@@ gi@@ cal point in life where change su@@ d@@ den@@ ly goes from a gal@@ lo@@ p to a cra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ en@@ age years ? I@@ s it middle age ?
D@@ o@@ es any of this matter ?
They need to be part of the p@@ ack .
"I still remem@@ ber the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use dig@@ ital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ ks ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad , I have progre@@ ss@@ ed , and I am , today , lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing a brand new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x con@@ tain@@ s one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people ."
"In the develo@@ ping world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they li@@ ved away then .
There was a big g@@ ap between the one billion in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world and the two billion in the develo@@ ping world .
"In the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world , people were heal@@ thy , educ@@ ated , rich , and they had small fami@@ lies ."
And their as@@ pira@@ tion was to buy a c@@ ar .
"And in 19@@ 60 , all Swe@@ des were s@@ av@@ ing to try to buy a V@@ ol@@ vo like this ."
This was the economic level at which Swe@@ den was .
"But in con@@ tr@@ ast to this , in the develo@@ ping world , far away , the as@@ pira@@ tion of the average family there was to have fo@@ od for the day ."
They were s@@ av@@ ing to be able to buy a pai@@ r of sho@@ es .
There was an en@@ orm@@ ous g@@ ap in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this g@@ ap between the W@@ est and the rest has created a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tically when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ ping World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s o@@ ver@@ du@@ e to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that tax@@ onom@@ y of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ b@@ led since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of compan@@ ies have happened to grow the econom@@ y , so the We@@ ster@@ n population mo@@ ved over to here ."
And now their as@@ pira@@ tion is not only to have a c@@ ar .
Now they want to have a ho@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ m@@ ote des@@ tin@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the develo@@ ping countries , they have mo@@ ved on , you know , and they have become emer@@ ging econom@@ ies , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ y@@ ing car@@ s .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ in@@ ese compan@@ y , Ge@@ ely , they ac@@ qui@@ red the V@@ ol@@ vo compan@@ y , and then finally the Swe@@ des under@@ sto@@ od that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tra@@ ge@@ dy is that the two billion over here that is stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling for fo@@ od and sho@@ es , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the big@@ gest p@@ ile of bil@@ lions , the three bil@@ lions here , which are also be@@ coming emer@@ ging econom@@ ies , because they are quite heal@@ thy , rel@@ ati@@ vely well-@@ educ@@ ated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; rich@@ er also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ pira@@ tion now is , of course , to buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le , and then later on they would like to have a mo@@ tor@@ b@@ ike also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any g@@ ap ."
"But the dis@@ tan@@ ce from the poor@@ est here , the very poor@@ est , to the very rich@@ est over here is w@@ ide@@ r than ever ."
"But there is a contin@@ u@@ ous world from walking , b@@ ik@@ ing , d@@ riv@@ ing , f@@ ly@@ ing — there are people on all le@@ vel@@ s , and most people tend to be some@@ where in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to project into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai re@@ cen@@ tly , and I lis@@ ten@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will c@@ atch up , just as Japan did ."
A@@ ll the pro@@ je@@ ctions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start f@@ ly@@ ing .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the emer@@ ging income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards econom@@ ically ."
"And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can av@@ oi@@ d se@@ v@@ ere cli@@ mate change , and energy can still be rel@@ ati@@ vely che@@ ap — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electri@@ c car@@ s .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poor@@ est two billion ?
What about the poor@@ est two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; a@@ mon@@ g emer@@ ging econom@@ ies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ ide@@ ly used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"@@ Here &#91; a@@ mon@@ g the poor@@ est &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; poor@@ est &#93; two billion will , in the next dec@@ ades , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a nu@@ cle@@ ar war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poor@@ est &#93; get out of po@@ ver@@ ty , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child survi@@ val , they can buy a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and a cell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for fo@@ od and sho@@ es because then we get contin@@ u@@ ed population growth .
And let me show you why by con@@ ver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d@@ -@@ time dig@@ ital technology .
Here I have on the scre@@ en my country bub@@ b@@ les .
E@@ very bub@@ ble is a country . The si@@ ze is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ el@@ low on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark b@@ lu@@ e is A@@ fri@@ c@@ a ; bro@@ wn is Euro@@ pe ; gre@@ en is the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast and this light b@@ lu@@ e is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ sia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . S@@ ize is population .
"@@ Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big fami@@ lies , small fami@@ lies ."
The year is 19@@ 60 .
"And down here , child survi@@ val , the per@@ cen@@ t@@ age of children survi@@ ving chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od up to star@@ ting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and heal@@ th@@ i@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion We@@ ster@@ n world here — high chil@@ d@@ -@@ survi@@ val , small fami@@ lies — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develo@@ ping countries , with very large fami@@ lies and poor child survi@@ val ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years pas@@ s by , child survi@@ val is increas@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ ap , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ation , pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ ami@@ ly si@@ ze is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0@@ -@@ percent child survi@@ val , then fami@@ lies de@@ cre@@ ase , and most of the Ara@@ b countries in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast is f@@ all@@ ing down there &#91; to small fami@@ lies &#93; ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok , B@@ ang@@ la@@ des@@ h c@@ at@@ ch@@ ing up with India ."
"The whole emer@@ ging world jo@@ ins the We@@ ster@@ n world with good child survi@@ val and small family si@@ ze , but we still have the poor@@ est billion ."
"C@@ an you see the poor@@ est billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ x@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survi@@ val of only 70 to 80 percent , me@@ an@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at le@@ ast four who survi@@ ve to the next generation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve child survi@@ val to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ dation , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and aid organiz@@ ations , together with national govern@@ ment in the poor@@ est countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to re@@ ach a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able population si@@ ze of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
Ch@@ il@@ d survi@@ val is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child survi@@ val that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mis@@ t , n@@ ei@@ ther am I a p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ t ."
"I &apos;m a very ser@@ i@@ ous &quot; &quot; possi@@ bil@@ is@@ t . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new ca@@ te@@ gor@@ y where we take e@@ mo@@ tion apar@@ t , and we just work anal@@ y@@ tically with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"W@@ ith gre@@ en technology and with in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old W@@ est .
"@@ Re@@ mem@@ ber when this b@@ lu@@ e bo@@ x was all alone , lead@@ ing the world , li@@ ving its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ oun@@ dation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

S@@ up@@ pose that two American friends are tra@@ vel@@ ing together in I@@ tal@@ y .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him B@@ ill — is trans@@ fi@@ x@@ ed by em@@ bar@@ ras@@ s@@ ment , at star@@ ing at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two gu@@ ys was more lik@@ ely to have v@@ ot@@ ed for Ge@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , which for A@@ l G@@ or@@ e ?"
"And in this case , the st@@ ere@@ ot@@ y@@ pe cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a ma@@ j@@ or pers@@ on@@ ality tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"P@@ eople low on it like things that are fami@@ li@@ ar , that are saf@@ e and de@@ pen@@ d@@ able ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at Ap@@ ple@@ be@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also tell@@ s us a lot about poli@@ tics .
This tra@@ it also tell@@ s us a lot about the kinds of groups people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the We@@ b .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to ra@@ ise your hand , whether you are liber@@ al , left of center — on social is@@ su@@ es , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ mar@@ ily — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a th@@ ir@@ d op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of liber@@ tar@@ i@@ ans in the au@@ dience ."
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re liber@@ tar@@ i@@ an .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And ple@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to see@@ k a de@@ ep@@ er understanding of the world , our gener@@ al l@@ ack of moral di@@ vers@@ ity here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share val@@ ues , when people all share mor@@ als , they become a te@@ am , and once you eng@@ age the psycho@@ logy of te@@ am@@ s , it sh@@ u@@ ts down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the liber@@ al te@@ am lo@@ ses , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other te@@ am .
"We think they must be b@@ lin@@ ded by religi@@ on , or by simple stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ otes R@@ ep@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ can because they are b@@ lin@@ ded in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed in a moral ma@@ tri@@ x , in a particular moral ma@@ tri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pic@@ ked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psycho@@ logy and see where it takes us .
What is mor@@ ality and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psycho@@ logy is the idea that the mind is a bl@@ ank s@@ late at bir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ iti@@ al organiz@@ ation of the brain does not de@@ p@@ end that much on experience ."
It gi@@ ves us very strong feel@@ ings about those who cause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ oun@@ dation under@@ lies about 70 percent of the moral sta@@ te@@ ments I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The th@@ ir@@ d f@@ oun@@ dation is in@@ -@@ group / l@@ oy@@ al@@ ty .
You do find groups in the an@@ ima@@ l kin@@ g@@ dom — you do find coo@@ per@@ ative groups — but these groups are always ei@@ ther very small or they &apos;re all si@@ b@@ lin@@ gs .
"It &apos;s only a@@ mon@@ g human@@ s that you find very large groups of people who are able to coo@@ per@@ ate , jo@@ in together into groups , but in this case , groups that are uni@@ ted to fi@@ ght other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tri@@ b@@ al li@@ ving , of tri@@ b@@ al psycho@@ logy ."
( Laughter ) S@@ por@@ ts is to war as por@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y is to sex .
"We get to exer@@ c@@ ise some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent d@@ ri@@ ves ."
The f@@ our@@ th f@@ oun@@ dation is au@@ th@@ ority / re@@ spe@@ ct .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive ge@@ st@@ ures from two mem@@ bers of very clo@@ se@@ ly re@@ lated speci@@ es .
"It &apos;s based on more vol@@ un@@ tar@@ y de@@ fer@@ ence , and even ele@@ ments of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ oun@@ dation is pur@@ ity / s@@ an@@ c@@ ti@@ ty .
"This pain@@ ting is called &quot; &quot; The Al@@ leg@@ or@@ y O@@ f Ch@@ as@@ ti@@ ty , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about sup@@ press@@ ing fe@@ mal@@ e sex@@ u@@ ality ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ tion@@ n@@ ai@@ re , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"@@ Here are the results from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American ci@@ tiz@@ ens ."
"They give high en@@ d@@ or@@ se@@ ment of these sor@@ ts of sta@@ te@@ ments all across the bo@@ ard , but as you also see , liber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the line s@@ lo@@ pes down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just f@@ li@@ p through a few other sli@@ des .
"N@@ oti@@ ce also that on all of these grap@@ h@@ s , the s@@ lo@@ pe is ste@@ ep@@ er on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ ority , pur@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ich sho@@ ws that within any country , the dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fai@@ r@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first pan@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"All is or@@ der@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and an@@ im@@ als are doing what they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be doing , where they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be ."
"But then , given the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing wh@@ ate@@ ver he wan@@ ts , with every ap@@ er@@ ture of every other person and every other an@@ ima@@ l ."
S@@ ome of you might recogn@@ ize this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably gi@@ ves way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the cu@@ t@@ tin@@ gs of the ap@@ er@@ tures h@@ ur@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three pan@@ el@@ s por@@ tra@@ y the ti@@ mele@@ ss tru@@ th that order ten@@ ds to dec@@ ay ."
The tru@@ th of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first ro@@ und , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people ar@@ en &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a su@@ c@@ ker . I &apos;m not going to coo@@ per@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so coo@@ per@@ ation quickly dec@@ ays from reas@@ on@@ ably good , down to clo@@ se to z@@ er@@ o ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tri@@ ck — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ ach@@ ter said , on the se@@ ven@@ th ro@@ und , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New ru@@ le ."
Because I think that the grea@@ test won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of ro@@ ck , and then a lot of water and win@@ d , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that com@@ plic@@ ated .
"This is an ab@@ solu@@ te mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement between liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an religi@@ ons have at@@ tain@@ ed .
Th@@ ink about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
You find the same thing in H@@ in@@ du@@ is@@ m .
There are many high go@@ ds in H@@ in@@ du@@ is@@ m .
"T@@ w@@ o of them are V@@ is@@ h@@ n@@ u , the pre@@ ser@@ ver , and S@@ hi@@ va , the de@@ st@@ roy@@ er ."
This ima@@ ge actually is both of those go@@ ds sh@@ ar@@ ing the same body .
"You have the mar@@ kin@@ gs of V@@ is@@ h@@ n@@ u on the left , so we could think of V@@ is@@ h@@ n@@ u as the con@@ serv@@ ative go@@ d ."
"You have the mar@@ kin@@ gs of S@@ hi@@ va on the right , S@@ hi@@ va &apos;s the liber@@ al go@@ d . And they work together ."
"Th@@ ese two st@@ an@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ ep@@ est in@@ si@@ ghts that have ever been at@@ tain@@ ed into moral psycho@@ logy ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en mas@@ ter S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; I@@ f you want the tru@@ th to st@@ and cle@@ ar before you , never be for or against ."
"The stru@@ g@@ g@@ le between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely , it &apos;s a disease that has been c@@ au@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lead@@ ers ."
"But before you feel su@@ peri@@ or to Ge@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , before you thro@@ w a sto@@ ne , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ p@@ ping out of the b@@ at@@ tle of good and evi@@ l ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I telling you to not stri@@ ve ?
"A@@ m I telling you to em@@ bra@@ ce S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of for and against ?"
"N@@ o , ab@@ solu@@ tely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from Sa@@ man@@ tha Po@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gio V@@ i@@ ei@@ ra de M@@ el@@ lo , you can &apos;t just go char@@ ging in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that re@@ qui@@ re us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ orm@@ ous moral au@@ th@@ ority of the D@@ al@@ ai La@@ ma — and it comes from his moral hu@@ mil@@ ity .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is pas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely eng@@ ag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
P@@ eople here are pas@@ sion@@ a@@ tely eng@@ ag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tru@@ th .
And so I think that the answer is to use that pas@@ sion@@ ate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tru@@ th to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything uni@@ qu@@ e about human be@@ ings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with fully developed moral senti@@ ments .
We &apos;re ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with mor@@ ality as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I pers@@ on@@ ally am ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with mor@@ ality .
"It was all du@@ e to this woman , S@@ is@@ ter M@@ ary Mar@@ aste@@ la , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an al@@ ta@@ r b@@ oy , I bre@@ a@@ the@@ d in a lot of in@@ cen@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ ras@@ es in La@@ tin , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s to@@ p@@ -@@ down mor@@ ality app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religi@@ ous and n@@ on@@ -@@ religi@@ ous were equ@@ ally ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with mor@@ ality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly bas@@ is for moral dec@@ is@@ i@@ ons ."
But I wanted to go f@@ ur@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a che@@ mis@@ try of mor@@ ality . I want to know
if there was a moral mole@@ cu@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experi@@ ments , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I bro@@ ught some with me .
This little sy@@ rin@@ ge con@@ tain@@ s the moral mole@@ cu@@ le .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent mole@@ cu@@ le found only in ma@@ m@@ m@@ als .
"In ro@@ dents , it was known to make mothers care for their of@@ f@@ sp@@ ring , and in some cre@@ atures , allowed for tol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ ma@@ tes ."
"But in human@@ s , it was only known to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate bir@@ th and b@@ reas@@ t@@ fe@@ e@@ ding in women , and is rele@@ as@@ ed by both sex@@ es during sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral mole@@ cu@@ le .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ au@@ l , that is the world &apos;s stu@@ pi@@ dis@@ t idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a fe@@ mal@@ e mole@@ cu@@ le ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I coun@@ tered , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stu@@ pi@@ d idea ."
But it was te@@ st@@ ably stu@@ pi@@ d .
"In other words , I thought I could de@@ sign an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ ur@@ ns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ irst of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y mole@@ cu@@ le ."
"B@@ as@@ el@@ ine le@@ vel@@ s are ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o , without some sti@@ mul@@ us to cause its rele@@ ase ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ minu@@ te hal@@ f-@@ life , and de@@ gra@@ des rap@@ id@@ ly at room tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it fas@@ t and keep it col@@ d ."
I think I can do that .
"Now lu@@ c@@ ki@@ ly , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the b@@ loo@@ d , so I could do this experiment without learning neuro@@ su@@ rg@@ ery ."
Th@@ en I had to measure mor@@ ality .
So tak@@ ing on M@@ or@@ ality with a cap@@ ital M is a hu@@ ge project .
So I started sm@@ al@@ ler .
I stu@@ died one single vi@@ r@@ tu@@ e : tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 20@@ 00@@ s that countries with a high@@ er pro@@ por@@ tion of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy people are more pros@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic trans@@ ac@@ tions o@@ c@@ cu@@ r and more we@@ al@@ th is created , al@@ le@@ vi@@ ating po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
"So if I under@@ sto@@ od the che@@ mis@@ try of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty ."
But I &apos;m also a skep@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ ag@@ u@@ i@@ re approach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we tem@@ p@@ t people with vi@@ r@@ tu@@ e and vice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ stru@@ ction , and we never ever dec@@ ei@@ ve them ."
Th@@ en we ma@@ t@@ ch them in pair@@ s by computer .
"And in that pai@@ r , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tri@@ ck is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now wh@@ ate@@ ver you give up gets tri@@ ple@@ d in the other person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er .
And they get a message by computer saying person one s@@ ent you this amount of money .
"D@@ o you want to keep it all , or do you want to sen@@ d some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for minu@@ te .
You &apos;re going to si@@ t on these hard ch@@ air@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome ma@@ d scienti@@ st is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a ne@@ ed@@ le and take four tu@@ b@@ es of b@@ loo@@ d .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stran@@ ger ?
So this was the bir@@ th of v@@ am@@ pi@@ re econom@@ ic@@ s .
M@@ ake a dec@@ is@@ ion and give me some b@@ loo@@ d .
"So in fact , experi@@ mental econom@@ is@@ ts had ru@@ n this test around the world , and for much high@@ er st@@ akes , and the con@@ sen@@ su@@ s view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the trans@@ fer from the second person back to the first measu@@ red tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , econom@@ is@@ ts were flu@@ m@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ su@@ med money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 90 percent of the first dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ mak@@ ers s@@ ent money , and of those who rec@@ ei@@ ved money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ turned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing oxytocin we found that the more money the second person rec@@ ei@@ ved , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ard , the more money they re@@ turned ."
So we have a bi@@ o@@ logy of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wa@@ it . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ w@@ o things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in is@@ ol@@ ation .
"So we measu@@ red n@@ ine other mole@@ cul@@ es that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any ef@@ fect ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ di@@ re@@ ct relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin c@@ au@@ sed tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ i@@ pu@@ late oxytocin di@@ rec@@ tly ."
I used everything sh@@ or@@ t of a d@@ ri@@ ll to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a n@@ as@@ al in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ ag@@ ues in Z@@ u@@ rich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or plac@@ eb@@ o , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who s@@ ent all their money to a stran@@ ger — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or cognition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust mole@@ cu@@ le , but is it the moral mole@@ cu@@ le ?"
"U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we ran more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin in@@ fu@@ sion increas@@ es gener@@ os@@ ity in un@@ il@@ a@@ ter@@ al mon@@ e@@ tar@@ y trans@@ fer@@ s by 80 percent .
We showed it increas@@ es don@@ ations to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ated n@@ on@@ -@@ ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ co@@ logi@@ c ways to ra@@ ise oxytocin .
"Th@@ ese inclu@@ de mas@@ s@@ age , d@@ an@@ cing and pra@@ y@@ ing ."
"Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise oxytocin , people w@@ il@@ lin@@ g@@ ly op@@ en up their wal@@ le@@ ts and share money with stran@@ g@@ ers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is f@@ loo@@ ded with oxytocin ?
"To inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a vi@@ de@@ o of a father and his four year@@ -@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain can@@ cer ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed the vi@@ de@@ o , we had them rate their feel@@ ings and took b@@ loo@@ d before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of em@@ path@@ y .
So it &apos;s em@@ path@@ y that makes us conne@@ ct to other people .
It &apos;s em@@ path@@ y that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s em@@ path@@ y that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er na@@ med A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith wrote a book in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The The@@ or@@ y of M@@ or@@ al S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; In this book , S@@ m@@ ith argu@@ ed that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a to@@ p@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the e@@ mo@@ tions of others ."
"So if I do something that h@@ ur@@ ts you , I feel that pain ."
So I tend to av@@ oi@@ d that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your j@@ oy ."
So I tend to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ da@@ m S@@ m@@ ith who , 1@@ 7 years later , would wr@@ ite a little book called &quot; &quot; The We@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ oun@@ ding do@@ cu@@ ment of econom@@ ic@@ s ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral ph@@ i@@ lo@@ so@@ ph@@ er , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the mole@@ cu@@ le behind it .
"But kno@@ wing that mole@@ cu@@ le is val@@ u@@ able , because it tell@@ s us how to turn up this behavi@@ or and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it tell@@ s us why we see im@@ mor@@ ality ."
"So to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate im@@ mor@@ ality , let me bring you back now to 19@@ 80 ."
"I &apos;m working at a g@@ as st@@ ation on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of S@@ an@@ ta B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ."
"You si@@ t in a g@@ as st@@ ation all day , you see lots of mor@@ ality and im@@ mor@@ ality , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ un@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my c@@ as@@ hi@@ er &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful je@@ wel@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ pen@@ s it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ arl nec@@ kl@@ ace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very val@@ u@@ able .
"We have to find the ow@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ ea . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to deci@@ de what to do with this , and the ph@@ one rings ."
"And a man says very exci@@ te@@ dly , &quot; &quot; I was in your g@@ as st@@ ation a while ago , and I b@@ ou@@ ght this je@@ wel@@ ry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re s@@ av@@ ing my life . Here &apos;s my ph@@ one number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wa@@ it half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , re@@ la@@ x ."
"G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ ena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ g@@ ain he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so ni@@ ce , let &apos;s sp@@ li@@ t the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the je@@ wel@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a clas@@ sic c@@ on called the pi@@ ge@@ on drop , and I was the pi@@ ge@@ on ."
"So the way many con@@ s work is not that the con@@ man gets the vic@@ ti@@ m to trust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tru@@ sts the vic@@ ti@@ m ."
Now we know what happens .
"The vic@@ ti@@ m &apos;s brain rele@@ as@@ es oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing up your wal@@ let or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ i@@ pu@@ late our oxytocin syste@@ ms ?
"We found , tes@@ ting thousands of individu@@ als , that five percent of the population don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
"So if you trust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a tech@@ ni@@ cal word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them bas@@ tar@@ ds .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the at@@ tribu@@ tes of psycho@@ path@@ s .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted .
One is through impro@@ per n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing .
"So we &apos;ve stu@@ died sex@@ u@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t rele@@ ase oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
You need enough n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing for this system to develo@@ p pro@@ per@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high stre@@ ss in@@ hi@@ b@@ its oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stre@@ ss@@ ed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ hi@@ bi@@ ted , which is interesting — through the action of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one ."
"So we , in experi@@ ments , have ad@@ min@@ is@@ tered te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to men ."
"And instead of sh@@ ar@@ ing money , they become sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"But interes@@ tin@@ g@@ ly , high te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one mal@@ es are also more lik@@ ely to use their own money to p@@ un@@ ish others for being sel@@ f@@ ish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bi@@ o@@ logy , we have the y@@ in and y@@ ang of mor@@ ality ."
"We have oxytocin that conne@@ cts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one that makes us want to p@@ un@@ ish people who be@@ have im@@ mor@@ ally ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or govern@@ ment telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful lab@@ ora@@ tory experi@@ ments , do they really app@@ ly to real life ?"
"Y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;ve been wor@@ ry@@ ing about that too ."
So I &apos;ve gone out of the la@@ b to see if this really h@@ ol@@ ds in our dai@@ ly lives .
"So last sum@@ mer , I at@@ ten@@ ded a we@@ d@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Eng@@ land ."
200 people in this beautiful V@@ ic@@ tori@@ an man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I dro@@ ve up in my ren@@ ted V@@ aux@@ h@@ all .
And I took out a cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge and d@@ ry ice and ne@@ ed@@ les and tu@@ b@@ es .
And I took b@@ loo@@ d from the bri@@ de and the gro@@ om and the we@@ d@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the friends before and im@@ me@@ dia@@ tely after the vo@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And gu@@ ess what ?
"W@@ ed@@ din@@ gs cause a rele@@ ase of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the center of the we@@ d@@ ding solar system ?
The bri@@ de .
She had the big@@ gest increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lo@@ ves the we@@ d@@ ding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
"H@@ er mother , that &apos;s right ."
H@@ er mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends — ar@@ ra@@ y@@ ed around the bri@@ de like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it tell@@ s us that we &apos;ve design@@ ed this rit@@ u@@ al to conne@@ ct us to this new couple , conne@@ ct us e@@ mo@@ tion@@ ally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ate the speci@@ es .
I also wor@@ ri@@ ed that my trust experi@@ ments with small amoun@@ ts of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how of@@ ten we actually trust our lives to stran@@ g@@ ers .
"So even though I have a fear of h@@ ei@@ ghts , I re@@ cen@@ tly st@@ r@@ app@@ ed myself to another human being and ste@@ pped out of an air@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my b@@ loo@@ d before and after , and I had a hu@@ ge sp@@ ike of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can conne@@ ct to people .
"For example , through social me@@ dia ."
M@@ any people are T@@ we@@ e@@ ting right now .
So we inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ated the ro@@ le of social me@@ dia and found the using social me@@ dia produc@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ dig@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I ran this experiment re@@ cen@@ tly for the Kor@@ ean B@@ ro@@ ad@@ c@@ as@@ ting S@@ y@@ stem .
And they had the re@@ por@@ ters and their produc@@ ers par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
"And one of these gu@@ ys , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 150 percent sp@@ ike in oxytocin ."
"I mean , as@@ to@@ un@@ ding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social me@@ dia in p@@ riv@@ ate .
"When I wrote my re@@ port to the Kor@@ e@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my gu@@ ess was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They che@@ c@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s Facebook p@@ age .
There you go . That &apos;s conne@@ ction .
"So there &apos;s ton@@ s of ways that we can conne@@ ct to other people , and it seems to be univers@@ al ."
"T@@ w@@ o weeks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New G@@ u@@ in@@ ea where I went up to the high@@ lan@@ ds — very is@@ ol@@ ated tri@@ b@@ es of sub@@ sis@@ t@@ ence far@@ mer@@ s li@@ ving as they have li@@ ved for mil@@ len@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different langu@@ ages in the high@@ lan@@ ds .
These are the most pri@@ mi@@ tive people in the world .
And they inde@@ ed also rele@@ ase oxytocin .
So oxytocin conne@@ cts us to other people .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to rele@@ ase oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fav@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the eas@@ i@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . Gi@@ ve me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my pen@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ g@@ ging other people has ear@@ ned me the ni@@ c@@ k@@ name D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who rele@@ ase more oxytocin are hap@@ pi@@ er .
And they &apos;re hap@@ pi@@ er because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all ty@@ pes .
D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve says eight hu@@ gs a day .
Ei@@ ght hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be hap@@ pi@@ er and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to to@@ u@@ ch people , I can always sho@@ ve this up your no@@ se ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to sum@@ mer c@@ am@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ h@@ ol .
And I just w@@ ai@@ ted for the time that I could go off and read my bo@@ o@@ ks .
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ h@@ yn@@ ess is about fear of social j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
"We s@@ at in ro@@ ws of de@@ sk@@ s like this , and we did most of our work pretty auto@@ no@@ m@@ ously ."
"So , quite underst@@ and@@ ably , qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es like magne@@ tis@@ m and charis@@ ma su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to seem really important ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
It &apos;s great for in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts and it &apos;s great for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
"H@@ i , my name is Mar@@ cin — far@@ mer , techno@@ logis@@ t ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ p@@ en S@@ our@@ ce E@@ co@@ logy .
"We &apos;ve id@@ enti@@ fied the 50 most important mach@@ ines that we think it takes for modern life to exis@@ t — things from tra@@ c@@ tors , b@@ read o@@ ven@@ s , cir@@ cu@@ it mak@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and main@@ tain at a fra@@ ction of the cost ."
We call this the G@@ lo@@ b@@ al V@@ ill@@ age C@@ on@@ stru@@ ction S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ is@@ hed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in fu@@ sion energy , and I disco@@ vered I was us@@ ele@@ ss ."
I had no pra@@ c@@ tical sk@@ il@@ ls .
"The world presen@@ ted me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I gu@@ ess you can call it the con@@ su@@ mer li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
So I started a far@@ m in M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i and learned about the econom@@ ic@@ s of far@@ ming .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a tra@@ c@@ tor — then it bro@@ ke .
I pai@@ d to get it re@@ pai@@ red — then it bro@@ ke again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was bro@@ ke too ."
"I re@@ alized that the truly appro@@ pri@@ ate , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able far@@ m and se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ment just didn &apos;t exis@@ t yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were ro@@ b@@ ust , mo@@ du@@ lar , high@@ ly ef@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ miz@@ ed , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost , made from lo@@ cal and rec@@ y@@ c@@ led materi@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not design@@ ed for ob@@ so@@ les@@ c@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I tes@@ ted them .
And I found that in@@ du@@ stri@@ al produc@@ ti@@ vity can be achi@@ ev@@ ed on a small scal@@ e .
"So then I published the 3@@ D design@@ s , sche@@ ma@@ tics , in@@ stru@@ c@@ tional vi@@ de@@ os and bu@@ d@@ gets on a w@@ iki ."
"Th@@ en con@@ tribu@@ tors from all over the world beg@@ an sho@@ wing up , proto@@ ty@@ ping new mach@@ ines during de@@ dic@@ ated project vis@@ its ."
"So far , we have proto@@ ty@@ ped eight of the 50 mach@@ ines ."
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce has succ@@ e@@ e@@ ded with to@@ ols for man@@ ag@@ ing kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is star@@ ting to happen with har@@ d@@ w@@ are too .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on har@@ d@@ w@@ are because it is har@@ d@@ w@@ are that can change people &apos;s lives in such tan@@ gi@@ ble material ways .
"If we can lower the bar@@ ri@@ ers to far@@ ming , building , man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just mas@@ sive amoun@@ ts of human po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al ."
That &apos;s not only in the develo@@ ping world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American far@@ mer , buil@@ der , en@@ trep@@ ren@@ eu@@ r , ma@@ ker ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of exci@@ te@@ ment from these people , who can now start a con@@ stru@@ ction b@@ usiness , parts man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , organ@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ ling power back to the gri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ posi@@ tory of published design@@ s so cle@@ ar , so comple@@ te , that a single bur@@ ned D@@ V@@ D is ef@@ fe@@ c@@ ti@@ vely a civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation star@@ ter k@@ it ."
I &apos;ve plan@@ ted a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve press@@ ed 5@@ ,000 bri@@ c@@ ks in one day from the di@@ r@@ t ben@@ e@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a tra@@ c@@ tor in six days ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is truly sound , then the im@@ plic@@ ations are sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ."
"A grea@@ ter dis@@ tribu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ men@@ tally sound sup@@ ply ch@@ ain@@ s , and a new@@ ly rele@@ v@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y ma@@ ker culture can ho@@ pe to trans@@ cen@@ d ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial s@@ car@@ city ."
We &apos;re explor@@ ing the lim@@ its of what we all can do to make a better world with op@@ en har@@ d@@ w@@ are technology .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"A thous@@ and years later , a ma@@ m@@ m@@ ot@@ h died in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Ger@@ many ."
"A few cen@@ tu@@ ries after that , a gri@@ f@@ f@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also died in the same vic@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these an@@ im@@ als me@@ t their de@@ ath@@ s , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble f@@ ate ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the flu@@ te , a to@@ ol that created us@@ ele@@ ss vibra@@ tions in air mole@@ cul@@ es ."
But that is exactly what our an@@ c@@ es@@ tors did .
Now this turns out to be surpris@@ ing@@ ly common in the history of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation .
"But just as of@@ ten , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fu@@ n ."
T@@ ake what may be the most important inven@@ tion of modern times : program@@ ma@@ ble compu@@ ters .
"S@@ ome@@ one came up with the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea of tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds by press@@ ing small le@@ ver@@ s with our fin@@ g@@ ers , inven@@ ting the first mu@@ si@@ cal ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard ."
"In fact , the very first ty@@ pe@@ w@@ ri@@ ter was or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally called &quot; &quot; the w@@ ri@@ ting har@@ psi@@ chor@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ lu@@ tes and music led to even more power@@ ful bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a thous@@ and years ago , at the h@@ eight of the Is@@ la@@ mic R@@ en@@ ais@@ s@@ ance , three bro@@ thers in B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad design@@ ed a de@@ vice that was an auto@@ ma@@ ted org@@ an ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ stru@@ ment that pl@@ ays itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ stru@@ ment was basically a gi@@ ant music bo@@ x ."
This in@@ stru@@ ment was the first of its kind .
It was program@@ ma@@ ble .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a mas@@ sive le@@ ap for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are becomes thin@@ ka@@ ble for the first time with this inven@@ tion .
It came from the strange de@@ light of w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing a machine pl@@ ay music .
"In fact , the idea of program@@ ma@@ ble mach@@ ines was ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely k@@ ep@@ t ali@@ ve by music for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 00@@ s , mu@@ si@@ c@@ -@@ making mach@@ ines be@@ came the play@@ things of the P@@ aris@@ i@@ an el@@ ite ."
"And as de V@@ au@@ can@@ son was design@@ ing his ro@@ bo@@ t mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , he had another idea ."
"If you could pro@@ gra@@ m a machine to make ple@@ as@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds , why not pro@@ gra@@ m it to we@@ ave de@@ li@@ ght@@ ful patter@@ ns of co@@ lo@@ r out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new patter@@ n for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just program@@ med a new c@@ y@@ lin@@ der ."
This was the first program@@ ma@@ ble loo@@ m .
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"Y@@ es , the mil@@ it@@ ary in@@ vol@@ ve@@ ment is an important part of the story , but inven@@ ting a computer also re@@ qui@@ red other building b@@ loc@@ ks : music bo@@ x@@ es , toy ro@@ bo@@ t flu@@ te play@@ ers , har@@ psi@@ chor@@ d ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful patter@@ ns wo@@ ven into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
Ne@@ c@@ ess@@ ity isn &apos;t always the mother of inven@@ tion .
"The play@@ ful state of mind is fun@@ da@@ men@@ tally expl@@ ora@@ tory , se@@ ek@@ ing out new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties in the world around us ."
And that se@@ ek@@ ing is why so many experien@@ ces that started with simple de@@ light and am@@ us@@ ement even@@ tually led us to pro@@ found bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
E@@ very@@ one needs a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all play@@ er , a ten@@ n@@ is play@@ er , a gy@@ mn@@ ast or a bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we impro@@ ve .
"U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no syste@@ mati@@ c fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ ob@@ s better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ ob@@ s in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ in@@ da and I learned how little us@@ e@@ ful fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were blo@@ wn away ."
"U@@ n@@ til re@@ cen@@ tly , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ atis@@ fac@@ tory ."
"If all my bri@@ dge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tory , &quot; &quot; I would have no ho@@ pe of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differen@@ tly ?
"T@@ o@@ day , dis@@ tri@@ cts are re@@ v@@ am@@ ping the way they ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them impro@@ ve their pra@@ c@@ tice ."
O@@ ur teachers de@@ serve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fai@@ r to them .
"It &apos;s not fai@@ r to students , and it &apos;s pu@@ tting America &apos;s global lead@@ er@@ ship at ris@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for impro@@ ve@@ ment they want and de@@ serve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ for@@ t@@ una@@ tely there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king t@@ ab@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back syste@@ ms ."
C@@ on@@ sider the ran@@ kin@@ gs for read@@ ing pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ cel@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the plac@@ es that do better than the U.S. in read@@ ing , how many of them have a forma@@ l system for hel@@ ping teachers impro@@ ve ?"
E@@ le@@ ven out of 14 .
"The U.S. is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in ma@@ th ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fa@@ il@@ ing to give our teachers the help they need to develo@@ p their sk@@ il@@ ls ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best acade@@ mic perfor@@ mer : the pro@@ vin@@ ce of S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai , China ."
"Now , they ran@@ k number one across the bo@@ ard , in read@@ ing , ma@@ th and science , and one of the ke@@ ys to S@@ h@@ an@@ gh@@ ai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep impro@@ ving ."
They made sure that youn@@ ger teachers get a chan@@ ce to watch mas@@ ter teachers at work .
"They have week@@ ly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even re@@ qui@@ re each teacher to ob@@ serve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much vari@@ ation in the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more ef@@ fe@@ ctive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers throu@@ gh@@ out the country who are hel@@ ping their students make ex@@ tra@@ ordinary g@@ ain@@ s ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blo@@ wing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ oun@@ dation has been working with 3@@ ,000 teachers in dis@@ tri@@ cts across the country on a project called Me@@ as@@ ures of E@@ f@@ fe@@ ctive T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing ."
