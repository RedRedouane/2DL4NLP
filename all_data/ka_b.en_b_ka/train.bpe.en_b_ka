"We live in difficult and chall@@ eng@@ ing economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of difficult economic times , I think , is public sp@@ en@@ ding of any kind , but cer@@ tain@@ ly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is public sp@@ en@@ ding for science , and partic@@ ul@@ arly cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ led science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
So I want to try and con@@ v@@ ince you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous and l@@ u@@ dic@@ r@@ ous thing to do .
"But I think to set the sc@@ en@@ e , I want to show — the next sli@@ de is not my att@@ emp@@ t to show the wor@@ st TED sli@@ de in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my f@@ au@@ l@@ t ; it &apos;s from the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of how much science cos@@ ts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for contin@@ u@@ ing to sp@@ end on cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven science and expl@@ or@@ ation , I should tell you how much it cos@@ ts ."
So this is a g@@ ame called &quot; &quot; sp@@ ot the science bu@@ d@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . government sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science bu@@ d@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of b@@ lob@@ s and then y@@ el@@ low set of b@@ lob@@ s ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ el@@ low set of b@@ lob@@ s around the big y@@ el@@ low b@@ lo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion p@@ ounds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from medic@@ al resear@@ ch , space expl@@ or@@ ation , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and hum@@ ani@@ ties , fund@@ ed from the science bu@@ d@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , t@@ iny y@@ el@@ low b@@ lo@@ b around the or@@ an@@ ge b@@ lo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"That per@@ cent@@ age , by the way , is about the same in the U.@@ S@@ . and G@@ er@@ many and F@@ r@@ ance ."
"@@ R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; D in t@@ ot@@ al in the econom@@ y , pub@@ lic@@ ly fund@@ ed , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re ar@@ gu@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is st@@ ra@@ ight from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; is that our expl@@ or@@ ation of the sol@@ ar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ descri@@ b@@ ably beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was s@@ ent back by the C@@ ass@@ in@@ i space pro@@ be around S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , after we &apos;d fin@@ i@@ shed f@@ il@@ m@@ ing &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the ser@@ ies ."
It &apos;s of the mo@@ on E@@ n@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us .
"So that big s@@ wee@@ ping , white sp@@ here in the cor@@ ner is S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , which is actually in the bac@@ k@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that cre@@ sc@@ ent there is the mo@@ on E@@ n@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us , which is about as big as the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh I@@ s@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters in di@@ am@@ e@@ ter .
"So , t@@ iny mo@@ on ."
What &apos;s f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ pro@@ cess@@ ed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , st@@ ra@@ ight from S@@ at@@ ur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fa@@ in@@ t , sort of , wi@@ sp@@ s of almost s@@ mo@@ ke ri@@ sing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful grap@@ hi@@ c .
What we found out were that those fa@@ in@@ t wi@@ sp@@ s are actually f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of ice ri@@ sing up from the sur@@ face of this t@@ iny mo@@ on .
"That &apos;s f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism for po@@ w@@ ering those f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins requ@@ i@@ res there to be la@@ kes of li@@ qu@@ id water b@@ ene@@ ath the sur@@ face of this mo@@ on ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qu@@ id water , we find life ."
"So , to find str@@ ong evidence of li@@ qu@@ id , po@@ ols of li@@ qu@@ id , b@@ ene@@ ath the sur@@ face of a mo@@ on 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away from the Earth is really quite ast@@ oun@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , ess@@ enti@@ ally , is maybe that &apos;s a ha@@ b@@ it@@ at for life in the sol@@ ar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a grap@@ hi@@ c . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of E@@ n@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us .
This is when C@@ ass@@ in@@ i f@@ le@@ w b@@ ene@@ ath E@@ n@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us .
"So it made a very low p@@ ass , just a few hundred k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters abo@@ ve the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ri@@ sing up into space , ab@@ solu@@ tely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for life in the sol@@ ar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a mo@@ on of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Euro@@ p@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the J@@ o@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this mo@@ on , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of ro@@ ck ."
It &apos;s actually an ice mo@@ on .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the mo@@ on Euro@@ p@@ a , which is a th@@ ick sh@@ e@@ et of ice , probably a hundred k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters th@@ ick ."
"But by meas@@ uring the way that Euro@@ p@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the mag@@ ne@@ tic field of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and looking at how those cr@@ ac@@ ks in the ice that you can see there on that grap@@ hi@@ c move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very stron@@ g@@ ly that there &apos;s an o@@ ce@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Euro@@ p@@ a ."
"So b@@ el@@ ow the ice , there &apos;s an o@@ ce@@ an of li@@ qu@@ id around the whole mo@@ on ."
"It could be hund@@ re@@ ds of k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s s@@ al@@ tw@@ ater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that mo@@ on of J@@ up@@ it@@ er than there is in all the o@@ ce@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little mo@@ on around J@@ up@@ it@@ er , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for fin@@ ding life on a mo@@ on or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disc@@ o@@ very .
O@@ ur expl@@ or@@ ation of the sol@@ ar system has t@@ au@@ ght us that the sol@@ ar system is beautiful .
"It may also have poin@@ ted the way to ans@@ w@@ ering one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can possi@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we al@@ one in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to expl@@ or@@ ation and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very fam@@ ous picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as E@@ ve , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o 8 as it went around the back of the mo@@ on .
Ear@@ th@@ ri@@ se from Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o 8 .
"A fam@@ ous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sa@@ ved 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent year — the stud@@ ent ri@@ ots in P@@ ar@@ is , the he@@ ight of the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the st@@ age at TED , is that this picture , ar@@ gu@@ ably , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mov@@ able , kind of in@@ de@@ struc@@ ti@@ ble place , but as a very small , fr@@ ag@@ il@@ e-@@ looking world just h@@ ang@@ ing against the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not often said about the space expl@@ or@@ ation , about the Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o program , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achi@@ ev@@ ement and de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed pic@@ tures like this , it c@@ ost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many stu@@ dies have been done about the economic effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , the economic imp@@ act of Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o ."
The bi@@ gg@@ est one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by C@@ ha@@ se E@@ con@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics .
"And it sho@@ wed that for every $ 1 sp@@ ent on Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o , 1@@ 4 came back into the U.@@ S@@ . econom@@ y ."
"So the Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o program p@@ a@@ id for itself in insp@@ ir@@ ation , in engine@@ ering , achi@@ ev@@ ement and , I think , in insp@@ ir@@ ing young scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers 1@@ 4 times over ."
So expl@@ or@@ ation can p@@ ay for itself .
What about scienti@@ fic disc@@ o@@ very ?
What about dri@@ ving in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vir@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scienti@@ sts , many ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light given off from at@@ om@@ s ."
And they saw stran@@ ge pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a pri@@ s@@ m is that you he@@ at hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a white light , it just em@@ its light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light bl@@ ue one , some dark bl@@ ue ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of at@@ om@@ ic struc@@ ture because the way that &apos;s expl@@ ained is at@@ om@@ s are a single n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with electr@@ ons going around them .
And the electr@@ ons can only be in particular places .
"And when they j@@ um@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they em@@ it light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that at@@ om@@ s , when you he@@ at them up , only em@@ it light at very speci@@ fic col@@ ors , was one of the k@@ ey dri@@ ver@@ s that led to the develop@@ ment of the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m theory , the theory of the struc@@ ture of at@@ om@@ s ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of the Su@@ n .
"And now , this is a picture of at@@ om@@ s in the Su@@ n &apos;s at@@ m@@ osp@@ here ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when electr@@ ons j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down , j@@ um@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black l@@ ines in that spec@@ tru@@ m .
And the el@@ ement he@@ li@@ um was disc@@ over@@ ed just by star@@ ing at the light from the Su@@ n because some of those black l@@ ines were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known el@@ ement .
And that &apos;s why he@@ li@@ um &apos;s called he@@ li@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; he@@ li@@ o@@ s &quot; &quot; — he@@ li@@ o@@ s from the Su@@ n .
"Now , that s@@ ounds es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic , and in@@ de@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic pur@@ su@@ it , but the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m theory qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly led to an understanding of the behavi@@ ors of electr@@ ons in materi@@ als like si@@ lic@@ on , for example ."
"The way that si@@ lic@@ on beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build tran@@ sist@@ ors , is a pu@@ re@@ ly qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
"So without that cur@@ i@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven understanding of the struc@@ ture of at@@ om@@ s , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic theory , qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics , then we wouldn &apos;t have tran@@ sist@@ ors , we wouldn &apos;t have si@@ lic@@ on ch@@ i@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the bas@@ is of our moder@@ n econom@@ y ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful tw@@ ist to that tal@@ e ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ d@@ ers of the S@@ ol@@ ar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; we ke@@ p@@ t emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zing the la@@ ws of physics are univers@@ al ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredi@@ ble things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can tran@@ sp@@ ort it , not only to the plan@@ ets , but to the most dist@@ ant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing predic@@ tions of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics , just by looking at the struc@@ ture of at@@ om@@ s — the same theory that descri@@ b@@ es tran@@ sist@@ ors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have re@@ ach@@ ed the end of their life that are big@@ ger than , quite speci@@ f@@ ically , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mass of the Su@@ n ."
That &apos;s a lim@@ it im@@ posed on the mass of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of p@@ ap@@ er in a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , get a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars big@@ ger than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the mass of the Su@@ n ."
That &apos;s quite an incredi@@ ble predic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the e@@ dge of that mass ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; &quot; our g@@ ar@@ d@@ en &quot; &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Su@@ n in it ."
It &apos;s just one of b@@ illions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the gal@@ ac@@ tic c@@ ore , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ in@@ ing out so bri@@ gh@@ tly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s sh@@ in@@ ing as bri@@ gh@@ tly as the center of the galaxy with a billion s@@ un@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a T@@ y@@ pe I@@ a super@@ no@@ v@@ a expl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"Now that &apos;s an incredi@@ ble ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a , because it &apos;s a star that s@@ its there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It s@@ its there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the mass of the Su@@ n ."
"And it has a b@@ in@@ ary comp@@ ani@@ on that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of g@@ as ."
"And what it does is it suc@@ ks g@@ as off its comp@@ ani@@ on star , until it gets to this lim@@ it called the Ch@@ and@@ r@@ as@@ e@@ k@@ ha@@ r lim@@ it , and then it exp@@ lo@@ des ."
"And it exp@@ lo@@ des , and it sh@@ ines as bri@@ gh@@ tly as a billion s@@ un@@ s for about two wee@@ ks , and re@@ le@@ ases , not only energy , but a huge amount of ch@@ em@@ ical el@@ em@@ ents into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe at the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang ."
And there was no car@@ b@@ on and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe thr@@ ough@@ out the first generation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ tur@@ ned to the universe in expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into plan@@ ets , stars , new sol@@ ar syst@@ ems and , in@@ de@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the power and beau@@ ty and univers@@ ality of the la@@ ws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the struc@@ ture of at@@ om@@ s here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der F@@ le@@ m@@ ing : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I w@@ o@@ ke up just after d@@ a@@ wn on S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t pl@@ an to re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ i@@ ze all medic@@ ine by disc@@ over@@ ing the world &apos;s first an@@ ti@@ bi@@ ot@@ ic . &quot; &quot; Now , the expl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the at@@ om did not int@@ end to inv@@ ent the tran@@ sist@@ or ."
"And they cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t int@@ end to descri@@ be the m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics of super@@ no@@ v@@ a expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons , which even@@ tually told us where the building bloc@@ ks of life were sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ zed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing things .
"It can also , I think , fin@@ ally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like S@@ at@@ ur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ ass@@ in@@ i space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a fam@@ ous picture , not because of the beau@@ ty and maj@@ est@@ y of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings , but actually because of a t@@ iny , fa@@ in@@ t b@@ lo@@ b just h@@ ang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the r@@ ings ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a mo@@ on , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tu@@ red in that f@@ ra@@ me of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million mil@@ es away .
"I think the Earth has got a stran@@ ge pro@@ per@@ ty that the f@@ ar@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dist@@ ant or most fam@@ ous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for sc@@ ale .
The V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er is a t@@ iny machine .
"It &apos;s curren@@ tly 10 billion mil@@ es away from Earth , trans@@ m@@ it@@ ting with that dis@@ h , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in cont@@ act with it ."
"But it vi@@ s@@ ited J@@ up@@ it@@ er , S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and N@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ un@@ e ."
"And after it vi@@ s@@ ited all four of those plan@@ ets , C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an , who &apos;s one of my great her@@ o@@ es , had the wonderful idea of tur@@ ning V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er around and taking a picture of every planet it had vi@@ s@@ ited ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ ale B@@ l@@ ue D@@ ot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in that red s@@ ha@@ ft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion mil@@ es away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ ag@@ an wr@@ ote about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Con@@ si@@ der again that do@@ t ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was li@@ ved out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates of jo@@ y and suff@@ ering thousands of con@@ fi@@ dent religi@@ ons , ide@@ o@@ logi@@ es and economic doc@@ tr@@ ines , every h@@ un@@ ter and for@@ ag@@ er , every her@@ o and co@@ ward , every cre@@ at@@ or and dest@@ ro@@ y@@ er of civi@@ li@@ zation , every king and pe@@ as@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , ho@@ pe@@ ful child , inv@@ ent@@ or and exp@@ lo@@ re@@ r , every teacher of mor@@ als , every cor@@ ru@@ p@@ t poli@@ tici@@ an , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me lead@@ er , every sa@@ in@@ t and s@@ in@@ ner in the history of our spec@@ ies , li@@ ved there , on a m@@ ote of d@@ ust , su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in a s@@ un@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that astron@@ om@@ y &apos;s a hum@@ bl@@ ing and char@@ ac@@ ter@@ -@@ building experience .
There is perhaps no better de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ ce@@ its than this dist@@ ant im@@ age of our t@@ iny world .
"T@@ o me , it under@@ sc@@ o@@ res our respon@@ si@@ bility to de@@ al more kin@@ dly with one another and to pres@@ er@@ ve and ch@@ er@@ ish the p@@ ale bl@@ ue do@@ t , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ au@@ ti@@ ful words about the power of science and expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"The ar@@ g@@ ument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had p@@ en@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the tran@@ sist@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disc@@ over anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly becom@@ ing a her@@ o of m@@ ine , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under ass@@ au@@ l@@ t all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ J@@ ust exp@@ lo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is more f@@ at@@ al to the progress of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ tim@@ ate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , that there are no my@@ st@@ er@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
You might hear it like secon@@ d@@ -@@ hand s@@ mo@@ ke at the a@@ ir@@ port ...
"And it does , doesn &apos;t it ?"
I was cl@@ app@@ ing . They were cl@@ app@@ ing .
"Th@@ ank you , th@@ ank you ."
"We &apos;re going to share a lot of sec@@ re@@ ts today , you and I , and in doing so , I hope that we can li@@ ft some of the s@@ ha@@ me many of us feel about se@@ x ."
How many here have ever been cat@@ called by a stran@@ ger ?
L@@ ots of women .
"For me , the time I remember best is when that stran@@ ger was a stud@@ ent of m@@ ine ."
"He came up to me after cl@@ ass that night and his words con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed what I already knew : &quot; &quot; I am so sor@@ ry , prof@@ ess@@ or ."
"If I had known it was you , I would never have said those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I wasn &apos;t a person to him until I was his prof@@ ess@@ or ."
"This con@@ cept , called ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation , is the f@@ ound@@ ation of se@@ x@@ ism , and we see it re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ed through every as@@ p@@ ect of our lives ."
We see it in the government that re@@ f@@ us@@ es to p@@ un@@ ish men for r@@ ap@@ ing women .
We see it in ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments .
How many of you have seen an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment that us@@ es a woman &apos;s bre@@ ast to s@@ ell an enti@@ re@@ ly un@@ rel@@ ated produc@@ t ?
O@@ r mo@@ vi@@ e after mo@@ vi@@ e after mo@@ vi@@ e that por@@ tr@@ ays women as only love interest@@ s ?
M@@ e@@ dia pl@@ ays a large ro@@ le in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating the ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation of women .
Let &apos;s consi@@ der the cl@@ assi@@ c r@@ om@@ an@@ tic com@@ e@@ dy .
"We &apos;re t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to two kinds of women in these mo@@ vi@@ es , two kinds of des@@ ir@@ able women , any@@ way ."
The first is the se@@ x@@ y bomb@@ sh@@ ell .
This is the un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous woman with the per@@ f@@ ect body .
The first is the s@@ l@@ ut .
She is to be con@@ sum@@ ed and for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
She is much too av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
Mar@@ ri@@ age material .
"We &apos;re actually told that women have two ro@@ les , but these two ro@@ les have a difficult time exist@@ ing within the same woman ."
"O@@ n the r@@ are oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on that I share with a new ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance that I study se@@ x , if they don &apos;t end the con@@ vers@@ ation right then , they &apos;re u@@ su@@ ally pretty in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed ."
&quot; O@@ h . T@@ ell me more . &quot;
So I do .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; O@@ h . H@@ u@@ h .
Do pre@@ gn@@ ant people even have se@@ x ?
"I asked this question in a sur@@ v@@ ey of over 5@@ 00 ad@@ ults , and most respon@@ ded with &quot; &quot; b@@ el@@ ly &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; r@@ ound &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; c@@ ute . &quot; &quot; This didn &apos;t surpri@@ se me too much ."
What else do we l@@ ab@@ el as c@@ ute ?
B@@ ab@@ ies . P@@ up@@ p@@ ies . K@@ it@@ ten@@ s .
The el@@ der@@ ly . R@@ ight ?

Not exactly .
What happens instead is a different kind of ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation .
"In my eff@@ or@@ ts to explain this to others , one con@@ vers@@ ation led to the V@@ en@@ us of W@@ ill@@ en@@ d@@ or@@ f , a P@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic fig@@ ur@@ ine scho@@ lars as@@ sum@@ ed was a go@@ dd@@ ess of love and beau@@ ty , h@@ ence the name V@@ en@@ us ."
They also as@@ sum@@ ed that she was me@@ ant to be hel@@ d or plac@@ ed l@@ ying down because her t@@ iny fe@@ et don &apos;t al@@ low her to be f@@ re@@ est@@ anding .
She also had no face .
"For this reason , it was as@@ sum@@ ed that she was a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ty and not a por@@ tra@@ it of a person ."
She was an ob@@ ject .
"In the history of her inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation , she went from ob@@ ject of ide@@ al beau@@ ty and love to ob@@ ject of re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"When a woman becom@@ es pre@@ gn@@ ant , she le@@ a@@ ves the re@@ al@@ m of men &apos;s se@@ x@@ u@@ al des@@ ire and sli@@ des into her re@@ produc@@ tive and chil@@ d@@ -@@ re@@ ar@@ ing ro@@ le ."

"This one might give you p@@ ause , I know , but st@@ ay with me ."
This is a huge sec@@ re@@ t .
It is actually sa@@ fe to dr@@ ink in moder@@ ation d@@ uring pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y .
M@@ any of us don &apos;t know this because doc@@ tors don &apos;t tr@@ ust pre@@ gn@@ ant women with this sec@@ re@@ t — ( Laughter ) es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally if she &apos;s less educ@@ ated or a woman of col@@ or .

This is a m@@ oun@@ tain .
The su@@ n .

The sym@@ bo@@ l of the do@@ or looks like a p@@ air of s@@ al@@ o@@ on do@@ ors in the wi@@ ld w@@ est .
I call these eight char@@ ac@@ ters ra@@ dic@@ als .
They are the building bloc@@ ks for you to create lots more char@@ ac@@ ters .
A person .
"If someone wal@@ ks be@@ h@@ ind , that is &quot; &quot; to fol@@ low . &quot; &quot; A@@ s the old saying goes , two is comp@@ any , three is a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
"If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their ar@@ ms wi@@ de , this person is saying , &quot; &quot; It was this big . &quot; &quot; The person inside the m@@ ou@@ th , the person is tr@@ app@@ ed ."

"Th@@ ree fi@@ res together , that &apos;s a lot of fl@@ am@@ es ."
"S@@ et the fir@@ e under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es , it &apos;s bur@@ ning ."

"@@ P@@ ut the su@@ n and the mo@@ on sh@@ in@@ ing together , it &apos;s bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
"It also means tom@@ or@@ row , after a day and a night ."
The su@@ n is coming up abo@@ ve the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on . S@@ un@@ ri@@ se .
"A do@@ or . P@@ ut a pl@@ ank inside the do@@ or , it &apos;s a do@@ or b@@ ol@@ t ."

We had no idea what was cau@@ sing this disease .
And it was a high@@ ly r@@ om@@ an@@ tici@@ zed disease .
And some people actually thought it gave you he@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vity and con@@ fer@@ red cre@@ ative gen@@ i@@ us .
"They were more social , more ener@@ ge@@ tic ."
"So ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental disc@@ o@@ very is not un@@ common in science , but it requ@@ i@@ res more than just a happy ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
You have to be able to recogni@@ ze it for disc@@ o@@ very to oc@@ cu@@ r .
"Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , since the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , we &apos;ve develop@@ ed some other dru@@ gs and we can actually now c@@ ure tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is ."
"And at le@@ ast in the United States , though not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily in other countries , we have cl@@ os@@ ed our s@@ an@@ it@@ ori@@ um@@ s and probably most of you are not too wor@@ ri@@ ed about T@@ B ."
"We are in the middle of an e@@ p@@ ide@@ mi@@ c of mo@@ od dis@@ ord@@ ers like depres@@ sion and pos@@ t-@@ tr@@ au@@ m@@ atic stress dis@@ order , or P@@ T@@ S@@ D ."
"And also , like tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , we don &apos;t know what cau@@ ses it ."
And this sort of re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing is actually quite chall@@ eng@@ ing .
"When doc@@ tors first saw this mo@@ o@@ d@@ -@@ en@@ h@@ anc@@ ing eff@@ ect of i@@ pr@@ on@@ i@@ az@@ id , they didn &apos;t really recogni@@ ze what they saw ."
"So they re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded that i@@ pr@@ on@@ i@@ az@@ id only be used in c@@ ases of extre@@ me T@@ B and in patients that were high@@ ly emoti@@ on@@ ally st@@ able , which is of course the ex@@ act op@@ pos@@ ite of how we use it as an an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"They were so used to looking at it from the per@@ spec@@ tive of this one disease , they could not see the lar@@ ger imp@@ lic@@ ations for another disease ."
"And to be fa@@ ir , it &apos;s not enti@@ re@@ ly their f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
F@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ onal fi@@ x@@ ed@@ ness is a bi@@ as that aff@@ ec@@ ts all of us .
But it does make you won@@ der what else we &apos;ve mis@@ sed .
"That in@@ clu@@ des li@@ ver to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity , we@@ ight g@@ ain of over 50 p@@ ounds , su@@ ici@@ d@@ ality ."
"And that was 30 years ago , and since then we have m@@ os@@ tly just worked on op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zing those dru@@ gs ."
"And in science , we try and re@@ move our bi@@ as , right , by run@@ ning d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ bl@@ in@@ ded experim@@ ents or being st@@ atis@@ tic@@ ally ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic as to what our res@@ ults will be ."
But bi@@ as cre@@ e@@ ps in more in@@ si@@ di@@ ously in what we cho@@ ose to study and how we cho@@ ose to study it .
"So we &apos;ve fo@@ c@@ used on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in now for the past 30 years , often to the ex@@ clu@@ sion of other things ."
"We still have no cu@@ res , and what if ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in isn &apos;t all there is to depres@@ sion ?"
What if it &apos;s not even the k@@ ey part of it ?
"It works on gl@@ ut@@ am@@ ate , which is another neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ter ."
And it &apos;s also re@@ pur@@ posed .
It was tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally used as an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a in sur@@ g@@ ery .
There was no man@@ ia to si@@ gn@@ al its effec@@ ts .
So we could have st@@ op@@ ped there .
And it looked kind of like this .
"So if you look at the far left , if you put a m@@ ouse in a new space , this is the bo@@ x , it &apos;s very exc@@ iting , a m@@ ouse will wal@@ k around and expl@@ ore , and you can see that p@@ ink line is actually the measure of them wal@@ king ."
And we also give it another m@@ ouse in a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l c@@ up that it can deci@@ de to inter@@ act with .
It will be social .
"Y@@ et the m@@ ice that had g@@ ot@@ ten that one in@@ jec@@ tion of C@@ al@@ yp@@ so@@ l , here on your right , they were expl@@ or@@ ing , they were social ."
"They looked like they had never been st@@ res@@ sed at all , which is im@@ possible ."
"And I remember us y@@ elling , which you &apos;re not sup@@ posed to do in an anim@@ al room where you &apos;re te@@ st@@ ing , because it had worked ."
"It se@@ em@@ ed like these m@@ ice were prot@@ ected against stress , or they were in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ately happy , ho@@ w@@ ever you want to call it ."
And we were really exc@@ ited .
So we r@@ an it again .
"And every time someone r@@ an it , they con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed the same thing ."
It se@@ em@@ ed like this one in@@ jec@@ tion of C@@ al@@ yp@@ so@@ l was some@@ how prot@@ ec@@ ting against stress for wee@@ ks .
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this p@@ assi@@ ve pro@@ per@@ ty .
It &apos;s the ab@@ s@@ ence of su@@ sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ bility fac@@ tors and ri@@ s@@ k fac@@ tors for these dis@@ ord@@ ers .
But what if it were ac@@ tive ?
"M@@ ay@@ be we could en@@ h@@ ance it , sort of ak@@ in to pu@@ tting on ar@@ m@@ or ."
We had ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally disc@@ over@@ ed the first re@@ si@@ li@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ en@@ h@@ anc@@ ing dru@@ g .
"And like I said , we only gave a t@@ iny amount of the dru@@ g , and it la@@ sted for wee@@ ks , and that &apos;s not like anything you see with an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts ."
But it is actually kind of sim@@ il@@ ar to what you see in im@@ m@@ un@@ e v@@ ac@@ c@@ ines .
"So in im@@ m@@ un@@ e v@@ ac@@ c@@ ines , you &apos;ll get your sh@@ ots , and then wee@@ ks , months , years later , when you &apos;re actually ex@@ posed to bac@@ ter@@ ia , it &apos;s not the v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine in your body that prot@@ ec@@ ts you ."
"O@@ r sim@@ il@@ ar to as I said before , with this p@@ al@@ li@@ ative , you &apos;ll take something that will sup@@ pres@@ s the sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s , but it won &apos;t treat the under@@ l@@ ying in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion , and you &apos;ll only feel better d@@ uring the time in which you &apos;re taking it , which is why you have to keep taking it ."
And in depres@@ sion and P@@ T@@ S@@ D — here we have your stress ex@@ pos@@ ure — we only have p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care .
"A@@ n@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts only sup@@ pres@@ s sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the l@@ eng@@ th of your own life ."
"So that &apos;s first respon@@ d@@ ers and fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers and pri@@ son gu@@ ar@@ ds , sol@@ di@@ ers , you name it ."
"And to give you a sense of the sc@@ ale of these dise@@ ases , in 20@@ 10 , the global bur@@ d@@ en of disease was es@@ tim@@ ated at 2@@ .@@ 5 tr@@ illion dollars , and since they are ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic , that c@@ ost is comp@@ oun@@ ding and is ther@@ e@@ fore exp@@ ected to ri@@ se up to six tr@@ illion dollars in just the next 15 years ."
It &apos;s used in children . We use it on the b@@ att@@ le@@ field .
"If we had disc@@ over@@ ed ke@@ t@@ am@@ ine as a par@@ av@@ ac@@ c@@ ine first , it &apos;d be pretty easy for us to devel@@ op it , but as is , we have to com@@ pe@@ te with our fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal fi@@ x@@ ed@@ ness and mental set that kind of inter@@ f@@ ere ."
And that will be years .
We could devel@@ op it for a fr@@ action of the pr@@ ice and a fr@@ action of the time .
"But actually , be@@ y@@ on@@ d fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal fi@@ x@@ ed@@ ness and mental set , there &apos;s a real other chall@@ en@@ ge to re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing dru@@ gs , which is po@@ lic@@ y ."
"R@@ eg@@ ar@@ d@@ less , the idea itself is completely no@@ v@@ el in psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry , to use dru@@ gs to pre@@ v@@ ent mental ill@@ ness as op@@ posed to just treat it ."
"It is possible that 20 , 50 , 100 years from now , we will look back now at depres@@ sion and P@@ T@@ S@@ D the way we look back at tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is s@@ an@@ it@@ ori@@ um@@ s as a thing of the past ."
This could be the beginning of the end of the mental health e@@ p@@ ide@@ mi@@ c .
"But as a great scienti@@ st once said , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ly a fo@@ ol is sure of anything ."
"A wi@@ se man ke@@ e@@ ps on gu@@ ess@@ ing . &quot; &quot; Thank you , gu@@ ys ."
( Applause )
"It goes without saying that it &apos;s really difficult for me to be here today , but my bro@@ ther D@@ eah , his wi@@ fe Y@@ us@@ or , and her si@@ ster R@@ az@@ an don &apos;t give me much of a cho@@ ice ."
"I &apos;m ho@@ pe@@ ful that by the end of this talk you will make a cho@@ ice , and jo@@ in me in st@@ anding up against h@@ ate ."
"It &apos;s D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 7 , 20@@ 1@@ 4 : the mor@@ ning of my bro@@ ther &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding day ."

"D@@ eah , Y@@ us@@ or and R@@ az@@ an were ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted in a place that was me@@ ant to be sa@@ fe : their home ."
"For months , this man had been har@@ ass@@ ing them : kno@@ c@@ king on their do@@ or , br@@ an@@ di@@ sh@@ ing his gu@@ n on a couple of oc@@ cas@@ i@@ ons ."

"In respon@@ se , Y@@ us@@ or &apos;s mo@@ m told her to be kind to her ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , that as he got to know them , he &apos;d see them for who they were ."
I gu@@ ess we &apos;ve all become so num@@ b to the h@@ at@@ red that we couldn &apos;t have ever imag@@ ined it tur@@ ning into f@@ at@@ al violence .
"The man who m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed my bro@@ ther tur@@ ned h@@ im@@ self in to the poli@@ ce sh@@ or@@ tly after the m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers , saying he k@@ ill@@ ed three kids , ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le , over a par@@ king di@@ sp@@ ute ."

It turns out there was no par@@ king di@@ sp@@ ute .
There was no ar@@ g@@ ument .
No viol@@ ation .
"I s@@ it on my bro@@ ther &apos;s bed and remember his words , the words he gave me so f@@ re@@ ely and with so much love , &quot; I am who I am because of you . &quot;"
That &apos;s what it ta@@ kes for me to c@@ lim@@ b through my cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing g@@ ri@@ e@@ f and spe@@ ak out .
I cannot let my family &apos;s de@@ a@@ ths be di@@ min@@ i@@ shed to a se@@ g@@ ment that is b@@ are@@ ly disc@@ us@@ sed on loc@@ al news .
"They were m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed by their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or because of their fa@@ ith , because of a piece of cl@@ ot@@ h they ch@@ ose to don on their he@@ ads , because they were vi@@ si@@ bly M@@ us@@ li@@ m ."
A ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st att@@ ack .
"When white men comm@@ it ac@@ ts of violence in the U@@ S , they &apos;re l@@ one w@@ ol@@ ves , m@@ ent@@ ally ill or dri@@ ven by a par@@ king di@@ sp@@ ute ."
"I know that I have to give my family v@@ o@@ ice , and I do the only thing I know how : I s@@ end a F@@ ac@@ e@@ book mess@@ age to everyone I know in me@@ dia ."
"A couple of hours later , in the mi@@ d@@ st of a cha@@ ot@@ ic h@@ ouse over@@ f@@ lowing with friends and family , our ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or N@@ e@@ al comes over , s@@ its down next to my parents and as@@ ks , &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; N@@ e@@ al had over two dec@@ ad@@ es of experience in j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ism , but he makes it c@@ lear that he &apos;s not there in his cap@@ ac@@ ity as j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ st , but as a ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or who wan@@ ts to help ."
E@@ ven now I don &apos;t have the words to th@@ ank him .
"&quot; &quot; J@@ ust tell me when , and I &apos;ll have all the news chan@@ n@@ els present , &quot; &quot; he said ."
He did for us what we could not do for ourselves in a moment of dev@@ ast@@ ation .
"I de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed the pres@@ s st@@ at@@ ement , still w@@ ear@@ ing sc@@ ru@@ b@@ s from the pre@@ vi@@ ous night ."
"The fol@@ lowing day , maj@@ or ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers — in@@ clu@@ ding the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es , Ch@@ ic@@ ago T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ e — published stories about D@@ eah , Y@@ us@@ or and R@@ az@@ an , al@@ lowing us to re@@ cl@@ a@@ i@@ m the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative and call att@@ en@@ tion the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am@@ ing of an@@ ti@@ -@@ M@@ us@@ li@@ m h@@ at@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese days , it fe@@ els like I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a is a soci@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able form of big@@ ot@@ ry ."
We just have to put up with it and s@@ mi@@ le .
"The n@@ ast@@ y st@@ are@@ s , the p@@ al@@ p@@ able fear when bo@@ ar@@ ding a plan@@ e , the ran@@ dom p@@ at do@@ w@@ ns at a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts that happen 9@@ 9 percent of the time ."
It doesn &apos;t stop there .
We have poli@@ tici@@ ans re@@ ap@@ ing political and fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al g@@ ain@@ s off our bac@@ ks .
"@@ J@@ ust a couple months ago , K@@ hal@@ id J@@ ab@@ ar@@ a , a L@@ e@@ b@@ an@@ es@@ e-@@ American Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an , was m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in O@@ k@@ la@@ h@@ om@@ a by his ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or — a man who called him a &quot; &quot; f@@ il@@ th@@ y A@@ ra@@ b . &quot; &quot; This man was pre@@ vi@@ ously j@@ a@@ il@@ ed for a m@@ ere 8 months , after att@@ emp@@ ting run over K@@ hal@@ id &apos;s mother with his c@@ ar ."
"@@ Ch@@ anc@@ es are you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard K@@ hal@@ id &apos;s story , because it didn &apos;t make it to national news ."
The le@@ ast we can do is call it what it is : a h@@ ate cri@@ me .
I was di@@ sh@@ ear@@ ten@@ ed .
H@@ um@@ ili@@ ated .
"D@@ ays later r@@ oun@@ ding on the same pati@@ ent , she looks at me and says , &quot; Y@@ our people are k@@ ill@@ ing people in Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es . &quot;"
I look around exp@@ ec@@ t@@ an@@ tly .
A@@ g@@ ain : si@@ l@@ ence .
"I s@@ it on her bed and g@@ ently ask her , &quot; &quot; H@@ ave I ever done anything but treat you with resp@@ ect and kin@@ d@@ ness ?"
"O@@ d@@ ds are you may have experienc@@ ed it , whether for your r@@ ace , gen@@ der , se@@ x@@ u@@ ality or religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s ."
We &apos;ve all been in sit@@ u@@ ations where we &apos;ve w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something wrong and didn &apos;t spe@@ ak up .

"We can all ag@@ ree that big@@ ot@@ ry is un@@ ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able , but when we see it , we &apos;re si@@ l@@ ent , because it makes us un@@ com@@ fort@@ able ."
But ste@@ p@@ ping right into that dis@@ com@@ for@@ t means you are also ste@@ p@@ ping into the ally z@@ one .
There may be over three million M@@ us@@ li@@ ms in America .
That &apos;s still just one percent of the t@@ ot@@ al population .

"A@@ l@@ so at the m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um sc@@ ale , we can look at the way of life of early civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations such as the ones descri@@ bed in the B@@ i@@ ble .

You can find four or five p@@ ass@@ ages in the B@@ i@@ ble of this il@@ k .

"For example , any social history will re@@ ve@@ al that mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation and t@@ or@@ ture were r@@ out@@ ine for@@ ms of cri@@ min@@ al p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .

"What about on@@ e-@@ on@@ -@@ one m@@ ur@@ der ? Well , there , there are good st@@ atis@@ tics , because many m@@ un@@ ici@@ p@@ ali@@ ties rec@@ or@@ ded the c@@ ause of death ."

Let &apos;s c@@ lic@@ k down now to the dec@@ ad@@ e sc@@ ale .
"And , as you can see , the death r@@ ate goes down from 6@@ 5@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths per con@@ f@@ lic@@ t per year in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s to less than 2@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths per con@@ f@@ lic@@ t per year in this dec@@ ad@@ e , as h@@ or@@ ri@@ fic as it is ."
"E@@ ven in the year sc@@ ale , one can see a dec@@ line of violence ."
"S@@ ince the end of the C@@ old W@@ ar , there have been fe@@ wer civi@@ l war@@ s , fe@@ wer gen@@ o@@ ci@@ des — in@@ de@@ ed , a 90 percent re@@ duc@@ tion since pos@@ t-@@ W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I high@@ s — and even a re@@ vers@@ al of the 19@@ 6@@ 0s up@@ tic@@ k in h@@ om@@ ici@@ de and viol@@ ent cri@@ me ."
"This is from the F@@ B@@ I U@@ ni@@ form C@@ ri@@ me St@@ atis@@ tics .

"@@ P@@ re@@ si@@ dent C@@ l@@ int@@ on , if you &apos;re here , th@@ ank you ."
One of them is we have better re@@ por@@ ting . The A@@ s@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress is a better ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic@@ l@@ er of war@@ s over the sur@@ face of the Earth than si@@ x@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ century mon@@ ks were .
"There &apos;s a cogni@@ tive ill@@ u@@ sion . We cogni@@ tive psycho@@ logi@@ sts know that the eas@@ ier it is to rec@@ all speci@@ fic inst@@ anc@@ es of something , the high@@ er the prob@@ ability that you assi@@ g@@ n to it ."
"M@@ ay@@ be I had better sho@@ ot him , before he sho@@ ots me , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to k@@ ill me , he &apos;s probably wor@@ r@@ ying right now that I might k@@ ill him before he k@@ ills me . &quot; &quot; And so on ."
"Now , one way of de@@ al@@ ing with this problem is by de@@ ter@@ ren@@ ce ."
"You don &apos;t stri@@ ke first , but you have a pub@@ lic@@ ly an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed po@@ lic@@ y that you will re@@ tal@@ i@@ ate sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely if you are inv@@ ad@@ ed ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ fe becom@@ es an e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de of &quot; &quot; The S@@ op@@ ran@@ o@@ s . &quot; &quot; H@@ ob@@ b@@ es &apos; solu@@ tion , the &quot; &quot; L@@ evi@@ a@@ than , &quot; &quot; was that if au@@ th@@ or@@ ity for the le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate use of violence was v@@ est@@ ed in a single democr@@ atic ag@@ enc@@ y — a le@@ vi@@ a@@ than — then such a state can re@@ duce the t@@ emp@@ t@@ ation of att@@ ack , because any kind of ag@@ gres@@ sion will be p@@ uni@@ shed , le@@ a@@ ving its prof@@ it@@ ability as z@@ er@@ o . That would re@@ move the t@@ emp@@ t@@ ation to inv@@ ad@@ e pre@@ emp@@ ti@@ vely , out of fear of them att@@ ac@@ king you first ."
So that &apos;s a bit of a sup@@ port for the le@@ vi@@ a@@ than theory .
"A@@ l@@ so sup@@ por@@ ting it is the fact that we today see er@@ up@@ tions of violence in z@@ ones of an@@ ar@@ ch@@ y , in fa@@ il@@ ed st@@ ates , coll@@ ap@@ sed em@@ pi@@ res , fron@@ ti@@ er re@@ gi@@ ons , ma@@ fi@@ as , stre@@ et g@@ an@@ gs and so on ."
"The second ex@@ plan@@ ation is that in many times and places , there is a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad s@@ enti@@ ment that life is che@@ ap ."
"In ear@@ li@@ er times , when suff@@ ering and early death were common in one &apos;s own life , one has fe@@ wer comp@@ un@@ c@@ tions about in@@ f@@ lic@@ ting them on others .

This was an ar@@ g@@ ument from the political scienti@@ st J@@ am@@ es P@@ ay@@ ne .

"C@@ A : Well , S@@ te@@ ve , I would love every news me@@ dia ow@@ ner to hear that talk at some point in the next year . I think it &apos;s really important . Thank you so much ."
S@@ P : My ple@@ as@@ ure .
"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do resear@@ ch on at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
J@@ ust think about this problem for a second .
"@@ Here is a l@@ um@@ p of fl@@ es@@ h , about three p@@ ounds , which you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand ."
But it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space .
"It can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the mean@@ ing of its own exist@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is tru@@ ly the most ama@@ zing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est my@@ st@@ ery con@@ fron@@ ting human be@@ ings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the ad@@ ult human brain .
"And each neur@@ on makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 cont@@ ac@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And bas@@ ed on this , people have cal@@ cul@@ ated that the number of per@@ m@@ ut@@ ations and com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of brain acti@@ vity ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the number of el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ les in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stud@@ ying the brain ?"
"One appro@@ ach is to look at patients who had l@@ es@@ i@@ ons in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior ."
This is what I sp@@ o@@ ke about in the last TED .
"T@@ o@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different appro@@ ach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually rec@@ or@@ d the acti@@ vity of in@@ divi@@ du@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ ort of e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one rec@@ ent disc@@ o@@ very that has been made by resear@@ ch@@ ers in I@@ tal@@ y , in P@@ ar@@ m@@ a , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o R@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ att@@ i and his colle@@ ag@@ ues , is a group of neurons called m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordin@@ ary m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
Th@@ ese neurons will fir@@ e when a person per@@ for@@ ms a speci@@ fic action .
"For example , if I do that , and re@@ ach and gra@@ b an app@@ le , a m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neur@@ on in the front of my brain will fir@@ e ."
"If I re@@ ach out and pul@@ l an ob@@ ject , another neur@@ on will fir@@ e , comm@@ anding me to pul@@ l that ob@@ ject ."
Th@@ ese are called m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ att@@ i found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fir@@ e when I &apos;m looking at somebody else per@@ form@@ ing the same action ."
"So , here is a neur@@ on that fi@@ res when I re@@ ach and gra@@ b something , but it also fi@@ res when I wat@@ ch J@@ o@@ e re@@ ach@@ ing and gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is tru@@ ly ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neur@@ on is ad@@ op@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ form@@ ing a vir@@ tual reality sim@@ ulation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of these m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ ol@@ ved in things like im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ulation .
Because to im@@ it@@ ate a comple@@ x act requ@@ i@@ res my brain to ad@@ op@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for im@@ it@@ ation and em@@ ulation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de ."
"So , how do you do im@@ it@@ ation ? Why is im@@ it@@ ation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons and im@@ it@@ ation , em@@ ulation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5@@ ,000 &#93; to 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ dd@@ en em@@ er@@ g@@ ence and r@@ ap@@ id sp@@ read of a number of sk@@ ills that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human be@@ ings like to@@ ol use , the use of fir@@ e , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavior ."
A@@ ll of that happened relati@@ vely qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had achi@@ ev@@ ed its present size almost three or four hundred thous@@ and years ago , 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years ago all of this happened very , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"And I cl@@ a@@ i@@ m that what happened was the su@@ dd@@ en em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of a s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on system , which al@@ lowed you to em@@ ul@@ ate and im@@ it@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ dd@@ en ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental disc@@ o@@ very by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fir@@ e , or a particular t@@ y@@ pe of to@@ ol , instead of d@@ ying out , this sp@@ read r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly , h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was trans@@ m@@ it@@ ted ver@@ tic@@ ally , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ c@@ ki@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ i@@ an ."
D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ i@@ an evolution is s@@ low ; it ta@@ kes hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A p@@ ol@@ ar be@@ ar , to ev@@ ol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just wat@@ ch its paren@@ t k@@ ill another p@@ ol@@ ar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one ste@@ p . What the p@@ ol@@ ar be@@ ar took 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ re@@ ads in ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ c pro@@ por@@ tion across a population .
This is the bas@@ is . The im@@ it@@ ation of comple@@ x sk@@ ills is what we call culture and is the bas@@ is of civi@@ li@@ zation .
"Now there is another kind of m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on , which is inv@@ ol@@ ved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons , just as there are m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons for action , there are m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neurons for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ch@@ es me , my hand , neur@@ on in the som@@ at@@ os@@ en@@ s@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ s@@ ory re@@ gi@@ on of the brain fi@@ res ."
"But the same neur@@ on , in some c@@ ases , will fir@@ e when I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s emp@@ ath@@ i@@ zing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fir@@ e when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different loc@@ ations . D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent neurons for different loc@@ ations ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fir@@ e even when I wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same loc@@ ation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in emp@@ ath@@ y ."
"Now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : If I simply wat@@ ch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ f@@ used and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ s@@ ation mer@@ ely by wat@@ ch@@ ing somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I emp@@ ath@@ i@@ ze with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got re@@ cep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and p@@ ain re@@ cep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , emp@@ ath@@ i@@ ze , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se you &apos;ll get con@@ f@@ used and mu@@ dd@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back si@@ gn@@ al that ve@@ to@@ es the si@@ gn@@ al of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r neur@@ on pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from conscious@@ ly experienc@@ ing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the br@@ achi@@ al ple@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ s@@ ations coming in , if I now wat@@ ch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings ."
"So , I call them G@@ and@@ h@@ i neurons , or emp@@ ath@@ y neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ str@@ act me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical sense .
"A@@ ll that &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"R@@ em@@ o@@ ve the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human be@@ ings .
"And this , of course , is the bas@@ is of much of E@@ ast@@ er@@ n philosop@@ h@@ y , and that is there is no real in@@ dep@@ en@@ dent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human be@@ ings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just vi@@ a F@@ ac@@ e@@ book and In@@ ter@@ net , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole cha@@ ins of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dist@@ inc@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of your consciousness from somebody else &apos;s consciousness .
And this is not m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o philosop@@ h@@ y .
It em@@ er@@ g@@ es from our understanding of bas@@ ic neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b . If the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a ph@@ an@@ tom , and you wat@@ ch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"Now the ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing thing is , if you have p@@ ain in your ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b , you s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze the other person &apos;s hand , m@@ ass@@ age the other person &apos;s hand , that reli@@ ev@@ es the p@@ ain in your ph@@ an@@ tom hand , almost as though the neur@@ on were ob@@ tain@@ ing reli@@ e@@ f from mer@@ ely wat@@ ch@@ ing somebody else being m@@ ass@@ ag@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sli@@ de ."
F@@ or the lon@@ g@@ est time people have re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded science and hum@@ ani@@ ties as being dist@@ inc@@ t .

"It &apos;s a great h@@ on@@ or today to share with you The D@@ ig@@ ital U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se , which was cre@@ ated for hum@@ an@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the vide@@ o that we have .
&#91; The H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ u@@ sic ) The fl@@ at h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that we &apos;ve ev@@ ol@@ ved with has been a me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded res@@ our@@ ces and un@@ lim@@ ited cap@@ ac@@ ity for di@@ sp@@ os@@ al of wa@@ st@@ e .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got abo@@ ve the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here and had seen the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a lim@@ ited condi@@ tion ."
The D@@ ig@@ ital U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se A@@ t@@ l@@ as has been built at the American M@@ u@@ se@@ um of N@@ at@@ ural H@@ i@@ story over the past 12 years .
"We ma@@ in@@ tain that , put that together as a pro@@ ject to really char@@ t the universe across all sc@@ al@@ es ."
"What we see here are s@@ at@@ elli@@ t@@ es around the Earth and the Earth in pro@@ per re@@ gi@@ str@@ ation against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A sup@@ por@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the H@@ ay@@ d@@ en P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ ig@@ ital U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se is the bas@@ is of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our ma@@ in space sho@@ ws in the d@@ ome .
"But what you see here is the res@@ ult of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we h@@ os@@ ted with L@@ in@@ k@@ op@@ ing U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity in S@@ we@@ d@@ en ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their gra@@ du@@ ate work , and the res@@ ult has been this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are called U@@ ni@@ view and a comp@@ any called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in S@@ we@@ d@@ en ."
"This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are al@@ lo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tual f@@ light pat@@ h and mo@@ vi@@ e that we see here was actually f@@ lo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tu@@ red this live from my l@@ ap@@ top in a c@@ a@@ fe called Earth M@@ at@@ ters on the Lo@@ wer E@@ ast S@@ i@@ de of M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an , where I live , and it was done as a coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative pro@@ ject with the R@@ u@@ b@@ in M@@ u@@ se@@ um of H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an A@@ r@@ t for an ex@@ hi@@ bit on com@@ par@@ ative cos@@ mo@@ logy ."
"And so as we move out , we see contin@@ u@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , ligh@@ t-@@ tra@@ v@@ el time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dist@@ ant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re ess@@ enti@@ ally bac@@ king up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re fin@@ ally seeing a con@@ tain@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P m@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ tain@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be mean@@ ing@@ less , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ tain@@ ment of the vi@@ sible universe .
We know the universe is big@@ ger than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , we see here the radi@@ o sp@@ here that we j@@ um@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are posi@@ tions , the l@@ at@@ est posi@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve m@@ app@@ ed , and our su@@ n here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own sol@@ ar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to j@@ um@@ p in here pretty qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly between se@@ ver@@ al ord@@ ers of mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the sol@@ ar system — these are the p@@ a@@ ths of V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 11 and P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to have left the sol@@ ar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in cl@@ os@@ er , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This ma@@ p can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ ar@@ ol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the cam@@ er@@ a P@@ .@@ I@@ .
for the C@@ ass@@ in@@ i mis@@ sion .
"But here we see the comple@@ x tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory of the C@@ ass@@ in@@ i mis@@ sion col@@ or co@@ ded for different mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ ses , in@@ gen@@ i@@ ously develop@@ ed so that 4@@ 5 en@@ coun@@ ters with the lar@@ g@@ est mo@@ on , T@@ it@@ an , which is lar@@ ger that the planet M@@ er@@ cur@@ y , di@@ ver@@ ts the or@@ bit into different parts of mis@@ sion p@@ ha@@ se ."
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are al@@ lo@@ ws us to come cl@@ ose and look at parts of this .
This so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can also be ne@@ t@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er b@@ ase of this , and we ne@@ t@@ work dom@@ es ."
And we can ne@@ t@@ work between dom@@ es and cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
We &apos;re actually sh@@ ar@@ ing t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in G@@ h@@ an@@ a as well as new li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a and a high school in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia .
And the C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ ans have actually contro@@ l@@ led the H@@ ay@@ d@@ en P@@ lan@@ et@@ ari@@ um from their high school .
"This is an im@@ age from S@@ at@@ ur@@ day , ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed by the A@@ qu@@ a s@@ at@@ elli@@ te , but through the U@@ ni@@ view so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
So you &apos;re seeing the e@@ dge of the Earth .
This is N@@ e@@ p@@ al .
"This is , in fact , right here is the val@@ le@@ y of L@@ ha@@ s@@ a , right here in T@@ i@@ be@@ t ."
But we can see the ha@@ ze from fi@@ res and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ le@@ y down b@@ el@@ ow in India .
This is N@@ e@@ p@@ al and T@@ i@@ be@@ t .
"And just in cl@@ os@@ ing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to bra@@ ve in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world nee@@ ds now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much lar@@ ger condi@@ tion now and a much lar@@ ger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , ess@@ enti@@ ally ."
We car@@ ry that in us .
"And to be able to see our cont@@ ex@@ t in this lar@@ ger sense at all sc@@ al@@ es hel@@ ps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe ."
Thank you .

"And this idea is n@@ ic@@ ely sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed by the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh cri@@ tic W@@ illi@@ am H@@ az@@ li@@ t@@ t , who wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; P@@ re@@ ju@@ di@@ ce is the child of ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance . &quot; &quot; I want to try to con@@ v@@ ince you here that this is mi@@ sta@@ ken .

"So , start with st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es . You look at me , you know my name , you know certain fac@@ ts about me , and you could make certain ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments ."
"You could make gu@@ ess@@ es about my e@@ th@@ n@@ ic@@ ity , my political aff@@ ili@@ ation , my religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s ."
"And the thing is , these ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments t@@ end to be ac@@ cur@@ ate ."
We &apos;re very good at this sort of thing .
"And we &apos;re very good at this sort of thing because our ability to st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe people is not some sort of ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary qu@@ ir@@ k of the mind , but rather it &apos;s a speci@@ fic inst@@ ance of a more gener@@ al process , which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that f@@ all into cat@@ eg@@ ories , and we can use our experience to make gener@@ ali@@ z@@ ations about no@@ v@@ el inst@@ anc@@ es of these cat@@ eg@@ ories ."
Now we might be wrong .
"But for the most part , we &apos;re good at this ."
"And in fact , H@@ az@@ li@@ t@@ t later on in his wonderful es@@ say con@@ ce@@ des this ."
But other times we &apos;re pr@@ ou@@ d of it .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) A@@ n@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er : G@@ ets to your question , the question in the h@@ all , on fore@@ ig@@ n a@@ id ? Y@@ es , m@@ a &apos;@@ am ."
W@@ om@@ an : The American people are suff@@ ering in our country right now .
Why do we contin@@ ue to s@@ end fore@@ ig@@ n a@@ id to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
"A@@ C : G@@ over@@ n@@ or P@@ er@@ ry , what about that ?"
"And in fact , in gener@@ al , people are often s@@ w@@ ay@@ ed by feel@@ ings of so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity , lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty , pri@@ de , pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ism , to@@ wards their country or to@@ wards their e@@ th@@ ni@@ c group ."
Now some of you may re@@ ject this .
"But even you s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ates ac@@ cept that there should be some pul@@ l to@@ wards the in@@ -@@ group in the dom@@ ain of friends and family , of people you &apos;re cl@@ ose to , and so even you make a dist@@ inc@@ tion between us ver@@ su@@ s them ."
T@@ a@@ j@@ fe@@ l was born in P@@ ol@@ and in 19@@ 1@@ 9 .
And what started his care@@ er is an in@@ sight that the way most people were thinking about the H@@ o@@ loc@@ au@@ st was wrong .
"M@@ any people , most people at the time , vie@@ wed the H@@ o@@ loc@@ au@@ st as sort of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing some tr@@ ag@@ ic fl@@ a@@ w on the part of the G@@ er@@ m@@ ans , some gen@@ e@@ tic tain@@ t , some au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an pers@@ on@@ ality ."
And T@@ a@@ j@@ fe@@ l re@@ jec@@ ted this .
"And to expl@@ ore this , he did a ser@@ ies of cl@@ assi@@ c stu@@ dies with B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents ."
"And in one of his stu@@ dies , what he did was he asked the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents all sor@@ ts of questions , and then bas@@ ed on their ans@@ w@@ ers , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve looked at your ans@@ w@@ ers , and bas@@ ed on the ans@@ w@@ ers , I have de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed that you are e@@ ither &quot; &quot; — he told half of them — &quot; &quot; a K@@ and@@ in@@ sk@@ y lo@@ ver , you love the work of K@@ and@@ in@@ sk@@ y , or a K@@ le@@ e lo@@ ver , you love the work of K@@ le@@ e . &quot; &quot; It was enti@@ re@@ ly bo@@ g@@ us ."
"But what he found was , these cat@@ eg@@ ories mat@@ ter@@ ed , so when he later gave the sub@@ jects money , they would pre@@ f@@ er to give the money to mem@@ bers of their own group than mem@@ bers of the other group ."
So one of the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts might like gre@@ en be@@ ans .
"They test the b@@ ab@@ ies own food pre@@ fer@@ ences , and b@@ ab@@ ies t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally pre@@ f@@ er the gra@@ ha@@ m cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ers ."
"But the question is , does this matter to b@@ ab@@ ies in how they treat the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts ? And it mat@@ ters a lot ."
"( Laughter ) We see this sort of in@@ -@@ group , out@@ -@@ group psycho@@ logy all the time ."
We see it in political cl@@ as@@ h@@ es within grou@@ ps with different ide@@ o@@ logi@@ es .
S@@ ter@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es can also go a@@ wr@@ y .
"So often they &apos;re r@@ ational and u@@ se@@ ful , but sometimes they &apos;re ir@@ r@@ ational , they give the wrong ans@@ w@@ ers , and other times they le@@ ad to pl@@ ain@@ ly im@@ moral con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ."
And the case that &apos;s been most stu@@ died is the case of r@@ ace .
"There was a f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating study pri@@ or to the 200@@ 8 elec@@ tion where social psycho@@ logi@@ sts looked at the ex@@ t@@ ent to which the can@@ di@@ d@@ ates were as@@ soci@@ ated with America , as in an un@@ consci@@ ous as@@ soci@@ ation with the American fl@@ a@@ g ."
"And in one of their stu@@ dies they comp@@ ared O@@ b@@ am@@ a and M@@ c@@ C@@ ain , and they found M@@ c@@ C@@ ain is thought of as more American than O@@ b@@ am@@ a , and to some ex@@ t@@ ent , people are@@ n &apos;t that surpri@@ sed by hear@@ ing that ."
"But they were respon@@ ding , of course , to the col@@ or of his sk@@ in ."
"In one rec@@ ent study , resear@@ ch@@ ers put ads on e@@ B@@ ay for the s@@ ale of bas@@ e@@ b@@ all car@@ ds ."
"S@@ ome of them were hel@@ d by white h@@ ands , others by black h@@ ands ."
They were the same bas@@ e@@ b@@ all car@@ ds .
"In resear@@ ch done at St@@ an@@ for@@ d , psycho@@ logi@@ sts exp@@ lo@@ red the case of people s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed for the m@@ ur@@ der of a white person ."
And there are different av@@ en@@ ues .
"One av@@ en@@ ue is to appe@@ al to people &apos;s emoti@@ onal respon@@ ses , to appe@@ al to people &apos;s emp@@ ath@@ y , and we often do that through stories ."
People don &apos;t t@@ end to d@@ el@@ u@@ ge people with fac@@ ts and st@@ atis@@ tics .
This is H@@ ar@@ ri@@ et B@@ e@@ ec@@ her S@@ to@@ we .
And that could well have been a cat@@ al@@ y@@ st for great social change .
"So A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith star@@ ts by as@@ king you to imagine the death of thousands of people , and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not fam@@ ili@@ ar with ."
It could be China or India or a country in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a .
"And S@@ m@@ ith says , how would you respon@@ d ?"
"And you would say , well that &apos;s too bad , and you &apos;d go on to the rest of your life ."
"But imagine instead , S@@ m@@ ith says , you were to learn that tom@@ or@@ row you were to have your little fin@@ ger cho@@ p@@ ped off ."
"S@@ m@@ ith says , that would matter a lot ."
So this ra@@ is@@ es the question : W@@ ould you s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice thousands of lives to sa@@ ve your little fin@@ ger ?
"Now answer this in the pri@@ v@@ acy of your own head , but S@@ m@@ ith says , ab@@ solu@@ tely not , what a h@@ or@@ ri@@ d thought ."
"And this prin@@ ci@@ ple of im@@ par@@ ti@@ ality man@@ i@@ fe@@ sts itself in all of the world &apos;s religi@@ ons , in all of the different ver@@ sions of the go@@ l@@ d@@ en ru@@ le , and in all of the world &apos;s moral philosop@@ hi@@ es , which diff@@ er in many ways but share the pre@@ sup@@ posi@@ tion that we should ju@@ dge mor@@ ality from sort of an im@@ par@@ ti@@ al point of view ."
We have b@@ ound ourselves .
And we b@@ ind ourselves in other ways as well .
I think pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and bi@@ as ill@@ u@@ str@@ ate a fundamental du@@ ality of human nature .

"In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s with a lot of un@@ int@@ en@@ ded con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ."
And I &apos;m going to talk about some of those con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences and just present a whole b@@ un@@ ch of really interesting pro@@ jects that I think give us tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous reas@@ ons to be really op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic that the big desig@@ n and develop@@ ment pro@@ ject of the next 50 years is going to be re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a .
"So whether it &apos;s re@@ develop@@ ing d@@ ying m@@ all@@ s or re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ iting de@@ ad big@@ -@@ bo@@ x st@@ o@@ res or re@@ con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ t@@ l@@ ands out of par@@ king lots , I think the fact is the gro@@ wing number of emp@@ ty and under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ing , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally re@@ ta@@ il , sit@@ es thr@@ ough@@ out sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a gi@@ ves us actually a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous op@@ port@@ unity to take our le@@ ast@@ -@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ able l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ es right now and con@@ ver@@ t them into more su@@ st@@ ain@@ able places ."
"And in the process , what that al@@ lo@@ ws us to do is to re@@ direc@@ t a lot more of our grow@@ th back into exist@@ ing comm@@ uni@@ ties that could use a bo@@ ost , and have the in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture in place , instead of contin@@ u@@ ing to te@@ ar down tre@@ es and to te@@ ar up the gre@@ en space out at the ed@@ g@@ es ."
So why is this important ?
"I think there are any number of reas@@ ons , and I &apos;m just going to not get into deta@@ il but men@@ tion a few ."
"@@ J@@ ust from the per@@ spec@@ tive of c@@ lim@@ ate change , the average ur@@ b@@ an d@@ well@@ er in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"@@ has about on@@ e-@@ thir@@ d the car@@ b@@ on fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t of the average sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an d@@ well@@ er , m@@ os@@ tly because sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an@@ it@@ es dri@@ ve a lot more , and living in de@@ t@@ ach@@ ed buil@@ d@@ ings , you have that much more ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sur@@ face to le@@ ak energy out of ."
"So str@@ ic@@ tly from a c@@ lim@@ ate change per@@ spec@@ tive , the ci@@ ties are already relati@@ vely gre@@ en ."
The big op@@ port@@ unity to re@@ duce gre@@ en@@ h@@ ouse g@@ as em@@ is@@ sions is actually in ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zing the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s .
"A@@ ll that dri@@ ving that we &apos;ve been doing out in the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s , we have d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed the amount of mil@@ es we dri@@ ve ."
It &apos;s increas@@ ed our dep@@ en@@ dence on fore@@ ig@@ n o@@ il des@@ p@@ ite the g@@ ain@@ s in fu@@ el eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y .
We &apos;re just dri@@ ving so much more ; we ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to keep up techno@@ log@@ ically .
P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c health is another reason to consi@@ der re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers at the C@@ D@@ C and other places have increas@@ ing@@ ly been l@@ in@@ king sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an develop@@ ment patterns with se@@ d@@ ent@@ ary li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ les .
"And those have been l@@ in@@ ked then with the rather al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , gro@@ wing r@@ ates of ob@@ es@@ ity , sho@@ wn in these m@@ aps here , and that ob@@ es@@ ity has also been tri@@ gg@@ ering great incre@@ ases in heart disease and di@@ ab@@ et@@ es to the point where a child born today has a on@@ e-@@ in@@ -@@ three chan@@ ce of develop@@ ing di@@ ab@@ et@@ es ."
"And that r@@ ate has been es@@ cal@@ ating at the same r@@ ate as children not wal@@ king to school any@@ more , again , because of our develop@@ ment patterns ."
And then there &apos;s fin@@ ally — there &apos;s the aff@@ ord@@ ability question .
"I mean , how aff@@ ord@@ able is it to contin@@ ue to live in sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a with ri@@ sing g@@ as pr@@ ices ?"
"S@@ u@@ bur@@ b@@ an exp@@ an@@ sion to che@@ ap land , for the last 50 years — you know the che@@ ap land out on the e@@ dge — has hel@@ ped gener@@ ations of fam@@ ili@@ es en@@ jo@@ y the American dre@@ am ."
"But increas@@ ing@@ ly , the sa@@ v@@ ings prom@@ is@@ ed by dri@@ v@@ e-@@ ti@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ f@@ y aff@@ ord@@ ability — which is basically our mo@@ de@@ l — those sa@@ v@@ ings are wi@@ ped out when you consi@@ der the tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation cos@@ ts ."
"For inst@@ ance , here in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , about half of h@@ ou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds make between $ 20@@ ,000 and $ 5@@ 0,000 a year , and they are sp@@ en@@ ding 2@@ 9 percent of their income on h@@ ous@@ ing and 3@@ 2 percent on tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation ."
"I mean , that &apos;s 200@@ 5 fi@@ gu@@ res ."
That &apos;s before we got up to the four b@@ uc@@ ks a g@@ all@@ on .
"You know , n@@ one of us really t@@ end to do the mat@@ h on our tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation cos@@ ts , and they &apos;re not going down any time so@@ on ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther you love sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a &apos;s le@@ af@@ y pri@@ v@@ acy or you h@@ ate its s@@ oul@@ less comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al stri@@ ps , there are reas@@ ons why it &apos;s important to re@@ tro@@ f@@ it ."
But is it pr@@ ac@@ tical ?
I think it is .
"@@ J@@ un@@ e W@@ illi@@ am@@ son and I have been resear@@ ch@@ ing this t@@ op@@ ic for over a dec@@ ad@@ e , and we &apos;ve found over 80 vari@@ ed pro@@ jects ."
"But that they &apos;re really all market dri@@ ven , and what &apos;s dri@@ ving the market in particular — number one — is maj@@ or demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c shi@@ f@@ ts ."
"We all t@@ end to think of sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a as this very fam@@ il@@ y-@@ fo@@ c@@ used place , but that &apos;s really not the case any@@ more ."
"S@@ ince 2@@ 000 , already tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds of h@@ ou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds in sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a did not have kids in them ."
We just ha@@ ven &apos;t cau@@ ght up with the ac@@ tual reali@@ ties of this .
"The reas@@ ons for this have a lot to with the dom@@ in@@ ance of the two big demo@@ grap@@ hi@@ c grou@@ ps right now : the B@@ ab@@ y B@@ o@@ om@@ ers re@@ ti@@ r@@ ing — and then there &apos;s a g@@ ap , G@@ ener@@ ation X , which is a small generation ."
They &apos;re still having kids — but G@@ ener@@ ation Y ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t even started h@@ it@@ ting chil@@ d@@ -@@ re@@ ar@@ ing age .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
"So as a res@@ ult of that , demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ers predic@@ t that through 20@@ 2@@ 5 , 7@@ 5 to 8@@ 5 percent of new h@@ ou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds will not have kids in them ."
"And the market resear@@ ch , con@@ sum@@ er resear@@ ch , as@@ king the B@@ o@@ om@@ ers and G@@ en Y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , t@@ ells us there is going to be a huge de@@ m@@ and — and we &apos;re already seeing it — for more ur@@ b@@ an li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ les within sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a ."
"That basically , the B@@ o@@ om@@ ers want to be able to age in place , and G@@ en Y would like to live an ur@@ b@@ an li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le , but most of their j@@ ob@@ s will contin@@ ue to be out in sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a ."
The other big d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic of change is the sh@@ e@@ er per@@ form@@ ance of under@@ per@@ form@@ ing as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
"Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an in@@ die ro@@ ck b@@ and , but develop@@ ers gener@@ ally use it to re@@ f@@ er to under@@ used par@@ king lots — and sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a is ful@@ l of them ."
"When the pos@@ tw@@ ar sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s were first built out on the che@@ ap land away from do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn , it made sense to just build sur@@ face par@@ king lots ."
"But those sit@@ es have now been le@@ ap@@ f@@ ro@@ gg@@ ed and le@@ ap@@ f@@ ro@@ gg@@ ed again , as we &apos;ve just contin@@ u@@ ed to sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l , and they now have a relati@@ vely cen@@ tr@@ al loc@@ ation ."
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more val@@ u@@ able than just sur@@ face par@@ king lots .
"It now makes sense to go back in , build a dec@@ k and build up on those sit@@ es ."
"So what do you do with a de@@ ad m@@ all , de@@ ad off@@ ice par@@ k ?"
"It turns out , all sor@@ ts of things ."
"In a s@@ low econom@@ y like ours , re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ ation is one of the more pop@@ ular str@@ ate@@ gi@@ es ."
So this happens to be a de@@ ad m@@ all in St@@ . L@@ ou@@ is that &apos;s been re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited as ar@@ t-@@ space .
"It &apos;s now home to arti@@ st stu@@ di@@ o@@ s , the@@ ater grou@@ ps , d@@ ance tr@@ ou@@ p@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not pul@@ ling in as much ta@@ x re@@ ven@@ ue as it once was , but it &apos;s ser@@ ving its comm@@ unity ."
It &apos;s ke@@ e@@ ping the ligh@@ ts on .
"It &apos;s becom@@ ing , I think , a really great in@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"O@@ ther m@@ all@@ s have been re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited as n@@ ur@@ sing h@@ om@@ es , as univer@@ si@@ ties , and as all vari@@ e@@ ty of off@@ ice space ."
"We also found a lot of exam@@ pl@@ es of de@@ ad big@@ -@@ bo@@ x st@@ o@@ res that have been con@@ ver@@ ted into all sor@@ ts of comm@@ un@@ it@@ y-@@ ser@@ ving us@@ es as well — lots of scho@@ ols , lots of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and lots of li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies like this one ."
"This was a little gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , a F@@ ood L@@ i@@ on gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , that is now a public li@@ br@@ ary ."
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to , I think , doing a beautiful ad@@ ap@@ tive re@@ use , they t@@ ore up some of the par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es , put in bi@@ os@@ wal@@ es to coll@@ ect and c@@ le@@ an the ru@@ no@@ ff , put in a lot more si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks to con@@ n@@ ect to the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds ."
"And they &apos;ve made this , what was just a st@@ ore along a comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al stri@@ p , into a comm@@ unity g@@ ath@@ ering space ."
"This one is a little L@@ -@@ shap@@ ed stri@@ p sho@@ p@@ ping center in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x , A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a ."
"R@@ e@@ ally all they did was they gave it a f@@ res@@ h co@@ at of b@@ right pain@@ t , a g@@ our@@ m@@ et gro@@ cer@@ y , and they put up a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in the old p@@ ost off@@ ice ."
N@@ ever under@@ es@@ tim@@ ate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a dest@@ in@@ ation .
"It &apos;s been so suc@@ cess@@ ful , they &apos;ve now taken over the stri@@ p across the stre@@ et ."
"The real est@@ ate ads in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od all very pr@@ ou@@ dly pro@@ cl@@ a@@ i@@ m , &quot; W@@ al@@ king dist@@ ance to L@@ e G@@ ran@@ de O@@ ran@@ ge , &quot; because it pro@@ vi@@ ded its ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od with what soci@@ o@@ logi@@ sts like to call &quot; a thir@@ d place . &quot;"
"If home is the first place and work is the second place , the thir@@ d place is where you go to h@@ ang out and build comm@@ unity ."
"And es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally as sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a is becom@@ ing less cen@@ ter@@ ed on the family , the family h@@ ou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds , there &apos;s a real h@@ un@@ ger for more thir@@ d places ."
"So the most dr@@ am@@ atic re@@ tro@@ f@@ its are really those in the next cat@@ eg@@ ory , the next str@@ ate@@ gy : re@@ develop@@ ment ."
"Now , d@@ uring the bo@@ om , there were se@@ ver@@ al really dr@@ am@@ atic re@@ develop@@ ment pro@@ jects where the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al building was sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ed to the ground and then the whole s@@ ite was re@@ built at si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly gre@@ ater den@@ s@@ ity , a sort of comp@@ act , wal@@ k@@ able ur@@ b@@ an ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds ."
But some of them have been much more incre@@ mental .
"This is M@@ as@@ h@@ pe@@ e C@@ om@@ m@@ ons , the ol@@ d@@ est re@@ tro@@ f@@ it that we &apos;ve found ."
"And it &apos;s just incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , over the last 20 years , built ur@@ b@@ an@@ ism on top of its par@@ king lots ."
So the black and white ph@@ ot@@ o sho@@ ws the simple 60 &apos;s stri@@ p sho@@ p@@ ping center .
"And then the m@@ aps abo@@ ve that show its gra@@ du@@ al trans@@ formation into a comp@@ act , mi@@ x@@ ed@@ -@@ use New Eng@@ land village , and it has pl@@ ans now that have been appro@@ ved for it to con@@ n@@ ect to new re@@ si@@ d@@ ential ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds across the ar@@ ter@@ i@@ als and over to the other side ."
"So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incre@@ mental ."
"S@@ ome@@ times , it &apos;s all at once ."
"This is another in@@ f@@ ill pro@@ ject on the par@@ king lots , this one of an off@@ ice par@@ k outside of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
"When M@@ e@@ tr@@ or@@ a@@ il exp@@ an@@ ded trans@@ it into the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s and op@@ en@@ ed a st@@ ation ne@@ ar@@ by to this s@@ ite , the ow@@ n@@ ers decided to build a new par@@ king dec@@ k and then in@@ ser@@ t on top of their sur@@ face lots a new M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et , se@@ ver@@ al ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments and con@@ do buil@@ d@@ ings , while ke@@ e@@ ping the exist@@ ing off@@ ice buil@@ d@@ ings ."
Here is the s@@ ite in 19@@ 40 : It was just a little f@@ ar@@ m in the village of H@@ y@@ att@@ s@@ v@@ il@@ le .
"B@@ y 19@@ 80 , it had been sub@@ divi@@ ded into a big m@@ all on one side and the off@@ ice par@@ k on the other and then some bu@@ ff@@ er sit@@ es for a li@@ br@@ ary and a ch@@ ur@@ ch to the far right ."
"T@@ o@@ day , the trans@@ it , the M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et and the new h@@ ous@@ ing have all been built ."
"E@@ ven@@ tually , I exp@@ ect that the stre@@ ets will probably ex@@ t@@ end through a re@@ develop@@ ment of the m@@ all ."
P@@ l@@ ans have already been an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed for a lot of those g@@ ar@@ d@@ en ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments abo@@ ve the m@@ all to be re@@ develop@@ ed .
T@@ r@@ ans@@ it is a big dri@@ ver of re@@ tro@@ f@@ its .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
You can sort of see the fun@@ k@@ y new con@@ do buil@@ d@@ ings in between the off@@ ice buil@@ d@@ ings and the public space and the new M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et .
"This one is one of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es , B@@ el@@ ma@@ r ."
I think they really built an at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive place here and have just emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed all@@ -@@ gre@@ en con@@ struc@@ tion .
There &apos;s massive P@@ .@@ V@@ . ar@@ ra@@ ys on the ro@@ of@@ s as well as w@@ ind tur@@ b@@ ines .
This was a very large m@@ all on a hund@@ re@@ d@@ -@@ ac@@ re super@@ bloc@@ k .
"It &apos;s now 2@@ 2 wal@@ k@@ able ur@@ b@@ an bloc@@ ks with public stre@@ ets , two public par@@ ks , eight b@@ us l@@ ines and a ran@@ ge of h@@ ous@@ ing typ@@ es , and so it &apos;s really given L@@ a@@ ke@@ w@@ ood , C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do the do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn that this particular sub@@ ur@@ b never had ."
Here was the m@@ all in its he@@ y@@ day .
They had their pro@@ m in the m@@ all . They lo@@ ved their m@@ all .
So here &apos;s the s@@ ite in 19@@ 7@@ 5 with the m@@ all .
"B@@ y 19@@ 9@@ 5 , the m@@ all has died ."
The de@@ par@@ t@@ ment st@@ ore has been ke@@ p@@ t — and we found this was true in many c@@ ases .
The de@@ par@@ t@@ ment st@@ o@@ res are m@@ ul@@ ti@@ story ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re@@ -@@ ad@@ ap@@ ted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at pro@@ jec@@ ted buil@@ d@@ -@@ out .
"This pro@@ ject , I think , has great connec@@ ti@@ vity to the exist@@ ing ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds ."
"It &apos;s pro@@ vi@@ ding 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 h@@ ou@@ se@@ ho@@ l@@ ds with the op@@ tion of a more ur@@ b@@ an li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ."
It &apos;s about tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et looks like .
"It &apos;s very suc@@ cess@@ ful , and it &apos;s hel@@ ped to prom@@ p@@ t — eight of the 1@@ 3 re@@ gi@@ onal m@@ all@@ s in D@@ en@@ ver have now , or have an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed pl@@ ans to be , re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ted ."
But it &apos;s important to n@@ ote that all of this re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting is not oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing — just b@@ ul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers are coming and just p@@ lowing down the whole c@@ ity .
"@@ No , it &apos;s po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of wal@@ k@@ ability on the sit@@ es of under@@ -@@ per@@ form@@ ing pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"And so it &apos;s giving people more cho@@ ices , but it &apos;s not taking away cho@@ ices ."
But it &apos;s also not really enough to just create po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of wal@@ k@@ ability .
You want to also try to get more syst@@ em@@ ic trans@@ formation .
We need to also re@@ tro@@ f@@ it the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors themselves .
So this is one that has been re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ted in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
"They took the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al stri@@ p sho@@ wn on the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white imag@@ es b@@ el@@ ow , and they built a b@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard that has become the M@@ ain S@@ tre@@ et for their to@@ wn ."
"And it &apos;s trans@@ form@@ ed from being an u@@ g@@ ly , un@@ sa@@ fe , und@@ es@@ ir@@ able ad@@ d@@ ress , to becom@@ ing a beautiful , at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , di@@ gni@@ fied sort of good ad@@ d@@ ress ."
"I mean now we &apos;re ho@@ ping we start to see it ; they &apos;ve already built C@@ ity H@@ all , at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted two h@@ ot@@ els ."
I could imagine beautiful h@@ ous@@ ing going up along there without t@@ ear@@ ing down another t@@ ree .
"So there &apos;s a lot of great things , but I &apos;d love to see more cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors getting re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting ."
But den@@ si@@ fic@@ ation is not going to work every@@ where .
S@@ ome@@ times re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing is really the better answer .
"There &apos;s a lot to learn from suc@@ cess@@ ful l@@ and@@ b@@ an@@ king pro@@ gr@@ ams in ci@@ ties like F@@ l@@ in@@ t , M@@ ic@@ hi@@ g@@ an ."
There &apos;s also a bur@@ ge@@ on@@ ing sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing mov@@ ement — sort of v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory g@@ ar@@ den@@ s me@@ ets the In@@ ter@@ net .
"But perhaps one of the most important re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts is the op@@ port@@ unity to re@@ st@@ ore the loc@@ al ec@@ o@@ logy , as in this example outside of M@@ in@@ ne@@ ap@@ ol@@ is ."
"When the sho@@ p@@ ping center died , the c@@ ity re@@ st@@ o@@ red the s@@ ite &apos;s or@@ ig@@ in@@ al we@@ t@@ l@@ ands , cre@@ ating la@@ ke@@ front pro@@ per@@ ty , which then at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted pri@@ v@@ ate inv@@ est@@ ment , the first pri@@ v@@ ate inv@@ est@@ ment to this very low@@ -@@ income ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in over 40 years ."
So they &apos;ve man@@ ag@@ ed to both re@@ st@@ ore the loc@@ al ec@@ o@@ logy and the loc@@ al econom@@ y at the same time .
This is another re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing example .
It also makes sense in very str@@ ong mar@@ ke@@ ts .
This one in S@@ e@@ att@@ le is on the s@@ ite of a m@@ all par@@ king lot ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent to a new trans@@ it stop .
And the wa@@ v@@ y line is a pat@@ h al@@ on@@ g@@ side a cre@@ e@@ k that has now been d@@ ay@@ li@@ t .
The cre@@ e@@ k had been cul@@ ver@@ ted under the par@@ king lot .
But d@@ ay@@ ligh@@ ting our cre@@ e@@ ks really impro@@ ves their water qu@@ ality and con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions to ha@@ b@@ it@@ at .
So I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you some of the first generation of re@@ tro@@ f@@ its .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three chall@@ eng@@ es for the future .
The first is to pl@@ an re@@ tro@@ f@@ it@@ ting much more syst@@ em@@ ically at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ t@@ an sc@@ ale .
We need to be able to t@@ ar@@ get which are@@ as really should be re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ed .
Wh@@ ere should we be re@@ develop@@ ing ?
And where should we be enc@@ our@@ aging re@@ -@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ ation ?
Th@@ ese sli@@ des just show two imag@@ es from a lar@@ ger pro@@ ject that looked at trying to do that for A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a .
I led a te@@ am that was asked to imagine A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a 100 years from now .
"And we ch@@ ose to try to re@@ ver@@ se sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l through three simple mo@@ ves — exp@@ en@@ sive , but simple ."
"One , in a hundred years , trans@@ it on all maj@@ or ra@@ il and ro@@ ad cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors ."
"T@@ w@@ o , in a hundred years , thous@@ and fo@@ ot bu@@ ff@@ ers on all stre@@ am cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors ."
"It &apos;s a little extre@@ me , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem ."
"In a hundred years , sub@@ divi@@ sions that simply end up too cl@@ ose to water or too far from trans@@ it won &apos;t be vi@@ able ."
And so we &apos;ve cre@@ ated the ec@@ o@@ -@@ ac@@ re trans@@ fer@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ trans@@ f@@ er develop@@ ment ri@@ gh@@ ts to the trans@@ it cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors and al@@ low the re@@ -@@ gre@@ en@@ ing of those form@@ er sub@@ divi@@ sions for food and energy produc@@ tion .
So the second chall@@ en@@ ge is to impro@@ ve the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tur@@ al desig@@ n qu@@ ality of the re@@ tro@@ f@@ its .
"And I cl@@ ose with this im@@ age of democr@@ acy in action : This is a prot@@ est that &apos;s happening on a re@@ tro@@ f@@ it in S@@ il@@ ver S@@ pr@@ ing , Mar@@ y@@ land on an A@@ str@@ ot@@ ur@@ f to@@ wn gre@@ en ."
"Now , re@@ tro@@ f@@ its are often ac@@ c@@ used of being exam@@ pl@@ es of f@@ au@@ x do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ w@@ ns and inst@@ ant ur@@ b@@ an@@ ism , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more ph@@ on@@ y than an A@@ str@@ ot@@ ur@@ f to@@ wn gre@@ en ."
"I have to say , these are very hy@@ bri@@ d places ."
They are new but trying to look old .
"They have ur@@ b@@ an stre@@ et@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , but sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an par@@ king r@@ ati@@ o@@ s ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir pop@@ ul@@ ations are more di@@ ver@@ se than typ@@ ical sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a , but they &apos;re less di@@ ver@@ se than ci@@ ties ."
"And they are public places , but that are man@@ ag@@ ed by pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies ."
And just the sur@@ face appe@@ ar@@ ance are often — like the A@@ str@@ ot@@ ur@@ f here — they make me w@@ ince .
"So , you know , I mean I &apos;m gl@@ ad that the ur@@ b@@ an@@ ism is doing its job ."
"The fact that a prot@@ est is happening really does mean that the l@@ ay@@ out of the bloc@@ ks , the stre@@ ets and bloc@@ ks , the pu@@ tting in of public space , comp@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ed as it may be , is still a really great thing ."
But we &apos;ve got to get the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture better .
The fin@@ al chall@@ en@@ ge is for all of you .
"I want you to jo@@ in the prot@@ est and start de@@ man@@ ding more su@@ st@@ ain@@ able sub@@ ur@@ b@@ an places — more su@@ st@@ ain@@ able places , per@@ i@@ od ."
"But cul@@ tur@@ ally , we t@@ end to think that do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ w@@ ns should be d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic , and we exp@@ ect that ."
But we seem to have an exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation that the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s should fore@@ ver re@@ ma@@ in f@@ ro@@ z@@ en in wh@@ at@@ ever ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent form they were first given bir@@ th to .
"It &apos;s time to let them grow up , so I want you to all sup@@ port the z@@ on@@ ing changes , the ro@@ ad di@@ ets , the in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents and the re@@ tro@@ f@@ its that are coming so@@ on to a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ne@@ ar you ."
Thank you .
How do they diff@@ er from the rest of us ?
"In two of the three great aren@@ as of life , by the time L@@ en was 30 , L@@ en was en@@ orm@@ ously suc@@ cess@@ ful ."
"B@@ y the time he was 20 , he was an op@@ tions tr@@ ad@@ er ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , in play , he &apos;s a national cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
"And the reason he was , was that L@@ en is a co@@ ld f@@ ish ."
What you get out of that is not sm@@ il@@ ey@@ -@@ ness .
"So , that &apos;s the second pat@@ h ."
"This is the most v@@ ener@@ able of the happ@@ in@@ ess@@ es , tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally ."
"Now , O@@ K , you can op@@ en your ey@@ es ."
"And we ask the question as a fun@@ c@@ tion of the three different lives , how much life s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion do you get ?"
The pur@@ su@@ it of mean@@ ing is the stron@@ g@@ est .
"A@@ l@@ li@@ son H@@ un@@ t : My three minutes ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t started yet , has it ?"
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes ."
"R@@ es@@ et the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fa@@ ir ."
"A@@ H : O@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s har@@ sh up here ."
I mean I &apos;m ner@@ v@@ ous enough as it is .
But I am not as ner@@ v@@ ous as I was five wee@@ ks ago .
F@@ i@@ ve wee@@ ks ago I had t@@ ot@@ al hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ement sur@@ g@@ ery .
Do you know that sur@@ g@@ ery ?
"E@@ l@@ ec@@ tri@@ c saw , power dr@@ ill , t@@ ot@@ ally dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing un@@ less you &apos;re D@@ a@@ vi@@ d B@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ y , in which case it &apos;s all tru@@ th and beau@@ ty ."
"S@@ ure D@@ a@@ vi@@ d , if it &apos;s not your hi@@ p , it &apos;s tru@@ th and beau@@ ty ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , I did have a really big e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any around the sit@@ u@@ ation , so Ch@@ r@@ is inv@@ ited me to tell you about it ."
But first you need to know two things about me .
J@@ ust two things .
"I &apos;m C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an , and I &apos;m the youn@@ g@@ est of se@@ ven kids ."
"Now , in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , we have that great health@@ care system ."
That means we get our new hi@@ ps for f@@ ree .
"And being the youn@@ g@@ est of se@@ ven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . O@@ K ?"
So my hi@@ p had been h@@ ur@@ ting me for years .
"I fin@@ ally went to the doc@@ tor , which was f@@ ree ."
"And she re@@ fer@@ red me to an or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on , also f@@ ree ."
F@@ in@@ ally got to see him after 10 months of wa@@ iting — almost a year .
That is what f@@ ree gets you .
"I m@@ et the sur@@ ge@@ on , and he took some f@@ ree X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , and I got a good look at them . And you know , even I could tell my hi@@ p was bad , and I actually work in mar@@ ke@@ ting ."
"So he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ l@@ li@@ son , we &apos;ve got to get you on the t@@ able ."
I &apos;m going to re@@ place your hi@@ p — it &apos;s about an 18@@ -@@ mon@@ th wa@@ it . &quot; &quot; 18 more months .
"I &apos;d already wa@@ ited 10 months , and I had to wa@@ it 18 more months ."
"You know , it &apos;s such a long wa@@ it that I actually started to even think about it in ter@@ ms of TE@@ D@@ s ."
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for this TED .
I wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for TE@@ D@@ G@@ lob@@ al in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a .
I would not have my new hi@@ p for TE@@ D@@ 200@@ 8 .
I would still be on my bad hi@@ p . That was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting .
"So , I left his off@@ ice and I was wal@@ king through the h@@ osp@@ ital , and that &apos;s when I had my e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any ."
This youn@@ g@@ est of se@@ ven had to get her@@ self to the front of the line .
O@@ h ye@@ ah .
C@@ an I tell you how un@@ -@@ C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an that is ?
We do not think that way .
We don &apos;t talk about it . It &apos;s not even a consi@@ der@@ ation .
"In fact , when we &apos;re tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing ab@@ ro@@ ad , it &apos;s how we i@@ d@@ enti@@ f@@ y f@@ el@@ low C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ ans ."
"&quot; A@@ f@@ ter you . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , no , no . A@@ f@@ ter you . &quot;"
"H@@ ey , are you from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a ? &quot; &quot; O@@ h , me too ! H@@ i ! &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at ! E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent ! &quot;"
"So no , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I wasn &apos;t a@@ ver@@ se to bu@@ tting any ge@@ e@@ z@@ er off the li@@ st ."
"S@@ ome 7@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old who wanted his new hi@@ p so he could be back go@@ l@@ f@@ ing , or g@@ ar@@ den@@ ing ."
"@@ No , no . F@@ r@@ on@@ t of the line ."
"So by now I was wal@@ king the lob@@ by , and of course , that h@@ ur@@ t , because of my hi@@ p , and I kind of needed a si@@ g@@ n ."
And I saw a si@@ g@@ n .
"In the w@@ in@@ do@@ w of the h@@ osp@@ ital &apos;s t@@ iny gi@@ ft sho@@ p there was a si@@ g@@ n that said , &quot; &quot; V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers N@@ e@@ e@@ ded . &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m ."
"Well , they si@@ g@@ ned me up im@@ me@@ di@@ ately ."
"@@ No re@@ fer@@ ence ch@@ ec@@ ks . N@@ one of the u@@ su@@ al bac@@ k@@ ground stuff , no ."
They were des@@ per@@ ate for v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers because the average age of the v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er at the h@@ osp@@ ital gi@@ ft sho@@ p was 7@@ 5 .
Y@@ eah . They needed some young b@@ loo@@ d .
"So , next thing you know , I had my b@@ right bl@@ ue v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er v@@ est , I had my ph@@ ot@@ o I@@ D , and I was fully tr@@ ained by my 8@@ 9@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old b@@ oss ."
I worked al@@ one .
E@@ very F@@ ri@@ day mor@@ ning I was at the gi@@ ft sho@@ p .
"Wh@@ ile r@@ ing@@ ing in h@@ osp@@ ital st@@ af@@ f &apos;s T@@ ic T@@ ac@@ s , I &apos;d cas@@ u@@ ally ask , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I &apos;d tell them , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m getting my hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ed — in 18 months ."
"It &apos;s g@@ on@@ n@@ a be so great when the p@@ ain st@@ op@@ s . O@@ w ! &quot; &quot; A@@ ll the st@@ af@@ f got to know the pl@@ uc@@ k@@ y , young v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er ."
"M@@ y next sur@@ ge@@ on &apos;s ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment was , co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , right after a shi@@ ft at the gi@@ ft sho@@ p ."
"So , nat@@ ur@@ ally , I had my v@@ est and my i@@ d@@ enti@@ fic@@ ation ."
I dr@@ ap@@ ed them cas@@ u@@ ally over the cha@@ ir in the doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice .
"And you know , when he wal@@ ked in , I could just tell that he saw them ."
"M@@ om@@ ents later , I had a sur@@ g@@ ery d@@ ate just wee@@ ks away , and a big f@@ at pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tion for P@@ er@@ co@@ c@@ et ."
"Now , word on the stre@@ et was that it was actually my v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ering that got me to the front of the line ."
"And , you know , I &apos;m not even as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed of that ."
T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hi@@ p ."
"But also I int@@ end to s@@ tic@@ k with the v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ering , which actually le@@ ads me to the bi@@ gg@@ est e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any of them all ."
"E@@ ven when a C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an che@@ at@@ s the system , they do it in a way that b@@ ene@@ f@@ its society ."
There &apos;s a group of people in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
People cr@@ oss o@@ ce@@ ans to go see them .
Th@@ ese people are t@@ all .
They j@@ um@@ p high . They we@@ ar red .
And they k@@ ill li@@ ons .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
Th@@ ese are the M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ is .
And you know what &apos;s co@@ ol ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ is , the bo@@ ys are br@@ ought up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are br@@ ought up to be mo@@ thers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was eng@@ ag@@ ed to be marri@@ ed as so@@ on as I re@@ ach@@ ed pub@@ er@@ ty ."
"M@@ y mother , my gr@@ and@@ mother , my au@@ n@@ ties , they con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me that your h@@ us@@ b@@ and just p@@ ass@@ ed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ o@@ ol , ye@@ ah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a per@@ f@@ ect woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the mor@@ ning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , s@@ wee@@ ping the h@@ ouse , co@@ o@@ king for my si@@ bl@@ ings , coll@@ ec@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ w@@ ood ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a per@@ f@@ ect wi@@ fe .
I went to school not because the M@@ a@@ as@@ a@@ is &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ bl@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living ."
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a po@@ lic@@ em@@ an in the c@@ ity .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
My mother worked hard in the f@@ ar@@ m to grow c@@ ro@@ ps so that we can e@@ at .
She re@@ ared the co@@ ws and the go@@ at@@ s so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would s@@ ell the co@@ ws , he would s@@ ell the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and dr@@ ank with his friends in the bar@@ s ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not al@@ lowed to own any pro@@ per@@ ty , and by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t , everything in my family any@@ way b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ tion@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers looked n@@ ice .
"They we@@ ar n@@ ice d@@ res@@ ses , high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ ed sho@@ es ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just wr@@ iting on the bo@@ ard — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , comp@@ ared to what I was doing in the f@@ ar@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our tra@@ di@@ tion , there is a cer@@ em@@ on@@ y that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a r@@ ite of p@@ ass@@ age to wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"And then I was just fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing my e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a tran@@ si@@ tion for me to go to high school ."
This was the cr@@ os@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this tra@@ di@@ tion , I was going to become a wi@@ fe ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of becom@@ ing a teacher will not come to p@@ ass ."
So I tal@@ ked — I had to come up with a pl@@ an to fig@@ ure these things out .
I tal@@ ked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this cer@@ em@@ on@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I r@@ an away , my father will have a sti@@ g@@ m@@ a , people will be call@@ ing him the father of that gir@@ l who didn &apos;t go through the cer@@ em@@ on@@ y ."
It was a s@@ ha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he fi@@ gu@@ red out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; o@@ kay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ em@@ on@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of exc@@ it@@ ement .
It &apos;s a cer@@ em@@ on@@ y . People are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tual cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happens , we were d@@ anc@@ ing , having exc@@ it@@ ement , and through all the night we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tual day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ouse that we were d@@ anc@@ ing in . Y@@ es , we d@@ anc@@ ed and d@@ anc@@ ed ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cour@@ t@@ y@@ ard , and there were a b@@ un@@ ch of people wa@@ iting ."
They were all in a cir@@ c@@ le .
"And as we d@@ anc@@ ed and d@@ anc@@ ed , and we appro@@ ach@@ ed this cir@@ c@@ le of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman sit@@ ting in the middle of it , and this woman was wa@@ iting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sist@@ ers and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ ach@@ ed her , she looked at me , and I s@@ at down ."
"And I s@@ at down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ r@@ ying a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ri@@ ed the k@@ ni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the c@@ li@@ t@@ or@@ is , and she c@@ ut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I bl@@ ed . I bl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter b@@ le@@ e@@ ding for a while , I fa@@ in@@ ted ther@@ e@@ after ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , I never died — but many die ."
"It &apos;s pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old k@@ ni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was l@@ uc@@ k@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and br@@ ought a n@@ ur@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree wee@@ ks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I m@@ et a young g@@ ent@@ le@@ man from our village who had been to the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was w@@ ear@@ ing a white t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t , j@@ e@@ ans , cam@@ er@@ a , white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , I think , and sho@@ es ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have p@@ a@@ ved ro@@ ads . It was quite at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and wa@@ iting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ J@@ ust tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This g@@ ent@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"Wh@@ ile I was in high school also , my d@@ ad was s@@ ick ."
"He got a st@@ ro@@ ke , and he was really , really s@@ ick , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ very@@ body who is my d@@ ad &apos;s age , m@@ ale in the comm@@ unity , is my father by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t — my un@@ cl@@ es , all of them — and they dic@@ t@@ ate what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ om@@ an &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and I couldn &apos;t come without the sup@@ port of the village , because I needed to ra@@ ise money to bu@@ y the air tic@@ k@@ et ."
I got a scho@@ lar@@ ship but I needed to get my@@ self here .
"But I needed the sup@@ port of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an op@@ port@@ unity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a l@@ ost op@@ port@@ unity ."
This should have been given to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tra@@ di@@ tion .
There &apos;s a belie@@ f am@@ ong our people that mor@@ ning br@@ ings good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the mor@@ ning , because there &apos;s good news in the mor@@ ning ."
"And in the village also , there is one ch@@ i@@ e@@ f , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the mor@@ ning , as the su@@ n r@@ ose ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ ens his do@@ or is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . C@@ an you sup@@ port me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I prom@@ is@@ ed him that I would be the best gir@@ l , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it al@@ one . &quot; &quot; He gave me a li@@ st of another 15 men that I went — 1@@ 6 more men — every single mor@@ ning I went and vi@@ s@@ ited them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to sup@@ port me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ ri@@ ved in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al@@ -@@ Mar@@ ts , v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and lots of food in the c@@ a@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia ."
I was in a land of pl@@ ent@@ y .
"I en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed my@@ self , but d@@ uring that moment while I was here , I disc@@ over@@ ed a lot of things ."
"I learned that that cer@@ em@@ on@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called f@@ em@@ ale gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
I learned that I did not have to tr@@ ad@@ e part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we spe@@ ak right now , three million girls in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a are at ri@@ s@@ k of going through this mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own pro@@ per@@ ty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me an@@ gr@@ y .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting marri@@ ed ."
"They were getting mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated , and here , after I gra@@ du@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my gra@@ du@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant cr@@ y of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mo@@ thers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had prom@@ is@@ ed you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I sp@@ o@@ ke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a gir@@ l is r@@ ap@@ ed when she &apos;s wal@@ king to school , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that ."
"If she got pre@@ gn@@ ant before she got marri@@ ed , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that , and she &apos;s p@@ uni@@ shed ."
She &apos;s be@@ at@@ en .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mo@@ ved , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for bo@@ ys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for bo@@ ys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a si@@ g@@ n of comm@@ it@@ ment ."
And they did . They d@@ on@@ ated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any cr@@ it@@ eri@@ a that we had ."
"S@@ he &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was ol@@ der . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine had been mo@@ ving from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father — mo@@ ving from one gr@@ and@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ouse to another one , from au@@ n@@ ties to au@@ n@@ ties . She had no st@@ ability in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something be@@ y@@ on@@ d what I was seeing in A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was ol@@ der to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the op@@ port@@ unity to come to the cl@@ ass .
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ formation had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine wan@@ ts to be a pi@@ lot so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top stud@@ ent when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best stud@@ ent , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re divi@@ sion that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ har@@ on . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ n . F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new d@@ a@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we spe@@ ak right now , 1@@ 2@@ 5 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated ."
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls will not be marri@@ ed when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achi@@ ev@@ ing their dre@@ ams .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties where they can ri@@ se ."
"As we spe@@ ak right now , women are not being be@@ at@@ en because of the re@@ v@@ olu@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our comm@@ unity ."
( Applause ) I want to chall@@ en@@ ge you today .
"You are li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to me because you are here , very op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic ."
You are somebody who is so p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see a better world .
"You are somebody who wan@@ ts to see that war ends , no po@@ ver@@ ty ."
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make a difference .
You are somebody who wan@@ ts to make our tom@@ or@@ row better .
"I want to chall@@ en@@ ge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . People will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e bo@@ ld . St@@ and up . B@@ e f@@ ear@@ less . B@@ e con@@ fi@@ dent .
"M@@ o@@ ve out , because as you change your world , as you change your comm@@ unity , as we believe that we are imp@@ ac@@ ting one gir@@ l , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your comm@@ unity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . If you do that , and I do that , are@@ n &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our gr@@ and@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many belie@@ ver@@ s at a TED Con@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al in any way , shap@@ e or form ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the maj@@ or@@ ity ."
My T@@ al@@ k today is about self-@@ tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dence .
It &apos;s just a bas@@ ic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just m@@ el@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is ec@@ st@@ atic and we re@@ ach for me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ li@@ f@@ ted or el@@ ev@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ str@@ act like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
So here &apos;s the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or I &apos;m off@@ ering today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ouse with many ro@@ om@@ s , most of which we &apos;re very fam@@ ili@@ ar with ."
But sometimes it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ar@@ s from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens on@@ to a sta@@ ir@@ case .
We c@@ lim@@ b the sta@@ ir@@ case and experience a state of al@@ ter@@ ed consciousness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psycho@@ logi@@ st W@@ illi@@ am J@@ am@@ es wr@@ ote about the many vari@@ e@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He coll@@ ected all kinds of case stu@@ dies .
"One of the most exc@@ iting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y , had an en@@ coun@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ es@@ us in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y said about it .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shap@@ e for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , appe@@ ar@@ ing to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing ."
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die .
This world had no place in my aff@@ ec@@ tions .
"@@ P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very self@@ ish and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I des@@ i@@ red the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st en@@ em@@ ies ."
"@@ J@@ H : So n@@ ote how B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y &apos;s pe@@ tty , mor@@ al@@ is@@ tic self just dies on the way up the sta@@ ir@@ case ."
And on this high@@ er level he becom@@ es lo@@ ving and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people c@@ lim@@ b the sta@@ ir@@ case .
O@@ thers use psy@@ che@@ de@@ li@@ c dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c sc@@ ro@@ ll sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ si@@ loc@@ y@@ b@@ in mu@@ sh@@ room and at the same moment get y@@ an@@ ked up the sta@@ ir@@ case by a go@@ d .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dence in nature .
O@@ thers over@@ come their self at ra@@ ves .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ d@@ est place of all : war .
"So many bo@@ o@@ ks about war say the same thing , that nothing br@@ ings people together like war ."
And that br@@ ing@@ ing them together op@@ ens up the possi@@ bility of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary self-@@ tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dent experi@@ ences .
I &apos;m going to play for you an ex@@ cer@@ p@@ t from this book by G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ r@@ ay .
G@@ r@@ ay was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ r@@ ay : M@@ any ve@@ ter@@ ans will ad@@ m@@ it that the experience of comm@@ un@@ al eff@@ ort in b@@ att@@ le has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; p@@ ass@@ es in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becom@@ es &quot; our &quot; and in@@ divi@@ du@@ al fa@@ ith l@@ os@@ es its cen@@ tr@@ al import@@ ance ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ sur@@ ance of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity that makes self-@@ s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice at these mom@@ ents so relati@@ vely easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not die , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ ra@@ des for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It fe@@ els some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cen@@ tr@@ al in the wr@@ iting of the great F@@ ren@@ ch soci@@ o@@ logi@@ st E@@ mi@@ le D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m .
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m even called us H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , or tw@@ o@@ -@@ level man ."
The lo@@ wer level he called the level of the prof@@ an@@ e .
Now prof@@ an@@ e is the op@@ pos@@ ite of s@@ ac@@ red .
It just means ordin@@ ary or common .
And in our ordin@@ ary lives we ex@@ ist as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als .
We want to s@@ atis@@ f@@ y our in@@ divi@@ du@@ al des@@ i@@ res .
We pur@@ sue our in@@ divi@@ du@@ al go@@ als .
But sometimes something happens that tri@@ gg@@ ers a p@@ ha@@ se change .
"I@@ n@@ divi@@ du@@ als un@@ ite into a te@@ am , a mov@@ ement or a n@@ ation , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m called this level the level of the s@@ ac@@ red because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the fun@@ c@@ tion of religi@@ on was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral comm@@ unity ."
D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us ta@@ kes on an air of s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people cir@@ c@@ le around some s@@ ac@@ red ob@@ ject or value , they &apos;ll then work as a te@@ am and fi@@ ght to de@@ f@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m wr@@ ote about a set of int@@ en@@ se coll@@ ec@@ tive emoti@@ ons that ac@@ comp@@ lish this m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of E pl@@ ur@@ i@@ b@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of in@@ divi@@ du@@ als ."
Th@@ ink of the coll@@ ec@@ tive jo@@ y in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain on the day W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ ink of the coll@@ ec@@ tive an@@ ger in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which br@@ ought down a dic@@ t@@ at@@ or ."
So let me sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ze where we are .
I &apos;m off@@ ering the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or of a sta@@ ir@@ case in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x and this sta@@ ir@@ case ta@@ kes us up from the prof@@ an@@ e level to the level of the s@@ ac@@ red .
So here &apos;s the m@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ l@@ ar question for social scienti@@ sts like me : I@@ s the sta@@ ir@@ case a fe@@ ature of our ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary desig@@ n ?
"I@@ s it a produc@@ t of natural sel@@ ec@@ tion , like our h@@ ands ?"
Well many scienti@@ sts who study religi@@ on take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ ists , for example , ar@@ gu@@ e that religi@@ on is a set of mem@@ es , sort of par@@ as@@ i@@ tic mem@@ es , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of crazy religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive stuff , like su@@ ici@@ de bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to l@@ ose ourselves ?"
How could it ever be ad@@ ap@@ tive for any org@@ an@@ ism to over@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ cent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in wr@@ ote a great de@@ al about the evolution of mor@@ ality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in not@@ ed that many of our vir@@ tu@@ es are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our grou@@ ps ."
But really the way to think about this is as m@@ ul@@ ti@@ level sel@@ ec@@ tion .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion going on within grou@@ ps and across grou@@ ps .
So here &apos;s a group of gu@@ ys on a colle@@ ge cre@@ w te@@ am .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in this te@@ am there &apos;s com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion .
There are gu@@ ys com@@ pe@@ ting with each other .
"The s@@ low@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get c@@ ut from the te@@ am ."
And only a few of these gu@@ ys are going to go on in the sp@@ ort .
"So within the te@@ am , their interest@@ s are actually p@@ it@@ ted against each other ."
And sometimes it would be adv@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ e@@ ous for one of these gu@@ ys to try to s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age the other gu@@ ys .
M@@ ay@@ be he &apos;ll b@@ ad@@ m@@ ou@@ th his ch@@ i@@ e@@ f ri@@ v@@ al to the co@@ ach .
"But while that com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on within the bo@@ at , this com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is going on across bo@@ at@@ s ."
They can only w@@ in if they all pul@@ l together as a te@@ am .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary tru@@ ths ."
Let me ill@@ u@@ str@@ ate this for you .
"S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;ve got a group of little org@@ an@@ is@@ ms — they can be bac@@ ter@@ ia , they can be ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s sup@@ pose that this little group here , they ev@@ ol@@ ved to be co@@ oper@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this sim@@ ulation , as they inter@@ act they g@@ ain poin@@ ts , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed in size , you &apos;ll see them sp@@ li@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ pro@@ duce and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it g@@ ain@@ s we@@ al@@ th or poin@@ ts or food ."
"And in sh@@ ort order , the co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The f@@ re@@ e-@@ ri@@ d@@ ers have taken over .
If a group cannot sol@@ ve the f@@ re@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem then it cannot re@@ ap the b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation and group sel@@ ec@@ tion cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fav@@ or@@ ite solu@@ tion is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the m@@ it@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a in every c@@ ell has its own D@@ N@@ A , t@@ ot@@ ally se@@ par@@ ate from the D@@ N@@ A in the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ par@@ ate f@@ re@@ e-@@ living bac@@ ter@@ ia and they came together and bec@@ ame a super@@ org@@ an@@ ism .
A super@@ org@@ an@@ ism can basically take what it wan@@ ts .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually comp@@ os@@ ed of these new super@@ org@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is sometimes called a maj@@ or tran@@ si@@ tion in ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history .
"D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s la@@ ws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of play@@ er on the field and things beg@@ in to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some so@@ li@@ t@@ ary was@@ ps beg@@ an cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ mi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly , in the last hal@@ f@@ -@@ million years when our own an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors bec@@ ame cul@@ tur@@ al cre@@ atures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a cam@@ p@@ fir@@ e , they divi@@ ded l@@ ab@@ or , they beg@@ an pain@@ ting their bo@@ dies , they sp@@ o@@ ke their own di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts , and even@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own go@@ ds ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation loc@@ ked inside ."
"And they un@@ loc@@ ked the most po@@ wer@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ oper@@ ation — a force for con@@ struc@@ tion and de@@ struc@@ tion ."
Lo@@ ok at the people in these ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing comm@@ un@@ al inter@@ est , which requ@@ i@@ res them to l@@ ose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my T@@ al@@ k de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed in the st@@ and@@ ard TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole T@@ al@@ k over again in three minutes in a more ful@@ l@@ -@@ spec@@ tru@@ m sort of way .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ on@@ a@@ than H@@ a@@ i@@ d@@ t : We hum@@ ans have many vari@@ e@@ ties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ illi@@ am J@@ am@@ es expl@@ ained ."
One of the most common is c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing the sec@@ re@@ t sta@@ ir@@ case and l@@ os@@ ing ourselves .
"The sta@@ ir@@ case ta@@ kes us from the experience of life as prof@@ an@@ e or ordin@@ ary up@@ wards to the experience of life as s@@ ac@@ red , or de@@ e@@ ply inter@@ connec@@ ted ."
"We are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ k@@ he@@ i@@ m expl@@ ained ."
"And we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x because we ev@@ ol@@ ved by m@@ ul@@ ti@@ level sel@@ ec@@ tion , as D@@ ar@@ w@@ in expl@@ ained ."
"If it is an ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation , then we ev@@ ol@@ ved to be religi@@ ous ."
"I mean that we ev@@ ol@@ ved to see s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ ams and cir@@ c@@ le around s@@ ac@@ red ob@@ jects , people and ideas ."
This is why poli@@ tics is so tri@@ b@@ al .
"@@ P@@ o@@ li@@ tics is par@@ tly prof@@ an@@ e , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but poli@@ tics is also about s@@ ac@@ re@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ in@@ ing with others to pur@@ sue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the e@@ ter@@ n@@ al str@@ u@@ gg@@ le between good and evi@@ l , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good te@@ am ."
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , if the sta@@ ir@@ case is real , it expl@@ ain@@ s the per@@ sist@@ ent under@@ curren@@ t of dis@@ s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion in moder@@ n life ."
"Because human be@@ ings are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , hi@@ vi@@ sh cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We bu@@ sted out of the hi@@ ve d@@ uring the E@@ n@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
We bro@@ ke down the old in@@ stitu@@ tions and br@@ ought li@@ ber@@ ty to the op@@ pres@@ sed .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays we f@@ ly around like in@@ divi@@ du@@ al be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our f@@ re@@ e@@ dom .
But sometimes we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ ple@@ x , but moder@@ n , sec@@ ular society was built to s@@ atis@@ f@@ y our lo@@ wer , prof@@ an@@ e selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ fort@@ able down here on the lo@@ wer level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment center ."
One great chall@@ en@@ ge of moder@@ n life is to find the sta@@ ir@@ case am@@ id all the clu@@ tter and then to do something good and no@@ ble once you c@@ lim@@ b to the top .
I see this des@@ ire in my students at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
They all want to find a c@@ ause or call@@ ing that they can th@@ row themselves into .
They &apos;re all sear@@ ch@@ ing for their sta@@ ir@@ case .
M@@ ost people long to over@@ come pe@@ tt@@ iness and become part of something lar@@ ger .
And this expl@@ ain@@ s the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary res@@ on@@ ance of this simple me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or con@@ ju@@ red up ne@@ arly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land enti@@ re of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the ma@@ in . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the ple@@ as@@ ures of every@@ day life .
But I want to beg@@ in with a story of an un@@ u@@ su@@ al and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ man@@ n G@@ o@@ ering .
"@@ G@@ o@@ ering was H@@ it@@ l@@ er &apos;s second in comm@@ and in W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I , his desig@@ n@@ ated suc@@ cess@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ l@@ er , G@@ o@@ ering f@@ an@@ ci@@ ed h@@ im@@ self a coll@@ ec@@ tor of art ."
"H@@ it@@ l@@ er had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fav@@ or@@ ite ar@@ t@@ work ever .
"W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I came to an end , and G@@ o@@ ering was cap@@ tu@@ red , tri@@ ed at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g and ul@@ tim@@ ately s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed to death ."
Th@@ en the A@@ l@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his coll@@ ec@@ tions and found the pain@@ t@@ ings and went after the people who so@@ ld it to him .
"@@ V@@ an M@@ e@@ eg@@ er@@ en was char@@ g@@ ed with the cri@@ me of tre@@ as@@ on , which is itself p@@ un@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by death ."
"S@@ i@@ x wee@@ ks into his pri@@ son s@@ ent@@ ence , v@@ an M@@ e@@ eg@@ er@@ en con@@ f@@ ess@@ ed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to tre@@ as@@ on .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not s@@ ell a great ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece to that N@@ az@@ i ."
I pain@@ ted it my@@ self ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now no@@ body beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll pro@@ ve it ."
"B@@ r@@ ing me a can@@ v@@ as and some pain@@ t , and I will pain@@ t a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I so@@ ld that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ az@@ i ."
He pain@@ ted a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the char@@ g@@ es of tre@@ as@@ on were d@@ rop@@ ped .
"He had a l@@ ess@@ er char@@ ge of for@@ g@@ ery , got a year s@@ ent@@ ence and died a her@@ o to the D@@ ut@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an M@@ e@@ eg@@ er@@ en , but I want to turn now to G@@ o@@ ering , who &apos;s pic@@ tu@@ red here being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated at N@@ u@@ re@@ m@@ ber@@ g ."
"Now G@@ o@@ ering was , by all ac@@ coun@@ ts , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ g@@ at@@ ors descri@@ bed him as an am@@ ic@@ able psycho@@ pat@@ h .
He had disc@@ over@@ ed after all that the pain@@ ting he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sho@@ ck .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The S@@ up@@ per at E@@ m@@ m@@ au@@ s &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ g@@ ery ."
"It was not that pain@@ ting , but that pain@@ ting ."
"And when that was disc@@ over@@ ed , it l@@ ost all its value and was taken away from the mu@@ se@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psycho@@ logi@@ sts — why do or@@ ig@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we respon@@ d so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ o@@ logi@@ sts like V@@ e@@ bl@@ en and W@@ ol@@ fe would ar@@ gu@@ e that the reason why we take or@@ ig@@ ins so ser@@ i@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ b@@ s , because we &apos;re fo@@ c@@ used on st@@ at@@ us ."
"A@@ m@@ ong other things , if you want to show off how r@@ ich you are , how po@@ wer@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al than a for@@ g@@ ery because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer or@@ ig@@ in@@ als than for@@ g@@ er@@ ies ."
"@@ that hum@@ ans are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , natural born ess@@ enti@@ ali@@ sts ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respon@@ d to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is condi@@ tion@@ ed on our belie@@ f@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hi@@ dd@@ en nature is ."
"I want to su@@ gg@@ est that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to su@@ gg@@ est that ple@@ as@@ ure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level ple@@ as@@ ures like art , but even the most se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly simple ple@@ as@@ ures are aff@@ ected by our belie@@ f@@ s about hi@@ dd@@ en ess@@ ences ."
So take food .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It dep@@ ends . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ e@@ f ."
F@@ ew of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a r@@ at or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a stran@@ ge@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so surpri@@ sing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it ta@@ st@@ es to you will dep@@ end cri@@ tic@@ ally on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of this was done with young children .
"@@ How do you make children not just be more likely to e@@ at car@@ r@@ ots and dr@@ ink mil@@ k , but to get more ple@@ as@@ ure from e@@ ating car@@ r@@ ots and dr@@ in@@ king mil@@ k — to think they ta@@ st@@ e better ?"
How do you get ad@@ ults to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
This was rec@@ ently done with a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic tw@@ ist .
I@@ n front of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ very@@ body , of course , dr@@ in@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re dr@@ in@@ king exp@@ en@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with ple@@ as@@ ure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as t@@ ree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more ple@@ as@@ ur@@ able , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take se@@ x .
Th@@ ese are s@@ tim@@ ul@@ i I &apos;ve used in some of my stu@@ dies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fa@@ ir@@ ly at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is m@@ ale , the one on the right is f@@ em@@ ale ."
"If that belie@@ f turns out to be mi@@ sta@@ ken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disc@@ over that the person you &apos;re looking at with l@@ ust is actually a dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed ver@@ sion of your son or d@@ aughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why sp@@ ous@@ es in happy marri@@ ages t@@ end to think that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and or wi@@ fe looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A partic@@ ul@@ arly dr@@ am@@ atic example of this comes from a neuro@@ logical dis@@ order known as C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
So C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is a dis@@ order where you get a speci@@ fic d@@ el@@ u@@ sion .
"Now often , a res@@ ult of C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is tr@@ ag@@ ic ."
But there &apos;s at le@@ ast one case where C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome had a happy en@@ ding .
This was rec@@ or@@ ded in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The go@@ l@@ f clu@@ b@@ s were ow@@ ned by J@@ o@@ h@@ n F@@ . K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy and so@@ ld for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ c@@ tion .
The bu@@ b@@ ble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star B@@ r@@ it@@ ne@@ y S@@ pe@@ ar@@ s and so@@ ld for se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ re@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ ri@@ ving market in the par@@ ti@@ ally e@@ at@@ en food of b@@ el@@ o@@ ved people ."
( Laughter ) The sho@@ es are perhaps the most val@@ u@@ able of all .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to an un@@ con@@ fir@@ m@@ ed re@@ port , a S@@ au@@ d@@ i m@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ ire off@@ er@@ ed 10 million dollars for this p@@ air of sho@@ es ."
They were the ones th@@ ro@@ wn at G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h at an I@@ ra@@ q@@ i pres@@ s con@@ fer@@ ence se@@ ver@@ al years ago .
"W@@ ith my colle@@ ag@@ ues G@@ e@@ or@@ ge N@@ e@@ w@@ man and G@@ il D@@ i@@ es@@ en@@ dr@@ uc@@ k , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the ob@@ jects that people like ."
"So in one of our experim@@ ents , we asked people to name a fam@@ ous person who they a@@ do@@ red , a living person they a@@ do@@ red ."
So one answer was G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you p@@ ay for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s s@@ we@@ ater ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fa@@ ir amount — more than you would p@@ ay for a br@@ and new s@@ we@@ ater or a s@@ we@@ ater ow@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other grou@@ ps of sub@@ jects — we gave them different re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions and different condi@@ tions .
"So for inst@@ ance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , you can bu@@ y the s@@ we@@ ater , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t res@@ ell it . &quot; &quot; That dro@@ ps the value of it , su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ing that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really cau@@ ses an eff@@ ect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , you could res@@ ell it , you could bo@@ ast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly was@@ h@@ ed . &quot; &quot; That cau@@ ses a huge dro@@ p in the value ."
"As my wi@@ fe put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve was@@ h@@ ed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ ot@@ ies . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ no@@ b and want to bo@@ ast about having an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ."
Wh@@ o here li@@ kes the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ loc@@ k ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then re@@ por@@ ted that her father was co@@ ach@@ ing her .
"When this came out on tel@@ evi@@ sion , the value of her art d@@ rop@@ ped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , phys@@ ically , but the history had changed ."
So he got J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million dol@@ l@@ ar viol@@ in down to a W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way st@@ ation and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ e@@ f c@@ li@@ p of this .
"( V@@ i@@ ol@@ in mu@@ sic ) A@@ f@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"@@ Ap@@ paren@@ tly to really en@@ jo@@ y the mu@@ sic of J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the vide@@ o — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s st@@ anding in a sub@@ way st@@ ation .
So she &apos;s struc@@ k with p@@ ity .
She re@@ ach@@ es into her pur@@ se and h@@ ands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from mu@@ sic is from J@@ o@@ h@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ ni@@ st comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can bu@@ y this from i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a dol@@ l@@ ar 9@@ 9 , you can li@@ st@@ en to that si@@ l@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of si@@ l@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about ple@@ as@@ ure , but what I want to su@@ gg@@ est is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ li@@ es as well to p@@ ain ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experienc@@ ing , your belie@@ f@@ s about the ess@@ ence of it , aff@@ ect how it h@@ ur@@ ts ."
One lo@@ vely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ r@@ ay and D@@ an W@@ eg@@ ner .
And they gave them a ser@@ ies of pain@@ ful elec@@ tri@@ c sho@@ c@@ ks .
So it was a ser@@ ies of five pain@@ ful sho@@ c@@ ks .
"The second sho@@ ck fe@@ els less pain@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The thir@@ d dro@@ ps , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The p@@ ain gets less .
"In the other condi@@ tion , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sho@@ c@@ king them on pur@@ pose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sho@@ c@@ king them ."
The first sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sho@@ ck h@@ ur@@ ts just as much , and the thir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some c@@ ases , p@@ ain under the right cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es can trans@@ form into ple@@ as@@ ure ."
"The point was n@@ ic@@ ely sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed by the po@@ et J@@ o@@ h@@ n M@@ il@@ t@@ on who wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ a@@ ven of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ a@@ ven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( Applause ) ( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( Applause ) ( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) H@@ er@@ bi@@ e H@@ an@@ co@@ ck : Thank you .

"S@@ ome@@ one once said that poli@@ tics is , of course , &quot; &quot; sho@@ w@@ bi@@ z for u@@ g@@ ly people . &quot; &quot; So , on that bas@@ is , I feel like I &apos;ve really ar@@ ri@@ ved ."
"The other thing to think of is what an h@@ on@@ or it is , as a poli@@ tici@@ an , to give a TED talk , partic@@ ul@@ arly here in the U.@@ K@@ . , where the re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation of poli@@ tics , with the exp@@ en@@ ses sc@@ and@@ al , has s@@ un@@ k so low ."
There was even a story rec@@ ently that scienti@@ sts had thought about actually re@@ plac@@ ing r@@ at@@ s in their experim@@ ents with poli@@ tici@@ ans .
"And someone asked , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s no sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of poli@@ tici@@ ans , no one really min@@ ds what happens to them and , after all , there are some things that r@@ at@@ s just won &apos;t do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I know you all love data , so I &apos;m star@@ ting with a dat@@ a@@ -@@ r@@ ich sli@@ de ."
"This , I think , is the most important fact to be@@ ar in mind in B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh poli@@ tics or American poli@@ tics , and that is : We have run out of money ."
We have v@@ ast bu@@ d@@ get de@@ fic@@ its .
"This is my global public de@@ b@@ t c@@ loc@@ k , and , as you can see , it &apos;s 3@@ 2 tr@@ illion and coun@@ ting ."
"And I think what this le@@ ads to is a very simple recogni@@ tion , that there &apos;s one question in poli@@ tics at the moment abo@@ ve all other , and it &apos;s this one : How do we make things better without sp@@ en@@ ding more money ?"
"Because there isn &apos;t going to be a lot of money to impro@@ ve public serv@@ ices , or to impro@@ ve government , or to impro@@ ve so many of the things that poli@@ tici@@ ans talk about ."
"So what fol@@ lo@@ ws from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money — you can only measure suc@@ cess in public serv@@ ices in health care and education and po@@ lic@@ ing by sp@@ en@@ ding more money , you can only measure progress by sp@@ en@@ ding money — you &apos;re going to have a pretty mis@@ er@@ able time ."
"But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that le@@ ad up to well being — things like your family relation@@ shi@@ ps , fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship , comm@@ unity , val@@ ues — then , actually , this is an incredi@@ bly exc@@ iting time to be in poli@@ tics ."
"And the really simple ar@@ g@@ ument I want to make t@@ on@@ ight , the really st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward ar@@ g@@ ument is this : That if we com@@ b@@ ine the right political philosop@@ h@@ y , the right political thinking , with the incredi@@ ble information re@@ v@@ olution that has taken place , and that all of you know so much more about than I do , I think there &apos;s an incredi@@ ble op@@ port@@ unity to actually re@@ make poli@@ tics , re@@ make government , re@@ make public serv@@ ices , and achi@@ e@@ ve what &apos;s up on that sli@@ de , which is a big increase in our well@@ -@@ being ."
That &apos;s the ar@@ g@@ ument I want to make t@@ on@@ ight .
"So , star@@ ting with the political philosop@@ h@@ y ."
Now I &apos;m not saying for a minut@@ e that B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh Con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves have all the ans@@ w@@ ers .
O@@ f course we don &apos;t .
But there are two things at heart that I think dri@@ ve a con@@ serv@@ ative philosop@@ h@@ y that are really re@@ lev@@ ant to this whole de@@ b@@ ate .
"The first is this : We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives , if you give people more cho@@ ice , if you put them in the dri@@ ving se@@ at , then actually , you can create a stron@@ ger and better society ."
"And if you mar@@ ry this fact with the incredi@@ ble ab@@ und@@ ance of information that we have in our world today , I think you can completely , as I &apos;ve said , re@@ make poli@@ tics , re@@ make government , re@@ make your public serv@@ ices ."
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the gra@@ in of human nature .
"@@ P@@ o@@ li@@ tics and poli@@ tici@@ ans will only suc@@ ce@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be ."
"Now , if you com@@ b@@ ine this very simple , very con@@ serv@@ ative thought — go with the gra@@ in of human nature — with all the adv@@ anc@@ es in behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics , some of which we were just hear@@ ing about , again , I think we can achi@@ e@@ ve a real increase in well@@ -@@ being , in happiness , in a stron@@ ger society without nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily having to sp@@ end a whole lot more money ."
"Now , why do I think now is the moment to make this ar@@ g@@ ument ?"
"Well , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re going to suff@@ er a sh@@ ort , con@@ den@@ sed history l@@ es@@ son about what I would say are the three p@@ ass@@ ages of history : the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age , the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age and what we now live in , which I think is a pos@@ t-@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age ."
"A sim@@ pl@@ er way of thinking of it is that we have g@@ one from a world of loc@@ al control , then we went to a world of cen@@ tr@@ al control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control ."
"@@ L@@ oc@@ al power , cen@@ tr@@ al power , now , people power ."
"Now , here is K@@ ing C@@ n@@ ut , king a thous@@ and years ago ."
Th@@ ought he could turn back the wa@@ ves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the wa@@ ves .
"C@@ ouldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thous@@ and years ago , while it still took hours and hours and wee@@ ks and wee@@ ks to tra@@ ver@@ se your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in char@@ ge of ."
"You wer@@ en &apos;t in char@@ ge of po@@ lic@@ ing , j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , education , health , w@@ el@@ f@@ are ."
You could just about go to war and that was about it .
"This was the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age , an age in which everything had to be loc@@ al ."
You had to have loc@@ al control because there was no n@@ ati@@ on@@ all@@ y-@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able information because tra@@ v@@ el was so re@@ str@@ ic@@ ted .
So this was the pre@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age .
"@@ N@@ ex@@ t part of the co@@ ld history l@@ es@@ son , the lo@@ vely picture of the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evolution ."
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , all sor@@ ts of tran@@ sp@@ ort , tra@@ v@@ el information were possible , and this gave bir@@ th to , what I like to call , the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age ."
And ho@@ pe@@ fully this sli@@ de is going to mor@@ p@@ h beauti@@ fully . There we are .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , you have the big , str@@ ong , cen@@ tr@@ al state ."
"It was able — but only it was able — to organi@@ ze health care , education , po@@ lic@@ ing , j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce ."
"And it was a world of , as I say , not loc@@ al power , but now cen@@ tr@@ al power ."
It had suc@@ ked all that power up from the loc@@ ali@@ ties .
It was able to do that itself .
"The next great st@@ age , which all of you are so fam@@ ili@@ ar with : the massive information re@@ v@@ olution ."
"@@ J@@ ust consi@@ der this one fact : One hundred years ago , sen@@ ding these 10 words c@@ ost 50 dollars ."
"R@@ ight now , here we are l@@ in@@ ked up to L@@ ong B@@ each and every@@ where else , and all these sec@@ re@@ t loc@@ ations for a fr@@ action of that c@@ ost , and we can s@@ end and re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve huge qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties of information without it cos@@ ting anything ."
"So we &apos;re now living in a pos@@ t-@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic age , where gen@@ u@@ ine people power is possible ."
"Now , what does this mean for our poli@@ tics , for our public serv@@ ices , for our government ?"
"Well I can &apos;t , in the time I &apos;ve got , give huge num@@ bers of exam@@ pl@@ es , but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change ."
"And this is so ob@@ vi@@ ous , in a way , because you think about how all of you have changed the way we sho@@ p , the way we tra@@ v@@ el , the way that business is done ."
"That is already happened ; the information and In@@ ter@@ net re@@ v@@ olution has actually g@@ one all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t , in every way , yet tou@@ ched our government ."
"So , how could this happen ?"
"Well , I think there are three ch@@ i@@ e@@ f ways that it should make an en@@ orm@@ ous difference : in tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y , in gre@@ ater cho@@ ice and in ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability , in giving us that gen@@ u@@ ine people power ."
"If we take tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y , here is one of my fav@@ or@@ ite we@@ b@@ sit@@ es , the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i A@@ c@@ coun@@ t@@ ability P@@ or@@ t@@ al ."
"In the old days , only the government could hold the information , and only a few elec@@ ted people could try and gra@@ b that information and question it and chall@@ en@@ ge it ."
"Now here , on one we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , one state in America , every single dol@@ l@@ ar sp@@ ent by that government is sear@@ cha@@ ble , is anal@@ y@@ z@@ able , is ch@@ ec@@ k@@ able ."
Th@@ ink of the huge change that means : A@@ n@@ y business that wan@@ ts to b@@ id for a government con@@ tr@@ act can see what curren@@ tly is being sp@@ ent .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one thinking , &quot; &quot; I could do that serv@@ ice better , I could de@@ li@@ ver it che@@ ap@@ er , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all av@@ a@@ il@@ able there ."
"We have only , in government and in poli@@ tics , started to sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch the sur@@ face of what people are doing in the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al world with the information re@@ v@@ olution ."
"So , comple@@ te tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y will make a huge difference ."
"In this country , if we w@@ in the elec@@ tion , we are going to make all government sp@@ en@@ ding over 2@@ 5@@ ,000 p@@ ounds tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ t and av@@ a@@ il@@ able on@@ line , sear@@ cha@@ ble for any@@ one to see ."
"We &apos;re going to make every con@@ tr@@ act — we &apos;re an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ing this today — av@@ a@@ il@@ able on the In@@ ter@@ net so any@@ one can see what the ter@@ ms are , what the condi@@ tions are , dri@@ ving huge value for money , but also huge incre@@ ases , I believe , in well@@ -@@ being as well ."
"C@@ ho@@ ice . Now you all sho@@ p on@@ line , comp@@ are on@@ line , do everything on@@ line , and yet this re@@ v@@ olution has har@@ dly tou@@ ched the sur@@ face of public serv@@ ices like education , or health care or po@@ lic@@ ing , and you &apos;re going to see this change massi@@ vely ."
"We should be making this change with the information re@@ v@@ olution in our country , with sear@@ cha@@ ble health sit@@ es , so you can see what oper@@ ations work out pro@@ per@@ ly , what rec@@ or@@ ds doc@@ tors have , the c@@ le@@ an@@ l@@ iness of h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , who does best at in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion control — all of the information that would once be loc@@ ked in the D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of H@@ e@@ al@@ th is now av@@ a@@ il@@ able for all of us to see ."
And the thir@@ d of these big changes : ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability .
"This , I think , is a huge change ."
It is a cri@@ me ma@@ p . This is a cri@@ me ma@@ p from Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
"So , instead of having a sit@@ u@@ ation where only the poli@@ ce have the information about which cri@@ m@@ es are comm@@ it@@ ted where , and we have to emp@@ lo@@ y people in government to try and hold the poli@@ ce to ac@@ coun@@ t , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , we &apos;ve got this v@@ ast op@@ port@@ unity for people power , where we , as ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , can see what cri@@ m@@ es are being comm@@ it@@ ted — where , when and by wh@@ om — and we can hold the poli@@ ce to ac@@ coun@@ t ."
"And you can see this looks a bit like a che@@ f &apos;s h@@ at , but actually that &apos;s an ass@@ au@@ l@@ t , the one in bl@@ ue ."
"You can see what cri@@ me is comm@@ it@@ ted where , and you have the op@@ port@@ unity to hold your poli@@ ce force to ac@@ coun@@ t ."
"So those three ways — tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y , ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability and cho@@ ice — will make a huge difference ."
"Now I also said the other prin@@ ci@@ ple that I think we should work on is understanding of people , is recogni@@ zing that going with the gra@@ in of human nature you can achi@@ e@@ ve so much more ."
"Now , we &apos;re got a huge re@@ v@@ olution in understanding of why people be@@ have in the way that they do , and a great op@@ port@@ unity to put that knowledge and information to gre@@ ater use ."
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
"We &apos;re being ad@@ vi@@ sed by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book ."
"@@ Let me just give you one example that I think is incredi@@ bly simple , and I love ."
We want to get people to be more energy eff@@ ici@@ ent .
"Wh@@ y ? It cu@@ ts fu@@ el po@@ ver@@ ty , it cu@@ ts their b@@ ills , and it cu@@ ts car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions at the same time ."
How do you do it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve had government information cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ ns over the years when they tell you to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch off the ligh@@ ts when you leave the home ."
We even had — one government min@@ ist@@ er once told us to br@@ us@@ h our te@@ e@@ th in the dark .
I don &apos;t think they la@@ sted very long .
Lo@@ ok at what this does . This is a simple piece of behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics .
"The best way to get someone to c@@ ut their electr@@ ic@@ ity b@@ ill is to show them their own sp@@ en@@ ding , to show them what their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors are sp@@ en@@ ding , and then show what an energy consci@@ ous ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or is sp@@ en@@ ding ."
That sort of behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics can trans@@ form people &apos;s behavior in a way that all the b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying and all the information and all the b@@ ad@@ g@@ ering from a government cannot possi@@ bly achi@@ e@@ ve .
O@@ ther exam@@ pl@@ es are rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .
We all know we need to rec@@ y@@ c@@ le more .
How do we make it happen ?
"A@@ ll the pro@@ of from America is that actually , if you p@@ ay people to rec@@ y@@ c@@ le , if you give them a car@@ ro@@ t rather than a s@@ tic@@ k , you can trans@@ form their behavior ."
So what does all this ad@@ d up to ?
Here are my two fav@@ or@@ ite U.@@ S@@ . spe@@ ech@@ es of the last 50 years .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , here we have J@@ F@@ K with that incredi@@ bly simple and po@@ wer@@ ful form@@ ulation , &quot; A@@ s@@ k not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredi@@ bly no@@ ble s@@ enti@@ ment ."
"But when he made that spe@@ ec@@ h , what could you do to build the stron@@ ger , better society ?"
"You could fi@@ ght for your country , you could die for your country , you could ser@@ ve in your country &apos;s civi@@ l serv@@ ice , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stron@@ ger society in the way that you do now ."
"And I think an even more wonderful spe@@ ec@@ h , which I &apos;m going to read a big ch@@ un@@ k of , which su@@ ms up what I said at the beginning about beli@@ ev@@ ing there is more to life than money , and more that we should try and measure than money ."
"And it is R@@ ob@@ er@@ t K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy &apos;s beautiful descri@@ p@@ tion of why gr@@ oss national produc@@ t cap@@ tures so little : It &quot; &quot; does not al@@ low for the health of our children , the qu@@ ality of their education , or the jo@@ y of their play ."
"It does not in@@ clu@@ de the beau@@ ty of our po@@ e@@ try or the stre@@ ng@@ th of our marri@@ ages , the intelligence of our public de@@ b@@ ate ."
"It meas@@ ures ne@@ ither our w@@ it n@@ or our cour@@ age , ne@@ ither our w@@ is@@ dom n@@ or our learning , ne@@ ither our comp@@ assion n@@ or our dev@@ oti@@ on to our country ."
"It meas@@ ures everything , in sh@@ ort , ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; A@@ g@@ ain , a s@@ enti@@ ment that was so no@@ ble and beauti@@ fully put 40 years ago , and a beautiful dre@@ am 40 years ago , but now with the huge adv@@ anc@@ es in information technology , with the massive changes in behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics , with all that we know about how you adv@@ ance well@@ -@@ being , that if we com@@ b@@ ine those in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts of giving power to people , and using information to make that possible , and using the in@@ sight of going with the gra@@ in of human nature , while at the same time , understanding why people be@@ have in the way they do ,"
it is a dre@@ am more easy to reali@@ ze today than it was when it was made in that beautiful spe@@ ec@@ h 40 years ago .
Thank you .

Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
It &apos;s an In@@ di@@ an story about an In@@ di@@ an woman and her j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
Let me beg@@ in with my parents .
I &apos;m a produc@@ t of this vi@@ si@@ on@@ ary mother and father .
"M@@ any years ago , when I was born in the &apos; 5@@ 0s — &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s didn &apos;t b@@ el@@ ong to girls in India ."
They b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ed to bo@@ ys .
"They b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ed to bo@@ ys who would jo@@ in business and in@@ her@@ it business from parents , and girls would be dol@@ led up to get marri@@ ed ."
"M@@ y family , in my c@@ ity , and almost in the country , was uni@@ qu@@ e ."
"We were four of us , not one , and fort@@ un@@ ately no bo@@ ys ."
We were four girls and no bo@@ ys .
And my parents were part of a lan@@ ded pro@@ per@@ ty family .
"M@@ y father de@@ fied his own gr@@ and@@ father , almost to the point of dis@@ in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , because he decided to educ@@ ate all four of us ."
He s@@ ent us to one of the best scho@@ ols in the c@@ ity and gave us the best education .
"As I &apos;ve said , when we &apos;re born , we don &apos;t cho@@ ose our parents , and when we go to school , we don &apos;t cho@@ ose our school ."
Ch@@ il@@ dren don &apos;t cho@@ ose a school .
They just get the school which parents cho@@ ose for them .
So this is the f@@ ound@@ ation time which I got .
"I gre@@ w up like this , and so did my other three sist@@ ers ."
"And my father used to say at that time , &quot; I &apos;m going to sp@@ read all my four d@@ augh@@ ters in four cor@@ n@@ ers of the world . &quot;"
"I don &apos;t know if he really me@@ ant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened ."
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
"One is a B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh , another is an American and the thir@@ d is a C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an ."
So we are four of us in four cor@@ n@@ ers of the world .
"And since I said they &apos;re my ro@@ le mo@@ d@@ els , I fol@@ lowed two things which my father and mother gave me ."
"One , they said , &quot; &quot; L@@ i@@ fe is on an in@@ cl@@ ine ."
"You e@@ ither go up , or you come down . &quot; &quot; And the second thing , which has st@@ ay@@ ed with me , which bec@@ ame my philosop@@ h@@ y of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad ."
"O@@ ut of 100 , 90 are your cre@@ ation ."
They &apos;re good . They &apos;re your cre@@ ation . E@@ n@@ jo@@ y it .
"If they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your cre@@ ation . L@@ ear@@ n from it ."
T@@ en are nat@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ s@@ ent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
"It &apos;s like a death of a rel@@ ative , or a c@@ y@@ cl@@ one , or a h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e , or an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ."
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respon@@ d to the sit@@ u@@ ation .
But that respon@@ se comes out of those 90 poin@@ ts .
"S@@ ince I &apos;m a produc@@ t of this philosop@@ h@@ y , of 90 / 10 , and secon@@ dly , &quot; &quot; life on an in@@ cl@@ ine , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the way I gre@@ w up to be val@@ u@@ ing what I got ."
"I &apos;m a produc@@ t of op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties , r@@ are op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and the &apos; 6@@ 0s , which girls didn &apos;t get , and I was consci@@ ous of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something uni@@ qu@@ e ."
"Because all of my best school friends were getting dol@@ led up to get marri@@ ed with a lot of do@@ wr@@ y , and here I was with a ten@@ n@@ is r@@ ac@@ k@@ et and going to school and doing all kinds of extr@@ ac@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ ular acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
I thought I must tell you this .
"Wh@@ y I said this , is the bac@@ k@@ ground ."
This is what comes next .
"I jo@@ ined the In@@ di@@ an P@@ o@@ li@@ ce S@@ er@@ v@@ ice as a t@@ ough woman , a woman with in@@ de@@ f@@ ati@@ g@@ able st@@ am@@ ina , because I used to run for my ten@@ n@@ is ti@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"But I jo@@ ined the In@@ di@@ an P@@ o@@ li@@ ce S@@ er@@ v@@ ice , and then it was a new patter@@ n of po@@ lic@@ ing ."
"For me the po@@ lic@@ ing st@@ ood for power to cor@@ rec@@ t , power to pre@@ v@@ ent and power to de@@ t@@ ect ."
This is something like a new defin@@ i@@ tion ever given in po@@ lic@@ ing in India — the power to pre@@ v@@ ent .
"Because norm@@ ally it was always said , power to de@@ t@@ ect , and that &apos;s it , or power to p@@ un@@ ish ."
"But I decided no , it &apos;s a power to pre@@ v@@ ent , because that &apos;s what I learned when I was gro@@ wing up ."
How do I pre@@ v@@ ent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
"So this was how it came into my serv@@ ice , and it was different from the men ."
"I didn &apos;t want to make it different from the men , but it was different , because this was the way I was different ."
And I re@@ defin@@ ed po@@ lic@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts in India .
"I &apos;m going to take you on two j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys , my po@@ lic@@ ing j@@ our@@ ne@@ y and my pri@@ son j@@ our@@ ne@@ y ."
"What you see , if you see the ti@@ t@@ le called &quot; &quot; P@@ M &apos;s c@@ ar hel@@ d . &quot; &quot; This was the first time a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er of India was given a par@@ king tic@@ k@@ et ."
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time in India , and I can tell you , that &apos;s the last time you &apos;re hear@@ ing about it ."
"It &apos;ll never happen again in India , because now it was once and fore@@ ver ."
"And the ru@@ le was , because I was sen@@ si@@ tive , I was comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate , I was very sen@@ si@@ tive to in@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , and I was very pro@@ -@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce ."
"That &apos;s the reason , as a woman , I jo@@ ined the In@@ di@@ an P@@ o@@ li@@ ce S@@ er@@ v@@ ice ."
"I had other op@@ tions , but I didn &apos;t cho@@ ose them ."
So I &apos;m going to move on .
"This is about t@@ ough po@@ lic@@ ing , equ@@ al po@@ lic@@ ing ."
"Now I was known as &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to li@@ st@@ en . &quot; &quot; So I was s@@ ent to all in@@ disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate pos@@ t@@ ings , pos@@ t@@ ings which others would say no ."
I now went to a pri@@ son assi@@ gn@@ ment as a poli@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er .
N@@ orm@@ ally poli@@ ce off@@ ic@@ ers don &apos;t want to do pri@@ son .
"They s@@ ent me to pri@@ son to loc@@ k me up , thinking , &quot; &quot; Now there will be no car@@ s and no V@@ I@@ P@@ s to be given tic@@ ke@@ ts to ."
Let &apos;s loc@@ k her up . &quot; &quot; Here I got a pri@@ son assi@@ gn@@ ment .
This was a pri@@ son assi@@ gn@@ ment which was one big d@@ en of cri@@ min@@ als .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , it was ."
"But 1@@ 0,000 men , of which only 4@@ 00 were women — 1@@ 0,000 — 9@@ ,000 pl@@ us about 6@@ 00 were men ."
"T@@ er@@ r@@ ori@@ sts , r@@ ap@@ ists , bur@@ g@@ lars , g@@ ang@@ st@@ ers — some of them I &apos;d s@@ ent to j@@ a@@ il as a poli@@ ce off@@ ic@@ er outside ."
And then how did I de@@ al with them ?
"The first day when I went in , I didn &apos;t know how to look at them ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pr@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I looked at the group , I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pr@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; They saw me as a young , sh@@ ort woman w@@ ear@@ ing a p@@ a@@ than su@@ it . I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pr@@ ay ? &quot; &quot;"
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Do you pr@@ ay ? Do you want to pr@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , let &apos;s pr@@ ay . &quot; &quot; I p@@ ra@@ y@@ ed for them , and things started to change ."
This is a vi@@ su@@ al of education inside the pri@@ son .
"F@@ ri@@ ends , this has never happened , where everybody in the pri@@ son stu@@ dies ."
I started this with comm@@ unity sup@@ port .
G@@ over@@ n@@ ment had no bu@@ d@@ get .
"It was one of the fin@@ est , lar@@ g@@ est v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ism in any pri@@ son in the world ."
This was in@@ i@@ ti@@ ated in D@@ el@@ h@@ i pri@@ son .
You see one s@@ am@@ ple of a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er teach@@ ing a cl@@ ass .
Th@@ ese are hund@@ re@@ ds of cl@@ ass@@ es .
"@@ N@@ ine to el@@ even , every pri@@ s@@ on@@ er went into the education program — the same d@@ en in which they thought they would put me be@@ h@@ ind the b@@ ar and things would be for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten ."
We con@@ ver@@ ted this into an as@@ h@@ ra@@ m — from a pri@@ son to an as@@ h@@ ra@@ m through education .
I think that &apos;s the big@@ ger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers were pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers . T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers were v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers .
B@@ oo@@ ks came from d@@ on@@ ated scho@@ ol@@ bo@@ o@@ ks .
St@@ ati@@ on@@ ery was d@@ on@@ ated .
"E@@ very@@ thing was d@@ on@@ ated , because there was no bu@@ d@@ get of education for the pri@@ son ."
"Now if I &apos;d not done that , it would have been a h@@ ell@@ hole ."
That &apos;s the second l@@ and@@ mar@@ k .
"I want to show you some mom@@ ents of history in my j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , which probably you would never ever get to see any@@ where in the world ."
"One , the num@@ bers you &apos;ll never get to see ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , this con@@ cept ."
"This was a me@@ d@@ it@@ ation program inside the pri@@ son of over 1@@ ,000 pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers ."
One thous@@ and pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers who s@@ at in me@@ d@@ it@@ ation .
This was one of the most cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous ste@@ ps I took as a pri@@ son govern@@ or .
And this is what trans@@ form@@ ed .
"You want to know more about this , go and see this f@@ il@@ m , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ ing T@@ i@@ me , D@@ o@@ ing V@@ i@@ p@@ ass@@ an@@ a . &quot; &quot; You will hear about it , and you will love it ."
"And wr@@ ite to me on K@@ ir@@ an@@ B@@ e@@ di@@ .@@ co@@ m , and I &apos;ll respon@@ d to you ."
Let me show you the next sli@@ de .
"I took the same con@@ cept of min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , because , why did I bring me@@ d@@ it@@ ation into the In@@ di@@ an pri@@ son ?"
Because cri@@ me is a produc@@ t of a dist@@ or@@ ted mind .
It was dist@@ or@@ tion of mind which needed to be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed to control .
"@@ Not by pre@@ ach@@ ing , not by t@@ elling , not by read@@ ing , but by ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing your mind ."
"I took the same thing to the poli@@ ce , because poli@@ ce , equ@@ ally , were pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers of their min@@ ds , and they f@@ el@@ t as if it was &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; they , &quot; &quot; and that the people don &apos;t co@@ oper@@ ate ."
This worked .
This is a fe@@ ed@@ back bo@@ x called a pe@@ ti@@ tion bo@@ x .
"This is a con@@ cept which I int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to li@@ st@@ en to com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts , li@@ st@@ en to g@@ ri@@ ev@@ anc@@ es ."
This was a mag@@ ic bo@@ x .
This was a sen@@ si@@ tive bo@@ x .
This is how a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er dre@@ w how they f@@ el@@ t about the pri@@ son .
"If you see somebody in the bl@@ ue — ye@@ ah , this guy — he was a pri@@ s@@ on@@ er , and he was a teacher ."
"And you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . There was no time to wa@@ st@@ e ."
Let me w@@ ra@@ p it up .
"I &apos;m curren@@ tly into mov@@ em@@ ents , mov@@ em@@ ents of education of the under@@ -@@ ser@@ ved children , which is thousands — India is all about thousands ."
S@@ econ@@ dly is about the an@@ ti@@ -@@ cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion mov@@ ement in India .
"That &apos;s a big way we , as a small group of acti@@ vi@@ sts , have d@@ ra@@ f@@ ted an om@@ bu@@ d@@ sm@@ an b@@ ill for the government of India ."
"F@@ ri@@ ends , you will hear a lot about it ."
"That &apos;s the mov@@ ement at the moment I &apos;m dri@@ ving , and that &apos;s the mov@@ ement and am@@ bi@@ tion of my life ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
R@@ ight now you have a mo@@ vi@@ e play@@ ing inside your head .
It &apos;s an ama@@ zing m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ tr@@ ack mo@@ vi@@ e .
"It has 3@@ D vi@@ sion and sur@@ r@@ ound sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hear@@ ing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it ."
Y@@ our mo@@ vi@@ e has sm@@ ell and ta@@ st@@ e and tou@@ ch .
"It has a sense of your body , p@@ ain , h@@ un@@ ger , org@@ as@@ ms ."
"It has emoti@@ ons , an@@ ger and happiness ."
"It has me@@ mor@@ ies , like sc@@ en@@ es from your chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od play@@ ing before you ."
And it has this con@@ st@@ ant v@@ o@@ ic@@ e@@ over n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative in your stre@@ am of consci@@ ous thinking .
A@@ t the heart of this mo@@ vi@@ e is you experienc@@ ing all this direc@@ tly .
"This mo@@ vi@@ e is your stre@@ am of consciousness , the sub@@ ject of experience of the mind and the world ."
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is one of the fundamental fac@@ ts of human exist@@ ence .
E@@ ach of us is consci@@ ous .
"We all have our own in@@ ner mo@@ vi@@ e , you and you and you ."
There &apos;s nothing we know about more direc@@ tly .
"A@@ t le@@ ast , I know about my consciousness direc@@ tly ."
I can &apos;t be certain that you gu@@ ys are consci@@ ous .
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness also is what makes life wor@@ th living .
"If we wer@@ en &apos;t consci@@ ous , nothing in our lives would have mean@@ ing or value ."
"But at the same time , it &apos;s the most my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on in the universe ."
Why are we consci@@ ous ?
Why do we have these in@@ ner mo@@ vi@@ es ?
"Wh@@ y are@@ n &apos;t we just ro@@ b@@ ots who process all this in@@ put , pro@@ duce all that out@@ put , without experienc@@ ing the in@@ ner mo@@ vi@@ e at all ?"
"R@@ ight now , no@@ body kno@@ ws the ans@@ w@@ ers to those questions ."
"I &apos;m going to su@@ gg@@ est that to in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate consciousness into science , some ra@@ dic@@ al ideas may be needed ."
S@@ ome people say a science of consciousness is im@@ possible .
"S@@ ci@@ ence , by its nature , is ob@@ jec@@ tive ."
"C@@ on@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , by its nature , is sub@@ jec@@ tive ."
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
"For much of the 20@@ th century , that view hel@@ d s@@ way ."
"@@ P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts stu@@ died behavior ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts stu@@ died the brain ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , and no@@ body even m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed consciousness ."
"E@@ ven 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scienti@@ fic work on consciousness ."
"Now , about 20 years ago , all that beg@@ an to change ."
N@@ e@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts like F@@ r@@ anc@@ is C@@ r@@ ick and phys@@ ici@@ sts like R@@ o@@ ger P@@ en@@ r@@ ose said now is the time for science to att@@ ack consciousness .
"And since then , there &apos;s been a real expl@@ os@@ i@@ on , a f@@ low@@ ering of scienti@@ fic work on consciousness ."
And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .
But it also has some fundamental lim@@ it@@ ations so far .
"The cen@@ ter@@ piece of the science of consciousness in rec@@ ent years has been the sear@@ ch for cor@@ rel@@ ations , cor@@ rel@@ ations between certain are@@ as of the brain and certain st@@ ates of consciousness ."
We saw some of this kind of work from N@@ anc@@ y K@@ an@@ wi@@ sh@@ er and the wonderful work she pres@@ en@@ ted just a few minutes ago .
"Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain are@@ as that go along with the consci@@ ous experience of seeing fac@@ es or of feel@@ ing p@@ ain or of feel@@ ing happy ."
But this is still a science of cor@@ rel@@ ations .
It &apos;s not a science of ex@@ plan@@ ations .
"We know that these brain are@@ as go along with certain kinds of consci@@ ous experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do ."
"I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence is ans@@ w@@ ering some of the questions we want ans@@ wer@@ ed about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain are@@ as do and what they cor@@ rel@@ ate with ."
"But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems ."
No kno@@ ck on the neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts .
There are no tru@@ ly easy problems with consciousness .
Why is there this in@@ ner sub@@ jec@@ tive mo@@ vi@@ e ?
"R@@ ight now , we don &apos;t really have a be@@ ad on that ."
"And you might say , let &apos;s just give neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence a few years ."
"It &apos;ll turn out to be another em@@ er@@ g@@ ent ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on like tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ ams , like h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ es , like life , and we &apos;ll fig@@ ure it out ."
"Now , I &apos;m a scienti@@ fic materi@@ ali@@ st at heart ."
"I want a scienti@@ fic theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I b@@ ang@@ ed my head against the w@@ all looking for a theory of consciousness in pu@@ re@@ ly physical ter@@ ms that would work ."
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of imp@@ as@@ se here .
"We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great cha@@ in of ex@@ plan@@ ation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics expl@@ ain@@ s ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y , ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y expl@@ ain@@ s bio@@ logy , bio@@ logy expl@@ ain@@ s parts of psycho@@ logy ."
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to f@@ it into this picture .
"O@@ n the one hand , it &apos;s a dat@@ um that we &apos;re consci@@ ous ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate it into our scienti@@ fic view of the world ."
"So I think consciousness right now is a kind of an@@ om@@ al@@ y , one that we need to in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate into our view of the world , but we don &apos;t yet see how ."
"F@@ ac@@ ed with an an@@ om@@ al@@ y like this , ra@@ dic@@ al ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that in@@ i@@ ti@@ ally seem crazy before we can come to g@@ ri@@ ps with consciousness scienti@@ f@@ ically ."
"Now , there are a few can@@ di@@ d@@ ates for what those crazy ideas might be ."
"M@@ y fri@@ end D@@ an D@@ en@@ ne@@ t@@ t , who &apos;s here today , has one ."
H@@ is crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
The whole idea of the in@@ ner sub@@ jec@@ tive mo@@ vi@@ e inv@@ ol@@ ves a kind of ill@@ u@@ sion or con@@ fu@@ sion .
"A@@ c@@ tually , all we &apos;ve got to do is explain the ob@@ jec@@ tive fun@@ c@@ tions , the behavi@@ ors of the brain , and then we &apos;ve expl@@ ained everything that nee@@ ds to be expl@@ ained ."
"Well I say , more power to him ."
That &apos;s the kind of ra@@ dic@@ al idea that we need to expl@@ ore if you want to have a pu@@ re@@ ly re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist bra@@ in@@ -@@ bas@@ ed theory of consciousness .
"A@@ t the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too cl@@ ose to simply den@@ ying the dat@@ um of consciousness to be s@@ atis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"In the time re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing , I want to expl@@ ore two crazy ideas that I think may have some prom@@ ise ."
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ sts sometimes take some as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of the universe as fundamental building bloc@@ ks : space and time and mass .
"They pos@@ t@@ ul@@ ate fundamental la@@ ws gover@@ ning them , like the la@@ ws of gra@@ vity or of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics ."
Th@@ ese fundamental pro@@ per@@ ties and la@@ ws are@@ n &apos;t expl@@ ained in ter@@ ms of anything more bas@@ ic .
"R@@ a@@ ther , they &apos;re taken as pri@@ mi@@ tive , and you build up the world from there ."
"Now sometimes , the li@@ st of fundam@@ ent@@ als exp@@ ands ."
"In the 19@@ th century , M@@ ax@@ well fi@@ gu@@ red out that you can &apos;t explain electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a in ter@@ ms of the exist@@ ing fundam@@ ent@@ als — space , time , mass , N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on &apos;s la@@ ws — so he pos@@ t@@ ul@@ ated fundamental la@@ ws of electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m and pos@@ t@@ ul@@ ated elec@@ tri@@ c char@@ ge as a fundamental el@@ ement that those la@@ ws gover@@ n ."
I think that &apos;s the sit@@ u@@ ation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
"If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in ter@@ ms of the exist@@ ing fundam@@ ent@@ als — space , time , mass , char@@ ge — then as a matter of logi@@ c , you need to exp@@ and the li@@ st ."
"The natural thing to do is to pos@@ t@@ ul@@ ate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building bloc@@ k of nature ."
This doesn &apos;t mean you su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly can &apos;t do science with it .
This op@@ ens up the way for you to do science with it .
"What we then need is to study the fundamental la@@ ws gover@@ ning consciousness , the la@@ ws that con@@ n@@ ect consciousness to other fundam@@ ent@@ als : space , time , mass , physical pro@@ cess@@ es ."
P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ sts sometimes say that we want fundamental la@@ ws so simple that we could wr@@ ite them on the front of a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t .
We want to find fundamental la@@ ws so simple we could wr@@ ite them on the front of a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t .
"We don &apos;t know what those la@@ ws are yet , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re after ."
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be univers@@ al .
E@@ very system might have some de@@ gre@@ e of consciousness .
E@@ ven a ph@@ ot@@ on has some de@@ gre@@ e of consciousness .
The idea is not that ph@@ ot@@ ons are intellig@@ ent or thinking .
"It &apos;s not that a ph@@ ot@@ on is wr@@ ac@@ ked with ang@@ st because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w@@ w , I &apos;m always bu@@ z@@ zing around ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"I never get to s@@ low down and sm@@ ell the r@@ os@@ es . &quot; &quot; No , not like that ."
"But the thought is maybe ph@@ ot@@ ons might have some el@@ ement of ra@@ w , sub@@ jec@@ tive feel@@ ing , some pri@@ mi@@ tive pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or to consciousness ."
This may sound a bit k@@ oo@@ k@@ y to you .
"I mean , why would any@@ one think such a crazy thing ?"
"S@@ ome moti@@ v@@ ation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental ."
"If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to sup@@ pose that it might be univers@@ al too , the way they are ."
"It &apos;s also wor@@ th not@@ ing that al@@ though the idea seems coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive to us , it &apos;s much less coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive to people from different cul@@ tures , where the human mind is seen as much more contin@@ u@@ ous with nature ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there &apos;s information pro@@ cess@@ ing , there &apos;s consciousness ."
"C@@ om@@ ple@@ x information pro@@ cess@@ ing , like in a human , comple@@ x consciousness ."
"S@@ im@@ ple information pro@@ cess@@ ing , simple consciousness ."
"A really exc@@ iting thing is in rec@@ ent years a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , G@@ i@@ u@@ li@@ o T@@ on@@ on@@ i , has taken this kind of theory and develop@@ ed it ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously with a ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al theory ."
"He has a ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al measure of information in@@ te@@ gr@@ ation which he call@@ s ph@@ i , meas@@ uring the amount of information in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated in a system ."
And he sup@@ pos@@ es that ph@@ i goes along with consciousness .
"In a m@@ ouse , me@@ di@@ um de@@ gre@@ e of information in@@ te@@ gr@@ ation , still pretty si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , pretty ser@@ i@@ ous amount of consciousness ."
"But as you go down to wor@@ ms , m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ es , partic@@ les , the amount of ph@@ i f@@ all@@ s off ."
"The amount of information in@@ te@@ gr@@ ation f@@ all@@ s off , but it &apos;s still n@@ on@@ -@@ z@@ er@@ o ."
"In eff@@ ect , he &apos;s pro@@ pos@@ ing a fundamental la@@ w of consciousness : high ph@@ i , high consciousness ."
A@@ no@@ ther fin@@ al moti@@ v@@ ation is that pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ism might help us to in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate consciousness into the physical world .
P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ sts and philosop@@ h@@ ers have often ob@@ ser@@ ved that physics is cur@@ i@@ ously ab@@ str@@ act .
"It descri@@ b@@ es the struc@@ ture of reality using a b@@ un@@ ch of equ@@ ations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that under@@ li@@ es it ."
"As S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king pu@@ ts it , what pu@@ ts the fir@@ e into the equ@@ ations ?"
"Well , on the pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist view , you can leave the equ@@ ations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be descri@@ b@@ ing the flu@@ x of consciousness ."
"That &apos;s what physics really is ul@@ tim@@ ately doing , descri@@ b@@ ing the flu@@ x of consciousness ."
"O@@ n this view , it &apos;s consciousness that pu@@ ts the fir@@ e into the equ@@ ations ."
"O@@ n that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t d@@ ang@@ le outside the physical world as some kind of extra ."
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
S@@ ome of these may be coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive .
"I used to think I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t e@@ at anything which is consci@@ ous , so ther@@ e@@ fore I should be ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an ."
"Now , if you &apos;re a pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist and you take that view , you &apos;re going to go very h@@ un@@ gr@@ y ."
"So I think when you think about it , this t@@ ends to trans@@ fig@@ ure your vie@@ ws , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as what mat@@ ters for e@@ th@@ ical pur@@ pos@@ es and moral consi@@ der@@ ations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the de@@ gre@@ e and the comple@@ x@@ ity of consciousness ."
"What about the arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally intellig@@ ent system in the mo@@ vi@@ e &quot; &quot; H@@ er , &quot; &quot; S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a ?"
I@@ s she consci@@ ous ?
"If that &apos;s right , it ra@@ is@@ es pretty ser@@ i@@ ous e@@ th@@ ical is@@ su@@ es about both the e@@ th@@ ics of develop@@ ing intellig@@ ent computer syst@@ ems and the e@@ th@@ ics of tur@@ ning them off ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole grou@@ ps , the planet ."
D@@ o@@ es C@@ an@@ ad@@ a have its own consciousness ?
"I don &apos;t know the answer to that question , but I think it &apos;s at le@@ ast one wor@@ th taking ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ kay , so this pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist vi@@ sion , it is a ra@@ dic@@ al one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s cor@@ rec@@ t ."
"I &apos;m actually more con@@ fi@@ dent about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s univers@@ al ."
"If not , well , this is the har@@ d@@ est problem perhaps in science and philosop@@ h@@ y ."
We can &apos;t exp@@ ect to sol@@ ve it over@@ night .
But I do think we &apos;re going to fig@@ ure it out even@@ tually .
"@@ Un@@ der@@ st@@ anding consciousness is a real k@@ ey , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves ."
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I bec@@ ame interest@@ ed in understanding what con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to a life that was wor@@ th living .
And fin@@ ally I en@@ ded up en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing psycho@@ logy by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a sk@@ i res@@ ort in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y my@@ self , because the s@@ now had m@@ el@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a mo@@ vi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers that there was to be a pres@@ ent@@ ation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Z@@ ur@@ ich , and it was about fl@@ ying s@@ au@@ c@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
"And I thought , well , since I can &apos;t go to the mo@@ vi@@ es , at le@@ ast I will go for f@@ ree to li@@ st@@ en to fl@@ ying s@@ au@@ c@@ ers ."
And the man who tal@@ ked at that even@@ ing l@@ ec@@ ture was very interesting .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad of talking about little gre@@ en men , he tal@@ ked about how the psy@@ ch@@ e of the Euro@@ pe@@ ans had been tr@@ au@@ m@@ ati@@ zed by the war , and now they &apos;re pro@@ jec@@ ting fl@@ ying s@@ au@@ c@@ ers into the sk@@ y ."
He tal@@ ked about how the m@@ and@@ al@@ as of an@@ ci@@ ent H@@ in@@ d@@ u religi@@ on were kind of pro@@ jec@@ ted into the sk@@ y as an att@@ emp@@ t to re@@ g@@ ain some sense of order after the cha@@ o@@ s of war .
And this se@@ em@@ ed very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his bo@@ o@@ ks after that l@@ ec@@ ture .
"And that was C@@ ar@@ l J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose name or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psycho@@ logy and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a typ@@ ical res@@ ult that many people have pres@@ en@@ ted , and there are many vari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for inst@@ ance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ v@@ ey@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the pers@@ onal income , on a sc@@ ale that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate for in@@ fl@@ ation , has more than d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed , almost tri@@ pl@@ ed , in that per@@ i@@ od ."
"But you find ess@@ enti@@ ally the same res@@ ults , nam@@ ely , that after a certain bas@@ ic point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars abo@@ ve the min@@ im@@ um po@@ ver@@ ty level — incre@@ ases in material well@@ -@@ being don &apos;t seem to aff@@ ect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the l@@ ack of bas@@ ic res@@ our@@ ces , material res@@ our@@ ces , con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material res@@ our@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my resear@@ ch has been fo@@ c@@ used more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tri@@ ed to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our norm@@ al experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those stu@@ dies about 40 years ago , I beg@@ an to look at cre@@ ative people — first arti@@ sts and scienti@@ sts , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th ess@@ enti@@ ally sp@@ en@@ ding their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t exp@@ ect e@@ ither fa@@ me or fort@@ un@@ e , but which made their life mean@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the lead@@ ing comp@@ os@@ ers of American mu@@ sic back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 p@@ ages long .
But this little ex@@ cer@@ p@@ t is a very good sum@@ mar@@ y of what he was saying d@@ uring the inter@@ view .
And it descri@@ b@@ es how he fe@@ els when comp@@ os@@ ing is going well .
And he says by descri@@ b@@ ing it as an ec@@ st@@ atic state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ec@@ st@@ as@@ y &quot; &quot; in G@@ re@@ e@@ k me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it bec@@ ame ess@@ enti@@ ally an anal@@ o@@ gy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordin@@ ary every@@ day r@@ out@@ ines .
So ec@@ st@@ as@@ y is ess@@ enti@@ ally a ste@@ p@@ ping into an al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ les of human achi@@ ev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , G@@ re@@ ece , the H@@ in@@ d@@ u civi@@ li@@ zation , or the M@@ ay@@ as , or E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their ec@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the t@@ em@@ pl@@ es they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the cir@@ c@@ us@@ es , the aren@@ as , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"Th@@ ese are the re@@ ma@@ ins of civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated , more or@@ der@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this aren@@ a , which is built like a G@@ re@@ e@@ k am@@ p@@ hi@@ the@@ at@@ re , is a place for ec@@ st@@ as@@ y also ."
We are par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He nee@@ ds just a piece of p@@ ap@@ er where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ ounds that had not exist@@ ed before in that particular com@@ b@@ in@@ ation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er did in her impro@@ vi@@ s@@ ation , a new reality — that is , a moment of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y — he en@@ ters that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so int@@ en@@ se an experience that it fe@@ els almost as if he didn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
And that s@@ ounds like a kind of a r@@ om@@ an@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation .
"But actually , our ner@@ v@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of pro@@ cess@@ ing more than about 1@@ 10 b@@ its of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 b@@ its per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ ol@@ ved in this completely eng@@ aging process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ en@@ tion left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body fe@@ els , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s h@@ un@@ gr@@ y or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , his i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ en@@ tion , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that requ@@ i@@ res a lot of con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation , and at the same time to feel that he ex@@ ists ."
So exist@@ ence is t@@ em@@ por@@ ar@@ ily su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seems to be mo@@ ving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two wee@@ ks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t comp@@ ose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s t@@ elling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this au@@ tom@@ atic , sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s descri@@ b@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tr@@ ained and who has develop@@ ed tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tru@@ ism in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of tech@@ n@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ knowledge im@@ mer@@ sion in a particular field .
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s or mu@@ sic , it ta@@ kes that long to be able to beg@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the mu@@ sic just f@@ lo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people descri@@ bed this as a sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous f@@ low that I called this t@@ y@@ pe of experience the &quot; &quot; f@@ low experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different re@@ al@@ ms .
"For inst@@ ance , a po@@ et descri@@ b@@ es it in this form ."
This is by a stud@@ ent of m@@ ine who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the lead@@ ing wr@@ it@@ ers and po@@ ets in the United States .
"And it descri@@ b@@ es the same eff@@ or@@ t@@ less , sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this ec@@ st@@ atic state ."
"This po@@ et descri@@ b@@ es it as op@@ en@@ ing a do@@ or that f@@ lo@@ at@@ s in the sk@@ y — a very sim@@ il@@ ar descri@@ p@@ tion to what A@@ l@@ ber@@ t E@@ inste@@ in gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of relati@@ vity , when he was str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ vi@@ ties .
"For inst@@ ance , this is another stud@@ ent of m@@ ine , S@@ us@@ an J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a , who did work with some of the lead@@ ing ath@@ le@@ t@@ es in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic sk@@ ater , the same ess@@ ential descri@@ p@@ tion of the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ o@@ logy of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes au@@ tom@@ atic@@ ally , if you mer@@ ge yourself with the mu@@ sic , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most rec@@ ent book I wr@@ ote , called &quot; &quot; G@@ ood B@@ us@@ iness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very suc@@ cess@@ ful and very e@@ th@@ ical , very soci@@ ally respon@@ sible ."
You see that these people de@@ fine suc@@ cess as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these suc@@ cess@@ ful and respon@@ sible C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be suc@@ cess@@ ful if you want a mean@@ ing@@ ful and suc@@ cess@@ ful job ."
A@@ n@@ it@@ a R@@ o@@ d@@ dic@@ k is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"S@@ he is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ o@@ dy S@@ ho@@ p , the natural cos@@ me@@ tics king ."
It &apos;s kind of a p@@ assion that comes from doing the best and having f@@ low while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ bu@@ k@@ a , who was at that time star@@ ting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a produc@@ t — they didn &apos;t have a produc@@ t , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to est@@ ab@@ lish a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of techno@@ logical in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , be aw@@ are of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s cont@@ ent ."
I couldn &apos;t impro@@ ve on this as a good example of how f@@ low en@@ ters the wor@@ k@@ place .
"Now , when we do stu@@ dies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ in@@ ic@@ an mon@@ ks , to bl@@ ind n@@ un@@ s , to H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an c@@ lim@@ bers , to N@@ av@@ a@@ j@@ o sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the culture , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of education or wh@@ at@@ ever , there are these se@@ ven condi@@ tions that seem to be there when a person is in f@@ low ."
"There &apos;s this fo@@ c@@ us that , once it becom@@ es int@@ en@@ se , le@@ ads to a sense of ec@@ st@@ as@@ y , a sense of cl@@ ar@@ ity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get im@@ me@@ di@@ ate fe@@ ed@@ back ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something lar@@ ger ."
"And once the condi@@ tions are present , what you are doing becom@@ es wor@@ th doing for its own sa@@ ke ."
"In our stu@@ dies , we re@@ present the every@@ day life of people in this simple s@@ che@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very preci@@ se@@ ly , actually , because we give people electr@@ on@@ ic p@@ ag@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of chall@@ en@@ ge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can est@@ ab@@ lish an average , which is the center of the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That would be your mean level of chall@@ en@@ ge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predic@@ t fa@@ ir@@ ly ac@@ cur@@ ately when you will be in f@@ low , and it will be when your chall@@ eng@@ es are high@@ er than average and sk@@ ills are high@@ er than average ."
"And you may be doing things very differ@@ ently from other people , but for everyone that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l , that are@@ a there , will be when you are doing what you really like to do — play the pi@@ an@@ o , be with your best fri@@ end , perhaps work , if work is what pro@@ vi@@ des f@@ low for you ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less posi@@ tive .
A@@ r@@ ous@@ al is still good because you are over@@ -@@ chall@@ eng@@ ed there .
"Y@@ our sk@@ ills are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move into f@@ low fa@@ ir@@ ly eas@@ ily by just develop@@ ing a little more sk@@ ill ."
"So , ar@@ ous@@ al is the are@@ a where most people learn from , because that &apos;s where they &apos;re pu@@ shed be@@ y@@ on@@ d their com@@ for@@ t z@@ one and to en@@ ter that — going back to f@@ low — then they devel@@ op high@@ er sk@@ ills ."
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ fort@@ able , but not very exc@@ ited ."
It &apos;s not very chall@@ eng@@ ing any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter f@@ low from control , you have to increase the chall@@ eng@@ es ."
So those two are ide@@ al and comple@@ m@@ ent@@ ary are@@ as from which f@@ low is easy to go into .
The other com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of chall@@ en@@ ge and sk@@ ill become progres@@ si@@ vely less op@@ tim@@ al .
R@@ el@@ ax@@ ation is fine — you still feel O@@ K .
"B@@ o@@ re@@ dom beg@@ ins to be very a@@ ver@@ sive and ap@@ ath@@ y becom@@ es very ne@@ g@@ ative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your sk@@ ills , there &apos;s no chall@@ en@@ ge ."
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in ap@@ ath@@ y ."
"The lar@@ g@@ est single con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tor to that experience is wat@@ ch@@ ing tel@@ evi@@ sion ; the next one is being in the b@@ ath@@ room , sit@@ ting ."
"E@@ ven though sometimes wat@@ ch@@ ing tel@@ evi@@ sion about se@@ ven to eight percent of the time is in f@@ low , but that &apos;s when you cho@@ ose a program you really want to wat@@ ch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ d@@ ress — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that f@@ low chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of chall@@ en@@ ge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously without any adv@@ ice , but un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our m@@ and@@ ate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : W@@ el@@ come to TED .
R@@ ic@@ hard B@@ ran@@ son : Thank you very much . The first TED has been great .
CA : H@@ ave you m@@ et any@@ one interesting ?
"RB : Well , the n@@ ice thing about TED is everybody &apos;s interesting ."
"I was very gl@@ ad to see G@@ ol@@ die H@@ a@@ wn , because I had an ap@@ o@@ logy to make to her ."
I &apos;d had d@@ in@@ ner with her about two years ago and I &apos;d — she had this big we@@ d@@ ding r@@ ing and I put it on my fin@@ ger and I couldn &apos;t get it off .
"And I went home to my wi@@ fe that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman &apos;s big , massive , big we@@ d@@ ding r@@ ing on my fin@@ ger ."
"And , any@@ way , the next mor@@ ning we had to go along to the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ er and get it c@@ ut off ."
So — ( Laughter ) — so ap@@ o@@ logi@@ es to G@@ ol@@ die .
CA : That &apos;s pretty good .
"So , we &apos;re going to put up some sli@@ des of some of your comp@@ an@@ ies here ."
You &apos;ve started one or two in your time .
"So , you know , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds — I gu@@ ess it all started with a mag@@ az@@ ine called S@@ tu@@ dent ."
"And then , y@@ es , all these other ones as well . I mean , how do you do this ?"
"RB : I read all these sort of TED in@@ struc@@ tions : you must not talk about your own business , and this , and now you ask me ."
"So I sup@@ pose you &apos;re not going to be able to k@@ ick me off the st@@ age , since you asked the question ."
( Laughter ) CA : It dep@@ ends what the answer is though .
"RB : No , I mean , I think I learned early on that if you can run one comp@@ any , you can really run any comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"I mean , comp@@ an@@ ies are all about fin@@ ding the right people , insp@@ ir@@ ing those people , you know , d@@ ra@@ wing out the best in people ."
"And I just love learning and I &apos;m incredi@@ bly in@@ qu@@ i@@ si@@ tive and I love taking on , you know , the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o and trying to turn it up@@ side down ."
So I &apos;ve seen life as one long learning process .
"And if I see — you know , if I f@@ ly on somebody else &apos;s a@@ ir@@ line and find the experience is not a ple@@ as@@ ant one , which it wasn &apos;t , 2@@ 1 years ago , then I &apos;d think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of a@@ ir@@ line that I &apos;d like to f@@ ly on ."
"And so , you know , so got one secon@@ d@@ hand 7@@ 4@@ 7 from B@@ o@@ e@@ ing and gave it a go ."
"C@@ A : Well , that was a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re thing , because you made this move that a lot of people ad@@ vi@@ sed you was crazy ."
"And in fact , in a way , it almost took down your emp@@ ire at one point ."
"I had a con@@ vers@@ ation with one of the inv@@ est@@ ment b@@ an@@ k@@ ers who , at the time when you basically so@@ ld V@@ ir@@ g@@ in R@@ ec@@ or@@ ds and inv@@ est@@ ed he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly in V@@ ir@@ g@@ in A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , and his view was that you were tr@@ ad@@ ing , you know , the world &apos;s f@@ our@@ th bi@@ gg@@ est rec@@ or@@ d comp@@ any for the tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ fi@@ f@@ th bi@@ gg@@ est a@@ ir@@ line and that you were out of your mind ."
Why did you do that ?
"RB : Well , I think that there &apos;s a very th@@ in divi@@ ding line between suc@@ cess and fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"And I think if you start a business without fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al bac@@ king , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that divi@@ ding line ."
We had — we were being att@@ ac@@ ked by B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh A@@ ir@@ ways .
"They were trying to put our a@@ ir@@ line out of business , and they lau@@ n@@ ched what &apos;s become known as the di@@ r@@ ty tr@@ ic@@ ks cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n ."
And I reali@@ zed that the whole emp@@ ire was likely to come cr@@ as@@ h@@ ing down un@@ less I ch@@ i@@ p@@ ped in a ch@@ i@@ p .
"And in order to prot@@ ect the j@@ ob@@ s of the people who worked for the a@@ ir@@ line , and prot@@ ect the j@@ ob@@ s of the people who worked for the rec@@ or@@ d comp@@ any , I had to s@@ ell the family j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry to prot@@ ect the a@@ ir@@ line ."
"C@@ A : P@@ os@@ t-@@ N@@ ap@@ ster , you &apos;re looking like a bit of a gen@@ i@@ us , actually , for that as well ."
"RB : Y@@ eah , as it tur@@ ned out , it pro@@ ved to be the right move ."
"But , ye@@ ah , it was sa@@ d at the time , but we mo@@ ved on ."
"C@@ A : Now , you use the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in br@@ and a lot and it seems like you &apos;re getting sy@@ ner@@ gy from one thing to the other ."
What does the br@@ and st@@ and for in your head ?
"RB : Well , I like to think it st@@ ands for qu@@ ality , that you know , if somebody comes across a V@@ ir@@ g@@ in comp@@ any , they — CA : They are qu@@ ality , R@@ ic@@ hard . C@@ ome on now , everyone says qu@@ ality . S@@ p@@ ir@@ it ?"
"RB : No , but I was going to move on this ."
We have a lot of fu@@ n and I think the people who work for it en@@ jo@@ y it .
"As I say , we go in and s@@ ha@@ ke up other in@@ du@@ stri@@ es , and I think , you know , we do it differ@@ ently and I think that in@@ du@@ stri@@ es are not quite the same as a res@@ ult of V@@ ir@@ g@@ in att@@ ac@@ king the market ."
"C@@ A : I mean , there are a few lau@@ n@@ ch@@ es you &apos;ve done where the br@@ and maybe ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t worked quite as well ."
"I mean , V@@ ir@@ g@@ in B@@ ri@@ des — what happened there ?"
( Laughter ) R@@ B : We couldn &apos;t find any cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) CA : I was actually also cur@@ i@@ ous why — I think you mis@@ sed an op@@ port@@ unity with your con@@ dom@@ s lau@@ n@@ ch . You called it M@@ ates .
"I mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in br@@ and for that as well ?"
"A@@ in &apos;t vir@@ g@@ in no longer , or something ."
"RB : A@@ g@@ ain , we may have had problems fin@@ ding cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
"I mean , we had — often , when you lau@@ n@@ ch a comp@@ any and you get cu@@ st@@ om@@ er com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts , you know , you can de@@ al with them ."
"But about three months after the lau@@ n@@ ch of the con@@ dom comp@@ any , I had a le@@ tter , a com@@ pl@@ ain@@ t , and I s@@ at down and wr@@ ote a long le@@ tter back to this l@@ ad@@ y ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing pro@@ fu@@ se@@ ly ."
"But ob@@ vi@@ ously , there wasn &apos;t a lot I could do about it ."
"And then six months later , or n@@ ine months after the problem had taken , I got this de@@ ligh@@ t@@ ful le@@ tter with a picture of the b@@ ab@@ y as@@ king if I &apos;d be go@@ d@@ father , which I bec@@ ame ."
"So , it all worked out well ."
CA : R@@ e@@ ally ? You should have br@@ ought a picture . That &apos;s wonderful .
R@@ B : I should have .
"C@@ A : So , just help us with some of the num@@ bers ."
"I mean , what are the num@@ bers on this ?"
"I mean , how big is the group over@@ all ?"
How much — what &apos;s the t@@ ot@@ al re@@ ven@@ ue ?
"RB : It &apos;s about 2@@ 5 billion dollars now , in t@@ ot@@ al ."
CA : And how many emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ?
"RB : A@@ b@@ out 5@@ 5@@ ,000 ."
"C@@ A : So , you &apos;ve been ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed in vari@@ ous ways at vari@@ ous times and never wor@@ r@@ ying about pu@@ tting your di@@ gn@@ ity on the line or anything like that ."
What was that ? W@@ as that real ?
"RB : Y@@ eah . We were lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing a me@@ g@@ ast@@ ore in Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es , I think ."
"@@ No , I mean , I think — CA : But is that your ha@@ ir ?"
R@@ B : No .
CA : What was that one ?
R@@ B : D@@ rop@@ ping in for te@@ a .
CA : O@@ K .
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : A@@ h , that was quite fu@@ n . That was a wonderful car@@ -@@ bo@@ at in which — CA : O@@ h , that c@@ ar that we — actually we — it was a TE@@ D@@ ster ev@@ ent there , I think ."
"I@@ s that — could you still p@@ ause on that one actually , for a minut@@ e ?"
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : It &apos;s a t@@ ough job , isn &apos;t it ?"
"C@@ A : I mean , it is a t@@ ough job ."
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en I first came to America , I used to try this with emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es as well and they kind of — they have these different r@@ ul@@ es over here , it &apos;s very stran@@ ge ."
"RB : I know , I have — the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers say you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t do things like that , but — CA : I mean , spe@@ a@@ king of which , tell us about — R@@ B : &quot; &quot; P@@ am@@ my &quot; &quot; we lau@@ n@@ ched , you know — mi@@ sta@@ k@@ en@@ ly thought we could take on C@@ oc@@ a@@ -@@ C@@ ol@@ a , and we lau@@ n@@ ched a col@@ a bot@@ t@@ le called &quot; &quot; The P@@ am@@ my &quot; &quot; and it was shap@@ ed a bit like P@@ am@@ el@@ a A@@ n@@ der@@ son ."
"But the tr@@ ou@@ ble is , it ke@@ p@@ t on ti@@ p@@ ping over , but — ( Laughter ) CA : D@@ es@@ ig@@ ned by P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pe St@@ ar@@ ck perhaps ?"
R@@ B : O@@ f course .
"C@@ A : So , we &apos;ll just run a couple more pic@@ tures here . V@@ ir@@ g@@ in B@@ ri@@ des . V@@ ery n@@ ice ."
"And , O@@ K , so stop there . This was — you had some aw@@ ard I think ?"
"RB : Y@@ eah , well , 2@@ 5 years ear@@ li@@ er , we &apos;d lau@@ n@@ ched the S@@ e@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols &apos; &quot; &quot; G@@ od S@@ ave The Q@@ u@@ een , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d cer@@ tain@@ ly never exp@@ ected that 2@@ 5 years later — that she &apos;d actually k@@ night us ."
"But some@@ how , she must have had a for@@ ge@@ t@@ ful mem@@ ory , I think ."
"C@@ A : Well , G@@ od sa@@ ved her and you got your just re@@ ward ."
"D@@ o you like to be called S@@ ir R@@ ic@@ hard , or how ?"
R@@ B : N@@ o@@ body &apos;s ever called me S@@ ir R@@ ic@@ hard .
"O@@ c@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally in America , I hear people saying S@@ ir R@@ ic@@ hard and think there &apos;s some S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are@@ an play taking place ."
But no@@ where else any@@ way .
CA : O@@ K . So can you use your k@@ ni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood for anything or is it just ...
"RB : No . I sup@@ pose if you &apos;re having problems getting a bo@@ o@@ king in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant or something , that might be wor@@ th using it ."
"C@@ A : You know , it &apos;s not R@@ ic@@ hard B@@ ran@@ son . It &apos;s S@@ ir R@@ ic@@ hard B@@ ran@@ son ."
R@@ B : I &apos;ll go get the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary to use it .
CA : O@@ K . So let &apos;s look at the space thing .
"I think , with us , we &apos;ve got a vide@@ o that sho@@ ws what you &apos;re up to , and V@@ ir@@ g@@ in G@@ al@@ ac@@ tic up in the air . ( V@@ ide@@ o ) So that &apos;s the B@@ er@@ t R@@ ut@@ an desig@@ ned sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p ?"
"RB : Y@@ eah , it &apos;ll be ready in — well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months ex@@ ten@@ sive te@@ st@@ ing ."
"And then 2@@ 4 months from now , people will be able to take a ri@@ de into space ."
CA : So this inter@@ i@@ or is P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pe St@@ ar@@ c@@ ke desig@@ ned ?
"RB : P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pe has done the — ye@@ ah , quite a bit of it : the lo@@ go@@ s and he &apos;s building the space st@@ ation in New M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o ."
"And basically , he &apos;s just taken an ey@@ e and the space st@@ ation will be one gi@@ ant ey@@ e , so when you &apos;re in space , you ought to be able to see this massive ey@@ e looking up at you ."
"And when you land , you &apos;ll be able to go back into this gi@@ ant ey@@ e ."
But he &apos;s an ab@@ sol@@ ute gen@@ i@@ us when it comes to desig@@ n .
CA : But you didn &apos;t have him desig@@ n the eng@@ ine ?
"RB : P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ pe is quite er@@ r@@ atic , so I think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to desig@@ n the eng@@ ine , no ."
CA : He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago .
"RB : Y@@ eah ? No , he is a — CA : Well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ."
"But , I pers@@ on@@ ally found it wonderful ."
"RB : He &apos;s a wonderful en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ ast , which is why I love him . But ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : So , now , you &apos;ve always had this expl@@ or@@ ation bu@@ g in you ."
H@@ ave you ever re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed that ?
R@@ B : M@@ any times .
"I mean , I think with the bal@@ lo@@ on@@ ing and bo@@ ating ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions we &apos;ve done in the past ."
"Well , I got pul@@ led out of the se@@ a I think six times by he@@ lic@@ op@@ ters , so — and each time , I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect to come home to tell the tal@@ e ."
"So in those mom@@ ents , you cer@@ tain@@ ly won@@ der what you &apos;re doing up there or — CA : What was the cl@@ os@@ est you got to — when did you think , this is it , I might be on my way out ?"
"RB : Well , I think the bal@@ lo@@ on adv@@ en@@ tures were — each one was , each one , actually , I think we came cl@@ ose ."
"And , I mean , first of all we — no@@ body had actually cr@@ os@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic in a ho@@ t air bal@@ lo@@ on before , so we had to build a ho@@ t air bal@@ lo@@ on that was cap@@ able of fl@@ ying in the j@@ et stre@@ am , and we wer@@ en &apos;t quite sure , when a bal@@ lo@@ on actually got into the j@@ et stre@@ am , whether it would actually survi@@ ve the 200 , 2@@ 20 mil@@ es an h@@ our w@@ in@@ ds that you can find up there ."
"And so , just the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al li@@ ft off from Su@@ g@@ ar@@ lo@@ a@@ f to cr@@ oss the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , as we were pu@@ sh@@ ing into the j@@ et stre@@ am , this en@@ orm@@ ous bal@@ lo@@ on — the top of the bal@@ lo@@ on en@@ ded up going at a couple of hundred mil@@ es an h@@ our , the cap@@ su@@ le that we were in at the bot@@ tom was going at maybe two mil@@ es an h@@ our , and it just took off ."
And it was like ho@@ l@@ ding on@@ to a thous@@ and h@@ or@@ ses .
"And we were just cr@@ os@@ sing every fin@@ ger , p@@ ra@@ ying that the bal@@ lo@@ on would hold together , which , fort@@ un@@ ately , it did ."
"But the ends of all those bal@@ lo@@ on tri@@ ps were , you know — something se@@ em@@ ed to go wrong every time , and on that particular oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on , the more experienc@@ ed bal@@ lo@@ on@@ ist who was with me j@@ um@@ ped , and left me ho@@ l@@ ding on for de@@ ar life ."
"( Laughter ) CA : D@@ id he tell you to j@@ um@@ p , or he just said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m out of here ! &quot; &quot; and ..@@ ."
"RB : No , he told me j@@ um@@ p , but once his we@@ ight had g@@ one , the bal@@ lo@@ on just sho@@ t up to 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et and I ..@@ ."
CA : And you insp@@ i@@ red an I@@ an M@@ c@@ E@@ w@@ an no@@ v@@ el I think with that .
"RB : Y@@ eah . No , I put on my oxy@@ g@@ en m@@ ask and st@@ ood on top of the bal@@ lo@@ on , with my par@@ ach@@ ute , looking at the s@@ w@@ ir@@ ling cl@@ ou@@ ds b@@ el@@ ow , trying to pl@@ uc@@ k up my cour@@ age to j@@ um@@ p into the N@@ or@@ th S@@ e@@ a , which — and it was a very , very , very lon@@ ely few mom@@ ents ."
"But , any@@ way , we man@@ ag@@ ed to survi@@ ve it ."
CA : D@@ id you j@@ um@@ p ? O@@ r it came down in the end ?
"RB : Well , I knew I had about half an h@@ our &apos;s fu@@ el left , and I also knew that the chan@@ ces were that if I j@@ um@@ ped , I would only have a couple of minutes of life left ."
So I c@@ lim@@ bed back into the cap@@ su@@ le and just des@@ per@@ ately tri@@ ed to make sure that I was making the right deci@@ sion .
"And wr@@ ote some not@@ es to my family . And then c@@ lim@@ bed back up again , looked down at those cl@@ ou@@ ds again , c@@ lim@@ bed back into the cap@@ su@@ le again ."
"And then fin@@ ally , just thought , there &apos;s a better way ."
"I &apos;ve got , you know , this en@@ orm@@ ous bal@@ lo@@ on abo@@ ve me , it &apos;s the bi@@ gg@@ est par@@ ach@@ ute ever , why not use it ?"
"And so I man@@ ag@@ ed to f@@ ly the bal@@ lo@@ on down through the cl@@ ou@@ ds , and about 50 fe@@ et , before I h@@ it the se@@ a , thre@@ w my@@ self over ."
"And the bal@@ lo@@ on h@@ it the se@@ a and went sho@@ ot@@ ing back up to 1@@ 0,000 fe@@ et without me ."
But it was a wonderful feel@@ ing being in that water and — CA : What did you wr@@ ite to your family ?
"RB : J@@ ust what you would do in a sit@@ u@@ ation like that : just I love you very much . And I &apos;d already wr@@ it@@ ten them a le@@ tter before going on this tri@@ p , which — just in case anything had happened ."
"But fort@@ un@@ ately , they never had to use it ."
CA : Y@@ our comp@@ an@@ ies have had incredi@@ ble P@@ R value out of these her@@ o@@ ics .
"The years — and until I st@@ op@@ ped looking at the p@@ ol@@ ls , you were sort of re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as this great her@@ o in the U.@@ K@@ . and el@@ se@@ where ."
"And c@@ y@@ n@@ ics might say , you know , this is just a smar@@ t business guy doing what it ta@@ kes to ex@@ ec@@ ute his particular st@@ y@@ le of mar@@ ke@@ ting ."
How much was the P@@ R value part of this ?
"RB : Well , of course , the P@@ R exper@@ ts said that as an a@@ ir@@ line ow@@ ner , the last thing you should be doing is he@@ ad@@ ing off in bal@@ lo@@ ons and bo@@ at@@ s , and cr@@ as@@ h@@ ing into the se@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) CA : They have a point , R@@ ic@@ hard ."
"RB : I@@ n fact , I think our a@@ ir@@ line took a ful@@ l p@@ age ad at the time saying , you know , come on , R@@ ic@@ hard , there are better ways of cr@@ os@@ sing the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) CA : T@@ o do all this , you must have been a gen@@ i@@ us from the ge@@ t-@@ go , right ?"
"RB : Well , I won &apos;t con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t that ."
"( Laughter ) CA : O@@ K , this isn &apos;t exactly har@@ d@@ b@@ all . O@@ K ."
D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t — wer@@ en &apos;t you just ter@@ ri@@ ble at school ?
R@@ B : I was d@@ ys@@ le@@ x@@ ic . I had no understanding of scho@@ ol@@ work wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
I cer@@ tain@@ ly would have fa@@ il@@ ed I@@ Q te@@ sts .
And it was one of the reas@@ ons I left school when I was 15 years old .
"And if I — if I &apos;m not interest@@ ed in something , I don &apos;t gr@@ as@@ p it ."
"As somebody who &apos;s d@@ ys@@ le@@ x@@ ic , you also have some quite bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"I mean , for inst@@ ance , I &apos;ve had to — you know , I &apos;ve been run@@ ning the lar@@ g@@ est group of pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies in Euro@@ pe , but ha@@ ven &apos;t been able to know the difference between net and gr@@ oss ."
And so the bo@@ ard me@@ et@@ ings have been f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"( Laughter ) And so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?"
"And gener@@ ally , the people would say , o@@ h , well that &apos;s bad news ."
"C@@ A : But just to cl@@ ari@@ f@@ y , the 2@@ 5 billion dollars is gr@@ oss , right ? That &apos;s gr@@ oss ?"
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : Well , I hope it &apos;s net actually , having — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;ve got it right ."
"C@@ A : No , tr@@ ust me , it &apos;s gr@@ oss ."
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : So , when I tur@@ ned 50 , somebody took me outside the bo@@ ar@@ d@@ room and said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok R@@ ic@@ hard , here &apos;s a — let me d@@ ra@@ w on a di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"@@ Here &apos;s a net in the se@@ a , and the f@@ ish have been pul@@ led from the se@@ a into this net ."
"And that &apos;s the prof@@ its you &apos;ve got left over in this little net , everything else is e@@ at@@ en . &quot; &quot; And I fin@@ ally worked it all out ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : But , I mean , at school — so as well as being , you know , doing pretty mis@@ er@@ ably ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ically , but you were also the cap@@ tain of the cr@@ ic@@ k@@ et and fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all te@@ ams ."
"So you were kind of a — you were a natural lead@@ er , but just a bit of a ... W@@ ere you a re@@ be@@ l then , or how would you ..@@ ."
"RB : Y@@ eah , I think I was a bit of a ma@@ ver@@ ick and — but I ... And I was , ye@@ ah , I was fort@@ un@@ ately good at sp@@ ort , and so at le@@ ast I had something to exc@@ el at , at school ."
CA : And some bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re things happened just ear@@ li@@ er in your life .
"I mean , there &apos;s the story about your mother al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly d@@ um@@ ping you in a field , ag@@ ed four , and saying &quot; &quot; O@@ K , wal@@ k home . &quot; &quot; D@@ id this really happen ?"
"RB : She was , you know , she f@@ el@@ t that we needed to st@@ and on our own two fe@@ et from an early age ."
"So she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be ar@@ re@@ sted for , such as pu@@ sh@@ ing us out of the c@@ ar , and t@@ elling us to find our own way to G@@ ran@@ n@@ y &apos;s , about five mil@@ es before we actually got there ."
"And making us go on wonderful , long bi@@ ke ri@@ des ."
And we were never al@@ lowed to wat@@ ch tel@@ evi@@ sion and the like .
CA : But is there a ri@@ s@@ k here ?
"I mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are we@@ al@@ th@@ y , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this di@@ le@@ m@@ m@@ a about how you bring them up ."
"D@@ o you look at the curren@@ t generation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too co@@ dd@@ led , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to ra@@ ise a generation of pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ ed ..@@ ."
"RB : No , I think if you &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing up kids , you just want to s@@ mother them with love and p@@ ra@@ ise and en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m ."
So I don &apos;t think you can m@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ co@@ ddle your kids too much really .
"C@@ A : You didn &apos;t turn out too bad , I have to say , I &apos;m ..@@ ."
"Y@@ our he@@ ad@@ ma@@ ster said to you — I mean he found you kind of an en@@ ig@@ m@@ a at your school — he said , you &apos;re e@@ ither going to be a m@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ ire or go to pri@@ son , and I &apos;m not sure which ."
Wh@@ ich of those happened first ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ B : Well , I &apos;ve done both . I think I went to pri@@ son first ."
I was actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted under two quite an@@ ci@@ ent ac@@ ts in the U.@@ K@@ .
I was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted under the 18@@ 8@@ 9 V@@ ener@@ e@@ al D@@ i@@ se@@ ases A@@ c@@ t and the 19@@ 1@@ 6 In@@ dec@@ ent A@@ d@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments A@@ c@@ t .
"O@@ n the first oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on , for m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease in public , which — we had a center where we would help young people who had problems ."
And one of the problems young people have is v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease .
And there &apos;s an an@@ ci@@ ent la@@ w that says you can &apos;t actually men@@ tion the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease or prin@@ t it in public .
"So the poli@@ ce kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or , and told us they were going to ar@@ rest us if we car@@ ri@@ ed on m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease ."
"We changed it to social dise@@ ases and people came along with ac@@ ne and sp@@ ots , but no@@ body came with V@@ D any more ."
"So , we put it back to V@@ D and prom@@ p@@ tly got ar@@ re@@ sted ."
"And then sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , &quot; &quot; N@@ ever M@@ ind the B@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks , Here &apos;s the S@@ e@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols , &quot; &quot; the word b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks , the poli@@ ce decided was a ru@@ de word and so we were ar@@ re@@ sted for using the word b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks on the S@@ e@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols &apos; al@@ bu@@ m ."
"And J@@ o@@ h@@ n M@@ or@@ tim@@ er , the play@@ w@@ right , de@@ f@@ en@@ ded us ."
And he asked if I could find a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tics exper@@ t to come up with a different defin@@ i@@ tion of the word b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks .
"And so I ran@@ g up N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ha@@ m U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity , and I asked to talk to the prof@@ ess@@ or of l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tics ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , b@@ ol@@ loc@@ ks is not a — has nothing to do with b@@ all@@ s wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ."
"It &apos;s actually a n@@ ic@@ k@@ name given to pri@@ est@@ s in the e@@ igh@@ te@@ en@@ th century . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he went , &quot; &quot; F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , I &apos;m a pri@@ est my@@ self . &quot; &quot; And so I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you mind coming to the cour@@ t ? &quot; &quot; And he said he &apos;d be de@@ ligh@@ ted . And I said — and he said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ould you like me to we@@ ar my do@@ g coll@@ ar ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , defin@@ it@@ ely . P@@ le@@ ase . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) CA : That &apos;s great ."
"RB : So our k@@ ey w@@ it@@ ness ar@@ gu@@ ed that it was actually &quot; N@@ ever M@@ ind the P@@ ri@@ est , Here &apos;s the S@@ e@@ x P@@ ist@@ ols . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) And the ju@@ dge found us — rel@@ uc@@ t@@ an@@ tly found us not gu@@ il@@ ty , so ... ( Laughter )"
CA : That is ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ e@@ ous .
"( Applause ) So ser@@ i@@ ously , is there a dark side ?"
"A lot of people would say there &apos;s no way that someone could put together this incredi@@ ble coll@@ ec@@ tion of bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es without k@@ ni@@ f@@ ing a few people in the back , you know , doing some u@@ g@@ ly things ."
You &apos;ve been ac@@ c@@ used of being ru@@ th@@ less .
There was a n@@ ast@@ y bio@@ grap@@ h@@ y wr@@ it@@ ten about you by someone .
I@@ s any of it true ? I@@ s there an el@@ ement of tru@@ th in it ?
"RB : I don &apos;t actually think that the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe of a bus@@ in@@ ess@@ person tre@@ ad@@ ing all over people to get to the top , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , works ."
"I think if you treat people well , people will come back and come back for more ."
And I think all you have in life is your re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation and it &apos;s a very small world .
"And I actually think that the best way of becom@@ ing a suc@@ cess@@ ful business lead@@ er is de@@ al@@ ing with people fa@@ ir@@ ly and well , and I like to think that &apos;s how we run V@@ ir@@ g@@ in ."
"C@@ A : And what about the people who love you and who see you sp@@ en@@ ding — you keep getting cau@@ ght up in these new pro@@ jects , but it almost fe@@ els like you &apos;re ad@@ dic@@ ted to lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing new stuff ."
"You get exc@@ ited by an idea and , k@@ ap@@ ow !@@ "
"I mean , do you think about life bal@@ ance ?"
How do your family feel about each time you ste@@ p into something big and new ?
"RB : I also believe that being a father &apos;s incredi@@ bly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on ho@@ li@@ day , I go on ho@@ li@@ day with them ."
And so we sp@@ end a very good sort of three months away together .
"Y@@ es , I &apos;ll , you know , be in tou@@ ch . We &apos;re very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , we have this t@@ iny little is@@ land in the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an and we can — so I can take them there and we can bring friends , and we can play together , but I can also keep in tou@@ ch with what &apos;s going on ."
CA : You started talking in rec@@ ent years about this ter@@ m cap@@ it@@ ali@@ st phil@@ an@@ th@@ ropy .
What is that ?
R@@ B : C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ ism has been pro@@ ven to be a system that works .
"You know , the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative , comm@@ un@@ ism , has not worked ."
"But the problem with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism is extre@@ me we@@ al@@ th ends up in the h@@ ands of a few people , and ther@@ e@@ fore extre@@ me respon@@ si@@ bility , I think , goes with that we@@ al@@ th ."
"And I think it &apos;s important that the in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , who are in that fort@@ un@@ ate posi@@ tion , do not end up com@@ pe@@ ting for big@@ ger and big@@ ger bo@@ at@@ s , and big@@ ger and big@@ ger car@@ s , but , you know , use that money to e@@ ither create new j@@ ob@@ s or to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le is@@ su@@ es around the world ."
"C@@ A : And what are the is@@ su@@ es that you wor@@ ry about most , care most about , want to turn your res@@ our@@ ces to@@ ward ?"
"RB : Well , there &apos;s — I mean there &apos;s a lot of is@@ su@@ es ."
"I mean global war@@ m@@ ing cer@@ tain@@ ly is a massive thre@@ at to man@@ kind and we are pu@@ tting a lot of time and energy into , A , trying to come up with al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative fu@@ els and , B , you know , we just lau@@ n@@ ched this pri@@ ze , which is really a pri@@ ze in case we don &apos;t get an answer on al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative fu@@ els , in case we don &apos;t actually man@@ age to get the car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions c@@ ut down qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , and in case we go through the ti@@ p@@ ping point ."
We need to try to enc@@ our@@ age people to come up with a way of extr@@ ac@@ ting car@@ b@@ on out of the Earth &apos;s at@@ m@@ osp@@ here .
"And we just — you know , there wer@@ en &apos;t really people working on that before , so we wanted people to try to — all the best bra@@ ins in the world to start thinking about that , and also to try to extr@@ act the me@@ th@@ an@@ e out of the Earth &apos;s at@@ m@@ osp@@ here as well ."
"And actually , we &apos;ve had about 1@@ 5@@ ,000 people f@@ ill in the for@@ ms saying they want to give it a go ."
"And so we only need one , so we &apos;re ho@@ pe@@ ful ."
CA : And you &apos;re also working in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a on a couple of pro@@ jects ?
"RB : Y@@ es , I mean , we &apos;ve got — we &apos;re se@@ tting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word ."
"We &apos;re trying to — maybe we &apos;ll change it — but any@@ way , it &apos;s a war room to try to co@@ ordin@@ ate all the att@@ ack that &apos;s going on in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , all the different social problems in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and try to look at best pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es ."
"So , for inst@@ ance , there &apos;s a doc@@ tor in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a that &apos;s found that if you give a mother an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al dru@@ gs at 2@@ 4 wee@@ ks , when she &apos;s pre@@ gn@@ ant , that the b@@ ab@@ y will not have H@@ I@@ V when it &apos;s born ."
And so dis@@ se@@ min@@ ating that information to around the rest of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a is important .
"C@@ A : The war room s@@ ounds , it s@@ ounds po@@ wer@@ ful and dr@@ am@@ atic ."
"And is there a ri@@ s@@ k that the kind of the business her@@ o@@ es of the W@@ est get so exc@@ ited about — I mean , they &apos;re used to having an idea , getting stuff done , and they believe prof@@ oun@@ dly in their ability to make a difference in the world ."
"I@@ s there a ri@@ s@@ k that we go to places like A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a and say , we &apos;ve got to fi@@ x this problem and we can do it , I &apos;ve got all these b@@ illions of dollars , you know , d@@ a , d@@ a , d@@ a — here &apos;s the big idea . And kind of take a much more comple@@ x sit@@ u@@ ation and actually end up making a m@@ ess of it . Do you wor@@ ry about that ?"
"RB : Well , first of all , on this particular sit@@ u@@ ation , we &apos;re actually — we &apos;re working with the government on it ."
"I mean , T@@ ha@@ b@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i &apos;s had his problems with ac@@ cep@@ ting H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S are rel@@ ated , but this is a way , I think , of him t@@ ac@@ k@@ ling this problem and instead of the world cri@@ tici@@ zing him , it &apos;s a way of working with him , with his government ."
"It &apos;s important that if people do go to A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years ."
It &apos;s got to be consi@@ st@@ ent .
But I think business lead@@ ers can bring their ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ i@@ al know@@ -@@ how and help govern@@ ments appro@@ ach things s@@ ligh@@ tly differ@@ ently .
"For inst@@ ance , we &apos;re se@@ tting up cl@@ in@@ ics in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a where we &apos;re going to be giving f@@ ree an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al dru@@ gs , f@@ ree T@@ B tre@@ at@@ ment and f@@ ree m@@ al@@ ari@@ a tre@@ at@@ ment ."
"But we &apos;re also trying to make them self-@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ ing cl@@ in@@ ics , so that people p@@ ay for some other as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts ."
"C@@ A : I mean a lot of c@@ y@@ n@@ ics say about someone like yourself , or B@@ ill G@@ ates , or wh@@ at@@ ever , that this is really being — it &apos;s almost dri@@ ven by some sort of des@@ ire again , you know , for the right im@@ age , for gu@@ il@@ t av@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ance and not like a real phil@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic inst@@ inc@@ t ."
What would you say to them ?
"RB : Well , I think that everybody — people do things for a whole vari@@ e@@ ty of different reas@@ ons and I think that , you know , when I &apos;m on me de@@ ath@@ bed , I will want to feel that I &apos;ve made a difference to other people &apos;s lives ."
"And that may be a self@@ ish thing to think , but it &apos;s the way I &apos;ve been br@@ ought up ."
"I think if I &apos;m in a posi@@ tion to ra@@ dic@@ ally change other people &apos;s lives for the better , I should do so ."
CA : How old are you ?
R@@ B : I &apos;m 5@@ 6 .
"C@@ A : I mean , the psycho@@ logi@@ st E@@ ri@@ k E@@ ri@@ k@@ son says that — as I understand him and I &apos;m a t@@ ot@@ al am@@ ate@@ ur — but that d@@ uring 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s people are dri@@ ven by this des@@ ire to grow and that &apos;s where they get their ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ."
"@@ 5@@ 0s , 6@@ 0s , the mo@@ de of oper@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ts more to the qu@@ est for w@@ is@@ dom and a sear@@ ch for le@@ g@@ acy ."
"I mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the grow@@ th p@@ ha@@ ses , you &apos;re still doing these incredi@@ ble new pl@@ ans ."
"@@ How much do you think about le@@ g@@ acy , and what would you like your le@@ g@@ acy to be ?"
R@@ B : I don &apos;t think I think too much about le@@ g@@ acy .
"I mean , I like to — you know , my gr@@ and@@ mother li@@ ved to 1@@ 0@@ 1 , so ho@@ pe@@ fully I &apos;ve got another 30 or 40 years to go ."
"@@ No , I just want to live life to its ful@@ l ."
"You know , if I can make a difference , I hope to be able to make a difference ."
"And I think one of the posi@@ tive things at the moment is you &apos;ve got S@@ er@@ g@@ ey and L@@ ar@@ ry from G@@ oo@@ g@@ le , for inst@@ ance , who are good friends ."
"And , th@@ ank G@@ od , you &apos;ve got two people who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely care about the world and with that kind of we@@ al@@ th ."
"If they had that kind of we@@ al@@ th and they didn &apos;t care about the world , it would be very wor@@ r@@ ying ."
And you know they &apos;re going to make a h@@ ell of a difference to the world .
And I think it &apos;s important that people in that kind of posi@@ tion do make a difference .
"C@@ A : Well , R@@ ic@@ hard , when I was star@@ ting off in business , I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of — I thought that business people were sup@@ posed to just be ru@@ th@@ less and that that was the only way you could have a chan@@ ce of suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding ."
"And you actually did insp@@ ire me . I looked at you , I thought , well , he &apos;s made it . M@@ ay@@ be there is a different way ."
"So I would like to th@@ ank you for that insp@@ ir@@ ation , and for coming to TED today . Thank you ."
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
So I want to take you on a tri@@ p to an ali@@ en world .
"And it &apos;s not a tri@@ p that requ@@ i@@ res ligh@@ t-@@ years of tra@@ v@@ el , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defin@@ ed by light ."
So it &apos;s a li@@ tt@@ le@@ -@@ ap@@ preci@@ ated fact that most of the anim@@ als in our o@@ ce@@ an make light .
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my care@@ er stud@@ ying this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence .
I study it because I think understanding it is cri@@ tical to understanding life in the o@@ ce@@ an where most bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence oc@@ cur@@ s .
I also use it as a to@@ ol for vi@@ su@@ ali@@ zing and tr@@ ac@@ king p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion .
But m@@ os@@ tly I &apos;m en@@ tr@@ anc@@ ed by it .
"S@@ ince my my first di@@ ve in a de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ ving sub@@ mer@@ sible , when I went down and tur@@ ned out the ligh@@ ts and saw the fi@@ re@@ works dis@@ pl@@ ays , I &apos;ve been a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence j@@ un@@ k@@ y ."
"But I would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were t@@ ot@@ ally in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate to the t@@ ask ."
I needed some way to share the experience direc@@ tly .
And the first time I fi@@ gu@@ red out that way was in this little sing@@ le@@ -@@ person sub@@ mer@@ sible called D@@ e@@ ep R@@ over .
"This next vide@@ o c@@ li@@ p , you &apos;re going to see how we s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ated the bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence ."
And the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a trans@@ ect scre@@ en that is about a me@@ ter across .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : I@@ n front of the su@@ b , a m@@ ess scre@@ en will come into cont@@ act with the so@@ f@@ t-@@ bo@@ died cre@@ atures of the de@@ ep se@@ a ."
"W@@ ith the su@@ b &apos;s ligh@@ ts s@@ w@@ it@@ ched off , it is possible to see their bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence — the light produc@@ ed when they col@@ li@@ de with the m@@ es@@ h ."
This is the first time it has ever been rec@@ or@@ ded .
E@@ d@@ ith W@@ i@@ d@@ der : So I rec@@ or@@ ded that with an int@@ en@@ si@@ fied vide@@ o cam@@ er@@ a that has about the sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vity of the fully dar@@ k@@ -@@ ad@@ ap@@ ted human ey@@ e .
Wh@@ ich means that really is what you would see if you took a di@@ ve in a sub@@ mer@@ sible .
"But just to try to pro@@ ve that fact to you , I &apos;ve br@@ ought along some bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent plan@@ k@@ t@@ on in what is und@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ dly a fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy att@@ emp@@ t at a live de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation ."
"( Laughter ) So , if we could have the ligh@@ ts down and have it as dark in here as possible , I have a fl@@ ask that has bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent plan@@ k@@ t@@ on in it ."
"And you &apos;ll n@@ ote there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , e@@ ither because they &apos;re de@@ ad — ( Laughter ) or because I need to sti@@ r them up in some way for you to see what bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence really looks like ."
( G@@ as@@ ps ) O@@ op@@ s . S@@ or@@ ry .
( Laughter ) I sp@@ end most of my time working in the dark ; I &apos;m used to that .
O@@ kay .
"So that light was made by a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent d@@ in@@ of@@ l@@ ag@@ ell@@ ate , a sing@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed al@@ g@@ a ."
So why would a sing@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ ell@@ ed al@@ g@@ a need to be able to pro@@ duce light ?
"Well , it us@@ es it to de@@ f@@ end itself from its pre@@ dat@@ ors ."
The fl@@ as@@ h is like a scre@@ am for help .
"It &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m , and just like the al@@ ar@@ m on your c@@ ar or your h@@ ouse , it &apos;s me@@ ant to c@@ ast un@@ wanted att@@ en@@ tion on@@ to the in@@ tru@@ der , ther@@ e@@ by e@@ ither lead@@ ing to his cap@@ ture or sc@@ ar@@ ing him away ."
"There &apos;s a lot of anim@@ als that use this tr@@ ick , for example this black dr@@ ag@@ on@@ f@@ ish ."
It &apos;s got a light org@@ an under its ey@@ e .
It &apos;s got a ch@@ in bar@@ be@@ l .
"It &apos;s got a lot of other light org@@ ans you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a minut@@ e ."
"So we had to cha@@ se this in the sub@@ mer@@ sible for quite some@@ time , because the top spe@@ ed of this f@@ ish is one k@@ not , which was the top spe@@ ed of the sub@@ mer@@ sible ."
"But it was wor@@ th it , because we cau@@ ght it in a speci@@ al cap@@ ture dev@@ ice , br@@ ought it up into the la@@ b on the ship , and then everything on this f@@ ish ligh@@ ts up ."
It &apos;s un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able .
The light org@@ ans under the ey@@ es are fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing .
That ch@@ in bar@@ be@@ l is fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing .
"It &apos;s got light org@@ ans on its b@@ el@@ ly that are fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing , f@@ in ligh@@ ts ."
It &apos;s a scre@@ am for help ; it &apos;s me@@ ant to at@@ tr@@ act att@@ en@@ tion .
It &apos;s ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
And you norm@@ ally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted the l@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence when we bring them up in ne@@ ts .
There &apos;s other ways you can de@@ f@@ end yourself with light .
"For example , this sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p re@@ le@@ ases its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als into the water just the way a s@@ qu@@ id or an oc@@ t@@ op@@ us would re@@ le@@ ase an ink cl@@ ou@@ d ."
This bl@@ in@@ ds or di@@ str@@ ac@@ ts the pre@@ dat@@ or .
This little s@@ qu@@ id is called the fir@@ e sho@@ ot@@ er because of its ability to do this .
"Now it may look like a ta@@ st@@ y mor@@ se@@ l , or a pi@@ g &apos;s head with w@@ ings — ( Laughter ) but if it &apos;s att@@ ac@@ ked , it pu@@ ts out a bar@@ r@@ age of light — in fact , a bar@@ r@@ age of ph@@ ot@@ on t@@ or@@ pe@@ does ."
I just b@@ are@@ ly got the ligh@@ ts out in time for you to be able to see those go@@ b@@ s of light h@@ it@@ ting the trans@@ ect scre@@ en and then just g@@ lowing .
It &apos;s ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
So there &apos;s a lot of anim@@ als in the op@@ en o@@ ce@@ an — most of them that make light .
"And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why ."
"They use it for fin@@ ding food , for at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting mat@@ es , for de@@ f@@ en@@ ding against pre@@ dat@@ ors ."
"But when you get down to the bot@@ tom of the o@@ ce@@ an , that &apos;s where things get really stran@@ ge ."
"And some of these anim@@ als are probably insp@@ ir@@ ation for the things you saw in &quot; &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; &quot; but you don &apos;t have to tra@@ v@@ el to P@@ and@@ or@@ a to see them ."
They &apos;re things like this .
"This is a go@@ l@@ d@@ en cor@@ al , a bus@@ h ."
It gro@@ ws very s@@ low@@ ly .
"In fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3@@ ,000 years old , which is one reason that bot@@ tom tra@@ w@@ ling should not be al@@ lowed ."
The other reason is this ama@@ zing bus@@ h g@@ lo@@ ws .
"So if you br@@ us@@ h up against it , any place you br@@ u@@ shed against it , you get this tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling bl@@ u@@ e-@@ gre@@ en light that &apos;s just bre@@ ath@@ taking ."
And you see things like this .
This looks like something out of a D@@ r@@ . S@@ e@@ us@@ s book — just all man@@ ner of cre@@ atures all over this thing .
And these are fl@@ y@@ tra@@ p an@@ em@@ ones .
"Now if you po@@ ke it , it pul@@ ls in its t@@ ent@@ ac@@ les ."
"But if you keep po@@ king it , it star@@ ts to pro@@ duce light ."
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
"It produc@@ es these str@@ ings of light , pre@@ sum@@ ably as some form of de@@ f@@ en@@ se ."
There are star@@ f@@ ish that can make light .
And there are br@@ it@@ t@@ le stars that pro@@ duce b@@ ands of light that d@@ ance along their ar@@ ms .
"This looks like a pl@@ ant , but it &apos;s actually an anim@@ al ."
And it an@@ ch@@ ors itself in the s@@ and by b@@ lowing up a bal@@ lo@@ on on the end of its st@@ oc@@ k .
"So it can actually hold itself in very str@@ ong curren@@ ts , as you see here ."
"But if we coll@@ ect it very g@@ ently , and we bring it up into the la@@ b and just s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze it at the b@@ ase of the st@@ oc@@ k , it produc@@ es this light that pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ates from stem to the pl@@ u@@ me , chang@@ ing col@@ or as it goes , from gre@@ en to bl@@ ue ."
C@@ ol@@ ori@@ zation and sound effec@@ ts ad@@ ded for you vie@@ wing ple@@ as@@ ure .
( Laughter ) But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a se@@ a p@@ en .
It &apos;s got a br@@ it@@ t@@ le star h@@ it@@ ch@@ ing a ri@@ de .
It &apos;s a gre@@ en s@@ ab@@ er of light .
"And like the one you just saw , it can pro@@ duce these as b@@ ands of light ."
"So if I s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze the b@@ ase , the b@@ ands go from b@@ ase to ti@@ p ."
"If I s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze the ti@@ p , they go from ti@@ p to b@@ ase ."
So what do you think happens if you s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze it in the middle ?
( G@@ as@@ ps ) I &apos;d be very interest@@ ed in your the@@ ories about what that &apos;s about .
"( Laughter ) So there &apos;s a language of light in the de@@ ep o@@ ce@@ an , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re im@@ it@@ ating a lot of these dis@@ pl@@ ays ."
This is an op@@ tical l@@ ure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electr@@ on@@ ic j@@ ell@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
It &apos;s just 1@@ 6 bl@@ ue L@@ E@@ D@@ s that we can program to do different typ@@ es of dis@@ pl@@ ays .
"And we view it with a cam@@ er@@ a system I develop@@ ed called E@@ ye@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ S@@ e@@ a that us@@ es far red light that &apos;s in@@ vi@@ sible to most anim@@ als , so it &apos;s u@@ no@@ b@@ tru@@ sive ."
So I just want to show you some of the respon@@ ses we &apos;ve e@@ lic@@ ited from anim@@ als in the de@@ ep se@@ a .
So the cam@@ er@@ a &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high@@ -@@ res@@ olution .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a b@@ a@@ it bo@@ x with a b@@ un@@ ch of — like the co@@ c@@ k@@ ro@@ ach@@ es of the o@@ ce@@ an — there are is@@ op@@ o@@ ds all over it .
And right in the front is the electr@@ on@@ ic j@@ ell@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
"And when it star@@ ts fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the L@@ E@@ D@@ s that &apos;s fl@@ as@@ h@@ ing very f@@ ast ."
"But as so@@ on as it star@@ ts to fl@@ as@@ h — and it &apos;s going to look big , because it b@@ lo@@ om@@ s on the cam@@ er@@ a — I want you to look right here ."
There &apos;s something small there that respon@@ ds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
"It looks like a little of str@@ ing pe@@ ar@@ ls basically — in fact , three str@@ ings of pe@@ ar@@ ls ."
And this was very consi@@ st@@ ent .
"This was in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ m@@ as at about 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et ."
"We basically have a ch@@ at room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking ."
And I think this is actually a sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p that &apos;s re@@ le@@ as@@ ing its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als into the water .
"But the co@@ ol thing is , we &apos;re talking to it ."
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
"@@ P@@ er@@ s@@ on@@ ally , I think it &apos;s something se@@ x@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) And then fin@@ ally , I want to show you some respon@@ ses that we rec@@ or@@ ded with the world &apos;s first de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ se@@ a we@@ b@@ c@@ am , which we had inst@@ all@@ ed in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey C@@ any@@ on last year ."
We &apos;ve only just be@@ gu@@ n to anal@@ y@@ ze all of this data .
"This is going to be a g@@ lowing s@@ our@@ ce first , which is like bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent bac@@ ter@@ ia ."
And it is an op@@ tical c@@ ue that there &apos;s car@@ ri@@ on on the bot@@ tom of the o@@ ce@@ an .
"So this sc@@ av@@ en@@ ger comes in , which is a gi@@ ant si@@ x@@ g@@ ill sh@@ ar@@ k ."
"And I can &apos;t cl@@ a@@ i@@ m for sure that the op@@ tical s@@ our@@ ce br@@ ought it in , because there &apos;s b@@ a@@ it right there ."
"But if it had been fol@@ lowing the o@@ d@@ or pl@@ u@@ me , it would have come in from the other direc@@ tion ."
And it does actually seem to be trying to e@@ at the electr@@ on@@ ic j@@ ell@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
That &apos;s a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ long gi@@ ant si@@ x@@ g@@ ill sh@@ ar@@ k .
"O@@ kay , so this next one is from the we@@ b@@ c@@ am , and it &apos;s going to be this p@@ in@@ whe@@ el dis@@ play ."
And this is a bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m .
"And that was a H@@ um@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t s@@ qu@@ id , a ju@@ ven@@ ile H@@ um@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t s@@ qu@@ id , about three fe@@ et long ."
"This is at 3@@ ,000 fe@@ et in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey C@@ any@@ on ."
"But if it &apos;s a bur@@ gl@@ ar al@@ ar@@ m , you wouldn &apos;t exp@@ ect it to att@@ ack the j@@ ell@@ y@@ f@@ ish direc@@ tly ."
It &apos;s sup@@ posed to be att@@ ac@@ king what &apos;s att@@ ac@@ king the j@@ ell@@ y@@ f@@ ish .
But we did see a b@@ un@@ ch of respon@@ ses like this .
This guy is a little more cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ative .
"&quot; &quot; H@@ ey , wa@@ it a minut@@ e ."
There &apos;s sup@@ posed to be something else there . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s per@@ sist@@ ent .
He ke@@ e@@ ps coming back .
"And then he goes away for a few secon@@ ds to think about it some more , and thin@@ ks , &quot; M@@ ay@@ be if I come in from a different ang@@ le . &quot;"
( Laughter ) N@@ op@@ e .
"So we are star@@ ting to get a h@@ and@@ le on this , but only just the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings ."
We need more ey@@ es on the process .
"So if any of you ever get a chan@@ ce to take a di@@ ve in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , by all means , c@@ lim@@ b in and take the pl@@ un@@ ge ."
"This is something that should be on everybody &apos;s b@@ uc@@ k@@ et li@@ st , because we live on an o@@ ce@@ an planet ."
"M@@ ore than 90 percent , 9@@ 9 percent , of the living space on our planet is o@@ ce@@ an ."
"It &apos;s a mag@@ ical place f@@ ill@@ ed with bre@@ ath@@ taking light sho@@ ws and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re and won@@ dr@@ ous cre@@ atures , ali@@ en life for@@ ms that you don &apos;t have to tra@@ v@@ el to another planet to see ."
"But if you do take the pl@@ un@@ ge , ple@@ ase remember to turn out the ligh@@ ts ."
"But I war@@ n you , it &apos;s ad@@ dic@@ tive ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s been great , ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t it ?"
I &apos;ve been b@@ lo@@ wn away by the whole thing .
"In fact , I &apos;m le@@ a@@ ving ."
( Laughter ) There have been three them@@ es run@@ ning through the con@@ fer@@ ence which are re@@ lev@@ ant to what I want to talk about .
One is the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary evidence of human cre@@ ati@@ vity in all of the pres@@ ent@@ ations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here .
J@@ ust the vari@@ e@@ ty of it and the ran@@ ge of it .
I have an inter@@ est in education .
"A@@ c@@ tually , what I find is everybody has an inter@@ est in education ."
D@@ on &apos;t you ?
"If you &apos;re at a d@@ in@@ ner par@@ ty , and you say you work in education — A@@ c@@ tually , you &apos;re not often at d@@ in@@ ner par@@ ties , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly ."
"( Laughter ) If you work in education , you &apos;re not asked . ( Laughter )"
"And you &apos;re never asked back , cur@@ i@@ ously . That &apos;s stran@@ ge to me ."
"But if you ask about their education , they p@@ in you to the w@@ all ."
"Because it &apos;s one of those things that goes de@@ ep with people , am I right ?"
"So I have a big inter@@ est in education , and I think we all do ."
"I mean , S@@ i@@ ren@@ a last night was a mar@@ v@@ el , wasn &apos;t she ?"
What you have there is a person of ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ dic@@ ation who found a tal@@ ent .
"And my cont@@ en@@ tion is , all kids have tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous tal@@ ents ."
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about cre@@ ati@@ vity .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"That was it , by the way ."
"Well , I was born ... no . ( Laughter )"
The teacher was f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated .
"But J@@ am@@ es got the part of J@@ os@@ e@@ p@@ h , which we were thr@@ ill@@ ed about ."
We consi@@ der@@ ed this to be one of the le@@ ad parts .
"We had the place cr@@ am@@ m@@ ed ful@@ l of ag@@ ents in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts : &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es R@@ ob@@ in@@ son I@@ S J@@ os@@ e@@ p@@ h ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He didn &apos;t have to spe@@ ak , but you know the bit where the three k@@ ings come in ?"
This really happened .
"If they don &apos;t know , they &apos;ll have a go ."
A@@ m I right ? They &apos;re not fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of being wrong .
I don &apos;t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being cre@@ ative .
"What we do know is , if you &apos;re not pre@@ p@@ ared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything or@@ ig@@ in@@ al — if you &apos;re not pre@@ p@@ ared to be wrong ."
"And by the time they get to be ad@@ ults , most kids have l@@ ost that cap@@ ac@@ ity ."
They have become fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of being wrong .
And the res@@ ult is that we are educ@@ ating people out of their cre@@ ative cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties .
"@@ P@@ ic@@ as@@ so once said this , he said that all children are born arti@@ sts ."
The problem is to re@@ ma@@ in an arti@@ st as we grow up .
"I believe this p@@ assi@@ on@@ ately , that we don &apos;t grow into cre@@ ati@@ vity , we grow out of it ."
"O@@ r rather , we get educ@@ ated out of it ."
So why is this ?
I li@@ ved in S@@ tr@@ at@@ for@@ d@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ A@@ v@@ on until about five years ago .
"In fact , we mo@@ ved from S@@ tr@@ at@@ for@@ d to Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es ."
A@@ re you struc@@ k by a new thought ? I was .
"You don &apos;t think of S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are having a father , do you ?"
"D@@ o you ? Because you don &apos;t think of S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are being a child , do you ?"
S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are being se@@ ven ?
I never thought of it .
"I mean , he was se@@ ven at some point ."
"He was in somebody &apos;s English cl@@ ass , wasn &apos;t he ?"
&quot; M@@ ust try har@@ der . &quot; ( Laughter )
&quot; It &apos;s con@@ f@@ using everybody . &quot; ( Laughter )
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we mo@@ ved from S@@ tr@@ at@@ for@@ d to Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es , and I just want to say a word about the tran@@ si@@ tion ."
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my d@@ aughter &apos;s 1@@ 6 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es .
"He lo@@ ved it , but he had a gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end in Eng@@ land ."
"This was the love of his life , S@@ ar@@ ah ."
He &apos;d known her for a mon@@ th .
"( Laughter ) M@@ ind you , they &apos;d had their f@@ our@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary , because it &apos;s a long time when you &apos;re 1@@ 6 ."
E@@ very one . D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter where you go .
"You &apos;d think it would be o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , but it isn &apos;t ."
"A@@ t the top are ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s and langu@@ ages , then the hum@@ ani@@ ties , and at the bot@@ tom are the ar@@ ts ."
E@@ very@@ where on Earth .
"And in pretty much every system too , there &apos;s a hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y within the ar@@ ts ."
There isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that teach@@ es d@@ ance every@@ day to children the way we te@@ ach them ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s . Why ?
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
"We all have bo@@ dies , don &apos;t we ? D@@ id I mis@@ s a me@@ e@@ ting ?"
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t it ?
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
"And I used to be one , so there ."
"( Laughter ) And I like univers@@ ity prof@@ ess@@ ors , but you know , we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high@@ -@@ water mar@@ k of all human achi@@ ev@@ ement ."
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
"But they &apos;re rather cur@@ i@@ ous , and I say this out of aff@@ ec@@ tion for them ."
"There &apos;s something cur@@ i@@ ous about prof@@ ess@@ ors in my experience — not all of them , but t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , they live in their he@@ ads ."
"They &apos;re dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died , you know , in a kind of liter@@ al way ."
They look up@@ on their body as a form of tran@@ sp@@ ort for their he@@ ads .
It &apos;s a way of getting their head to me@@ et@@ ings .
"And there , you will see it ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wn men and women w@@ ri@@ thing un@@ contro@@ l@@ l@@ ably , off the be@@ at ."
O@@ ur education system is predic@@ ated on the idea of ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c ability .
"A@@ r@@ ound the world , there were no public syst@@ ems of education , really , before the 19@@ th century ."
They all came into being to me@@ et the nee@@ ds of in@@ du@@ stri@@ al@@ ism .
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one , that the most u@@ se@@ ful sub@@ jects for work are at the top ."
"D@@ on &apos;t do mu@@ sic , you &apos;re not going to be a m@@ us@@ ici@@ an ; don &apos;t do art , you won &apos;t be an arti@@ st ."
The whole world is eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed in a re@@ v@@ olution .
"And the second is ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c ability , which has really come to dom@@ in@@ ate our view of intelligence , because the univer@@ si@@ ties desig@@ ned the system in their im@@ age ."
"If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a prot@@ r@@ ac@@ ted process of univers@@ ity en@@ tr@@ ance ."
"In the next 30 years , ac@@ cor@@ ding to U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O , more people wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de will be gra@@ du@@ ating through education than since the beginning of history ."
"M@@ ore people , and it &apos;s the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of all the things we &apos;ve tal@@ ked about — technology and its trans@@ formation eff@@ ect on work , and demo@@ grap@@ h@@ y and the huge expl@@ os@@ i@@ on in population ."
I@@ s@@ n &apos;t that true ?
"If you didn &apos;t have a job , it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one ."
We need to ra@@ dic@@ ally re@@ think our view of intelligence .
"We think in ab@@ str@@ act ter@@ ms , we think in mov@@ ement ."
"If you look at the inter@@ ac@@ tions of a human brain , as we heard y@@ est@@ er@@ day from a number of pres@@ ent@@ ations , intelligence is wonder@@ fully inter@@ ac@@ tive ."
The brain isn &apos;t divi@@ ded into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments .
"In fact , cre@@ ati@@ vity — which I de@@ fine as the process of having or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ideas that have value — more often than not comes about through the inter@@ action of different di@@ sci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary ways of seeing things ."
"B@@ y the way , there &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ ft of ner@@ ves that jo@@ ins the two hal@@ ves of the brain called the cor@@ p@@ us call@@ os@@ um ."
"F@@ ol@@ lowing off from H@@ el@@ en y@@ est@@ er@@ day , this is probably why women are better at m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ t@@ as@@ king ."
"Because you are , are@@ n &apos;t you ?"
"There &apos;s a ra@@ ft of resear@@ ch , but I know it from my pers@@ onal life ."
"If my wi@@ fe is co@@ o@@ king a me@@ al at home — which is not often , th@@ an@@ k@@ fully ."
"If I &apos;m co@@ o@@ king , the do@@ or is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the ph@@ one &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ er@@ ry , ple@@ ase , I &apos;m trying to fr@@ y an eg@@ g in here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; G@@ i@@ ve me a bre@@ ak . &quot; ( Laughter )"
"A@@ c@@ tually , do you know that old philosop@@ h@@ ical thing , if a t@@ ree f@@ all@@ s in a fore@@ st and no@@ body hear@@ s it , did it happen ?"
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber that old ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut ?
"I saw a great t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t rec@@ ently , which said , &quot; &quot; If a man spe@@ a@@ ks his mind in a fore@@ st , and no woman hear@@ s him , is he still wrong ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the thir@@ d thing about intelligence is , it &apos;s dist@@ inc@@ t ."
"I used to be on the bo@@ ard of The R@@ o@@ y@@ al B@@ al@@ let , as you can see ."
It wasn &apos;t an av@@ a@@ il@@ able condi@@ tion .
( Laughter ) People wer@@ en &apos;t aw@@ are they could have that . ( Laughter )
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , she went to see this speci@@ ali@@ st ."
"So , this o@@ ak@@ -@@ pan@@ el@@ ed room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and s@@ at on this cha@@ ir at the end , and she s@@ at on her h@@ ands for 20 minutes while this man tal@@ ked to her mother about the problems G@@ illi@@ an was having at school ."
"Because she was dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing people ; her h@@ ome@@ work was always l@@ ate ; and so on , little k@@ id of eight ."
"In the end , the doc@@ tor went and s@@ at next to G@@ illi@@ an , and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to all these things your mother &apos;s told me , I need to spe@@ ak to her pri@@ v@@ ately ."
"But as they went out of the room , he tur@@ ned on the radi@@ o that was sit@@ ting on his des@@ k ."
"And when they got out , he said to her mother , &quot; &quot; J@@ ust st@@ and and wat@@ ch her . &quot; &quot; And the minut@@ e they left the room , she was on her fe@@ et , mo@@ ving to the mu@@ sic ."
"And they wat@@ ched for a few minutes and he tur@@ ned to her mother and said , &quot; &quot; M@@ r@@ s@@ . L@@ y@@ n@@ ne , G@@ illi@@ an isn &apos;t s@@ ick ; she &apos;s a d@@ anc@@ er ."
"T@@ a@@ ke her to a d@@ ance school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was ful@@ l of people like me .
People who couldn &apos;t s@@ it still .
People who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"They did bal@@ let , they did ta@@ p , j@@ az@@ z ; they did moder@@ n ; they did cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary ."
She was even@@ tually au@@ di@@ tion@@ ed for the R@@ o@@ y@@ al B@@ al@@ let S@@ cho@@ ol ; she bec@@ ame a so@@ lo@@ ist ; she had a wonderful care@@ er at the R@@ o@@ y@@ al B@@ al@@ let .
S@@ ome@@ body else might have put her on medic@@ ation and told her to cal@@ m down .
( Applause ) What I think it comes to is this : A@@ l G@@ ore sp@@ o@@ ke the other night about ec@@ o@@ logy and the re@@ v@@ olution that was tri@@ gg@@ er@@ ed by R@@ ac@@ he@@ l C@@ ar@@ son .
O@@ ur education system has min@@ ed our min@@ ds in the way that we stri@@ p@@ -@@ m@@ ine the ear@@ th : for a particular com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity .
"And for the future , it won &apos;t ser@@ ve us ."
"There was a wonderful quot@@ e by J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k , who said , &quot; &quot; If all the in@@ sec@@ ts were to dis@@ appe@@ ar from the Earth , within 50 years all life on Earth would end ."
"If all human be@@ ings dis@@ appe@@ ared from the Earth , within 50 years all for@@ ms of life would fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s right ."
What TED c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ates is the gi@@ ft of the human imag@@ in@@ ation .
We have to be care@@ ful now that we use this gi@@ ft wi@@ se@@ ly and that we a@@ ver@@ t some of the sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ s that we &apos;ve tal@@ ked about .
And the only way we &apos;ll do it is by seeing our cre@@ ative cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties for the r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are .
And our job is to help them make something of it .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
There are a few things that all of us need .
We all need air to bre@@ a@@ the .
We need c@@ le@@ an water to dr@@ ink .
We need food to e@@ at . We need sh@@ el@@ ter and love .
"You know . Lo@@ ve is great , too ."
And we all need a sa@@ fe place to pe@@ e .
( Laughter ) Y@@ eah ?
"As a tr@@ ans person who doesn &apos;t f@@ it ne@@ at@@ ly into the gen@@ der b@@ in@@ ary , if I could change the world tom@@ or@@ row to make it eas@@ ier for me to n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate , the very first thing I would do is bl@@ ink and create single st@@ all , gen@@ der@@ -@@ ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om@@ s in all public places ."
"( Applause ) T@@ r@@ ans people and tr@@ ans is@@ su@@ es , they &apos;ve been getting a lot of ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am me@@ dia att@@ en@@ tion l@@ ately ."
"And this is a great and nec@@ ess@@ ary thing , but most of that att@@ en@@ tion has been fo@@ c@@ used on a very few in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , most of wh@@ om are kin@@ d@@ a r@@ ich and pretty fam@@ ous , and probably don &apos;t have to wor@@ ry that much any@@ more about where they &apos;re going to pe@@ e in between cl@@ ass@@ es at their comm@@ unity colle@@ ge , or where they &apos;re going to get changed into their g@@ y@@ m stri@@ p at their public high school ."
F@@ ame and money in@@ s@@ ul@@ ates these tel@@ evi@@ sion star tr@@ ans people from most of the every@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es that the rest of us have to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le on a d@@ a@@ ily bas@@ is .
P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
"They &apos;ve been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember , first when I was just a little b@@ ab@@ y tom@@ bo@@ y and then later as a m@@ as@@ cul@@ in@@ e-@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing , pre@@ dom@@ in@@ an@@ tly est@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ bas@@ ed org@@ an@@ ism ."
"( Laughter ) Now , today as a tr@@ ans person , public b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om@@ s and change ro@@ om@@ s are where I am most likely to be ques@@ tion@@ ed or har@@ ass@@ ed ."
I &apos;ve often been ver@@ b@@ ally att@@ ac@@ ked be@@ h@@ ind their do@@ ors .
I &apos;ve been ha@@ ul@@ ed out by sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds with my pan@@ ts still hal@@ f@@ way pul@@ led up .
"I &apos;ve been st@@ ared at , scre@@ am@@ ed at , wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed about , and one time I got sm@@ ac@@ ked in the face by a little old l@@ ad@@ y &apos;s pur@@ se that from the looks of the sh@@ in@@ er I took home that day I am pretty certain con@@ tain@@ ed at le@@ ast 7@@ 0 dollars of ro@@ l@@ led up small change and a large hard can@@ dy coll@@ ec@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) And I know what some of you are thinking , and you &apos;re m@@ os@@ tly right ."
I can and do just use the men &apos;s room most of the time these days .
"But that doesn &apos;t sol@@ ve my change room di@@ le@@ m@@ m@@ as , does it ?"
And I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to use the men &apos;s room because I &apos;m not a man .
I &apos;m a tr@@ ans person .
And now we &apos;ve got these f@@ ear@@ mon@@ g@@ ering poli@@ tici@@ ans that keep trying to p@@ ass these b@@ ath@@ room b@@ ills .
H@@ ave you heard about these ?
They try to le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ ate to try and force people like my@@ self to use the b@@ ath@@ room that they de@@ e@@ m most appro@@ pri@@ ate ac@@ cor@@ ding to the gen@@ der I was assi@@ g@@ ned at bir@@ th .
"And if these poli@@ tici@@ ans ever get their way , in A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a or C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a or F@@ l@@ ori@@ d@@ a or just last week in H@@ ou@@ st@@ on , T@@ ex@@ as , or O@@ t@@ ta@@ w@@ a , well then , using the men &apos;s room will not be a le@@ g@@ al op@@ tion for me e@@ ither ."
"And every time one of these poli@@ tici@@ ans br@@ ings one of these b@@ ills to the t@@ able , I can &apos;t help but won@@ der , you know , just who will and exactly how would we go about en@@ for@@ c@@ ing la@@ ws like these . R@@ ight ?"
P@@ an@@ ty ch@@ ec@@ ks ?
R@@ e@@ ally .
G@@ en@@ ital in@@ spec@@ tions outside of b@@ ath change ro@@ om@@ s at public po@@ ols ?
There &apos;s no le@@ g@@ al or e@@ th@@ ical or pl@@ au@@ sible way to en@@ force la@@ ws like these any@@ way .
They ex@@ ist only to f@@ os@@ ter fear and prom@@ ote tran@@ sp@@ ho@@ bi@@ a .
They don &apos;t make any@@ one sa@@ f@@ er .
But they do for sure make the world more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous for some of us .
"And mean@@ while , our tr@@ ans children suff@@ er ."
"They dro@@ p out of school , or they op@@ t out of life al@@ together ."
"T@@ r@@ ans people , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally tr@@ ans and gen@@ der@@ -@@ n@@ on@@ con@@ form@@ ing y@@ ou@@ th face ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal chall@@ eng@@ es when ac@@ cess@@ ing po@@ ols and g@@ y@@ ms , but also univer@@ si@@ ties , h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies ."
D@@ on &apos;t even get me started on how they treat us in a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts .
"If we don &apos;t move now to make sure that these places are tru@@ ly op@@ en and ac@@ c@@ es@@ sible to everyone , then we just need to get h@@ on@@ est and qu@@ it call@@ ing them public places ."
"We need to just ad@@ m@@ it that they are really only op@@ en for people who f@@ it ne@@ at@@ ly into one of two gen@@ der bo@@ x@@ es , which I do not ."
I never have .
And this star@@ ts very early .
I know a little gir@@ l . She &apos;s the d@@ aughter of a fri@@ end of m@@ ine .
She &apos;s a self-@@ i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied tom@@ bo@@ y .
"I &apos;m talking about co@@ w@@ bo@@ y bo@@ ots and C@@ at@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ar y@@ el@@ low to@@ y tr@@ uc@@ ks and bu@@ g j@@ ar@@ s , the whole n@@ ine y@@ ar@@ ds ."
One time I asked her what her fav@@ or@@ ite col@@ or was .
"S@@ he told me , &quot; &quot; C@@ am@@ ou@@ fl@@ age . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that aw@@ es@@ ome little k@@ id , she came home from school last O@@ c@@ to@@ ber from her half day of pre@@ school with so@@ g@@ gy pan@@ ts on because the other kids at school were har@@ ass@@ ing her when she tri@@ ed to use the girls &apos; b@@ ath@@ room ."
And the teacher had already in@@ struc@@ ted her to st@@ ay out of the bo@@ ys &apos; b@@ ath@@ room .
"And she had dr@@ ank two gl@@ ass@@ es of that red ju@@ ice at the H@@ al@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ ty , and I mean , who can re@@ si@@ st that red ju@@ ice , right ? It &apos;s so good ."
And she couldn &apos;t hold her pe@@ e any longer .
H@@ er and her cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es were four years old .
They already f@@ el@@ t em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed enough to poli@@ ce her use of the so@@ -@@ called public b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
She was four years old .
She had already been t@@ au@@ ght the br@@ ut@@ al l@@ es@@ son that there was no b@@ ath@@ room do@@ or at pre@@ school with a si@@ g@@ n on it that w@@ el@@ com@@ ed people like her .
"S@@ he &apos;d already learned that b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om@@ s were going to be a problem , and that problem started with her and was h@@ ers al@@ one ."
"So my fri@@ end asked me to talk to her little d@@ aughter , and I did ."
"I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got ol@@ der , but I couldn &apos;t ."
"So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened , asked her to tell me how it made her feel ."
"So I told her that she wasn &apos;t al@@ one and that it wasn &apos;t right what had happened to her , and then she asked me if I had ever pe@@ ed in my pan@@ ts before ."
"I said y@@ es , I had , but not for a really long time ."
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich of course was a li@@ e , because you know how you h@@ it , like , 4@@ 2 or 4@@ 3 , and sometimes you just , I don &apos;t know , you pe@@ e a little bit when you c@@ ough or s@@ nee@@ ze , when you &apos;re run@@ ning up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , or you &apos;re stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ing ."
D@@ on &apos;t li@@ e .
It happens . R@@ ight ?
"S@@ he doesn &apos;t need to know that , I fig@@ ure ."
"( Laughter ) I told her , when you get ol@@ der , your bl@@ ad@@ der is going to grow big@@ ger , too ."
"When you get old like me , you &apos;re going to be able to hold your pe@@ e for way longer , I prom@@ is@@ ed her ."
&quot; Un@@ til you can get home ? &quot;
she asked me .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , until you can get home . &quot; &quot; She se@@ em@@ ed to take some com@@ for@@ t in that ."
"So let &apos;s just build some single st@@ all , gen@@ der@@ -@@ ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al b@@ ath@@ ro@@ om@@ s with a little b@@ en@@ ch for getting changed into your g@@ y@@ m c@@ lo@@ th@@ es ."
This we can do .
So let &apos;s just do it .
"If you can &apos;t bring yourself to care enough about people like me , then what about women and girls with body im@@ age is@@ su@@ es ?"
What about any@@ one with body im@@ age stuff going on ?
"What about that bo@@ y at school who is a fo@@ ot sh@@ or@@ ter than his cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es , wh@@ ose v@@ o@@ ice still ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t d@@ rop@@ ped yet ? H@@ ey ?"
"O@@ h , gra@@ de eight , what a c@@ ru@@ el ma@@ ster you can be ."
R@@ ight ?
What about people with an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty is@@ su@@ es ?
What about people with dis@@ abili@@ ties or who need assi@@ st@@ ance in there ?
"What about fol@@ ks with bo@@ dies who , for wh@@ at@@ ever reason , don &apos;t f@@ it into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am idea of what a body should look like ?"
"@@ How many of us still feel sh@@ y or af@@ ra@@ id to dis@@ ro@@ be in front of our pe@@ ers , and how many of us al@@ low that fear to keep us from something as important as physical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ?"
W@@ ould all those people not b@@ ene@@ f@@ it from these single st@@ all fac@@ ili@@ ties ?
"We can &apos;t change tran@@ sp@@ ho@@ bi@@ c min@@ ds over@@ night , but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world sa@@ f@@ er for all of us ."
Thank you for li@@ st@@ en@@ ing .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a very large cos@@ mo@@ s , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at e@@ ither of those sc@@ al@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins ha@@ ven &apos;t ev@@ ol@@ ved to understand the world at that sc@@ ale ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed on this very th@@ in sli@@ ce of per@@ cep@@ tion right in the middle ."
"But it gets stran@@ ge , because even at that sli@@ ce of reality that we call home , we &apos;re not seeing most of the action that &apos;s going on ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
"This is light wa@@ ves , electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation that b@@ oun@@ ces off ob@@ jects and it h@@ its speci@@ ali@@ zed re@@ cep@@ tors in the back of our ey@@ es ."
But we &apos;re not seeing all the wa@@ ves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tr@@ illi@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"So you have radi@@ o wa@@ ves and m@@ ic@@ ro@@ wa@@ ves and X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys and g@@ am@@ m@@ a ra@@ ys p@@ ass@@ ing through your body right now and you &apos;re completely un@@ aw@@ are of it , because you don &apos;t come with the pro@@ per bio@@ logical re@@ cep@@ tors for pic@@ king it up ."
"There are thousands of c@@ ell ph@@ one con@@ vers@@ ations p@@ ass@@ ing through you right now , and you &apos;re ut@@ ter@@ ly bl@@ ind to it ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ her@@ ently un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ n@@ a@@ kes in@@ clu@@ de some in@@ f@@ ra@@ red in their reality , and h@@ on@@ ey@@ be@@ es in@@ clu@@ de ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let in their view of the world , and of course we build mach@@ ines in the d@@ as@@ h@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our car@@ s to pic@@ k up on si@@ gn@@ als in the radi@@ o f@@ requ@@ enc@@ y ran@@ ge , and we built mach@@ ines in h@@ osp@@ it@@ als to pic@@ k up on the X@@ -@@ r@@ ay ran@@ ge ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at le@@ ast not yet , because you don &apos;t come equ@@ i@@ p@@ ped with the pro@@ per sen@@ s@@ ors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ st@@ ra@@ ined by our bio@@ logy , and that goes against the common sense n@@ oti@@ on that our ey@@ es and our ear@@ s and our fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ jec@@ tive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , our bra@@ ins are s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing just a little bit of the world ."
"Now , across the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , different anim@@ als pic@@ k up on different parts of reality ."
"So in the bl@@ ind and de@@ a@@ f world of the tic@@ k , the important si@@ gn@@ als are t@@ em@@ per@@ ature and bu@@ t@@ y@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish , its sen@@ s@@ ory world is la@@ vi@@ sh@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red by electr@@ ical fiel@@ ds ; and for the ec@@ ho@@ loc@@ ating b@@ at , its reality is con@@ struc@@ ted out of air com@@ pres@@ sion wa@@ ves ."
"That &apos;s the sli@@ ce of their ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem that they can pic@@ k up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"It &apos;s called the um@@ w@@ el@@ t , which is the G@@ er@@ man word for the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding world ."
"Now , pre@@ sum@@ ably , every anim@@ al as@@ sum@@ es that its um@@ w@@ el@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ jec@@ tive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ y@@ on@@ d what we can sense ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , what we all do is we ac@@ cept reality as it &apos;s pres@@ en@@ ted to us ."
Let &apos;s do a conscious@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ mag@@ ine that you are a b@@ loo@@ d@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about sm@@ elling .
"You &apos;ve got a long s@@ n@@ out that has 200 million sc@@ ent re@@ cep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et n@@ os@@ tr@@ il@@ s that at@@ tr@@ act and tra@@ p sc@@ ent m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es , and your n@@ os@@ tr@@ il@@ s even have sli@@ ts so you can take big n@@ os@@ e@@ ful@@ s of air ."
E@@ very@@ thing is about sm@@ ell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your tr@@ ac@@ ks with a re@@ v@@ el@@ ation ."
"You look at your human ow@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the pi@@ ti@@ ful , im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed n@@ ose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ e@@ ble little n@@ os@@ e@@ ful of air ?
"@@ How can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 y@@ ar@@ ds away , or that your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or was on this very sp@@ ot six hours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re hum@@ ans , we &apos;ve never experienc@@ ed that world of sm@@ ell , so we don &apos;t mis@@ s it , because we are fir@@ m@@ ly se@@ tt@@ led into our um@@ w@@ el@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be st@@ uc@@ k there ?"
"So as a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , I &apos;m interest@@ ed in the way that technology might exp@@ and our um@@ w@@ el@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So we already know that we can mar@@ ry our technology to our bio@@ logy , because there are hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of people wal@@ king around with arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hear@@ ing and arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al vi@@ sion ."
"So the way this works is , you take a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one and you di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze the si@@ gn@@ al , and you put an elec@@ tro@@ de stri@@ p direc@@ tly into the in@@ ner e@@ ar ."
"O@@ r , with the re@@ t@@ in@@ al im@@ pl@@ ant , you take a cam@@ er@@ a and you di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze the si@@ gn@@ al , and then you pl@@ u@@ g an elec@@ tro@@ de g@@ ri@@ d direc@@ tly into the op@@ tic ner@@ ve ."
"And as rec@@ ently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scienti@@ sts who thought these techno@@ logi@@ es wouldn &apos;t work ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these techno@@ logi@@ es spe@@ ak the language of S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , and it &apos;s not exactly the same di@@ al@@ ect as our natural bio@@ logical sense org@@ ans ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain fi@@ gu@@ res out how to use the si@@ gn@@ als just fine .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big sec@@ re@@ t : Y@@ our brain is not hear@@ ing or seeing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is loc@@ ked in a v@@ au@@ l@@ t of si@@ l@@ ence and dar@@ k@@ ness inside your sk@@ ul@@ l .
"A@@ ll it ever se@@ es are elec@@ tro@@ ch@@ em@@ ical si@@ gn@@ als that come in along different data c@@ ab@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
"Now , ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly , the brain is really good at taking in these si@@ gn@@ als and extr@@ ac@@ ting patterns and assi@@ g@@ ning mean@@ ing , so that it ta@@ kes this in@@ ner cos@@ mo@@ s and pu@@ ts together a story of this , your sub@@ jec@@ tive world ."
"But here &apos;s the k@@ ey point : Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know , and it doesn &apos;t care , where it gets the data from ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever information comes in , it just fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with it ."
And this is a very eff@@ ici@@ ent kind of machine .
"It &apos;s ess@@ enti@@ ally a gener@@ al pur@@ pose compu@@ ting dev@@ ice , and it just ta@@ kes in everything and fi@@ gu@@ res out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , f@@ re@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to t@@ in@@ ker around with different sor@@ ts of in@@ put chan@@ n@@ els ."
"So I call this the P@@ .@@ H@@ . mo@@ de@@ l of evolution , and I don &apos;t want to get too tech@@ n@@ ical here , but P@@ .@@ H@@ . st@@ ands for P@@ ot@@ a@@ to H@@ e@@ ad , and I use this name to emp@@ ha@@ size that all these sen@@ s@@ ors that we know and love , like our ey@@ es and our ear@@ s and our fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps , these are mer@@ ely per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al pl@@ u@@ g@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ play dev@@ ices : You s@@ tic@@ k them in , and you &apos;re good to go ."
The brain fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , you find lots of per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"So s@@ n@@ a@@ kes have he@@ at p@@ its with which to de@@ t@@ ect in@@ f@@ ra@@ red , and the gh@@ ost k@@ ni@@ fe@@ f@@ ish has elec@@ tro@@ re@@ cep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ n@@ os@@ ed mo@@ le has this app@@ en@@ d@@ age with 2@@ 2 fin@@ g@@ ers on it with which it fe@@ els around and con@@ struc@@ ts a 3@@ D mo@@ de@@ l of the world , and many bir@@ ds have mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ te so they can ori@@ ent to the mag@@ ne@@ tic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to contin@@ u@@ ally re@@ desig@@ n the brain .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , with the prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es of brain oper@@ ation est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is desig@@ ning new per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The l@@ es@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really speci@@ al or fundamental about the bio@@ logy that we come to the t@@ able with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ her@@ ited from a comple@@ x ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to s@@ tic@@ k with , and our best pro@@ of of prin@@ ci@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"And that re@@ f@@ ers to fe@@ e@@ ding information into the brain vi@@ a un@@ u@@ su@@ al sen@@ s@@ ory chan@@ n@@ els , and the brain just fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with it ."
"Now , that might sound spec@@ ul@@ ative , but the first p@@ ap@@ er de@@ mon@@ str@@ ating this was published in the j@@ our@@ n@@ al N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
"So if you wi@@ gg@@ le a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e c@@ up in front of the cam@@ er@@ a , you &apos;re feel@@ ing that in your back , and ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly , bl@@ ind people got pretty good at being able to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine what was in front of the cam@@ er@@ a just by feel@@ ing it in the small of their back ."
"Now , there have been many moder@@ n in@@ car@@ n@@ ations of this ."
"And it doesn &apos;t have to be through the ear@@ s : this system us@@ es an electr@@ ot@@ acti@@ le g@@ ri@@ d on the fore@@ head , so wh@@ at@@ ever &apos;s in front of the vide@@ o fe@@ ed , you &apos;re feel@@ ing it on your fore@@ head ."
Why the fore@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most moder@@ n in@@ car@@ n@@ ation is called the bra@@ in@@ port , and this is a little elec@@ tro@@ g@@ ri@@ d that s@@ its on your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e , and the vide@@ o fe@@ ed gets tur@@ ned into these little electr@@ ot@@ acti@@ le si@@ gn@@ als , and bl@@ ind people get so good at using this that they can th@@ row a b@@ all into a bas@@ k@@ et , or they can n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate comple@@ x ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
"Now , that s@@ ounds completely in@@ s@@ an@@ e , right ?"
"But remember , all vi@@ sion ever is is elec@@ tro@@ ch@@ em@@ ical si@@ gn@@ als cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the si@@ gn@@ als come from .
It just fi@@ gu@@ res out what to do with them .
And here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets con@@ ver@@ ted in some way so that a de@@ a@@ f person can understand what is being said .
"And we wanted to do this , given the power and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity of port@@ able compu@@ ting , we wanted to make sure that this would run on c@@ ell ph@@ ones and t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts , and also we wanted to make this a w@@ ear@@ able , something that you could we@@ ar under your c@@ lo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m spe@@ a@@ king , my sound is getting cap@@ tu@@ red by the t@@ ab@@ let , and then it &apos;s getting m@@ app@@ ed on@@ to a v@@ est that &apos;s co@@ ver@@ ed in vi@@ br@@ at@@ ory m@@ ot@@ ors , just like the m@@ ot@@ ors in your c@@ ell ph@@ one . So as I &apos;m spe@@ a@@ king ,"
the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated to a patter@@ n of vi@@ br@@ ation on the v@@ est .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tual : this t@@ ab@@ let is trans@@ m@@ it@@ ting B@@ l@@ u@@ e@@ to@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m w@@ ear@@ ing the v@@ est right now ."
So as I &apos;m spe@@ a@@ king — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ l@@ ated into d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic patterns of vi@@ br@@ ation .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the s@@ on@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been te@@ st@@ ing this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start understanding the language of the v@@ est ."
So this is J@@ on@@ a@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a ma@@ ster &apos;s de@@ gre@@ e .
"He was born prof@@ oun@@ dly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ w@@ el@@ t that &apos;s un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to him ."
"So we had J@@ on@@ a@@ than tr@@ ain with the v@@ est for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t N@@ o@@ v@@ ich : You .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d E@@ ag@@ le@@ man : So S@@ c@@ ot@@ t says a word , J@@ on@@ a@@ than fe@@ els it on the v@@ est , and he wr@@ it@@ es it on the bo@@ ard ."
S@@ N : Wh@@ ere . Wh@@ ere .
D@@ E : J@@ on@@ a@@ than is able to trans@@ l@@ ate this comp@@ lic@@ ated patter@@ n of vi@@ br@@ ations into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"D@@ E : Now , he &apos;s not doing this — ( Applause ) — J@@ on@@ a@@ than is not doing this conscious@@ ly , because the patterns are too comp@@ lic@@ ated , but his brain is star@@ ting to un@@ loc@@ k the patter@@ n that al@@ lo@@ ws it to fig@@ ure out what the data mean , and our exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation is that , after w@@ ear@@ ing this for about three months , he will have a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience of hear@@ ing in the same way that when a bl@@ ind person p@@ ass@@ es a fin@@ ger over bra@@ il@@ le , the mean@@ ing comes direc@@ tly off the p@@ age without any consci@@ ous inter@@ ven@@ tion at all ."
"Now , this technology has the p@@ ot@@ ential to be a g@@ am@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger , because the only other solu@@ tion for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ pl@@ ant , and that requ@@ i@@ res an inv@@ as@@ i@@ ve sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ ap@@ er than a co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ pl@@ ant , which op@@ ens up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the po@@ o@@ rest countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed by our res@@ ults with sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ stitu@@ tion , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ di@@ tion ."
"@@ How could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a completely new kind of sense , to exp@@ and the human um@@ v@@ el@@ t ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed re@@ al@@ -@@ time data from the In@@ ter@@ net direc@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they devel@@ op a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
A sub@@ ject is feel@@ ing a re@@ al@@ -@@ time stre@@ am@@ ing fe@@ ed from the N@@ et of data for five secon@@ ds .
"Th@@ en , two bu@@ tt@@ ons appe@@ ar , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He makes a cho@@ ice , and he gets fe@@ ed@@ back after one second ."
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding is re@@ al@@ -@@ time data from the st@@ oc@@ k market , and he &apos;s making bu@@ y and s@@ ell deci@@ sions ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is t@@ elling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re seeing is , can we exp@@ and the human um@@ v@@ el@@ t so that he comes to have , after se@@ ver@@ al wee@@ ks , a direc@@ t per@@ cep@@ tual experience of the economic mov@@ em@@ ents of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll re@@ port on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ uring the tal@@ ks this mor@@ ning , we &apos;ve been au@@ tom@@ atic@@ ally sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ing T@@ w@@ it@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 ha@@ sh@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an au@@ tom@@ ated s@@ enti@@ ment anal@@ ys@@ is , which means , are people using posi@@ tive words or ne@@ g@@ ative words or ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate emoti@@ on of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lo@@ ving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a big@@ ger experience than a human can norm@@ ally have .
We &apos;re also exp@@ anding the um@@ v@@ el@@ t of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the v@@ est is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different meas@@ ures from this qu@@ ad@@ cop@@ ter , so p@@ it@@ ch and y@@ a@@ w and ro@@ ll and ori@@ ent@@ ation and he@@ ad@@ ing , and that impro@@ ves this pi@@ lot &apos;s ability to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s ess@@ enti@@ ally like he &apos;s ex@@ ten@@ ding his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vi@@ si@@ on@@ ing is taking a moder@@ n co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it ful@@ l of g@@ au@@ g@@ es and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between ac@@ cess@@ ing big data and experienc@@ ing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possi@@ bili@@ ties on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on for human exp@@ an@@ sion .
"@@ J@@ ust imagine an astron@@ au@@ t being able to feel the over@@ all health of the In@@ ter@@ national S@@ p@@ ace St@@ ation , or , for that matter , having you feel the in@@ vi@@ sible st@@ ates of your own health , like your b@@ loo@@ d su@@ g@@ ar and the state of your m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0-@@ de@@ gre@@ e vi@@ sion or seeing in in@@ f@@ ra@@ red or ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ."
"So the k@@ ey is this : A@@ s we move into the future , we &apos;re going to increas@@ ing@@ ly be able to cho@@ ose our own per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al dev@@ ices ."
"We no longer have to wa@@ it for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ s@@ ory gi@@ f@@ ts on her tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es , but instead , like any good paren@@ t , she &apos;s given us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and de@@ fine our own tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : C@@ an you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ eah .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I f@@ el@@ t ap@@ plause on the v@@ est ."
It &apos;s n@@ ice . It &apos;s like a m@@ ass@@ age . ( Laughter ) CA : T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &apos;s going crazy . T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &apos;s going ma@@ d .
So that st@@ oc@@ k market experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to wr@@ ite to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
"C@@ A : Well look , just to be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical for a minut@@ e , I mean , this is ama@@ zing , but isn &apos;t most of the evidence so far that sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ stitu@@ tion works , not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily that sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ di@@ tion works ?"
"I mean , isn &apos;t it possible that the bl@@ ind person can see through their t@@ on@@ gu@@ e because the vi@@ su@@ al cor@@ te@@ x is still there , ready to process , and that that is needed as part of it ?"
D@@ E : That &apos;s a great question . We actually have no idea what the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical lim@@ its are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
"The gener@@ al story , though , is that it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble ."
"So when a person goes bl@@ ind , what we used to call their vi@@ su@@ al cor@@ te@@ x gets taken over by other things , by tou@@ ch , by hear@@ ing , by v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary ."
So what that t@@ ells us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tr@@ ick p@@ on@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of comp@@ ut@@ ations on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through b@@ um@@ ps on their fin@@ g@@ ers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a the@@ o@@ re@@ tical lim@@ it that we know the e@@ dge of .
"C@@ A : If this ch@@ ec@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be d@@ el@@ u@@ g@@ ed ."
There are so many possible app@@ lic@@ ations for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exc@@ ited about , the direc@@ tion it might go ?"
"D@@ E : I mean , I think there &apos;s a lot of app@@ lic@@ ations here ."
"The k@@ ey is this : O@@ ur vi@@ su@@ al syst@@ ems are good at de@@ t@@ ec@@ ting b@@ lob@@ s and ed@@ g@@ es , but they &apos;re really bad at what our world has become , which is scre@@ ens with lots and lots of data ."
We have to cra@@ w@@ l that with our att@@ enti@@ onal syst@@ ems .
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re st@@ anding around ."
"So I think he@@ av@@ y mach@@ in@@ ery , sa@@ fe@@ ty , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ t@@ ory , of your equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ a@@ vi@@ d E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d@@ -@@ b@@ lowing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m going to talk about a fa@@ il@@ ure of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion that many of us suff@@ er from .
It &apos;s really a fa@@ il@@ ure to de@@ t@@ ect a certain kind of d@@ an@@ ger .
"I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o that I think is both ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying and likely to oc@@ cu@@ r , and that &apos;s not a good com@@ b@@ in@@ ation , as it turns out ."
"And yet rather than be sc@@ ared , most of you will feel that what I &apos;m talking about is kind of co@@ ol ."
I &apos;m going to descri@@ be how the g@@ ain@@ s we make in arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence could ul@@ tim@@ ately dest@@ ro@@ y us .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
O@@ K ? That respon@@ se should wor@@ ry you .
"And if I were to con@@ v@@ ince you in this talk that we were likely to suff@@ er a global fam@@ ine , e@@ ither because of c@@ lim@@ ate change or some other cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he , and that your gr@@ and@@ children , or their gr@@ and@@ children , are very likely to live like this , you wouldn &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing ."
I like this TED T@@ al@@ k . &quot; &quot; F@@ am@@ ine isn &apos;t fu@@ n .
"I am un@@ able to mar@@ s@@ ha@@ l this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
"B@@ e@@ h@@ ind do@@ or number one , we stop making progress in building intellig@@ ent mach@@ ines ."
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are just st@@ op@@ s getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to consi@@ der why this might happen .
"I mean , given how val@@ u@@ able intelligence and au@@ tom@@ ation are , we will contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our technology if we are at all able to ."
What could stop us from doing this ?
A ful@@ l@@ -@@ sc@@ ale n@@ uc@@ lear war ?
A global pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c ?
A@@ n ast@@ er@@ o@@ id imp@@ act ?
J@@ us@@ ti@@ n B@@ i@@ e@@ ber becom@@ ing pre@@ si@@ dent of the United States ?
"( Laughter ) The point is , something would have to dest@@ ro@@ y civi@@ li@@ zation as we know it ."
"You have to imagine how bad it would have to be to pre@@ v@@ ent us from making impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in our technology per@@ man@@ ently , generation after generation ."
"Now , this is often car@@ ic@@ at@@ u@@ red , as I have here , as a fear that ar@@ mi@@ es of m@@ al@@ ici@@ ous ro@@ b@@ ots will att@@ ack us ."
But that isn &apos;t the most likely sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
It &apos;s not that our mach@@ ines will become sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously m@@ al@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent .
J@@ ust think about how we rel@@ ate to an@@ ts .
We don &apos;t h@@ ate them .
We don &apos;t go out of our way to har@@ m them .
"In fact , sometimes we take pain@@ s not to har@@ m them ."
We ste@@ p over them on the si@@ de@@ wal@@ k .
"But wh@@ en@@ ever their pres@@ ence ser@@ i@@ ously con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts with one of our go@@ als , let &apos;s say when con@@ struc@@ ting a building like this one , we an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ate them without a qu@@ al@@ m ."
"The con@@ cer@@ n is that we will one day build mach@@ ines that , whether they &apos;re consci@@ ous or not , could treat us with sim@@ il@@ ar dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard ."
"Now , I su@@ sp@@ ect this seems f@@ ar@@ -@@ fe@@ t@@ ched to many of you ."
But then you must find something wrong with one of the fol@@ lowing as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
And there are only three of them .
In@@ t@@ ellig@@ ence is a matter of information pro@@ cess@@ ing in physical syst@@ ems .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this is a little bit more than an as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion ."
"We have already built n@@ ar@@ row intelligence into our mach@@ ines , and many of these mach@@ ines per@@ form at a level of super@@ human intelligence already ."
"And we know that m@@ ere matter can give ri@@ se to what is called &quot; &quot; gener@@ al intelligence , &quot; &quot; an ability to think f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bly across m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple dom@@ ain@@ s , because our bra@@ ins have man@@ ag@@ ed it . R@@ ight ?"
"I mean , there &apos;s just at@@ om@@ s in here , and as long as we contin@@ ue to build syst@@ ems of at@@ om@@ s that dis@@ play more and more intellig@@ ent behavior , we will even@@ tually , un@@ less we are inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted , we will even@@ tually build gener@@ al intelligence into our mach@@ ines ."
"It &apos;s cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al to reali@@ ze that the r@@ ate of progress doesn &apos;t matter , because any progress is enough to get us into the end z@@ one ."
We don &apos;t need M@@ o@@ ore &apos;s la@@ w to contin@@ ue . We don &apos;t need exp@@ on@@ ential progress .
We just need to keep going .
The second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our intellig@@ ent mach@@ ines .
It is our most val@@ u@@ able res@@ our@@ ce .
So we want to do this .
We have problems that we des@@ per@@ ately need to sol@@ ve .
We want to c@@ ure dise@@ ases like A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and cancer .
We want to understand economic syst@@ ems . We want to impro@@ ve our c@@ lim@@ ate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"The tr@@ ain is already out of the st@@ ation , and there &apos;s no bra@@ ke to pul@@ l ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , we don &apos;t st@@ and on a pe@@ ak of intelligence , or any@@ where ne@@ ar it , likely ."
And this really is the cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al in@@ sight .
"This is what makes our sit@@ u@@ ation so pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , and this is what makes our in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions about ri@@ s@@ k so un@@ reli@@ able ."
"Now , just consi@@ der the smar@@ test person who has ever li@@ ved ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s sh@@ or@@ t@@ li@@ st here is J@@ o@@ h@@ n v@@ on N@@ e@@ um@@ an@@ n .
"I mean , the im@@ pres@@ sion that v@@ on N@@ e@@ um@@ an@@ n made on the people around him , and this in@@ clu@@ ded the gre@@ at@@ est ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans and phys@@ ici@@ sts of his time , is fa@@ ir@@ ly well@@ -@@ doc@@ um@@ en@@ ted ."
"If only half the stories about him are half true , there &apos;s no question he &apos;s one of the smar@@ test people who has ever li@@ ved ."
So consi@@ der the spec@@ tru@@ m of intelligence .
Here we have J@@ o@@ h@@ n v@@ on N@@ e@@ um@@ an@@ n .
And then we have you and me .
"( Laughter ) S@@ or@@ ry , a ch@@ ic@@ ken . ( Laughter )"
There &apos;s no reason for me to make this talk more depres@@ sing than it nee@@ ds to be . ( Laughter )
And it &apos;s important to recogni@@ ze that this is true by vir@@ tu@@ e of spe@@ ed al@@ one .
R@@ ight ? So imagine if we just built a super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ I that was no smar@@ ter than your average te@@ am of resear@@ ch@@ ers at St@@ an@@ for@@ d or M@@ I@@ T .
"So you set it run@@ ning for a week , and it will per@@ form 20@@ ,000 years of hum@@ an@@ -@@ level int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual work , week after week after week ."
"The other thing that &apos;s wor@@ r@@ ying , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , is that , imagine the best case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o ."
It &apos;s as though we &apos;ve been h@@ an@@ ded an or@@ ac@@ le that beha@@ ves exactly as int@@ en@@ ded .
"Well , this machine would be the per@@ f@@ ect l@@ ab@@ or@@ -@@ sa@@ ving dev@@ ice ."
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dru@@ d@@ g@@ ery .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual work .
So what would ap@@ es like ourselves do in this cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to play F@@ ri@@ s@@ be@@ e and give each other m@@ ass@@ ages ."
"A@@ d@@ d some L@@ S@@ D and some ques@@ tion@@ able war@@ dro@@ be cho@@ ices , and the whole world could be like B@@ ur@@ ning M@@ an ."
It seems likely that we would w@@ it@@ ness a level of we@@ al@@ th in@@ equality and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment that we have never seen before .
And what would the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans or the Ch@@ in@@ ese do if they heard that some comp@@ any in S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y was about to dep@@ lo@@ y a super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ I ?
"This machine would be cap@@ able of w@@ aging war , whether ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al or c@@ y@@ ber , with un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted power ."
This is a w@@ in@@ ner@@ -@@ ta@@ ke@@ -@@ all sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
So it seems that even m@@ ere r@@ um@@ ors of this kind of bre@@ ak@@ through could c@@ ause our spec@@ ies to go ber@@ ser@@ k .
"Now , one of the most fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things , in my view , at this moment , are the kinds of things that A@@ I resear@@ ch@@ ers say when they want to be reas@@ sur@@ ing ."
And the most common reason we &apos;re told not to wor@@ ry is time .
"This is all a long way off , don &apos;t you know ."
This is probably 50 or 100 years away .
"If intelligence is just a matter of information pro@@ cess@@ ing , and we contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve our mach@@ ines , we will pro@@ duce some form of super@@ intelligence ."
And we have no idea how long it will take us to create the condi@@ tions to do that sa@@ fe@@ ly .
We have no idea how long it will take us to create the condi@@ tions to do that sa@@ fe@@ ly .
"And if you ha@@ ven &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is 50 years in months .
This is how long we &apos;ve had the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ imp@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on tel@@ evi@@ sion .
F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years is not that much time to me@@ et one of the gre@@ at@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es our spec@@ ies will ever face .
"O@@ n@@ ce again , we seem to be fa@@ il@@ ing to have an appro@@ pri@@ ate emoti@@ onal respon@@ se to what we have every reason to believe is coming ."
The computer scienti@@ st S@@ tu@@ art R@@ us@@ s@@ ell has a n@@ ice anal@@ o@@ gy here .
"He said , imagine that we re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a mess@@ age from an ali@@ en civi@@ li@@ zation , which read : &quot; &quot; People of Earth , we will ar@@ ri@@ ve on your planet in 50 years ."
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just coun@@ ting down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship l@@ ands ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y than we do .
"They &apos;ll be gra@@ f@@ ted on@@ to our bra@@ ins , and we &apos;ll ess@@ enti@@ ally become their lim@@ bi@@ c syst@@ ems ."
"Now , this may in fact be the sa@@ f@@ est and only pr@@ u@@ dent pat@@ h for@@ ward , but u@@ su@@ ally one &apos;s sa@@ fe@@ ty con@@ cer@@ ns about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you s@@ tic@@ k it inside your head ."
"And given that the comp@@ an@@ ies and govern@@ ments doing this work are likely to per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve themselves as being in a r@@ ace against all others , given that to w@@ in this r@@ ace is to w@@ in the world , pro@@ vi@@ ded you don &apos;t dest@@ ro@@ y it in the next moment , then it seems likely that wh@@ at@@ ever is eas@@ ier to do will get done first ."
"Now , un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , I don &apos;t have a solu@@ tion to this problem , ap@@ art from re@@ comm@@ en@@ ding that more of us think about it ."
"But the moment we ad@@ m@@ it that information pro@@ cess@@ ing is the s@@ our@@ ce of intelligence , that some appro@@ pri@@ ate comp@@ ut@@ ational system is what the bas@@ is of intelligence is , and we ad@@ m@@ it that we will impro@@ ve these syst@@ ems contin@@ u@@ ously , and we ad@@ m@@ it that the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on of cogni@@ tion very likely far ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds what we curren@@ tly know , then we have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are in the process of building some sort of go@@ d ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
What do we te@@ ach our children about emoti@@ onal hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e ?
"&quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re feel@@ ing depres@@ sed ? J@@ ust s@@ ha@@ ke it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , ad@@ ults get tr@@ ic@@ ked this way as well , all the time ."
And then you &apos;ll be even more con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed you can &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed .
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people fun@@ c@@ tion b@@ el@@ ow their ac@@ tual p@@ ot@@ ential ."
"We were dri@@ ving with friends down a dark ro@@ ad at night , when a poli@@ ce c@@ ar st@@ op@@ ped us ."
Why ? Because of po@@ or emoti@@ onal hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
T@@ o r@@ um@@ in@@ ate means to ch@@ ew over .
He had vi@@ sible tu@@ m@@ ors all over his body .
And he had to start a har@@ sh course of ch@@ em@@ o@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
If they f@@ el@@ t better about themselves and more em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed ?
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He cre@@ ated this experiment that is used in many other experim@@ ents in behavi@@ or@@ al science .
I bring you into a room .
"He g@@ a@@ ther@@ ed his par@@ tici@@ pan@@ ts and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ c@@ enti@@ vi@@ ze them .
It d@@ ul@@ ls thinking and bloc@@ ks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m t@@ elling you , it &apos;s not even cl@@ ose ."
"R@@ e@@ wards , by their very nature , n@@ ar@@ row our fo@@ c@@ us , con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many c@@ ases ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not t@@ elling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who sp@@ on@@ so@@ red this resear@@ ch ?
The good news is that the scienti@@ sts who &apos;ve been stud@@ ying moti@@ v@@ ation have given us this new appro@@ ach .
A@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y : the ur@@ ge to direc@@ t our own lives .
M@@ ast@@ ery : the des@@ ire to get better and better at something that mat@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ ag@@ ement ."
M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement did not em@@ an@@ ate from nature .
S@@ ome@@ body inv@@ en@@ ted it .
"But if you want eng@@ ag@@ ement , self-@@ direc@@ tion works better ."
How many of you have heard of the comp@@ any A@@ t@@ l@@ assi@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ bly co@@ ol .
"A@@ ut@@ on@@ om@@ y , ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ pose , the building bloc@@ ks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another enc@@ y@@ c@@ lo@@ pe@@ dia got started ."
The dri@@ ve to do things c@@ ause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
J@@ o@@ e K@@ ow@@ an : I have st@@ age f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had st@@ age f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
"That &apos;s when I started wr@@ iting s@@ on@@ gs , and even then I only play@@ ed them for my@@ self ."
J@@ ust kno@@ wing my ro@@ om@@ mat@@ es were in the same h@@ ouse made me un@@ com@@ fort@@ able .
"But after a couple of years , just wr@@ iting s@@ on@@ gs wasn &apos;t enough ."
"I had all these stories and ideas , and I wanted to share them with people , but ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ log@@ ically , I couldn &apos;t do it ."
I had this ir@@ r@@ ational fear .
"But the more I wr@@ ote , and the more I pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed , the more I wanted to per@@ form ."
"So on the week of my 3@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day , I decided I was going to go to this loc@@ al op@@ en mi@@ c , and put this fear be@@ h@@ ind me ."
"Well , when I got there , it was p@@ ac@@ ked ."
There were like 20 people there .
( Laughter ) And they all looked an@@ gr@@ y .
"But I took a de@@ ep bre@@ ath , and I si@@ g@@ ned up to play , and I f@@ el@@ t pretty good ."
"@@ P@@ re@@ tty good , until about 10 minutes before my turn , when my whole body re@@ b@@ ell@@ ed , and this w@@ ave of an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty just was@@ h@@ ed over me ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sym@@ p@@ a@@ the@@ tic ner@@ v@@ ous system k@@ ic@@ ks in ."
"So you have a r@@ us@@ h of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , your heart r@@ ate incre@@ ases , your bre@@ a@@ thing gets fa@@ ster ."
"@@ N@@ ex@@ t your n@@ on@@ -@@ ess@@ ential syst@@ ems start to sh@@ ut down , like dig@@ es@@ tion . ( Laughter ) So your m@@ ou@@ th gets d@@ ry , and b@@ loo@@ d is r@@ ou@@ ted away from your extre@@ mi@@ ties , so your fin@@ g@@ ers don &apos;t work any@@ more ."
"Y@@ our pu@@ p@@ il@@ s di@@ l@@ ate , your mu@@ sc@@ les con@@ tr@@ act , your S@@ p@@ ide@@ y sense t@@ ing@@ les , basically your whole body is tri@@ gg@@ er@@ -@@ happy . ( Laughter ) That condi@@ tion is not conduc@@ i@@ ve to per@@ form@@ ing fol@@ k mu@@ sic . ( Laughter )"
"I mean , your ner@@ v@@ ous system is an i@@ di@@ ot ."
"R@@ e@@ ally ? T@@ w@@ o hundred thous@@ and years of human evolution , and it still can &apos;t tell the difference between a s@@ ab@@ er to@@ ot@@ h ti@@ ger and 20 fol@@ k@@ sing@@ ers on a T@@ u@@ es@@ day night op@@ en mi@@ c ?"
( Laughter ) I have never been more ter@@ ri@@ fied — until now .
"( Laughter and che@@ ers ) So then it was my turn , and some@@ how , I get my@@ self on@@ to the st@@ age , I start my s@@ ong , I op@@ en my m@@ ou@@ th to sing the first line , and this completely h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble vi@@ bra@@ to — you know , when your v@@ o@@ ice wa@@ ver@@ s — comes stre@@ am@@ ing out ."
"And this is not the good kind of vi@@ bra@@ to , like an oper@@ a s@@ in@@ ger has , this is my whole body just con@@ v@@ ul@@ sing with fear ."
"I mean , it &apos;s a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are ."
"I &apos;m em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed , the au@@ dience is c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , they &apos;re fo@@ c@@ used on my dis@@ com@@ for@@ t ."
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a sol@@ o sing@@ er@@ -@@ s@@ on@@ g@@ wr@@ it@@ er .
And something good did happen — I had the t@@ in@@ i@@ est little g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of that au@@ dience connec@@ tion that I was ho@@ ping for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness .
That night I prom@@ is@@ ed my@@ self : I would go back every week until I wasn &apos;t ner@@ v@@ ous any@@ more .
"And I did . I went back every single week , and sure enough , week after week , it didn &apos;t get any better . The same thing happened every week . ( Laughter ) I couldn &apos;t s@@ ha@@ ke it ."
And that &apos;s when I had an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any .
"And I remember it really well , because I don &apos;t have a lot of e@@ pi@@ ph@@ an@@ ies . ( Laughter ) A@@ ll I had to do was wr@@ ite a s@@ ong that exp@@ lo@@ its my ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness ."
"That only seems au@@ th@@ enti@@ c when I have st@@ age f@@ right , and the more ner@@ v@@ ous I was , the better the s@@ ong would be . E@@ as@@ y ."
So I started wr@@ iting a s@@ ong about having st@@ age f@@ right .
"F@@ ir@@ st , f@@ ess@@ ing up to the problem , the physical man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ations , how I would feel , how the li@@ st@@ en@@ er might feel ."
"And then ac@@ coun@@ ting for things like my s@@ ha@@ k@@ y v@@ o@@ ice , and I knew I would be sing@@ ing about a hal@@ f@@ -@@ oc@@ ta@@ ve high@@ er than norm@@ al , because I was ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"B@@ y having a s@@ ong that expl@@ ained what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the au@@ dience per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"They didn &apos;t have to feel bad for me because I was ner@@ v@@ ous , they could experience that with me , and we were all one big happy , ner@@ v@@ ous , un@@ com@@ fort@@ able family . ( Laughter ) B@@ y thinking about my au@@ dience , by em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing and exp@@ lo@@ iting my problem , I was able to take something that was bloc@@ king my progress , and turn it into something that was ess@@ ential for my suc@@ cess ."
And having the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong let me get past that bi@@ gg@@ est is@@ sue right in the beginning of a per@@ form@@ ance .
"And then I could move on , and play the rest of my s@@ on@@ gs with just a little bit more e@@ ase ."
"And even@@ tually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to play the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really ner@@ v@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be o@@ kay if I play@@ ed the st@@ age f@@ right s@@ ong for you ?"
( Applause ) C@@ an I have a si@@ p of water ?
( M@@ u@@ sic ) Thank you .

This is actually a pain@@ ting that h@@ an@@ gs at the C@@ oun@@ t@@ way L@@ i@@ br@@ ary at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard M@@ e@@ dic@@ al S@@ cho@@ ol .
And it sho@@ ws the first time an org@@ an was ever trans@@ plan@@ ted .
"In the front , you see , actually , J@@ o@@ e M@@ ur@@ r@@ ay getting the pati@@ ent ready for the trans@@ pl@@ ant , while in the back room you see H@@ ar@@ tw@@ ell H@@ ar@@ ri@@ son , the C@@ hi@@ e@@ f of U@@ ro@@ logy at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , actually har@@ v@@ est@@ ing the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y ."
The ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y was in@@ de@@ ed the first org@@ an ever to be trans@@ plan@@ ted to the human .
"That was back in 19@@ 5@@ 4 , 5@@ 5 years ago ."
Y@@ et we &apos;re still de@@ al@@ ing with a lot of the same chall@@ eng@@ es as many dec@@ ad@@ es ago .
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly many adv@@ anc@@ es , many lives sa@@ ved ."
But we have a maj@@ or sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of org@@ ans .
I@@ n the last dec@@ ad@@ e the number of patients wa@@ iting for a trans@@ pl@@ ant has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
"Wh@@ ile , at the same time , the ac@@ tual number of trans@@ plan@@ ts has re@@ ma@@ ined almost enti@@ re@@ ly fl@@ at ."
That really has to do with our aging population .
We &apos;re just getting ol@@ der .
M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine is doing a better job of ke@@ e@@ ping us ali@@ ve .
"But as we age , our org@@ ans t@@ end to fa@@ il more ."
"So , that &apos;s a chall@@ en@@ ge , not just for org@@ ans but also for ti@@ s@@ su@@ es ."
"T@@ r@@ ying to re@@ place pan@@ cre@@ as , trying to re@@ place ner@@ ves that can help us with P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s ."
Th@@ ese are maj@@ or is@@ su@@ es .
This is actually a very st@@ un@@ ning st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c .
E@@ very 30 secon@@ ds a pati@@ ent dies from dise@@ ases that could be tre@@ ated with ti@@ s@@ sue re@@ generation or re@@ plac@@ ement .
"So , what can we do about it ?"
We &apos;ve tal@@ ked about stem cells t@@ on@@ ight .
That &apos;s a way to do it .
"But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients , in ter@@ ms of ac@@ tual ther@@ ap@@ ies for org@@ ans ."
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if our bo@@ dies could re@@ gener@@ ate ?
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if we could actually har@@ ness the power of our bo@@ dies , to actually he@@ al ourselves ?"
"It &apos;s not really that fore@@ ig@@ n of a con@@ cept , actually ; it happens on the Earth every day ."
This is actually a picture of a s@@ al@@ am@@ an@@ der .
S@@ al@@ am@@ and@@ ers have this ama@@ zing cap@@ ac@@ ity to re@@ gener@@ ate .
You see here a little vide@@ o .
This is actually a lim@@ b in@@ j@@ ury in this s@@ al@@ am@@ an@@ der .
"And this is actually real ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y , tim@@ ed ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y , sho@@ wing how that lim@@ b re@@ gener@@ ates in a per@@ i@@ od of days ."
You see the sc@@ ar form .
And that sc@@ ar actually gro@@ ws out a new lim@@ b .
"So , s@@ al@@ am@@ and@@ ers can do it ."
Why can &apos;t we ? Why can &apos;t hum@@ ans re@@ gener@@ ate ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , we can re@@ gener@@ ate ."
Y@@ our body has many org@@ ans and every single org@@ an in your body has a c@@ ell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of in@@ j@@ ury . It happens every day .
"As you age , as you get ol@@ der ."
Y@@ our b@@ ones re@@ gener@@ ate every 10 years .
Y@@ our sk@@ in re@@ gener@@ ates every two wee@@ ks .
"So , your body is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ gener@@ ating ."
The chall@@ en@@ ge oc@@ cur@@ s when there is an in@@ j@@ ury .
"A@@ t the time of in@@ j@@ ury or disease , the body &apos;s first re@@ action is to se@@ al itself off from the rest of the body ."
"It basically wan@@ ts to fi@@ ght off in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion , and se@@ al itself , whether it &apos;s org@@ ans inside your body , or your sk@@ in , the first re@@ action is for sc@@ ar ti@@ s@@ sue to move in , to se@@ al itself off from the outside ."
"So , how can we har@@ ness that power ?"
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smar@@ t bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als .
"@@ How does this work ? Well , on the left side here you see a u@@ re@@ thr@@ a which was in@@ ju@@ red ."
This is the chan@@ ne@@ l that connec@@ ts the bl@@ ad@@ der to the outside of the body .
And you see that it is in@@ ju@@ red .
We basically found out that you can use these smar@@ t bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als that you can actually use as a bri@@ dge .
"If you build that bri@@ dge , and you cl@@ ose off from the outside environ@@ ment , then you can create that bri@@ dge , and cells that re@@ gener@@ ate in your body , can then cr@@ oss that bri@@ dge , and take that pat@@ h ."
That &apos;s exactly what you see here .
"It &apos;s actually a smar@@ t bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ al that we used , to actually treat this pati@@ ent ."
This was an in@@ ju@@ red u@@ re@@ thr@@ a on the left side .
We used that bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ al in the middle .
"And then , six months later on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side you see this re@@ engine@@ er@@ ed u@@ re@@ thr@@ a ."
"T@@ ur@@ ns out your body can re@@ gener@@ ate , but only for small dist@@ anc@@ es ."
The ma@@ x@@ im@@ um eff@@ ici@@ ent dist@@ ance for re@@ generation is only about one c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter .
"So , we can use these smar@@ t bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als but only for about one c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter to bri@@ dge those g@@ aps ."
"So , we do re@@ gener@@ ate , but for lim@@ ited dist@@ anc@@ es ."
"What do we do now , if you have in@@ j@@ ury for lar@@ ger org@@ ans ?"
What do we do when we have in@@ j@@ ur@@ ies for struc@@ tures which are much lar@@ ger than one c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter ?
Th@@ en we can start to use cells .
"The str@@ ate@@ gy here , is if a pati@@ ent comes in to us with a dise@@ as@@ ed or in@@ ju@@ red org@@ an , you can take a very small piece of ti@@ s@@ sue from that org@@ an , less than half the size of a pos@@ t@@ age st@@ am@@ p , you can then te@@ ase that ti@@ s@@ sue ap@@ art , and look at its bas@@ ic comp@@ on@@ ents , the pati@@ ent &apos;s own cells , you take those cells out , grow and exp@@ and those cells outside the body in large qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties , and then we then use sc@@ aff@@ old materi@@ als ."
"T@@ o the n@@ a@@ ked ey@@ e they look like a piece of your bl@@ ouse , or your sh@@ ir@@ t , but actually these materi@@ als are fa@@ ir@@ ly comple@@ x and they are desig@@ ned to de@@ gra@@ de once inside the body ."
It dis@@ in@@ te@@ gr@@ ates a few months later .
It &apos;s ac@@ ting only as a c@@ ell de@@ li@@ very ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
"It &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the cells into the body . It &apos;s al@@ lowing the cells to re@@ gener@@ ate new ti@@ s@@ sue , and once the ti@@ s@@ sue is re@@ gener@@ ated the sc@@ aff@@ old goes away ."
And that &apos;s what we did for this piece of mu@@ sc@@ le .
This is actually sho@@ wing a piece of mu@@ sc@@ le and how we go through the struc@@ tures to actually engine@@ er the mu@@ sc@@ le .
"We take the cells , we exp@@ and them , we place the cells on the sc@@ aff@@ old , and we then place the sc@@ aff@@ old back into the pati@@ ent ."
"But actually , before plac@@ ing the sc@@ aff@@ old into the pati@@ ent , we actually ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se it ."
"We want to make sure that we condi@@ tion this mu@@ sc@@ le , so that it kno@@ ws what to do once we put it into the pati@@ ent ."
That &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here . You &apos;re seeing this mu@@ sc@@ le bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor actually ex@@ er@@ ci@@ sing the mu@@ sc@@ le back and for@@ th .
"O@@ kay . Th@@ ese are fl@@ at struc@@ tures that we see here , the mu@@ sc@@ le ."
What about other struc@@ tures ?
This is actually an engine@@ er@@ ed b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
"@@ V@@ ery sim@@ il@@ ar to what we just did , but a little bit more comple@@ x ."
"@@ Here we take a sc@@ aff@@ old , and we basically — sc@@ aff@@ old can be like a piece of p@@ ap@@ er here ."
And we can then tu@@ b@@ ul@@ ari@@ ze this sc@@ aff@@ old .
"And what we do is we , to make a b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l , same str@@ ate@@ gy ."
A b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l is made up of two different c@@ ell typ@@ es .
"We take mu@@ sc@@ le cells , we p@@ ast@@ e , or co@@ at the outside with these mu@@ sc@@ le cells , very much like b@@ a@@ king a l@@ ay@@ er c@@ a@@ ke , if you will ."
You place the mu@@ sc@@ le cells on the outside .
You place the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l l@@ in@@ ing cells on the inside .
You now have your fully see@@ ded sc@@ aff@@ old .
You &apos;re going to place this in an o@@ ven@@ -@@ like dev@@ ice .
"It has the same condi@@ tions as a human body , 3@@ 7 de@@ gre@@ es c@@ enti@@ gra@@ de , 9@@ 5 percent oxy@@ g@@ en ."
"You then ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se it , as what you saw on that t@@ ap@@ e ."
And on the right you actually see a car@@ ot@@ id ar@@ ter@@ y that was engine@@ er@@ ed .
This is actually the ar@@ ter@@ y that goes from your nec@@ k to your brain .
"And this is an X@@ -@@ r@@ ay sho@@ wing you the pat@@ ent , fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l ."
"M@@ ore comple@@ x struc@@ tures such as b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ sel@@ s , u@@ re@@ thr@@ as , which I sho@@ wed you , they &apos;re defin@@ it@@ ely more comple@@ x because you &apos;re int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ing two different c@@ ell typ@@ es ."
But they are really ac@@ ting m@@ os@@ tly as con@@ du@@ its .
You &apos;re al@@ lowing flu@@ id or air to go through at ste@@ ad@@ y st@@ ates .
They are not ne@@ arly as comple@@ x as ho@@ l@@ low org@@ ans .
"H@@ ol@@ low org@@ ans have a much high@@ er de@@ gre@@ e of comple@@ x@@ ity , because you &apos;re as@@ king these org@@ ans to act on de@@ m@@ and ."
"So , the bl@@ ad@@ der is one such org@@ an ."
"S@@ ame str@@ ate@@ gy , we take a very small piece of the bl@@ ad@@ der , less than half the size of a pos@@ t@@ age st@@ am@@ p ."
"We then te@@ ase the ti@@ s@@ sue ap@@ art into its two in@@ divi@@ du@@ al c@@ ell comp@@ on@@ ents , mu@@ sc@@ le , and these bl@@ ad@@ der speci@@ ali@@ zed cells ."
We grow the cells outside the body in large qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties .
It ta@@ kes about four wee@@ ks to grow these cells from the org@@ an .
We then take a sc@@ aff@@ old that we shap@@ e like a bl@@ ad@@ der .
We co@@ at the inside with these bl@@ ad@@ der l@@ in@@ ing cells .
We co@@ at the outside with these mu@@ sc@@ le cells .
We place it back into this o@@ ven@@ -@@ like dev@@ ice .
"F@@ rom the time you take that piece of ti@@ s@@ sue , six to eight wee@@ ks later you can put the org@@ an right back into the pati@@ ent ."
This actually sho@@ ws the sc@@ aff@@ old .
The material is actually being co@@ ated with the cells .
Wh@@ en we did the first cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ al for these patients we actually cre@@ ated the sc@@ aff@@ old speci@@ f@@ ically for each pati@@ ent .
"We br@@ ought patients in , six to eight wee@@ ks pri@@ or to their s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed sur@@ g@@ ery , did X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , and we then comp@@ os@@ ed a sc@@ aff@@ old speci@@ f@@ ically for that pati@@ ent &apos;s size p@@ el@@ vi@@ c c@@ a@@ vity ."
"For the second p@@ ha@@ se of the tri@@ als we just had different si@@ z@@ es , small , me@@ di@@ um , large and ex@@ tra@@ -@@ large ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
And I &apos;m sure everyone here wanted an ex@@ tra@@ -@@ large . R@@ ight ?
"( Laughter ) So , bl@@ ad@@ d@@ ers are defin@@ it@@ ely a little bit more comple@@ x than the other struc@@ tures ."
But there are other ho@@ l@@ low org@@ ans that have ad@@ ded comple@@ x@@ ity to it .
"This is actually a heart val@@ ve , which we engine@@ er@@ ed ."
And the way you engine@@ er this heart val@@ ve is the same str@@ ate@@ gy .
"We take the sc@@ aff@@ old , we se@@ ed it with cells , and you can now see here , the val@@ ve le@@ af@@ le@@ ts op@@ en@@ ing and cl@@ os@@ ing ."
We ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se these pri@@ or to im@@ plan@@ t@@ ation .
S@@ ame str@@ ate@@ gy .
And then the most comple@@ x are the so@@ li@@ d org@@ ans .
"For so@@ li@@ d org@@ ans , they &apos;re more comple@@ x because you &apos;re using a lot more cells per c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter ."
This is actually a simple so@@ li@@ d org@@ an like the e@@ ar .
It &apos;s now being see@@ ded with car@@ ti@@ l@@ age .
That &apos;s the o@@ ven@@ -@@ like dev@@ ice ; once it &apos;s co@@ ated it gets plac@@ ed there .
And then a few wee@@ ks later we can take out the car@@ ti@@ l@@ age sc@@ aff@@ old .
This is actually dig@@ its that we &apos;re engine@@ ering .
"Th@@ ese are being l@@ ay@@ er@@ ed , one l@@ ay@@ er at a time , first the b@@ one , we f@@ ill in the g@@ aps with car@@ ti@@ l@@ age ."
We then start ad@@ ding the mu@@ sc@@ le on top .
And you start l@@ ay@@ ering these so@@ li@@ d struc@@ tures .
"A@@ g@@ ain , fa@@ ir@@ ly more comple@@ x org@@ ans , but by far , the most comple@@ x so@@ li@@ d org@@ ans are actually the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed , high@@ ly v@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed , a lot of b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l sup@@ ply , org@@ ans such as the heart , the li@@ ver , the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys ."
This is actually an example — se@@ ver@@ al str@@ ate@@ gi@@ es to engine@@ er so@@ li@@ d org@@ ans .
This is actually one of the str@@ ate@@ gi@@ es . We use a prin@@ ter .
"And instead of using ink , we use — you just saw an in@@ k@@ j@@ et car@@ tri@@ dge — we just use cells ."
This is actually your typ@@ ical des@@ k@@ top prin@@ ter .
"It &apos;s actually prin@@ ting this two cha@@ m@@ ber heart , one l@@ ay@@ er at a time ."
"You see the heart coming out there . It ta@@ kes about 40 minutes to prin@@ t , and about four to six hours later you see the mu@@ sc@@ le cells con@@ tr@@ act ."
"( Applause ) This technology was develop@@ ed by T@@ a@@ o J@@ u , who worked at our in@@ stitu@@ te ."
"And this is actually still , of course , experim@@ ental , not for use in patients ."
A@@ no@@ ther str@@ ate@@ gy that we have fol@@ lowed is actually to use dec@@ ell@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed org@@ ans .
"We actually take d@@ on@@ or org@@ ans , org@@ ans that are disc@@ ar@@ ded , and we then can use very mi@@ ld de@@ ter@@ g@@ ents to take all the c@@ ell el@@ em@@ ents out of these org@@ ans ."
"So , for example on the left pan@@ el , top pan@@ el , you see a li@@ ver ."
"We actually take the d@@ on@@ or li@@ ver , we use very mi@@ ld de@@ ter@@ g@@ ents , and we , by using these mi@@ ld de@@ ter@@ g@@ ents , we take all the cells out of the li@@ ver ."
"T@@ w@@ o wee@@ ks later , we basically can li@@ ft this org@@ an up , it fe@@ els like a li@@ ver , we can hold it like a li@@ ver , it looks like a li@@ ver , but it has no cells ."
"A@@ ll we are left with is the sk@@ el@@ et@@ on , if you will , of the li@@ ver , all made up of coll@@ ag@@ en , a material that &apos;s in our bo@@ dies , that will not re@@ ject ."
We can use it from one pati@@ ent to the next .
We then take this v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar struc@@ ture and we can pro@@ ve that we re@@ tain the b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l sup@@ ply .
"You can see , actually that &apos;s a flu@@ or@@ os@@ cop@@ y ."
We &apos;re actually in@@ jec@@ ting con@@ tr@@ ast into the org@@ an .
Now you can see it start . We &apos;re in@@ jec@@ ting the con@@ tr@@ ast into the org@@ an into this dec@@ ell@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed li@@ ver .
And you can see the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar t@@ ree that re@@ ma@@ ins int@@ act .
"We then take the cells , the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar cells , b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ se@@ l cells , we per@@ fu@@ se the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar t@@ ree with the pati@@ ent &apos;s own cells ."
We per@@ fu@@ se the outside of the li@@ ver with the pati@@ ent &apos;s own li@@ ver cells .
And we can then create fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal li@@ ver@@ s .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
"This is still experim@@ ental . But we are able to actually re@@ pro@@ duce the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ality of the li@@ ver struc@@ ture , experim@@ ent@@ ally ."
"For the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y , as I tal@@ ked to you about the first pain@@ ting that you saw , the first sli@@ de I sho@@ wed you , 90 percent of the patients on the trans@@ pl@@ ant wa@@ it li@@ st are wa@@ iting for a ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y , 90 percent ."
"So , another str@@ ate@@ gy we &apos;re fol@@ lowing is actually to create w@@ af@@ ers that we st@@ ack together , like an ac@@ cor@@ di@@ on , if you will ."
"So , we st@@ ack these w@@ af@@ ers together , using the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y cells ."
And then you can see these min@@ i@@ ature ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys that we &apos;ve engine@@ er@@ ed .
They are actually making ur@@ ine .
"A@@ g@@ ain , small struc@@ tures , our chall@@ en@@ ge is how to make them lar@@ ger , and that is something we &apos;re working on right now at the in@@ stitu@@ te ."
One of the things that I wanted to sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ze for you then is what is a str@@ ate@@ gy that we &apos;re going for in re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine .
"If at all possible , we really would like to use smar@@ t bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als that we can just take off the sh@@ el@@ f and re@@ gener@@ ate your org@@ ans ."
"We are lim@@ ited with dist@@ anc@@ es right now , but our go@@ al is actually to increase those dist@@ anc@@ es over time ."
"If we cannot use smar@@ t bi@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells ."
Why ? Because they will not re@@ ject .
"We can take cells from you , create the struc@@ ture , put it right back into you , they will not re@@ ject ."
"And if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very speci@@ fic org@@ an ."
If you present with a dise@@ as@@ ed w@@ ind pi@@ pe we &apos;d like to take cells from your w@@ in@@ d@@ pi@@ pe .
If you present with a dise@@ as@@ ed pan@@ cre@@ as we &apos;d like to take cells from that org@@ an .
Why ? Because we &apos;d rather take those cells which already know that those are the c@@ ell typ@@ es you want .
A w@@ in@@ d@@ pi@@ pe c@@ ell already kno@@ ws it &apos;s a w@@ in@@ d@@ pi@@ pe c@@ ell .
We don &apos;t need to te@@ ach it to become another c@@ ell t@@ y@@ pe .
"So , we pre@@ f@@ er org@@ an@@ -@@ speci@@ fic cells ."
"And today we can ob@@ tain cells from most every org@@ an in your body , ex@@ cept for se@@ ver@@ al which we still need stem cells for , like heart , li@@ ver , ner@@ ve and pan@@ cre@@ as ."
And for those we still need stem cells .
If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we &apos;d like to use d@@ on@@ or stem cells .
And we pre@@ f@@ er cells that will not re@@ ject and will not form tu@@ m@@ ors .
"And we &apos;re working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago , stem cells from the am@@ ni@@ ot@@ ic flu@@ id , and the plac@@ ent@@ a , which have those pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"So , at this point , I do want to tell you that some of the maj@@ or chall@@ eng@@ es we have ."
"You know , I just sho@@ wed you this pres@@ ent@@ ation , everything looks so good , everything works . A@@ c@@ tually no , these techno@@ logi@@ es really are not that easy ."
S@@ ome of the work you saw today was per@@ form@@ ed by over 7@@ 00 resear@@ ch@@ ers at our in@@ stitu@@ te across a 20@@ -@@ year time sp@@ an .
"So , these are very t@@ ough techno@@ logi@@ es ."
O@@ n@@ ce you get the form@@ ul@@ a right you can re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate it .
But it ta@@ kes a lot to get there .
"So , I always like to show this car@@ to@@ on ."
This is how to stop a run@@ away st@@ age .
"And there you see the st@@ ag@@ ec@@ o@@ ach dri@@ ver , and he goes , on the top pan@@ el , He goes A , B , C , D , E , F@@ ."
He fin@@ ally st@@ op@@ s the run@@ away st@@ age .
"And those are u@@ su@@ ally the bas@@ ic scienti@@ sts , The bot@@ tom is u@@ su@@ ally the sur@@ ge@@ ons ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m a sur@@ ge@@ on so that &apos;s not that fun@@ n@@ y . ( Laughter )
But actually me@@ th@@ od A is the cor@@ rec@@ t appro@@ ach .
"And what I mean by that is that any@@ time we &apos;ve lau@@ n@@ ched one of these techno@@ logi@@ es to the cl@@ in@@ ic , we &apos;ve made ab@@ solu@@ tely sure that we do everything we can in the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory before we ever lau@@ n@@ ch these techno@@ logi@@ es to patients ."
And when we lau@@ n@@ ch these techno@@ logi@@ es to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very t@@ ough question .
"A@@ re you ready to place this in your own lo@@ ved one , your own child , your own family mem@@ ber , and then we pro@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Because our ma@@ in go@@ al , of course , is first , to do no har@@ m ."
"I &apos;m going to show you now , a very sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p , It &apos;s a five second c@@ li@@ p of a pati@@ ent who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved one of the engine@@ er@@ ed org@@ ans ."
We started im@@ plan@@ ting some of these struc@@ tures over 1@@ 4 years ago .
"So , we have patients now wal@@ king around with org@@ ans , engine@@ er@@ ed org@@ ans , for over 10 years , as well ."
I &apos;m going to show a c@@ li@@ p of one young l@@ ad@@ y .
"S@@ he had a sp@@ ina bi@@ fi@@ d@@ a de@@ f@@ ect , a sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d ab@@ norm@@ ality ."
She did not have a norm@@ al bl@@ ad@@ der . This is a se@@ g@@ ment from C@@ N@@ N .
We are just taking five secon@@ ds .
This is a se@@ g@@ ment that S@@ an@@ j@@ ay G@@ up@@ t@@ a actually took care of .
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : K@@ a@@ it@@ l@@ y@@ n M : I &apos;m happy . I was always af@@ ra@@ id that I was going to have like , an ac@@ ci@@ dent or something ."
"And now I can just go and go out with my friends , go do wh@@ at@@ ever I want ."
"A@@ n@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ tal@@ a : S@@ e@@ e , at the end of the day , the prom@@ ise of re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is a single prom@@ ise ."
"And that is really very simple , to make our patients better ."
Thank you for your att@@ en@@ tion .
( Applause )
"I@@ mag@@ ine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the size of a go@@ l@@ f b@@ all .
So en@@ vi@@ sion what it looks like all wr@@ app@@ ed up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredi@@ ble things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel lo@@ ved and ap@@ preci@@ ated like never before and re@@ con@@ n@@ ect with friends and ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ t@@ anc@@ es you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ d@@ or@@ ation and ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ation will over@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ de@@ fine your sense of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ality and fa@@ ith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and tr@@ ust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ p@@ ass@@ ed v@@ it@@ ality and energy .
"You &apos;ll exp@@ and your v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , me@@ et new people , and you &apos;ll have a health@@ ier li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation of doing ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing .
You &apos;ll e@@ at coun@@ t@@ less g@@ our@@ m@@ et me@@ als .
F@@ low@@ ers will ar@@ ri@@ ve by the tr@@ uc@@ k@@ lo@@ ad .
"@@ People will say to you , &quot; You look great . H@@ ave you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a li@@ fe@@ time sup@@ ply of good dru@@ gs .
"You &apos;ll be chall@@ eng@@ ed , insp@@ i@@ red , moti@@ v@@ ated and hum@@ bl@@ ed ."
Y@@ our life will have new mean@@ ing .
"@@ Pe@@ ace , health , ser@@ en@@ ity , happiness , n@@ ir@@ v@@ an@@ a ."
The pr@@ ice ?
"@@ $ 5@@ 5@@ ,000 , and that &apos;s an incredi@@ ble de@@ al ."
B@@ y now I know you &apos;re d@@ ying to know what it is and where you can get one .
D@@ o@@ es A@@ ma@@ z@@ on car@@ ry it ?
D@@ o@@ es it have the Ap@@ ple lo@@ go on it ?
I@@ s there a wa@@ iting li@@ st ?
Not likely .
This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wr@@ app@@ ed up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a r@@ are ge@@ m — a brain tu@@ m@@ or , h@@ em@@ an@@ gi@@ o@@ bl@@ ast@@ om@@ a — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ e@@ ps on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m o@@ kay now , I wouldn &apos;t w@@ ish this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ oun@@ dly al@@ ter@@ ed my life in ways I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect in all the ways I just s@@ ha@@ red with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s un@@ exp@@ ected , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , consi@@ der that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
"S@@ ome 1@@ 7 years ago , I bec@@ ame all@@ er@@ gi@@ c to D@@ el@@ h@@ i &apos;s air ."
"M@@ y doc@@ tors told me that my l@@ un@@ g cap@@ ac@@ ity had g@@ one down to 7@@ 0 percent , and it was k@@ ill@@ ing me ."
"W@@ ith the help of I@@ I@@ T , TE@@ R@@ I , and lear@@ n@@ ings from N@@ A@@ S@@ A , we disc@@ over@@ ed that there are three bas@@ ic gre@@ en plan@@ ts , common gre@@ en plan@@ ts , with which we can grow all the f@@ res@@ h air we need in@@ do@@ ors to keep us health@@ y ."
"We &apos;ve also found that you can re@@ duce the f@@ res@@ h air requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments into the building , while ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ing in@@ du@@ str@@ y in@@ do@@ or a@@ ir@@ -@@ qu@@ ality st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds ."
"The three plan@@ ts are A@@ rec@@ a p@@ al@@ m , M@@ o@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ L@@ a@@ w &apos;s T@@ on@@ gu@@ e and money pl@@ ant ."
The bot@@ an@@ ical nam@@ es are in front of you .
A@@ rec@@ a p@@ al@@ m is a pl@@ ant which re@@ mo@@ ves C@@ O@@ 2 and con@@ ver@@ ts it into oxy@@ g@@ en .
"We need four sh@@ oul@@ der@@ -@@ high plan@@ ts per person , and in ter@@ ms of pl@@ ant care , we need to wi@@ pe the le@@ a@@ ves every day in D@@ el@@ h@@ i , and perhaps once a week in c@@ le@@ an@@ er@@ -@@ air ci@@ ties ."
"We had to grow them in ver@@ m@@ i man@@ ure , which is st@@ eri@@ le , or hy@@ d@@ rop@@ on@@ ics , and take them out@@ do@@ ors every three to four months ."
"The second pl@@ ant is M@@ o@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w &apos;s T@@ on@@ gu@@ e , which is again a very common pl@@ ant , and we call it a be@@ d@@ room pl@@ ant , because it con@@ ver@@ ts C@@ O@@ 2 into oxy@@ g@@ en at night ."
And we need six to eight wa@@ ist@@ -@@ high plan@@ ts per person .
"The thir@@ d pl@@ ant is money pl@@ ant , and this is again a very common pl@@ ant ; pre@@ fer@@ ably gro@@ ws in hy@@ d@@ rop@@ on@@ ics ."
And this particular pl@@ ant re@@ mo@@ ves form@@ al@@ de@@ hy@@ des and other v@@ ol@@ ati@@ le ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als .
"W@@ ith these three plan@@ ts , you can grow all the f@@ res@@ h air you need ."
"In fact , you could be in a bot@@ t@@ le with a c@@ ap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any f@@ res@@ h air ."
"We have tri@@ ed these plan@@ ts at our own building in D@@ el@@ h@@ i , which is a 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ s@@ qu@@ are@@ -@@ fe@@ et , 20@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old building ."
"And it has cl@@ ose to 1@@ ,@@ 200 such plan@@ ts for 3@@ 00 oc@@ c@@ up@@ an@@ ts ."
O@@ ur stu@@ dies have found that there is a 4@@ 2 percent prob@@ ability of one &apos;s b@@ loo@@ d oxy@@ g@@ en going up by one percent if one st@@ ays in@@ do@@ ors in this building for 10 hours .
The government of India has disc@@ over@@ ed or published a study to show that this is the health@@ i@@ est building in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i .
"And the study sho@@ wed that , comp@@ ared to other buil@@ d@@ ings , there is a re@@ duc@@ ed in@@ ci@@ dence of ey@@ e ir@@ r@@ it@@ ation by 5@@ 2 percent , resp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory syst@@ ems by 3@@ 4 percent , he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es by 2@@ 4 percent , l@@ un@@ g imp@@ a@@ ir@@ ment by 12 percent and as@@ th@@ m@@ a by n@@ ine percent ."
"And this study has been published on S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 8 , and it &apos;s av@@ a@@ il@@ able on the government of India we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ."
O@@ ur experience poin@@ ts to an ama@@ zing increase in human produc@@ ti@@ vity by over 20 percent by using these plan@@ ts .
"And also a re@@ duc@@ tion in energy requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments in buil@@ d@@ ings by an out@@ st@@ anding 15 percent , because you need less f@@ res@@ h air ."
"We are now re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating this in a 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 5@@ -@@ m@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ are@@ -@@ fe@@ et building , which will have 6@@ 0,000 in@@ do@@ or plan@@ ts ."
Why is this important ?
"It is also important for the environ@@ ment , because the world &apos;s energy requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments are exp@@ ected to grow by 30 percent in the next dec@@ ad@@ e ."
"@@ 40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buil@@ d@@ ings curren@@ tly , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buil@@ d@@ ings in ci@@ ties with a population of over one million in the next 15 years ."
And there is a gro@@ wing pre@@ fer@@ ence for living and working in a@@ ir@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed places .
"&quot; B@@ e the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i ."
And th@@ ank you for li@@ st@@ en@@ ing .
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ ra@@ id of wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od .
"@@ Not that I &apos;m not af@@ ra@@ id now , but I &apos;ve learned to pre@@ t@@ end ."
I &apos;ve learned to be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble .
"In fact , I &apos;ve develop@@ ed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ack in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were sup@@ posed to be kind and th@@ ough@@ t@@ ful and pretty and g@@ ent@@ le and so@@ ft , and we were sup@@ posed to f@@ it into ro@@ les that were sort of s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y — really not quite c@@ lear what we were sup@@ posed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were pl@@ ent@@ y of ro@@ le mo@@ d@@ els all around us .
"We had our mo@@ thers , our au@@ n@@ ts , our c@@ ous@@ ins , our sist@@ ers , and of course , the e@@ ver@@ -@@ present me@@ dia bomb@@ ar@@ ding us with imag@@ es and words , t@@ elling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"S@@ he was a h@@ ome@@ ma@@ ker , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ li@@ e things together , and she didn &apos;t bu@@ y me p@@ ink out@@ f@@ its ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ought me a book of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that hum@@ or was ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able in my family , I could d@@ ra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to spe@@ ak — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ v@@ al ."
I was lau@@ n@@ ched as a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know .

We &apos;re told what shap@@ e we &apos;re sup@@ posed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to we@@ ar — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our ha@@ ir — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the r@@ ul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly being mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ rec@@ ted , and the pri@@ mar@@ y po@@ lic@@ em@@ en are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the tra@@ di@@ tion ."
We p@@ ass it down from generation to generation .
Not only that — we always have this v@@ ag@@ ue n@@ oti@@ on that something &apos;s exp@@ ected of us .
"And on top of all off these r@@ ul@@ es , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it pu@@ ts us in a very ten@@ u@@ ous posi@@ tion . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these r@@ ul@@ es , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite aw@@ are that I &apos;m fol@@ lowing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hum@@ or ?"
H@@ um@@ or reli@@ es on the tra@@ di@@ tions of a society .
"It ta@@ kes what we know , and it tw@@ ists it ."
"It ta@@ kes the co@@ des of behavior and the co@@ des of d@@ ress , and it makes it un@@ exp@@ ected , and that &apos;s what e@@ lic@@ its a lau@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and hum@@ or ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground f@@ lo@@ or , and we know the tra@@ di@@ tions so well , we can bring a different v@@ o@@ ice to the t@@ able ."
Now I started d@@ ra@@ wing in the middle of a lot of cha@@ o@@ s .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ d@@ uring the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ igh@@ ts mov@@ ement , the ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ations , the W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate hear@@ ings and then the f@@ em@@ in@@ ist mov@@ ement , and I think I was d@@ ra@@ wing , trying to fig@@ ure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in cha@@ o@@ s , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with l@@ aughter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y parents got di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed , and my si@@ ster was ar@@ re@@ sted ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar high he@@ els , I didn &apos;t have to we@@ ar p@@ ink , and I could feel like I f@@ it in ."
"Now when I was a little ol@@ der , in my 20@@ s , I reali@@ zed there are not many women in car@@ to@@ on@@ ing ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can bre@@ ak the little gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing of car@@ to@@ on@@ ing , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I bec@@ ame a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always lo@@ ved political car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the cont@@ ent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the stu@@ p@@ id r@@ ul@@ es that we &apos;re fol@@ lowing as well as lau@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spec@@ tive is a partic@@ ul@@ arly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spec@@ tive is a partic@@ ul@@ arly American per@@ spec@@ tive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ ven though I &apos;ve tra@@ v@@ el@@ ed a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the r@@ ul@@ es that I &apos;m talking about are univers@@ al , of course — that each culture has its different co@@ des of behavior and d@@ ress and tra@@ di@@ tions , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , we have ."
"W@@ om@@ en , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tra@@ di@@ tion ."
We have ama@@ zing an@@ ten@@ n@@ a@@ e .
"Now my work l@@ ately has been to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ on@@ ists , which I so en@@ jo@@ y , and it &apos;s given me a gre@@ ater ap@@ preci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tru@@ th , to get at the is@@ su@@ es qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly and suc@@ c@@ inc@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the int@@ ell@@ ect , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has al@@ lowed me to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate with women car@@ to@@ on@@ ists from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ d@@ i A@@ r@@ ab@@ ia , I@@ r@@ an , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , A@@ r@@ g@@ ent@@ ina , F@@ r@@ ance — and we have s@@ at together and l@@ augh@@ ed and tal@@ ked and s@@ ha@@ red our diffic@@ ul@@ ties ."
And these women are working so hard to get their v@@ o@@ ices heard in some very difficult cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es .
But I feel bl@@ ess@@ ed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such str@@ ong per@@ cep@@ tions , because of our ten@@ u@@ ous posi@@ tion and our ro@@ le as tra@@ di@@ tion@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great p@@ ot@@ ential to be chan@@ ge@@ -@@ ag@@ ents ."
"And I think , I tru@@ ly believe , that we can change this thing one lau@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .

"Th@@ r@@ ough@@ out the history of compu@@ ters we &apos;ve been stri@@ ving to sh@@ or@@ ten the g@@ ap between us and dig@@ ital information , the g@@ ap between our physical world and the world in the scre@@ en where our imag@@ in@@ ation can go wi@@ ld ."
"But I wonder@@ ed , what if there could be no b@@ ound@@ ary at all ?"
I started to imagine what this would look like .
"F@@ ir@@ st , I cre@@ ated this to@@ ol which p@@ ene@@ tr@@ ates into the dig@@ ital space , so when you pres@@ s it hard on the scre@@ en , it trans@@ f@@ ers its physical body into pi@@ x@@ els ."
"D@@ es@@ ig@@ n@@ ers can materi@@ ali@@ ze their ideas direc@@ tly in 3@@ D , and sur@@ ge@@ ons can pr@@ acti@@ ce on vir@@ tual org@@ ans under@@ ne@@ ath the scre@@ en ."
"So with this to@@ ol , this b@@ ound@@ ary has been bro@@ ken ."
But our two h@@ ands still re@@ ma@@ in outside the scre@@ en .
How can you re@@ ach inside and inter@@ act with the dig@@ ital information using the ful@@ l de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity of our h@@ ands ?
"A@@ t M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ of@@ t Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed S@@ ci@@ ences , along with my m@@ ent@@ or C@@ at@@ i B@@ oul@@ an@@ ger , I re@@ desig@@ ned the computer and tur@@ ned a little space abo@@ ve the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard into a dig@@ ital wor@@ k@@ space ."
"( Applause ) Because w@@ in@@ do@@ ws and f@@ il@@ es have a posi@@ tion in the real space , sel@@ ec@@ ting them is as easy as gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing a book off your sh@@ el@@ f ."
"Th@@ en you can f@@ li@@ p through this book while high@@ ligh@@ ting the l@@ ines , words on the vir@@ tual tou@@ ch p@@ ad b@@ el@@ ow each f@@ lo@@ ating w@@ in@@ do@@ w ."
A@@ r@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts can stre@@ t@@ ch or r@@ ot@@ ate the mo@@ d@@ els with their two h@@ ands direc@@ tly .
"So in these exam@@ pl@@ es , we are re@@ ach@@ ing into the dig@@ ital world ."
But how about re@@ ver@@ sing its ro@@ le and having the dig@@ ital information re@@ ach us instead ?
But now you don &apos;t have to wor@@ ry about it .
This is a view that you get from he@@ ad@@ -@@ m@@ oun@@ ted or see@@ -@@ through dis@@ play when the system underst@@ ands the ge@@ ome@@ try of your body .
"T@@ a@@ king this idea f@@ ur@@ ther , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pi@@ x@@ els in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can tou@@ ch and feel it ?"
What would such a future look like ?
"A@@ t M@@ I@@ T M@@ e@@ dia L@@ a@@ b , along with my ad@@ vi@@ s@@ or H@@ ir@@ os@@ h@@ i I@@ shi@@ i and my coll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or R@@ e@@ h@@ m@@ i P@@ ost , we cre@@ ated this one physical pi@@ x@@ el ."
"Well , in this case , this sp@@ her@@ ical mag@@ net ac@@ ts like a 3@@ D pi@@ x@@ el in our space , which means that both compu@@ ters and people can move this ob@@ ject to any@@ where within this little 3@@ D space ."
What we did was ess@@ enti@@ ally canc@@ el@@ ing gra@@ vity and contro@@ l@@ ling the mov@@ ement by com@@ b@@ in@@ ing mag@@ ne@@ tic lev@@ it@@ ation and m@@ ech@@ an@@ ical ac@@ tu@@ ation and sen@@ sing techno@@ logi@@ es .
"And by dig@@ it@@ ally pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing the ob@@ ject , we are li@@ ber@@ ating the ob@@ ject from con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts of time and space , which means that now , human moti@@ ons can be rec@@ or@@ ded and play@@ ed back and left per@@ man@@ ently in the physical world ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents can use this as a to@@ ol to learn about the comple@@ x con@@ cep@@ ts such as plan@@ et@@ ary moti@@ on , physics , and un@@ like computer scre@@ ens or t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , this is a real , t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble experience that you can tou@@ ch and feel , and it &apos;s very po@@ wer@@ ful ."
And what &apos;s more exc@@ iting than just tur@@ ning what &apos;s curren@@ tly in the computer physical is to start imag@@ in@@ ing how pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing the world will al@@ ter even our d@@ a@@ ily physical acti@@ vi@@ ties .
"T@@ o@@ day , we started by talking about the b@@ ound@@ ary , but if we re@@ move this b@@ ound@@ ary , the only b@@ ound@@ ary left is our imag@@ in@@ ation ."

A@@ no@@ ther up@@ d@@ ate : You will rec@@ all I int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed you gu@@ ys to the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o T@@ r@@ ac@@ ker .
It &apos;s like a water do@@ w@@ sing dev@@ ice .
It &apos;s just a ho@@ l@@ low piece of pl@@ as@@ tic with an an@@ ten@@ n@@ a that s@@ wi@@ v@@ els around .
"And you wal@@ k around , and it poin@@ ts to things ."
"O@@ h , sor@@ ry . ( Laughter ) This particular one that was given to me fin@@ ds go@@ l@@ f b@@ all@@ s , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally if you &apos;re at a go@@ l@@ f course and you ch@@ ec@@ k under enough bu@@ sh@@ es ."
"Well , under the cat@@ eg@@ ory of &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the har@@ m of si@@ l@@ ly stuff like this ? &quot; &quot; this dev@@ ice , the A@@ D@@ E 6@@ 5@@ 1 , was so@@ ld to the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i government for 4@@ 0,000 dollars ap@@ i@@ ece ."
"It &apos;s just like this one , completely wor@@ th@@ less , in which it al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly worked by &quot; &quot; electr@@ os@@ t@@ atic mag@@ ne@@ tic i@@ on at@@ tr@@ action , &quot; &quot; which trans@@ l@@ ates to &quot; &quot; p@@ se@@ u@@ d@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic bal@@ on@@ ey &quot; &quot; — would be the n@@ ice word — in which you str@@ ing together a b@@ un@@ ch of words that sound good , but it does ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing ."
"In this case , at tre@@ sp@@ ass poin@@ ts , al@@ lowing people to go through because your little tr@@ ac@@ ker dev@@ ice said they were o@@ kay , actually c@@ ost lives ."
So what I want to talk about today is belie@@ f .
"I want to believe , and you do too ."
"And in fact , I think my the@@ s@@ is here is that belie@@ f is the natural state of things ."
It is the de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t op@@ tion . We just believe .
We believe all sor@@ ts of things .
"B@@ e@@ li@@ e@@ f is natural ; dis@@ belie@@ f , s@@ ke@@ p@@ tici@@ s@@ m , science , is not natural ."
It &apos;s un@@ com@@ fort@@ able to not believe things .
"So like F@@ o@@ x M@@ ul@@ der on &quot; &quot; X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , &quot; &quot; who wan@@ ts to believe in U@@ F@@ O@@ s ? Well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belie@@ f eng@@ ine in our bra@@ ins ."
"E@@ s@@ s@@ enti@@ ally , we are patter@@ n@@ -@@ see@@ king pri@@ mat@@ es ."
We con@@ n@@ ect the d@@ ots : A is connec@@ ted to B ; B is connec@@ ted to C@@ .
"And sometimes A really is connec@@ ted to B , and that &apos;s called as@@ soci@@ ation learning ."
"We find patterns , we make those connec@@ tions , whether it &apos;s P@@ av@@ lo@@ v &apos;s do@@ g here as@@ soci@@ ating the sound of the b@@ ell with the food , and then he s@@ ali@@ v@@ ates to the sound of the b@@ ell , or whether it &apos;s a S@@ kin@@ n@@ eri@@ an r@@ at , in which he &apos;s having an as@@ soci@@ ation between his behavior and a re@@ ward for it , and ther@@ e@@ fore he re@@ pe@@ at@@ s the behavior ."
"S@@ ome@@ times it was even sp@@ inning around tw@@ ice coun@@ ter@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ wi@@ se , once c@@ loc@@ k@@ wi@@ se and p@@ ec@@ k the k@@ ey tw@@ ice ."
"And that &apos;s called super@@ sti@@ tion , and that , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , we will always have with us ."
"When we do this process , we make two typ@@ es of er@@ r@@ ors ."
O@@ ur second t@@ y@@ pe of er@@ ro@@ r is a f@@ al@@ se ne@@ g@@ ative .
A T@@ y@@ pe I@@ I er@@ ro@@ r is not beli@@ ev@@ ing a patter@@ n is real when it is .
So let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
"Y@@ our name is L@@ uc@@ y , o@@ kay ?"
And you hear a ru@@ st@@ le in the gr@@ ass .
"I@@ s it a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous pre@@ dat@@ or , or is it just the w@@ ind ?"
Y@@ our next deci@@ sion could be the most important one of your life .
But no har@@ m . You just move away .
You &apos;ve just won a D@@ ar@@ w@@ in aw@@ ard .
You &apos;ve been taken out of the gen@@ e po@@ ol .
Now the problem here is that patter@@ n@@ ici@@ ties will oc@@ cu@@ r wh@@ en@@ ever the c@@ ost of making a T@@ y@@ pe I er@@ ro@@ r is less than the c@@ ost of making a T@@ y@@ pe I@@ I er@@ ro@@ r .
This is the only equ@@ ation in the talk by the way .
So the de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t posi@@ tion is just : B@@ e@@ li@@ e@@ ve all patterns are real — A@@ ll ru@@ st@@ les in the gr@@ ass are d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous pre@@ dat@@ ors and not just the w@@ ind .
And so I think that we ev@@ ol@@ ved ...
"So for example , what do you see here ?"
"It &apos;s a h@@ or@@ se head , that &apos;s right ."
It looks like a h@@ or@@ se . It must be a h@@ or@@ se .
That &apos;s a patter@@ n .
And is it really a h@@ or@@ se ?
O@@ r is it more like a f@@ ro@@ g ?
"Y@@ es , of course , it &apos;s a c@@ ow ."
S@@ ome people see a D@@ al@@ m@@ ati@@ an do@@ g .
"Y@@ es , there it is . And there &apos;s the pri@@ me ."
What do you see here ?
"@@ P@@ lan@@ et S@@ at@@ ur@@ n . Y@@ es , that &apos;s good ."
How about here ?
J@@ ust sh@@ out out anything you see .
"That &apos;s a good au@@ dience , Ch@@ r@@ is ."
"Because there &apos;s nothing in this . Well , al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing ."
This is an experiment done by J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er Wh@@ it@@ son at U.@@ T@@ . A@@ us@@ ti@@ n on cor@@ por@@ ate environ@@ ments and whether feel@@ ings of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty and out of control makes people see ill@@ us@@ ory patterns .
"@@ People that are put in a condi@@ tion of feel@@ ing out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly patter@@ n@@ less ."
"In other words , the pro@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ity to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a l@@ ack of control ."
Because fiel@@ d@@ ers are suc@@ cess@@ ful 90 to 9@@ 5 percent of the time .
The best b@@ at@@ ters fa@@ il se@@ ven out of 10 times .
"So their super@@ sti@@ tions , their patter@@ n@@ ici@@ ties , are all as@@ soci@@ ated with feel@@ ings of l@@ ack of control and so for@@ th ."
"What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?"
A@@ n@@ y@@ body see an ob@@ ject there ?
"There actually is something here , but it &apos;s de@@ gra@@ ded ."
"And those who sc@@ o@@ red high on the E@@ S@@ P sc@@ ale , ten@@ ded to not only see more patterns in the de@@ gra@@ ded imag@@ es but in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t patterns ."
Here is what you show sub@@ jects .
"A sim@@ il@@ ar experiment was done by another &#91; S@@ w@@ is@@ s &#93; psycho@@ logi@@ st nam@@ ed Pe@@ ter B@@ ru@@ g@@ ger , who found si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly more mean@@ ing@@ ful patterns were per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved on the right h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here , vi@@ a the left vi@@ su@@ al field , than the left h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here ."
"B@@ ru@@ g@@ ger and his colle@@ ag@@ ue , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ine M@@ o@@ h@@ r , gave sub@@ jects L@@ -@@ D@@ O@@ P@@ A ."
"@@ L@@ -@@ D@@ O@@ P@@ A &apos;s a dru@@ g , as you know , given for tre@@ ating P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease , which is rel@@ ated to a dec@@ re@@ ase in d@@ op@@ am@@ ine ."
L@@ -@@ D@@ O@@ P@@ A incre@@ ases d@@ op@@ am@@ ine .
A@@ n increase of d@@ op@@ am@@ ine cau@@ sed sub@@ jects to see more patterns than those that did not re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve the d@@ op@@ am@@ ine .
So d@@ op@@ am@@ ine appe@@ ar@@ s to be the dru@@ g as@@ soci@@ ated with patter@@ n@@ ic@@ ity .
"In fact , neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic dru@@ gs that are used to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate psy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ic behavior , things like par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , d@@ el@@ u@@ sions and h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ations , these are patter@@ n@@ ici@@ ties ."
They &apos;re in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t patterns . They &apos;re f@@ al@@ se posi@@ ti@@ ves . They &apos;re T@@ y@@ pe I er@@ r@@ ors .
"That is , you dec@@ re@@ ase the amount of d@@ op@@ am@@ ine , and their ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y to see patterns like that dec@@ reas@@ es ."
"O@@ n the other hand , am@@ ph@@ et@@ am@@ ines like co@@ c@@ a@@ ine are d@@ op@@ am@@ ine ag@@ on@@ ists ."
They increase the amount of d@@ op@@ am@@ ine .
"So you &apos;re more likely to feel in a e@@ u@@ ph@@ or@@ ic state , cre@@ ati@@ vity , find more patterns ."
"In fact , I saw R@@ ob@@ in W@@ illi@@ ams rec@@ ently talk about how he thought he was much fun@@ ni@@ er when he was doing co@@ c@@ a@@ ine , when he had that is@@ sue , than now ."
So perhaps more d@@ op@@ am@@ ine is rel@@ ated to more cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"D@@ op@@ am@@ ine , I think , changes our si@@ gn@@ al@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ no@@ ise r@@ ati@@ o ."
"That is , how ac@@ cur@@ ate we are in fin@@ ding patterns ."
You think people are talking about you .
"And if you go too far on that , that &apos;s just simply l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed as ma@@ d@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ tion perhaps we might make between two N@@ o@@ be@@ l lau@@ re@@ ates , R@@ ic@@ hard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man and J@@ o@@ h@@ n N@@ as@@ h ."
One se@@ es maybe just the right number of patterns to w@@ in a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze .
"The other one also , but maybe too many patterns ."
And we then call that s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ ni@@ a .
So the si@@ gn@@ al@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ no@@ ise r@@ ati@@ o then pres@@ ents us with a patter@@ n@@ -@@ de@@ t@@ ec@@ tion problem .
"And of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?"
And what patter@@ n do you see here ?
"A@@ g@@ ain , I &apos;m pu@@ tting your an@@ ter@@ i@@ or c@@ ing@@ ul@@ ate cor@@ te@@ x to the test here , cau@@ sing you con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting patter@@ n de@@ t@@ ec@@ tions ."
"You know , of course , this is V@@ ia U@@ no sho@@ es ."
Th@@ ese are s@@ and@@ als .
"@@ P@@ re@@ tty se@@ x@@ y fe@@ et , I must say ."
M@@ ay@@ be a little P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ ho@@ p@@ ped .
"And of course , the am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous fi@@ gu@@ res that seem to f@@ li@@ p@@ -@@ f@@ lo@@ p back and for@@ th ."
It turns out what you &apos;re thinking about a lot in@@ flu@@ ences what you t@@ end to see .
"And you see the l@@ am@@ p here , I know ."
Because the ligh@@ ts on here .
"You see a dol@@ ph@@ in here , and there &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in , and there &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in ."
"That &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in ta@@ il there , gu@@ ys ."
"( Laughter ) If we can give you con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting data , again , your A@@ C@@ C is going to be going into hy@@ per@@ dri@@ ve ."
"If you look down here , it &apos;s fine . If you look up here , then you get con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting data ."
The im@@ possible cr@@ ate ill@@ u@@ sion .
It &apos;s easy to fo@@ ol the brain in 2@@ D .
"So you say , &quot; &quot; A@@ w , come on S@@ her@@ m@@ er , any@@ body can do that in a P@@ sy@@ ch 1@@ 0@@ 1 t@@ ex@@ t with an ill@@ u@@ sion like that . &quot; &quot; Well here &apos;s the l@@ ate , great J@@ er@@ ry A@@ n@@ dr@@ us &apos; &quot; &quot; im@@ possible cr@@ ate &quot; &quot; ill@@ u@@ sion in 3@@ D , in which J@@ er@@ ry is st@@ anding inside the im@@ possible cr@@ ate ."
And he was kind enough to p@@ ost this and give us the re@@ ve@@ al .
This is a fa@@ ir@@ ly new one that th@@ ro@@ ws us off because of the con@@ f@@ lic@@ ting patterns of com@@ par@@ ing this ang@@ le with that ang@@ le .
"In fact , it &apos;s the ex@@ act same picture side by side ."
"So what you &apos;re doing is com@@ par@@ ing that ang@@ le instead of with this one , but with that one ."
And so your brain is fo@@ ol@@ ed .
Here &apos;s some fac@@ es on the side of a ro@@ ck .
I &apos;m actually not even sure if this is — this might be P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ ho@@ p@@ ped .
"But any@@ way , the point is still made ."
"In a qu@@ ick re@@ action , which one looks o@@ d@@ d ?"
The one on the left . O@@ kay . So I &apos;ll r@@ ot@@ ate it so it &apos;ll be the one on the right .
And you are cor@@ rec@@ t .
A fa@@ ir@@ ly fam@@ ous ill@@ u@@ sion — it was first done with Mar@@ g@@ are@@ t Th@@ at@@ ch@@ er .
"Now , they tr@@ ad@@ e up the poli@@ tici@@ ans every time ."
"Well , why is this happening ?"
"Well , we know exactly where it happens , in the t@@ em@@ por@@ al lo@@ be , right across , sort of abo@@ ve your e@@ ar there , in a little struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And there &apos;s two typ@@ es of cells that do this , that rec@@ or@@ d fac@@ i@@ al fe@@ atures e@@ ither glob@@ ally , or speci@@ f@@ ically these large , r@@ ap@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ fir@@ ing cells , first look at the gener@@ al face ."
And then you not@@ ice something quite a little bit o@@ d@@ d about the ey@@ es and the m@@ ou@@ th .
"E@@ speci@@ ally when they &apos;re up@@ side down , you &apos;re eng@@ aging that gener@@ al fac@@ i@@ al recogni@@ tion so@@ f@@ tw@@ are there ."
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
"Well , the w@@ ind is in@@ anim@@ ate ; the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous pre@@ dat@@ or is an int@@ enti@@ onal ag@@ ent ."
"That is the ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y to in@@ fu@@ se patterns with mean@@ ing , int@@ en@@ tion and ag@@ enc@@ y , often in@@ vi@@ sible be@@ ings from the top down ."
"This is an idea that we got from a f@@ el@@ low TE@@ D@@ ster here , D@@ an D@@ en@@ ne@@ t@@ t , who tal@@ ked about taking the int@@ enti@@ onal st@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s the belie@@ f that ali@@ ens are some@@ how more adv@@ anc@@ ed than us , more moral than us , and the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves always are that they &apos;re coming here to sa@@ ve us and re@@ sc@@ ue us from on high ."
"The intellig@@ ent desig@@ ner &apos;s always por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed as this sup@@ er intellig@@ ent , moral being that comes down to desig@@ n life ."
"And this is also , I think , the bas@@ is of con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy the@@ ories ."
"But this is a patter@@ n de@@ t@@ ec@@ tion problem , isn &apos;t it ?"
S@@ ome patterns are real and some are not .
W@@ as J@@ F@@ K ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ated by a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy or by a l@@ one ass@@ ass@@ in ?
"Well , if you go there — there &apos;s people there on any given day — like when I went there , here — sho@@ wing me where the different sho@@ ot@@ ers were ."
My fav@@ or@@ ite one was he was in the man@@ hole .
"And he pop@@ ped out at the last second , took that sho@@ t ."
"Because , let &apos;s face it , some patterns are real ."
"E@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ s a lot , maybe ."
And 9 / 11 has a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy theory . It is a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy .
Because it worked .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we are nat@@ ur@@ al@@ -@@ born du@@ ali@@ sts .
O@@ ur ag@@ en@@ tic@@ ity process comes from the fact that we can en@@ jo@@ y mo@@ vi@@ es like these .
"Because we can imagine , in ess@@ ence , contin@@ u@@ ing on ."
"O@@ r you can do it through l@@ oss of consciousness , by ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating in a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge ."
"You get a hy@@ po@@ x@@ ia , or a lo@@ wer oxy@@ g@@ en ."
And the brain then sen@@ ses that there &apos;s an out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ body experience .
So I &apos;m going to end here with a sh@@ ort vide@@ o c@@ li@@ p that sort of br@@ ings all this together .
It &apos;s just a minut@@ e and a half .
It ties together all this into the power of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation and the power of belie@@ f .
G@@ o a@@ head and ro@@ ll it .
"W@@ om@@ an : We &apos;re ho@@ ping we can use part of this in a national comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al , right ?"
And this is test on some li@@ p bal@@ ms that we have over here .
"And these are our mo@@ d@@ els who are going to help us , R@@ o@@ ger and M@@ at@@ t ."
"And we have our own li@@ p bal@@ m , and we have a lead@@ ing br@@ and ."
W@@ ould you have any problem k@@ is@@ sing our mo@@ d@@ els to test it ?
G@@ ir@@ l : No .
I &apos;m going to ask you to go a@@ head and put a bl@@ in@@ d@@ fo@@ ld on .
"@@ G@@ ir@@ l : Y@@ es . ( W@@ om@@ an : O@@ kay . ) Now , what I &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it prot@@ ec@@ ts your li@@ ps , the t@@ ex@@ ture , right , and maybe if you can disc@@ er@@ n any fl@@ av@@ or or not ."
G@@ ir@@ l : O@@ kay . ( W@@ om@@ an : H@@ ave you ever done a k@@ is@@ sing test before ? ) G@@ ir@@ l : No .
W@@ om@@ an : T@@ a@@ ke a ste@@ p here .
"O@@ kay , now I &apos;m going to ask you to p@@ uc@@ ker up ."
"@@ P@@ uc@@ ker up big and le@@ an in just a little bit , o@@ kay ?"
( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) W@@ om@@ an : O@@ kay .
"And , J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er , how did that feel ?"
J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er : G@@ ood .
( Laughter ) G@@ ir@@ l : O@@ h my G@@ od ! ( Laughter )
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ her@@ m@@ er : Thank you very much . Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks .
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We st@@ um@@ bl@@ ed on your vide@@ o on dec@@ im@@ als , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ mi@@ tive .
And the K@@ h@@ an A@@ c@@ a@@ de@@ my vide@@ o@@ s are there .
G@@ re@@ en means the stud@@ ent &apos;s already prof@@ ici@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
in a gra@@ du@@ ate school of education who is wat@@ ch@@ ing a prof@@ ess@@ or b@@ ab@@ ble on and on about eng@@ ag@@ ement in the most dis@@ eng@@ aging way possible . R@@ ight now
"@@ there &apos;s a fir@@ st@@ -@@ year teacher at home who is p@@ our@@ ing through l@@ es@@ son pl@@ ans trying to make sense of st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds , who is trying to make sense of how to gra@@ de students appro@@ pri@@ ately , while at the same time saying to her@@ self over and over again , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t s@@ mi@@ le ti@@ ll N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber , &quot; because that &apos;s what she was t@@ au@@ ght in her teacher education program ."
"R@@ ight now there &apos;s a stud@@ ent who is coming up with a way to con@@ v@@ ince his mo@@ m or d@@ ad that he &apos;s very , very s@@ ick and can &apos;t make it to school tom@@ or@@ row ."
"R@@ ight now there is also a person who has an enti@@ re au@@ dience r@@ ap@@ t with att@@ en@@ tion , a person that is we@@ a@@ ving a po@@ wer@@ ful n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative about a world that the people who are li@@ st@@ en@@ ing have never imag@@ ined or seen before , but if they cl@@ ose their ey@@ es ti@@ gh@@ tly enough , they can en@@ vi@@ sion that world because the st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ elling is so comp@@ elling ."
R@@ ight now .
"So people will then say , &quot; &quot; Well , Ch@@ r@@ is , you descri@@ be the guy who is going through some aw@@ ful tr@@ ain@@ ing but you &apos;re also descri@@ b@@ ing these po@@ wer@@ ful educ@@ at@@ ors ."
"If you &apos;re thinking about the world of education or ur@@ b@@ an education in particular , these gu@@ ys will probably canc@@ el each other out , and then we &apos;ll be o@@ kay . &quot; &quot; The reality is , the fol@@ ks I descri@@ bed as the ma@@ ster teachers , the ma@@ ster n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative buil@@ d@@ ers , the ma@@ ster st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers are far re@@ mo@@ ved from cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s ."
The fol@@ ks who know the sk@@ ills about how to te@@ ach and eng@@ age an au@@ dience don &apos;t even know what teacher cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation means .
They may not even have the de@@ gre@@ es to be able to have anything to call an education .
And that to me is sa@@ d .
"It &apos;s sa@@ d because the people who I descri@@ bed , they were very dis@@ interest@@ ed in the learning process , want to be effec@@ tive teachers , but they have no mo@@ d@@ els ."
I &apos;m going to par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se Mar@@ k T@@ w@@ ain .
"M@@ ar@@ k T@@ w@@ ain says that pro@@ per pre@@ par@@ ation , or teach@@ ing , is so po@@ wer@@ ful that it can turn bad mor@@ als to good , it can turn aw@@ ful pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es into po@@ wer@@ ful ones , it can change men and trans@@ form them into ang@@ els ."
"The fol@@ ks who I descri@@ bed ear@@ li@@ er got pro@@ per pre@@ par@@ ation in teach@@ ing , not in any colle@@ ge or univers@@ ity , but by vir@@ tu@@ e of just being in the same sp@@ ac@@ es of those who eng@@ age ."
"B@@ ar@@ ber sho@@ ps , ra@@ p con@@ cer@@ ts , and most import@@ an@@ tly , in the black ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
And I &apos;ve been fr@@ am@@ ing this idea called P@@ ent@@ ec@@ os@@ t@@ al pe@@ d@@ ag@@ o@@ gy .
We got a couple of h@@ ands .
"You go to a black ch@@ ur@@ ch , their pre@@ acher star@@ ts off and he reali@@ z@@ es that he has to eng@@ age the au@@ dience , so he star@@ ts off with this sort of wor@@ d@@ play in the beginning of@@ t@@ enti@@ m@@ es , and then he ta@@ kes a p@@ ause , and he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my g@@ os@@ h , they &apos;re not quite p@@ ay@@ ing att@@ en@@ tion . &quot; &quot; So he says , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I get an am@@ en ? &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ men ."
Ch@@ r@@ is E@@ m@@ d@@ in : So I can I get an am@@ en ? A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ men .
"C@@ E : And all of a su@@ dd@@ en , everybody &apos;s re@@ aw@@ o@@ ken ."
That pre@@ acher b@@ an@@ gs on the pul@@ p@@ it for att@@ en@@ tion .
"He dro@@ ps his v@@ o@@ ice at a very , very low v@@ olu@@ me when he wan@@ ts people to k@@ ey into him , and those things are the sk@@ ills that we need for the most eng@@ aging teachers ."
"So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the bas@@ ic sk@@ ills , that mag@@ ic that you need to eng@@ age an au@@ dience , to eng@@ age a stud@@ ent ?"
"So I make the ar@@ g@@ ument that we re@@ f@@ ra@@ me teacher education , that we could fo@@ c@@ us on cont@@ ent , and that &apos;s fine , and we could fo@@ c@@ us on the@@ ories , and that &apos;s fine , but cont@@ ent and the@@ ories with the ab@@ s@@ ence of the mag@@ ic of teach@@ ing and learning means nothing ."
"And when they try to descri@@ be what that is , they just say , &quot; &quot; He has that mag@@ ic . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m here to tell you that mag@@ ic can be t@@ au@@ ght ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , I asked this question when I was a little k@@ id ."
"S@@ ome got k@@ ill@@ ed , and some did it without dru@@ g assi@@ st@@ ance ."
And then the next ste@@ p is another 15 v@@ ol@@ ts .
They said only one percent .
M@@ il@@ gram did more than 1@@ 6 stu@@ dies .
And it happens when you &apos;re in a new or un@@ fam@@ ili@@ ar sit@@ u@@ ation .
A white guy f@@ all@@ s on the tr@@ ac@@ ks .
"T@@ a@@ ke pat@@ h one , you &apos;re going to be a per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ or of evi@@ l ."
"You &apos;re going to che@@ at , or you &apos;re going to al@@ low b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary cl@@ a@@ im@@ s requ@@ ire ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary evidence , and it is my job , my respon@@ si@@ bility , as an astron@@ om@@ er to re@@ mind people that ali@@ en hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses should always be a last res@@ ort ."
"It inv@@ ol@@ ves data from a N@@ A@@ S@@ A mis@@ sion , ordin@@ ary people and one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary stars in our galaxy ."
It beg@@ an in 200@@ 9 with the lau@@ n@@ ch of N@@ A@@ S@@ A &apos;s K@@ e@@ pl@@ er mis@@ sion .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er &apos;s ma@@ in scienti@@ fic ob@@ jec@@ tive was to find plan@@ ets outside of our sol@@ ar system .
"It did this by star@@ ing at a single field in the sk@@ y , this one , with all the t@@ iny bo@@ x@@ es ."
"And in this one field , it mon@@ it@@ o@@ red the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars contin@@ u@@ ously for four years , taking a data point every 30 minutes ."
It was looking for what astron@@ om@@ ers call a trans@@ it .
"This is when the planet &apos;s or@@ bit is ali@@ g@@ ned in our line of sight , just so that the planet cr@@ os@@ ses in front of a star ."
"And when this happens , it bloc@@ ks out a t@@ iny bit of star@@ light , which you can see as a di@@ p in this cur@@ ve ."
And so the te@@ am at N@@ A@@ S@@ A had develop@@ ed very s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated compu@@ ters to sear@@ ch for trans@@ its in all the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er data .
"A@@ t the same time of the first data re@@ le@@ ase , astron@@ om@@ ers at Y@@ ale were wonder@@ ing an interesting thing : What if compu@@ ters mis@@ sed something ?"
And so we lau@@ n@@ ched the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en science pro@@ ject called P@@ lan@@ et H@@ un@@ ters to have people look at the same data .
"The human brain has an ama@@ zing ability for patter@@ n recogni@@ tion , sometimes even better than a computer ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there was a lot of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tici@@ s@@ m around this ."
"M@@ y colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ e@@ br@@ a F@@ is@@ ch@@ er , f@@ oun@@ der of the P@@ lan@@ et H@@ un@@ ters pro@@ ject , said that people at the time were saying , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . There &apos;s no way that a computer will mis@@ s a si@@ gn@@ al . &quot;"
"And so it was on , the cl@@ assi@@ c human ver@@ su@@ s machine g@@ am@@ ble ."
"And if we found one planet , we would be thr@@ ill@@ ed ."
"When I jo@@ ined the te@@ am four years ago , we had already found a couple ."
"And today , with the help of over 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 science en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ sts , we have found do@@ z@@ ens , and we &apos;ve also found one of the most my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous stars in our galaxy ."
"So to understand this , let me show you what a norm@@ al trans@@ it in K@@ e@@ pl@@ er data looks like ."
"O@@ n this grap@@ h on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side you have the amount of light , and on the bot@@ tom is time ."
"The white line is light just from the star , what astron@@ om@@ ers call a light cur@@ ve ."
"And so , for example , let &apos;s take J@@ up@@ it@@ er ."
P@@ lan@@ ets don &apos;t get much big@@ ger than J@@ up@@ it@@ er .
J@@ up@@ it@@ er will make a one percent dro@@ p in a star &apos;s bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
"@@ Earth , on the other hand , is 11 times sm@@ all@@ er than J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and the si@@ gn@@ al is b@@ are@@ ly vi@@ sible in the data ."
So back to our my@@ st@@ ery .
"A few years ago , P@@ lan@@ et H@@ un@@ ters were si@@ f@@ ting through data looking for trans@@ its , and they sp@@ ot@@ ted a my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous si@@ gn@@ al coming from the star K@@ I@@ C 8@@ 4@@ 6@@ 2@@ 8@@ 5@@ 2 ."
"The ob@@ serv@@ ations in M@@ ay of 200@@ 9 were the first they sp@@ ot@@ ted , and they started talking about this in the disc@@ us@@ sion for@@ um@@ s ."
"You see , trans@@ its norm@@ ally only last for a few hours , and this one la@@ sted for almost a week ."
"They were also saying that it looks as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c , mean@@ ing that instead of the c@@ le@@ an , U@@ -@@ shap@@ ed di@@ p that we saw with J@@ up@@ it@@ er , it had this stran@@ ge s@@ lo@@ pe that you can see on the left side ."
This se@@ em@@ ed to in@@ dic@@ ate that wh@@ at@@ ever was getting in the way and bloc@@ king the star@@ light was not cir@@ cul@@ ar like a planet .
"There are few more di@@ ps that happened , but for a couple of years , it was pretty qu@@ i@@ et ."
"And then in Mar@@ ch of 20@@ 11 , we see this ."
We descri@@ bed this fe@@ ature as both s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h and c@@ le@@ an .
"It also is as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c , having a gra@@ du@@ al di@@ m@@ m@@ ing that la@@ sts almost a week , and then it s@@ n@@ aps right back up to norm@@ al in just a matter of days ."
"And again , after this , not much happens until F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary of 20@@ 1@@ 3 ."
Th@@ ings start to get really crazy .
"There is a huge comple@@ x of di@@ ps in the light cur@@ ve that appe@@ ar , and they last for like a hundred days , all the way up into the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er mis@@ sion &apos;s end ."
Th@@ ese di@@ ps have vari@@ able shap@@ es .
"S@@ ome are very sh@@ ar@@ p , and some are bro@@ ad , and they also have vari@@ able d@@ ur@@ ations ."
"S@@ ome last just for a day or two , and some for more than a week ."
"And there &apos;s also up and down tre@@ n@@ ds within some of these di@@ ps , almost like se@@ ver@@ al in@@ dep@@ en@@ dent ev@@ ents were super@@ im@@ posed on top of each other ."
"And at this time , this star dro@@ ps in its bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness over 20 percent ."
This is tru@@ ly re@@ mark@@ able .
"And so the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en scienti@@ sts , when they saw this , they n@@ oti@@ fied the science te@@ am that they found something we@@ ir@@ d enough that it might be wor@@ th fol@@ lowing up ."
"And so when the science te@@ am looked at it , we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , there &apos;s probably just something wrong with the data . &quot; &quot; But we looked really , really , really hard , and the data were good ."
"And so what was happening had to be ast@@ ro@@ physical , mean@@ ing that something in space was getting in the way and bloc@@ king star@@ light ."
"And the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en scienti@@ sts who hel@@ ped us in this disc@@ o@@ very , they jo@@ ined along for the ri@@ de wat@@ ch@@ ing science in action fir@@ s@@ th@@ and ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , somebody said , you know , what if this star was very young and it still had the cl@@ ou@@ d of material it was born from sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding it ."
"And then somebody else said , well , what if the star had already form@@ ed plan@@ ets , and two of these plan@@ ets had col@@ li@@ ded , sim@@ il@@ ar to the Ear@@ th@@ -@@ M@@ o@@ on form@@ ing ev@@ ent ."
"Well , both of these the@@ ories could explain part of the data , but the diffic@@ ul@@ ties were that the star sho@@ wed no si@@ g@@ ns of being young , and there was no g@@ low from any of the material that was he@@ ated up by the star &apos;s light , and you would exp@@ ect this if the star was young or if there was a col@@ li@@ sion and a lot of d@@ ust was produc@@ ed ."
"And so somebody else said , well , how about a huge s@@ war@@ m of com@@ ets that are p@@ ass@@ ing by this star in a very elli@@ p@@ tical or@@ bit ?"
"Well , it ends up that this is actually consi@@ st@@ ent with our ob@@ serv@@ ations ."
"But I ag@@ ree , it does feel a little con@@ tri@@ ved ."
"You see , it would take hund@@ re@@ ds of com@@ ets to re@@ pro@@ duce what we &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving ."
And these are only the com@@ ets that happen to p@@ ass between us and the star .
"And so in reality , we &apos;re talking thousands to ten@@ s of thousands of com@@ ets ."
"But of all the bad ideas we had , this one was the best ."
And so we went a@@ head and published our fin@@ d@@ ings .
"Now , let me tell you , this was one of the har@@ d@@ est p@@ ap@@ ers I ever wr@@ ote ."
"S@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts are me@@ ant to publi@@ sh res@@ ults , and this sit@@ u@@ ation was far from that ."
( Laughter ) So this isn &apos;t the end of the story .
"A@@ r@@ ound the same time I was wr@@ iting this p@@ ap@@ er , I m@@ et with a colle@@ ag@@ ue of m@@ ine , J@@ as@@ on W@@ right , and he was also wr@@ iting a p@@ ap@@ er on K@@ e@@ pl@@ er data ."
"And he was saying that with K@@ e@@ pl@@ er &apos;s extre@@ me preci@@ sion , it could actually de@@ t@@ ect ali@@ en me@@ g@@ a@@ struc@@ tures around stars , but it didn &apos;t ."
"And then I sho@@ wed him this we@@ ir@@ d data that our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en scienti@@ sts had found , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; A@@ w cra@@ p , T@@ ab@@ by ."
So we had to find a way to ru@@ le out ali@@ ens .
"So together , we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed a colle@@ ag@@ ue of ours who works on S@@ E@@ T@@ I , the S@@ ear@@ ch for E@@ x@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ re@@ stri@@ al In@@ t@@ ellig@@ ence , that this would be an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary t@@ ar@@ get to pur@@ sue ."
We wr@@ ote a pro@@ pos@@ al to ob@@ ser@@ ve the star with the world &apos;s lar@@ g@@ est radi@@ o tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e at the G@@ re@@ en B@@ ank O@@ b@@ serv@@ at@@ ory .
"A couple months later , news of this pro@@ pos@@ al got le@@ a@@ ked to the pres@@ s and now there are thousands of ar@@ tic@@ les , over 1@@ 0,000 ar@@ tic@@ les , on this star al@@ one ."
"And if you sear@@ ch G@@ oo@@ g@@ le I@@ mag@@ es , this is what you &apos;ll find ."
"Now , you may be wonder@@ ing , O@@ K , T@@ ab@@ by , well , how do ali@@ ens actually explain this light cur@@ ve ?"
"O@@ K , well , imagine a civi@@ li@@ zation that &apos;s much more adv@@ anc@@ ed than our own ."
"In this hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance , this civi@@ li@@ zation would have ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted the energy sup@@ ply of their home planet , so where could they get more energy ?"
"Well , they have a h@@ ost star just like we have a su@@ n , and so if they were able to cap@@ ture more energy from this star , then that would sol@@ ve their energy nee@@ ds ."
So they would go and build huge struc@@ tures .
"Th@@ ese gi@@ ant me@@ g@@ a@@ struc@@ tures , like g@@ in@@ orm@@ ous sol@@ ar pan@@ els , are called D@@ y@@ son sp@@ her@@ es ."
This im@@ age abo@@ ve are lots of arti@@ sts &apos; im@@ pres@@ sions of D@@ y@@ son sp@@ her@@ es .
"It &apos;s really hard to pro@@ vi@@ de per@@ spec@@ tive on the v@@ ast@@ ness of these things , but you can think of it this way ."
And now imagine one of these struc@@ tures in moti@@ on around a star .
"You can see how it would pro@@ duce an@@ om@@ al@@ ies in the data such as un@@ even , un@@ natural looking di@@ ps ."
But it re@@ ma@@ ins that even ali@@ en me@@ g@@ a@@ struc@@ tures cannot de@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics .
A@@ no@@ ther idea that &apos;s one of my pers@@ onal fav@@ or@@ it@@ es is that we had just w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed an inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary space b@@ att@@ le and the cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ c de@@ struc@@ tion of a planet .
"Now , I ad@@ m@@ it that this would pro@@ duce a lot of d@@ ust that we don &apos;t ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
"But if we &apos;re already inv@@ o@@ king ali@@ ens in this ex@@ plan@@ ation , then who is to say they didn &apos;t eff@@ ici@@ ently c@@ le@@ an up all this m@@ ess for rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing pur@@ pos@@ es ?"
( Laughter ) You can see how this qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly cap@@ tures your imag@@ in@@ ation .
"Well , there you have it ."
We &apos;re in a sit@@ u@@ ation that could un@@ fo@@ ld to be a natural ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on we don &apos;t understand or an ali@@ en technology we don &apos;t understand .
"@@ P@@ er@@ s@@ on@@ ally , as a scienti@@ st , my money is on the natural ex@@ plan@@ ation ."
"But don &apos;t get me wrong , I do think it would be aw@@ es@@ ome to find ali@@ ens ."
"E@@ ither way , there is something new and really interesting to disc@@ over ."
So what happens next ?
We need to contin@@ ue to ob@@ ser@@ ve this star to learn more about what &apos;s happening .
"But prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal astron@@ om@@ ers , like me , we have lim@@ ited res@@ our@@ ces for this kind of thing , and K@@ e@@ pl@@ er is on to a different mis@@ sion ."
"You see , this time , am@@ ate@@ ur astron@@ om@@ ers with their bac@@ k@@ y@@ ard tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es ste@@ p@@ ped up im@@ me@@ di@@ ately and started ob@@ ser@@ ving this star ni@@ gh@@ tly at their own fac@@ ili@@ ties , and I am so exc@@ ited to see what they find ."
What &apos;s ama@@ zing to me is that this star would have never been found by compu@@ ters because we just wer@@ en &apos;t looking for something like this .
There are new mis@@ sions that are coming up that are ob@@ ser@@ ving m@@ illions more stars all over the sk@@ y .
And just think : What will it mean when we find another star like this ?
And what will it mean if we don &apos;t find another star like this ?
Thank you .
( Applause )
What are the mess@@ ages we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this cl@@ ass together .
W@@ om@@ en do not ne@@ g@@ oti@@ ate for themselves in the wor@@ k@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even as@@ king ? &quot; &quot; If you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ o@@ y , it mat@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two grou@@ ps of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone li@@ ked H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the comp@@ lic@@ ation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ l@@ l@@ is R@@ o@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consi@@ der an un@@ u@@ su@@ al fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it fe@@ els natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the W@@ or@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the mor@@ ning of S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had per@@ i@@ shed yet until 3@@ 6 hours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were af@@ ra@@ id of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my h@@ us@@ b@@ and , O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sho@@ ck , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sho@@ ck , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble expl@@ os@@ i@@ on in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not ven@@ ge@@ ful ."
"And a couple of wee@@ ks later when Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was in@@ dic@@ ted on six coun@@ ts of con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy to comm@@ it ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , and the U.@@ S@@ . government called for a death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty for him , if con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted , my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and I sp@@ o@@ ke out in op@@ posi@@ tion to that , pub@@ lic@@ ly ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough that and through human ri@@ gh@@ ts grou@@ ps , we were br@@ ought together with se@@ ver@@ al other v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s &apos; fam@@ ili@@ es ."
"When I saw A@@ ic@@ h@@ a in the me@@ dia , coming over when her son was in@@ dic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a bra@@ ve woman ."
S@@ ome@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m stron@@ ger . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep g@@ ri@@ e@@ f ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the stre@@ ng@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m , I got im@@ me@@ di@@ ate sym@@ p@@ ath@@ y ."
"But when people learned what her son was ac@@ c@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ p@@ ath@@ y ."
But her suff@@ ering is equ@@ al to m@@ ine .
"So we m@@ et in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ ic@@ h@@ a will now tell you how that came about ."
"( T@@ r@@ ans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ ic@@ h@@ a el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : G@@ ood af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ zation of H@@ um@@ an R@@ igh@@ ts to put me in tou@@ ch with the parents of the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s .
So they int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed me to five fam@@ ili@@ es .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ l@@ l@@ is , and I wat@@ ched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , sist@@ ers ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I suff@@ er@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was marri@@ ed when I was 1@@ 4 .
"I l@@ ost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 1@@ 6 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
"And I still suff@@ er , because my son is like he &apos;s bur@@ i@@ ed ali@@ ve ."
I know she really cri@@ ed for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s ali@@ ve . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s t@@ or@@ tu@@ red .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suff@@ ering is something posi@@ tive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mo@@ thers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be h@@ and@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism ."
"I go to scho@@ ols to talk to young , M@@ us@@ li@@ m girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be marri@@ ed against their will very young ."
"So if I can sa@@ ve one of the young girls , and av@@ o@@ id that they get marri@@ ed and suff@@ er as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
"@@ P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ ic@@ h@@ a , star@@ ting with that day we had our very first me@@ e@@ ting with other family mem@@ bers — which was a very pri@@ v@@ ate me@@ e@@ ting with sec@@ ur@@ ity , because it was N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , we were af@@ ra@@ id of the super@@ -@@ pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ism of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ bers ."
But we were all so ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"B@@ e@@ fore we knew each others &apos; nam@@ es , or anything , we had em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed and we@@ p@@ t ."
"Th@@ en we s@@ at in a cir@@ c@@ le with sup@@ port , with help , from people experienc@@ ed in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"And A@@ ic@@ h@@ a started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ no@@ cent , but I want to tell you how sor@@ ry I am for what happened to your fam@@ ili@@ es ."
"I know what it is to suff@@ er , and I feel that if there is a cri@@ me , a person should be tri@@ ed fa@@ ir@@ ly and p@@ uni@@ shed . &quot; &quot; But she re@@ ach@@ ed out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ic@@ e-@@ bre@@ a@@ ker ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connec@@ ted as human be@@ ings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three hours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d f@@ el@@ t as if we &apos;d known each other fore@@ ver .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these present cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had m@@ et someone with such a hard life , from such a t@@ ot@@ ally different culture and environ@@ ment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a speci@@ al connec@@ tion , which I value very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ ra@@ id of the other , but making that ste@@ p and then reali@@ zing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ ic@@ h@@ a , do you have a couple of words for con@@ clu@@ sion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( T@@ r@@ ans@@ l@@ at@@ or ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your hear@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."

"In 200@@ 8 , C@@ y@@ cl@@ one N@@ ar@@ g@@ is dev@@ ast@@ ated M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r ."
M@@ illions of people were in se@@ v@@ ere need of help .
The U.@@ N@@ . wanted to r@@ us@@ h people and sup@@ p@@ li@@ es to the are@@ a .
"But there were no m@@ aps , no m@@ aps of ro@@ ads , no m@@ aps sho@@ wing h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , no way for help to re@@ ach the c@@ y@@ cl@@ one v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s ."
"When we look at a ma@@ p of Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es or L@@ on@@ don , it is hard to believe that as of 200@@ 5 , only 15 percent of the world was m@@ app@@ ed to a ge@@ o@@ -@@ co@@ d@@ able level of deta@@ il ."
The U.@@ N@@ . r@@ an he@@ ad@@ first into a problem that the maj@@ or@@ ity of the world &apos;s pop@@ ul@@ ous fac@@ es : not having deta@@ il@@ ed m@@ aps .
But help was coming .
"A@@ t G@@ oo@@ g@@ le , 40 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers used a new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to ma@@ p 1@@ 20@@ ,000 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters of ro@@ ads , 3@@ ,000 h@@ osp@@ it@@ als , log@@ is@@ tics and reli@@ e@@ f poin@@ ts ."
And it took them four days .
The new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are they used ? G@@ oo@@ g@@ le M@@ ap@@ ma@@ ker .
G@@ oo@@ g@@ le M@@ ap@@ ma@@ ker is a technology that em@@ po@@ w@@ ers each of us to ma@@ p what we know loc@@ ally .
"@@ People have used this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to ma@@ p everything from ro@@ ads to ri@@ ver@@ s , from scho@@ ols to loc@@ al bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , and vide@@ o st@@ o@@ res to the cor@@ ner st@@ ore ."
M@@ aps matter .

"In the last year al@@ one , thousands of us@@ ers in 1@@ 7@@ 0 countries have m@@ app@@ ed m@@ illions of pi@@ ec@@ es of information , and cre@@ ated a ma@@ p of a level of deta@@ il never thought vi@@ able ."

Let &apos;s look at some of the m@@ aps being cre@@ ated by us@@ ers right now .
"So , as we spe@@ ak , people are m@@ app@@ ing the world in these 1@@ 7@@ 0 countries ."

"So , I was in the h@@ osp@@ ital for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the cha@@ ir@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exc@@ ited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic new tre@@ at@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exc@@ ited . I wal@@ ked with him to his off@@ ice ."
"And he expl@@ ained to me that , when I s@@ have , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the ha@@ ir is , but on the right side of my face I was b@@ ad@@ ly bur@@ ned so I have no ha@@ ir , and this cre@@ ates l@@ ack of sym@@ me@@ try ."
And what &apos;s the br@@ illi@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to t@@ at@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c .
It s@@ oun@@ ded interesting . He asked me to go and s@@ have .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a stran@@ ge way to s@@ have , because I thought about it and I reali@@ zed that the way I was s@@ having then would be the way I would s@@ have for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the wi@@ d@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his off@@ ice , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he sho@@ wed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ e@@ ks with little black d@@ ots — not very in@@ form@@ ative ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow ol@@ der and my ha@@ ir becom@@ es white ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have l@@ as@@ ers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ cer@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the bi@@ gg@@ est gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ jo@@ y looking n@@ on@@ -@@ sym@@ me@@ tri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ ver@@ ted ple@@ as@@ ure from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have se@@ x with you more f@@ requ@@ ently ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very surpri@@ sing to me , because I &apos;ve g@@ one through many tre@@ at@@ ments — there were many tre@@ at@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ex@@ t@@ ent ."
But I decided not to have this tre@@ at@@ ment .
"And I went to his de@@ pu@@ ty and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"Wh@@ ere was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he expl@@ ained that they have done this pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure on two patients already , and they need the thir@@ d pati@@ ent for a p@@ ap@@ er they were wr@@ iting ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a s@@ ch@@ m@@ uc@@ k .
"R@@ ight , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experim@@ ents in the la@@ b ."
"And when we run experim@@ ents , we u@@ su@@ ally hope that one group will be@@ have differ@@ ently than another ."
"So we had one group that I ho@@ ped their per@@ form@@ ance would be very high , another group that I thought their per@@ form@@ ance would be very low , and when I got the res@@ ults , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — as@@ i@@ de from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was sup@@ posed to have very high per@@ form@@ ance that was actually per@@ form@@ ing ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , dest@@ ro@@ ying my st@@ atis@@ tical si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of the test ."
So I looked care@@ fully at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years ol@@ der than any@@ body else in the s@@ am@@ ple .
And I remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the la@@ b wan@@ ting to make some easy cas@@ h and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s th@@ row him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever in@@ clu@@ de a dr@@ un@@ ken guy in a s@@ am@@ ple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this dr@@ un@@ ken guy was not in that condi@@ tion ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"W@@ ould we have th@@ ro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ! What a smar@@ t guy who is per@@ form@@ ing this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lo@@ wer , giving us even stron@@ ger st@@ atis@@ tical res@@ ults than we could ."
So we decided not to th@@ row the guy out and to r@@ er@@ u@@ n the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experim@@ ents that we &apos;ve done on con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est , basically kind of bring two poin@@ ts to the fore@@ ground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ coun@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to t@@ at@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the inc@@ enti@@ ves that get them to be bl@@ in@@ ded to reality and give us adv@@ ice that is in@@ her@@ ently bi@@ as@@ ed .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recogni@@ ze , and we see that it happens ."
"M@@ ay@@ be we don &apos;t recogni@@ ze it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recogni@@ ze that sometimes we too are bl@@ in@@ ded by our own inc@@ enti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult l@@ es@@ son to take into ac@@ coun@@ t ."
Because we don &apos;t see how con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experim@@ ents , in my mind , I was hel@@ ping science ."
I was e@@ li@@ min@@ ating the data to get the true patter@@ n of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a k@@ night trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ f@@ ering with the process with lots of good int@@ enti@@ ons .
"And I think the real chall@@ en@@ ge is to fig@@ ure out where are the c@@ ases in our lives where con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to tr@@ ust our own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion to over@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ all@@ ing pre@@ y to these behavi@@ ors , because we can create lots of und@@ es@@ ir@@ able cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es ."
I do want to leave you with one posi@@ tive thought .
"I mean , this is all very depres@@ sing , right — people have con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The posi@@ tive per@@ spec@@ tive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms of why we fa@@ il and where we fa@@ il , we can actually hope to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tru@@ th of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion that in@@ equality is divi@@ sive and soci@@ ally cor@@ r@@ os@@ i@@ ve has been around since before the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equ@@ al societies , and see what in@@ equality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the l@@ in@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you ex@@ ist .
"But first , see what a mis@@ er@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a par@@ a@@ do@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y against gr@@ oss national income — how r@@ ich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like N@@ or@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are tw@@ ice as r@@ ich as I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , G@@ re@@ ece , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y at all .
There &apos;s no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y ."
"Th@@ ese are small are@@ as of Eng@@ land and W@@ al@@ es — the po@@ o@@ rest on the right , the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the po@@ or and the rest of us .
E@@ ven the people just b@@ el@@ ow the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that par@@ a@@ do@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at rel@@ ative income or social posi@@ tion , social st@@ at@@ us — where we are in rel@@ ation to each other and the size of the g@@ aps between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ me@@ di@@ ately won@@ der : what happens if we wi@@ d@@ en the differ@@ ences , or com@@ pres@@ s them , make the income differ@@ ences big@@ ger or sm@@ all@@ er ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical data .
I &apos;m taking data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank has — on the sc@@ ale of income differ@@ ences in these r@@ ich develop@@ ed market democr@@ ac@@ ies .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much r@@ ic@@ her the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equ@@ al countries on the left — Jap@@ an , F@@ in@@ land , N@@ or@@ way , S@@ we@@ d@@ en — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as r@@ ich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more un@@ equ@@ al end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore — the differ@@ ences are tw@@ ice as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are tw@@ ice as un@@ equ@@ al as some of the other suc@@ cess@@ ful market democr@@ ac@@ ies ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We coll@@ ected data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social l@@ ad@@ der ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ ally com@@ par@@ able data on life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ acy sc@@ o@@ res , on in@@ f@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity r@@ ates , h@@ om@@ ici@@ de r@@ ates , pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son , te@@ en@@ age bir@@ thr@@ ates , lev@@ els of tr@@ ust , ob@@ es@@ ity , mental ill@@ ness — which in st@@ and@@ ard di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic cl@@ assi@@ fic@@ ation in@@ clu@@ des dru@@ g and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mo@@ bility ."
We put them all in one in@@ de@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ igh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
Wh@@ ere a country is is a sort of average sc@@ ore on these things .
"And there , you see it in rel@@ ation to the measure of in@@ equality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sh@@ all use over and over again in the data ."
The more un@@ equ@@ al countries are doing wor@@ se on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily cl@@ ose cor@@ rel@@ ation .
"But if you look at that same in@@ de@@ x of health and social problems in rel@@ ation to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a , gr@@ oss national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ rel@@ ation any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ri@@ ed that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our ar@@ g@@ ument and just man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red this evidence , so we also did a p@@ ap@@ er in the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh M@@ e@@ dic@@ al J@@ our@@ n@@ al on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F in@@ de@@ x of child well@@ -@@ being ."
It has 40 different comp@@ on@@ ents put together by other people .
"It con@@ ta@@ ins whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have bo@@ o@@ ks at home , what im@@ m@@ uni@@ zation r@@ ates are like , whether there &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying at school ."
E@@ very@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in rel@@ ation to that same measure of in@@ equality .
K@@ i@@ ds do wor@@ se in the more un@@ equ@@ al societies .
H@@ igh@@ ly si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well@@ -@@ being , in rel@@ ation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well@@ -@@ being of our societies is not dep@@ en@@ dent any longer on national income and economic grow@@ th .
"That &apos;s very important in po@@ o@@ re@@ r countries , but not in the r@@ ich develop@@ ed world ."
But the differ@@ ences between us and where we are in rel@@ ation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the se@@ par@@ ate b@@ its of our in@@ de@@ x .
"@@ Here , for inst@@ ance , is tr@@ ust ."
It &apos;s simply the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tru@@ sted .
It comes from the W@@ or@@ ld V@@ al@@ ues S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more un@@ equ@@ al end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can tr@@ ust others ."
"But in the more equ@@ al societies , it ri@@ ses to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at meas@@ ures of inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in comm@@ unity life or social cap@@ ital , very sim@@ il@@ ar relation@@ shi@@ ps cl@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated to in@@ equality ."
"I may say , we did all this work tw@@ ice ."
"We did it first on these r@@ ich , develop@@ ed countries , and then as a se@@ par@@ ate test bed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American st@@ ates — as@@ king just the same question : do the more un@@ equ@@ al st@@ ates do wor@@ se on all these kinds of meas@@ ures ?"
So here is tr@@ ust from a gener@@ al social sur@@ v@@ ey of the fe@@ der@@ al government rel@@ ated to in@@ equality .
V@@ ery sim@@ il@@ ar sc@@ at@@ ter over a sim@@ il@@ ar ran@@ ge of lev@@ els of tr@@ ust .
S@@ ame thing is going on .
B@@ as@@ ically we found that almost anything that &apos;s rel@@ ated to tr@@ ust inter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ ally is rel@@ ated to tr@@ ust am@@ on@@ g@@ st the 50 st@@ ates in that se@@ par@@ ate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a flu@@ ke .
This is mental ill@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together fi@@ gu@@ res using the same di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom s@@ am@@ pl@@ es of the population to al@@ low us to comp@@ are r@@ ates of mental ill@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental ill@@ ness in the pre@@ ce@@ ding year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental ill@@ ness of others .
"And again , cl@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated to in@@ equality ."
This is violence .
"Th@@ ese red d@@ ots are American st@@ ates , and the bl@@ ue tri@@ ang@@ les are C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an pro@@ v@@ inc@@ es ."
But look at the sc@@ ale of the differ@@ ences .
It goes from 15 h@@ om@@ ici@@ des per million up to 1@@ 50 .
This is the pro@@ por@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son .
"There &apos;s a about a ten@@ fo@@ ld difference there , lo@@ g sc@@ ale up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pri@@ son .
That relation@@ ship is not ma@@ in@@ ly dri@@ ven by more cri@@ me .
"In some places , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ uni@@ tive s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ing , har@@ sh@@ er s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ing ."
And the more un@@ equ@@ al societies are more likely also to re@@ tain the death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
Here we have children d@@ rop@@ ping out of high school .
"A@@ g@@ ain , quite big differ@@ ences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily d@@ am@@ aging , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mo@@ bility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mo@@ bility bas@@ ed on income .
"B@@ as@@ ically , it &apos;s as@@ king : do r@@ ich fa@@ thers have r@@ ich s@@ ons and po@@ or fa@@ thers have po@@ or s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more un@@ equ@@ al end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ a@@ vi@@ an countries , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the au@@ dience here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ al@@ ics here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that t@@ end to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are en@@ d@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are wor@@ se in more un@@ equ@@ al countries — not just a little bit wor@@ se , but anything from tw@@ ice as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the exp@@ en@@ se , the human c@@ ost of that ."
I want to go back though to this grap@@ h that I sho@@ wed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two poin@@ ts .
"One is that , in grap@@ h after grap@@ h , we find the countries that do wor@@ se , wh@@ at@@ ever the out@@ come , seem to be the more un@@ equ@@ al ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the N@@ or@@ di@@ c countries and Jap@@ an ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ fun@@ c@@ tion rel@@ ated to in@@ equality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this grap@@ h is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , S@@ we@@ d@@ en and Jap@@ an , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways ."
"The posi@@ tion of women , how cl@@ os@@ ely they keep to the n@@ uc@@ lear family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the p@@ ol@@ es in ter@@ ms of the r@@ ich develop@@ ed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their gre@@ ater equality .
"S@@ we@@ d@@ en has huge differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings , and it n@@ ar@@ ro@@ ws the g@@ ap through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al w@@ el@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous b@@ ene@@ f@@ its and so on ."
Jap@@ an is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much sm@@ all@@ er differ@@ ences in ear@@ n@@ ings before ta@@ x .
It has lo@@ wer ta@@ x@@ es .
It has a sm@@ all@@ er w@@ el@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our anal@@ ys@@ is of the American st@@ ates , we find rather the same con@@ tr@@ ast ."
"There are some st@@ ates that do well through re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion , some st@@ ates that do well because they have sm@@ all@@ er income differ@@ ences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ clu@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your gre@@ ater equality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about per@@ f@@ ect equality , I &apos;m talking about what ex@@ ists in r@@ ich develop@@ ed market democr@@ ac@@ ies ."
A@@ no@@ ther really surpri@@ sing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the po@@ or who are aff@@ ected by in@@ equality .
There seems to be some tru@@ th in J@@ o@@ h@@ n D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ land . &quot;
"And in a number of stu@@ dies , it &apos;s possible to comp@@ are how people do in more and less equ@@ al countries at each level in the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s in@@ f@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity .
S@@ ome S@@ we@@ des very kin@@ dly cl@@ assi@@ fied a lot of their in@@ f@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths ac@@ cor@@ ding to the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh re@@ gi@@ ster of gener@@ al soci@@ o@@ economic cl@@ assi@@ fic@@ ation .
"And so it &apos;s an@@ ach@@ r@@ on@@ is@@ tic@@ ally a cl@@ assi@@ fic@@ ation by fa@@ thers &apos; oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations , so single parents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social cl@@ ass , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ sk@@ ill@@ ed man@@ u@@ al oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the sk@@ ill@@ ed man@@ u@@ al oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations in the middle , then the j@@ uni@@ or n@@ on@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ al , going up high to the prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal oc@@ c@@ up@@ ations — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of lar@@ ger comp@@ an@@ ies ."
You see there that S@@ we@@ d@@ en does better than B@@ r@@ it@@ ain all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
The bi@@ gg@@ est differ@@ ences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small b@@ ene@@ f@@ it to being in a more equ@@ al society ."
We show that on about five different se@@ ts of data co@@ ver@@ ing educ@@ ational out@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ ally .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that gre@@ ater equality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some b@@ ene@@ f@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ ci@@ al effec@@ ts of in@@ equality .
"M@@ ore to do with feel@@ ings of super@@ i@@ or@@ ity and in@@ f@@ eri@@ or@@ ity , of being val@@ u@@ ed and dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed , resp@@ ected and dis@@ resp@@ ected ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the st@@ at@@ us com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion that comes out of that dri@@ ves the con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism in our society ."
It also le@@ ads to st@@ at@@ us in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed and seen by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , c@@ le@@ ver , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly , some par@@ al@@ le@@ l work going on in social psycho@@ logy : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different stu@@ dies in which v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been inv@@ ited into a psycho@@ logical l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory and had their stress h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing st@@ res@@ s@@ ful t@@ as@@ ks , meas@@ u@@ red ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interest@@ ed in seeing is what kind of st@@ res@@ ses most reli@@ ably ra@@ ise lev@@ els of cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , the cen@@ tr@@ al stress h@@ orm@@ one ."
And the con@@ clu@@ sion was it was t@@ as@@ ks that in@@ clu@@ ded soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ at@@ s to self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m or social st@@ at@@ us in which others can ne@@ g@@ ati@@ vely ju@@ dge your per@@ form@@ ance .
Th@@ ose kind of st@@ res@@ ses have a very particular eff@@ ect on the ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy of stress .
Now we have been cri@@ tici@@ zed .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surpri@@ sing ."
"I should tell you though that when people cri@@ tici@@ ze us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pic@@ k and cho@@ ose data ."
"We have an ab@@ sol@@ ute ru@@ le that if our data s@@ our@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ ys@@ is ."
"O@@ ur data s@@ our@@ ce deci@@ des whether it &apos;s reli@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se that would int@@ ro@@ duce bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 stu@@ dies of health in rel@@ ation to income and equality in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed j@@ our@@ n@@ als .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation ."
"The same countries , the same measure of in@@ equality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we control for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated me@@ th@@ o@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for po@@ ver@@ ty and education and so on ."
What about cau@@ s@@ ality ?
C@@ or@@ rel@@ ation in itself doesn &apos;t pro@@ ve cau@@ s@@ ality .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And in@@ de@@ ed , people know the cau@@ s@@ al l@@ in@@ ks quite well in some of these out@@ comes ."
"The big change in our understanding of dri@@ ver@@ s of ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic health in the r@@ ich develop@@ ed world is how important ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic stress from social s@@ our@@ ces is aff@@ ec@@ ting the im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar system ."
"O@@ r for inst@@ ance , the reason why violence becom@@ es more common in more un@@ equ@@ al societies is because people are sen@@ si@@ tive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the pos@@ t-@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ st@@ ra@@ in income , the b@@ on@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our b@@ os@@ ses ac@@ coun@@ t@@ able to their emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in any way we can .
I think the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ home mess@@ age though is that we can impro@@ ve the real qu@@ ality of human life by re@@ duc@@ ing the differ@@ ences in in@@ comes between us .
"S@@ u@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we have a h@@ and@@ le on the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ ci@@ al well@@ -@@ being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exc@@ iting ."
Thank you .

I &apos;d like you to imagine the world an@@ ew .
Here &apos;s an im@@ age that you &apos;re very fam@@ ili@@ ar with .
I &apos;m old enough that I was actually born before we saw this im@@ age .
"It &apos;s only been a few cent@@ ur@@ ies since we &apos;ve actually , most of us , thought of our planet as sp@@ her@@ ical ."
"When we first saw these imag@@ es in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , the world was chang@@ ing at an incredi@@ ble r@@ ate ."

E@@ very@@ body on the planet is given an equ@@ al amount of space .
The ci@@ ties are sho@@ wn sh@@ in@@ ing b@@ right .
The l@@ ines are sho@@ wing you sub@@ mar@@ ine c@@ ab@@ les and tr@@ ad@@ e r@@ out@@ es .
"And there &apos;s one particular line that goes from the Ch@@ in@@ ese port of D@@ ali@@ an through past S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore , through the Su@@ e@@ z C@@ an@@ al , through the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an and r@@ ound to R@@ ot@@ ter@@ d@@ am ."

"A@@ t its pe@@ ak 9@@ ,000 years ago , people had to wal@@ k over the ro@@ of@@ s of others &apos; h@@ ous@@ es to get to their home ."
"If you look care@@ fully at the ma@@ p of the c@@ ity , you &apos;ll see it has no stre@@ ets , because stre@@ ets are something we inv@@ en@@ ted ."
The world changes .

We are learning about ourselves at an incredi@@ ble spe@@ ed .

It &apos;s ac@@ cre@@ tion .
"We don &apos;t not@@ ice the change because we only have sh@@ ort lives , 7@@ 0 , 80 , if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ k@@ y 90 years ."

O@@ ur planet is st@@ abili@@ zing .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in that change , you can see tu@@ m@@ ult ."
You can see the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .

Th@@ ese are the ev@@ ents we t@@ end to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate on .
We wor@@ ry about people .
We wor@@ ry about how many people there are .
We wor@@ ry about how you can get away from people .

"And you see the mon@@ so@@ ons mo@@ ving around the planet , and the planet almost appe@@ ar@@ s to have a hear@@ t@@ be@@ at ."
We have enough water .
This is a ma@@ p of where we grow our food in the world .
You will have seen this ma@@ p of the world before .
"When you norm@@ ally see that ma@@ p , on a norm@@ al ma@@ p , the kind of ma@@ p that most of you will be used to , you think you are seeing a ma@@ p of where people live ."
Wh@@ ere the ligh@@ ts are sh@@ in@@ ing up is where people live .
E@@ very@@ where has the same den@@ s@@ ity of people on this ma@@ p .
And the world didn &apos;t end .
"A few years ago , the number of b@@ ab@@ ies d@@ ying in their first year of life in the world f@@ ell by five percent in just one year ."
"I can give you good news story after good news story about what is getting better in the planet , but we t@@ end to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate on the bad news that is im@@ me@@ di@@ ate ."
You are sho@@ wn those ter@@ ri@@ ble things on the news every night of the week .
You are not told about the population s@@ lowing down .
You are not told about the world becom@@ ing more connec@@ ted .
You are not told about how we are learning to beg@@ in to wa@@ st@@ e less and con@@ su@@ me less .
This is my last ma@@ p .
You can see that Euro@@ pe is on the e@@ dge .
And we in E@@ x@@ e@@ ter today are on the far e@@ dge of the planet .
"We are living in a st@@ abili@@ zing world , an ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zing world , an aging world , a connec@@ ting world ."
"There are many , many things to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed about , but there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do , and we need to see that we are now living in a new world ."

I &apos;m here to rec@@ ru@@ it men to sup@@ port gen@@ der equality .
What do men have to do with gen@@ der equality ?
"@@ G@@ en@@ der equality is about women , right ?"
"A@@ c@@ tually , I &apos;m even here spe@@ a@@ king as a middle cl@@ ass white man ."
"Now , I wasn &apos;t always a middle cl@@ ass white man ."
"It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in gra@@ du@@ ate school , and a b@@ un@@ ch of us gra@@ du@@ ate students got together one day , and we said , you know , there &apos;s an expl@@ os@@ i@@ on of wr@@ iting and thinking in f@@ em@@ in@@ ist theory , but there &apos;s no cour@@ ses yet ."
So we did what gra@@ du@@ ate students t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally do in a sit@@ u@@ ation like that .
"We &apos;ll read a t@@ ex@@ t , we &apos;ll talk about it , we &apos;ll have a p@@ ot@@ l@@ uc@@ k d@@ in@@ ner ."
"( Laughter ) So every week , 11 women and me got together . ( Laughter )"
We would read some t@@ ex@@ t in f@@ em@@ in@@ ist theory and have a con@@ vers@@ ation about it .
"And d@@ uring one of our con@@ vers@@ ations , I w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed an inter@@ action that changed my life fore@@ ver ."
It was a con@@ vers@@ ation between two women .
"One of the women was white , and one was black ."
"And the white woman said — this is going to sound very an@@ ach@@ r@@ on@@ is@@ tic now — the white woman said , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll women face the same op@@ pres@@ sion as women ."
"A@@ ll women are sim@@ il@@ arly sit@@ u@@ ated in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch@@ y , and ther@@ e@@ fore all women have a kind of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity or sist@@ er@@ ho@@ od . &quot; &quot; And the black woman said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not so sure ."
"@@ Let me ask you a question . &quot; &quot; So the black woman says to the white woman , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and you look in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , what do you see ? &quot; &quot; And the white woman said , &quot; &quot; I see a woman . &quot; &quot; And the black woman said , &quot; &quot; You see , that &apos;s the problem for me ."
"Because when I wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I look in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I see a black woman ."
"T@@ o me , r@@ ace is vi@@ sible . But to you , r@@ ace is in@@ vi@@ sible . You don &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And then she said something really star@@ t@@ ling ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s how pri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge works ."
"@@ P@@ ri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge is in@@ vi@@ sible to those who have it . &quot; &quot; It is a l@@ u@@ x@@ ury , I will say to the white people sit@@ ting in this room , not to have to think about r@@ ace every sp@@ li@@ t second of our lives . P@@ ri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge is in@@ vi@@ sible to those who have it ."
"Now remember , I was the only man in this group ,"
"@@ so when I w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed this , I went , &quot; &quot; O@@ h no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And somebody said , &quot; &quot; Well what was that re@@ action ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , when I wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I look in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , I see a human being ."
I &apos;m kind of the gener@@ ic person .
"You know , I &apos;m a middle cl@@ ass white man . I have no r@@ ace , no cl@@ ass , no gen@@ der ."
"I had to start thinking about them , and it had been pri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge that had ke@@ p@@ t it in@@ vi@@ sible to me for so long ."
"Now , I w@@ ish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago in that little disc@@ us@@ sion group , but I was re@@ min@@ ded of it quite rec@@ ently at my univers@@ ity where I te@@ ach ."
"I have a colle@@ ag@@ ue , and she and I both te@@ ach the soci@@ o@@ logy of gen@@ der course on al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate se@@ me@@ st@@ ers ."
So she gi@@ ves a gu@@ est l@@ ec@@ ture for me when I te@@ ach .
"A@@ ll that se@@ me@@ ster , wh@@ en@@ ever my colle@@ ag@@ ue op@@ en@@ ed her m@@ ou@@ th , what my students saw was a woman ."
"I mean , if you were to say to my students , &quot; There is struc@@ tur@@ al in@@ equality bas@@ ed on gen@@ der in the United States , &quot; they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Well of course you &apos;d say that ."
"I@@ s that going to be on the test ? How do you sp@@ ell &apos; struc@@ tur@@ al &apos; ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I hope you all can see , this is what ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity looks like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) D@@ i@@ se@@ m@@ bo@@ died W@@ est@@ er@@ n r@@ ati@@ on@@ ality . ( Laughter )
"And that , by the way , is why I think men so often we@@ ar ties . ( Laughter )"
"Because if you are going to em@@ body dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died W@@ est@@ er@@ n r@@ ati@@ on@@ ality , you need a si@@ gni@@ fi@@ er , and what could be a better si@@ gni@@ fi@@ er of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died W@@ est@@ er@@ n r@@ ati@@ on@@ ality than a g@@ ar@@ ment that at one end is a no@@ ose and the other end poin@@ ts to the gen@@ it@@ als ?"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That is min@@ d@@ -@@ body du@@ al@@ ism right there .
So making gen@@ der vi@@ sible to men is the first ste@@ p to eng@@ aging men to sup@@ port gen@@ der equality .
I was on a T@@ V talk show op@@ pos@@ ite four white men .
"It was a quot@@ e from one of the men , and the quot@@ e was , &quot; A B@@ l@@ ack W@@ om@@ an S@@ to@@ le My J@@ o@@ b . &quot;"
I want to know about the word &apos; my . &apos; Wh@@ ere did you get the idea it was your job ?
"O@@ f course , it &apos;s fa@@ ir , it &apos;s right and it &apos;s just ."
"But more than that , gen@@ der equality is also in our inter@@ est as men ."
"If you li@@ st@@ en to what men say about what they want in their lives , gen@@ der equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live ."
G@@ en@@ der equality is good for countries .
"It turns out , ac@@ cor@@ ding to most stu@@ dies , that those countries that are the most gen@@ der equ@@ al are also the countries that sc@@ ore high@@ est on the happiness sc@@ ale ."
And that &apos;s not just because they &apos;re all in Euro@@ pe .
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven within Euro@@ pe , those countries that are more gen@@ der equ@@ al also have the high@@ est lev@@ els of happiness ."
It is also good for comp@@ an@@ ies .
"R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch by C@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st and others has sho@@ wn con@@ clu@@ si@@ vely that the more gen@@ der@@ -@@ equ@@ al comp@@ an@@ ies are , the better it is for wor@@ k@@ ers , the happ@@ ier their l@@ ab@@ or force is ."
They have lo@@ wer job tur@@ no@@ ver . They have lo@@ wer lev@@ els of at@@ tri@@ tion .
They have an eas@@ ier time rec@@ ru@@ iting .
"And I say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h no , in fact , what you have to start cal@@ cul@@ ating is how much gen@@ der in@@ equality is already cos@@ ting you ."
It is extre@@ me@@ ly exp@@ en@@ sive . &quot; &quot; So it is good for business .
"And the other thing is , it &apos;s good for men ."
"It is good for the kind of lives we want to live , because young men es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally have changed en@@ orm@@ ously , and they want to have lives that are anim@@ ated by ter@@ ri@@ fic relation@@ shi@@ ps with their children ."
"They exp@@ ect their par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , their sp@@ ous@@ es , their wi@@ ves , to work outside the home and be just as comm@@ it@@ ted to their care@@ ers as they are ."
"I was talking , to give you an ill@@ u@@ str@@ ation of this change — S@@ ome of you may remember this ."
"When I was a lot youn@@ ger , there was a ri@@ ddle that was posed to us ."
S@@ ome of you may w@@ ince to remember this ri@@ ddle .
This ri@@ ddle went something like this .
How is this possible ?
We were fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed by this .
We could not fig@@ ure this out .
"( Laughter ) Well , I decided to do a little experiment with my 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old son ."
"So I decided I would pose this ri@@ ddle to them , just to see , to g@@ au@@ ge the level of change ."
"Well , 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old bo@@ ys , they im@@ me@@ di@@ ately tur@@ ned to me and said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s his mo@@ m . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
No problem . J@@ ust like that .
"E@@ x@@ cept for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; Well , he could have two d@@ ads . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s an in@@ de@@ x , an in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of how things have changed ."
Y@@ oun@@ ger men today exp@@ ect to be able to bal@@ ance work and family .
"They want to be du@@ al@@ -@@ care@@ er , du@@ al@@ -@@ care@@ r cou@@ pl@@ es ."
They want to be able to bal@@ ance work and family with their par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
They want to be inv@@ ol@@ ved fa@@ thers .

"( Laughter ) I came to reali@@ ze , as a phys@@ ici@@ an , that I was working to@@ ward a go@@ al which was different from the go@@ al of evolution — not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory , just different ."
I was trying to pres@@ er@@ ve the body .

"E@@ v@@ olution is all about p@@ ass@@ ing on the gen@@ ome to the next generation , ad@@ ap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation ."

"I think we would all understand the s@@ enti@@ ment that W@@ oo@@ dy A@@ l@@ l@@ en ex@@ pres@@ sed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achi@@ e@@ ve im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity through my work ."
I want to achi@@ e@@ ve it through not d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ v@@ olution does not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily fav@@ or the lon@@ ge@@ st@@ -@@ li@@ ved .
"It doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily fav@@ or the bi@@ gg@@ est or the stron@@ g@@ est or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test ."
E@@ v@@ olution fav@@ ors those cre@@ atures best ad@@ ap@@ ted to their environ@@ ment .

"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the o@@ ce@@ an , bac@@ ter@@ ia that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ c and can survi@@ ve at the ste@@ am v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se pro@@ duce , if f@@ ish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de co@@ o@@ ked f@@ ish , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a h@@ osp@@ it@@ able environ@@ ment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of hum@@ ans in evolution , and partic@@ ul@@ arly as we look a@@ head to the next p@@ ha@@ se , I would say that there are a number of possi@@ bili@@ ties ."
The first is that we will not ev@@ ol@@ ve .
We have re@@ ach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ i@@ po@@ ise .
"And the reas@@ on@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind that would be , first , we have , through medic@@ ine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be sel@@ ected out and be re@@ mo@@ ved from the population ."
"And secon@@ dly , we as a spec@@ ies have so con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red our environ@@ ment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it ad@@ ap@@ t to us as well as we ad@@ ap@@ t to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ate and cir@@ cul@@ ate and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is nec@@ ess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possi@@ bility is that there will be evolution of the tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal kind , natural , im@@ posed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the ar@@ g@@ ument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ low@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able ."
"And as far as is@@ ol@@ ation goes , when we as a spec@@ ies do col@@ on@@ i@@ ze dist@@ ant plan@@ ets , there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environ@@ mental changes that could pro@@ duce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a thir@@ d possi@@ bility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possi@@ bility ."
"I call it ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ i@@ ded and ch@@ os@@ en by us as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als in the cho@@ ices that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ ices about their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more m@@ al@@ es than f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the in@@ divi@@ du@@ al and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to cho@@ ose , not simply to cho@@ ose the se@@ x of your child , but for you in your body to make the gen@@ e@@ tic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would c@@ ure or pre@@ v@@ ent dise@@ ases ."
What if you could make the gen@@ e@@ tic changes to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate di@@ ab@@ et@@ es or A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of cancer or e@@ li@@ min@@ ate st@@ ro@@ ke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ um@@ an G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject started in 19@@ 90 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It c@@ ost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ i@@ shed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."

C@@ an you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ c@@ o ?
"Th@@ ese are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be e@@ ver@@ more possible ."
I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ v@@ a , or change the ne@@ w@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing a better chan@@ ce at a health@@ ier life — e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the h@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of cancer ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want health@@ ier children ?
"And then , that same anal@@ y@@ tic technology , that same eng@@ ine of science that can pro@@ duce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also en@@ able us to ad@@ op@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties — that better mem@@ ory ."
"Wh@@ y not have the qu@@ ick w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next generation of the W@@ at@@ son machine ?"
Why not have the qu@@ ick tw@@ it@@ ch mu@@ sc@@ le that will en@@ able you to run fa@@ ster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
Th@@ ese will be ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a posi@@ tion where we can p@@ ass it on to the next generation , and we can ad@@ op@@ t the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es we want , we will have con@@ ver@@ ted ol@@ d@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that norm@@ ally might requ@@ ire 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 years , and we can com@@ pres@@ s it down to a thous@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"Th@@ ese are cho@@ ices that your gr@@ and@@ children , or their gr@@ and@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"W@@ ill we use these cho@@ ices to make a society that is better , that is more suc@@ cess@@ ful , that is kin@@ der ?"

"W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more ro@@ b@@ ust and more vers@@ ati@@ le ?"
Th@@ ese are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .

"One thing the world nee@@ ds , one thing this country des@@ per@@ ately nee@@ ds is a better way of conduc@@ ting our political de@@ b@@ ates ."
We need to re@@ disc@@ over the l@@ ost art of democr@@ atic ar@@ g@@ ument .

But we too ra@@ re@@ ly ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate and de@@ f@@ end and ar@@ gu@@ e about those big moral questions in our poli@@ tics .

"F@@ ir@@ st , let me take a fam@@ ous philosop@@ her who wr@@ ote about those questions of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce and mor@@ ality , give you a very sh@@ ort l@@ ec@@ ture on A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s theory of j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , and then have a disc@@ us@@ sion here to see whether A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and ar@@ gu@@ e about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the l@@ ec@@ ture ?"
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le , j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce means giving people what they des@@ er@@ ve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the l@@ ec@@ ture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions beg@@ in when it comes to ar@@ gu@@ ing about who des@@ er@@ ves what and why .
T@@ a@@ ke the example of fl@@ ut@@ es .
S@@ up@@ pose we &apos;re dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ting fl@@ ut@@ es .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best fl@@ ute ?
You can just call it out .
( A@@ u@@ dience : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ an@@ de@@ l : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
O@@ r by the first person to r@@ us@@ h into the h@@ all to get them .
How many say the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best fl@@ ut@@ es should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?"
Pe@@ ter : The gre@@ at@@ est b@@ ene@@ f@@ it to all .
M@@ S : The gre@@ at@@ est b@@ ene@@ f@@ it to all .
We &apos;ll hear better mu@@ sic if the best fl@@ ut@@ es should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
That &apos;s Pe@@ ter ? ( A@@ u@@ dience : Pe@@ ter . ) M@@ S : A@@ ll right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good mu@@ sic is play@@ ed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble mu@@ sic .
"But Pe@@ ter , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best fl@@ ut@@ es should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes ar@@ gu@@ e about , the pur@@ pose of the thing , or the social acti@@ vity — in this case , m@@ us@@ ical per@@ form@@ ance ."
"And the point , the ess@@ ential nature , of m@@ us@@ ical per@@ form@@ ance is to pro@@ duce exc@@ ell@@ ent mu@@ sic ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ produc@@ t that we &apos;ll all b@@ ene@@ f@@ it .
"But when we think about j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the ess@@ ential nature of the acti@@ vity in question and the qu@@ ali@@ ties that are wor@@ th h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ing and recogni@@ zing ."
"Now , fl@@ ut@@ es may seem ... the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of fl@@ ut@@ es may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al case ."
Let &apos;s take a cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary example of the di@@ sp@@ ute about j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce .
It had to do with go@@ l@@ f .
"C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n — a few years ago , C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good go@@ l@@ f@@ er , but he had a dis@@ ability ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory problem , that made it very pain@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ri@@ ed ri@@ s@@ k of in@@ j@@ ury ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ onal G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers &apos; A@@ s@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t in the P@@ G@@ A t@@ our@@ nam@@ ents ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ t@@ age . &quot; &quot; He su@@ ed , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the go@@ l@@ f car@@ t , because the la@@ w says that the dis@@ ab@@ led must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ated , pro@@ vi@@ ded the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation does not change the ess@@ ential nature of the acti@@ vity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great go@@ l@@ f@@ er ."
I want to com@@ pe@@ te .
But I need a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t to get from one hole to the next . &quot; &quot; S@@ up@@ pose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
S@@ up@@ pose you were deci@@ ding the j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n does have a right to use a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a p@@ ol@@ l , show of h@@ ands ."
How many would ru@@ le in fav@@ or of C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"A@@ ll right , we have a good divi@@ sion of op@@ in@@ i@@ on here ."
"S@@ ome@@ one who would not gr@@ ant C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n the right to a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t , what would be your reason ?"
"R@@ a@@ ise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ ph@@ one ."
( A@@ u@@ dience : It &apos;d be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ t@@ age . ) M@@ S : It would be an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ t@@ age if he gets to ri@@ de in a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t .
"A@@ ll right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the go@@ l@@ f car@@ t wor@@ ry about an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ t@@ age ."
How would you answer the ob@@ jec@@ tion ?
"Y@@ es , all right ."
A@@ u@@ dience : The car@@ t &apos;s not part of the g@@ ame .
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : The car@@ t &apos;s not part of the g@@ ame .
M@@ S : But what about wal@@ king from hole to hole ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the g@@ ame .
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the g@@ ame of go@@ l@@ f ?
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : A@@ ll right . St@@ ay there , Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?
"A@@ ll right , who has an answer for Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e ?"
What would you say ?
"A@@ u@@ dience : The en@@ d@@ ur@@ ance el@@ ement is a very important part of the g@@ ame , wal@@ king all those ho@@ les ."
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king all those ho@@ les ?
That &apos;s part of the g@@ ame of go@@ l@@ f ? ( A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . ) M@@ S : What &apos;s your name ? ( A@@ u@@ dience : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n . ) M@@ S : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ re@@ n ?"
Ch@@ ar@@ le@@ y : I &apos;ll s@@ tic@@ k to my or@@ ig@@ in@@ al the@@ s@@ is .
W@@ ar@@ re@@ n : I am not a go@@ l@@ f@@ er .
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ le@@ y : And I am . ( M@@ S : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lo@@ wer cour@@ t , they br@@ ought in go@@ l@@ f@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s to t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y on this very is@@ sue ."
I@@ s wal@@ king the course ess@@ ential to the g@@ ame ?
And they br@@ ought in J@@ ack N@@ ic@@ k@@ lau@@ s and A@@ r@@ no@@ ld P@@ al@@ m@@ er .
And what do you sup@@ pose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"They said , y@@ es , wal@@ king the course is stre@@ n@@ u@@ ous physical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ."
The f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e fac@@ tor is an important part of go@@ l@@ f .
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the g@@ ame to give him the go@@ l@@ f car@@ t .
"Now , not@@ ice , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you sup@@ pose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n must be pro@@ vi@@ ded a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t ."
"S@@ even to two , they r@@ ul@@ ed ."
"What was interesting about their r@@ ul@@ ing and about the disc@@ us@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the disc@@ us@@ sion about the right , the j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , of the matter dep@@ en@@ ded on fig@@ uring out what is the ess@@ ential nature of go@@ l@@ f ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce St@@ ev@@ ens , wr@@ iting for the maj@@ or@@ ity , said he had read all about the history of go@@ l@@ f , and the ess@@ ential point of the g@@ ame is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a hole in as few st@@ ro@@ kes as possible , and that wal@@ king was not ess@@ ential , but in@@ ci@@ d@@ ental ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ sen@@ ters , one of wh@@ om was J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce S@@ c@@ ali@@ a ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gr@@ an@@ ted the car@@ t , and he had a very interesting dis@@ s@@ ent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ jec@@ ted the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an pre@@ mi@@ se under@@ l@@ ying the maj@@ or@@ ity &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; T@@ o say that something is ess@@ ential is ordin@@ ar@@ ily to say that it is nec@@ ess@@ ary to the achi@@ ev@@ ement of a certain ob@@ ject .
J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce S@@ c@@ ali@@ a &apos;s op@@ in@@ i@@ on is ques@@ tion@@ able for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ ir@@ st , no real sp@@ or@@ ts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) If we had thought that the r@@ ul@@ es of the sp@@ or@@ ts we care about are mer@@ ely ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary , rather than desig@@ ned to call for@@ th the vir@@ tu@@ es and the exc@@ ell@@ ences that we think are wor@@ th@@ y of ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ing , we wouldn &apos;t care about the out@@ come of the g@@ ame ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ jec@@ tion@@ able on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it se@@ em@@ ed to be — this de@@ b@@ ate about the go@@ l@@ f car@@ t — an ar@@ g@@ ument about fa@@ ir@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fa@@ ir adv@@ an@@ t@@ age ."
"But if fa@@ ir@@ ness were the only thing at sta@@ ke , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous solu@@ tion ."
"But le@@ tting everyone ri@@ de in a car@@ t would have been , I su@@ sp@@ ect , more an@@ a@@ them@@ a to the go@@ l@@ f@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ as@@ ey Mar@@ ti@@ n ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as de@@ lic@@ ately as possible : G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers are a little sen@@ si@@ tive about the ath@@ le@@ tic st@@ at@@ us of their g@@ ame .
"( Laughter ) A@@ f@@ ter all , there &apos;s no run@@ ning or j@@ um@@ ping , and the b@@ all st@@ ands still . ( Laughter )"
"So if go@@ l@@ f@@ ing is the kind of g@@ ame that can be play@@ ed while ri@@ ding around in a go@@ l@@ f car@@ t , it would be hard to con@@ f@@ er on the go@@ l@@ f@@ ing gre@@ at@@ s the st@@ at@@ us that we con@@ f@@ er , the h@@ on@@ or and recogni@@ tion that goes to tru@@ ly great ath@@ le@@ t@@ es ."
"That ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates that with go@@ l@@ f , as with fl@@ ut@@ es , it &apos;s hard to deci@@ de the question of what j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce requ@@ i@@ res , without grap@@ pl@@ ing with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the ess@@ ential nature of the acti@@ vity in question , and what qu@@ ali@@ ties , what exc@@ ell@@ ences connec@@ ted with that acti@@ vity , are wor@@ th@@ y of h@@ on@@ or and recogni@@ tion ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fin@@ al example that &apos;s prom@@ in@@ ent in cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary political de@@ b@@ ate : s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x marri@@ age ."
"There are those who fav@@ or state recogni@@ tion only of tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal marri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fav@@ or state recogni@@ tion of s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x marri@@ age ."
How many here fav@@ or the first po@@ lic@@ y : the state should recogni@@ ze tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal marri@@ age only ?
"And how many fav@@ or the second , s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x marri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ p@@ on@@ ents of s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x marri@@ age say that the pur@@ pose of marri@@ age , fundam@@ ent@@ ally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ th@@ y of h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and recogni@@ zing and enc@@ our@@ aging ."
"So with fl@@ ut@@ es , with go@@ l@@ f car@@ ts , and even with a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely con@@ te@@ sted question like s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x marri@@ age , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le has a point ."
V@@ ery hard to ar@@ gu@@ e about j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce without first ar@@ gu@@ ing about the pur@@ pose of social in@@ stitu@@ tions and about what qu@@ ali@@ ties are wor@@ th@@ y of h@@ on@@ or and recogni@@ tion .
"So let &apos;s ste@@ p back from these c@@ ases and see how they shed light on the way we might impro@@ ve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the ter@@ ms of political disc@@ our@@ se in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y to think that if we eng@@ age too direc@@ tly with moral questions in poli@@ tics , that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement , and for that matter , a re@@ ci@@ pe for int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on ."
"So better to sh@@ y away from , to ig@@ n@@ ore , the moral and the religi@@ ous con@@ v@@ ic@@ tions that people bring to civi@@ c life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore the art of democr@@ atic ar@@ g@@ ument ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"Th@@ ank you very much . Th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you . Ch@@ r@@ is . Th@@ an@@ ks , Ch@@ r@@ is . Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : F@@ rom fl@@ ut@@ es to go@@ l@@ f cour@@ s@@ es@@ "
to s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x marri@@ age — that was a gen@@ i@@ us l@@ ink .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of op@@ en education ."
Y@@ our l@@ ec@@ ture ser@@ ies was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vi@@ sion for the next p@@ ha@@ se of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ vers@@ ation , inv@@ iting questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ in@@ ing in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ ight . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong B@@ each , and we do it in a cl@@ ass@@ room at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and ar@@ gu@@ ing , eng@@ aging ser@@ i@@ ously with big moral questions , expl@@ or@@ ing cul@@ tur@@ al differ@@ ences and con@@ n@@ ect through a live vide@@ o ho@@ o@@ k@@ up , students in B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing and M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i and in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge , M@@ ass@@ ach@@ u@@ se@@ t@@ ts and create a global cl@@ ass@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"I want to talk today about — I &apos;ve been asked to take the long view , and I &apos;m going to tell you what I think are the three bi@@ gg@@ est problems for hum@@ an@@ ity from this long point of view ."
"S@@ ome of these have already been tou@@ ched up@@ on by other spe@@ ak@@ ers , which is enc@@ our@@ aging ."
It seems that there &apos;s not just one person who thin@@ ks that these problems are important .
The first is — death is a big problem .
"If you look at the st@@ atis@@ tics , the o@@ d@@ ds are not very fav@@ or@@ able to us ."
"So far , most people who have li@@ ved have also died ."
R@@ ough@@ ly 90 percent of everybody who has been ali@@ ve has died by now .
"So the an@@ n@@ u@@ al death r@@ ate ad@@ ds up to 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 — sor@@ ry , the d@@ a@@ ily death r@@ ate — 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 people per day , which is a huge number by any st@@ and@@ ard ."
"The an@@ n@@ u@@ al death r@@ ate , then , becom@@ es 5@@ 6 million ."
"If we just look at the single , bi@@ gg@@ est c@@ ause of death — aging — it ac@@ coun@@ ts for r@@ ough@@ ly tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds of all human people who die ."
That ad@@ ds up to an an@@ n@@ u@@ al death t@@ ol@@ l of gre@@ ater than the population of C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we don &apos;t see a problem because e@@ ither it &apos;s too fam@@ ili@@ ar or it &apos;s too big ."
C@@ an &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
"So that would be , r@@ ough@@ ly , 3@@ 2@@ 4 people have died since I &apos;ve be@@ gu@@ n spe@@ a@@ king ."
People like — it &apos;s r@@ ough@@ ly the population in this room has just died .
"Now , the human c@@ ost of that is ob@@ vi@@ ous , once you start to think about it — the suff@@ ering , the l@@ oss — it &apos;s also , econom@@ ically , en@@ orm@@ ously wa@@ ste@@ ful ."
"I just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is l@@ ost d@@ ue to natural cau@@ ses of death in gener@@ al , and aging , in particular ."
"Now , of course , this is an under@@ es@@ tim@@ ation ."
A person &apos;s li@@ fe@@ time of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book .
But let &apos;s sup@@ pose we did this .
"@@ 5@@ 2 million people die of natural cau@@ ses each year cor@@ respon@@ ds , then , to 5@@ 2 million v@@ ol@@ um@@ es dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed ."
L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gres@@ s ho@@ l@@ ds 18 million v@@ ol@@ um@@ es .
We are up@@ set about the bur@@ ning of the L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ ri@@ a .
"It &apos;s one of the great cul@@ tur@@ al tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dies that we remember , even today ."
"But this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of three L@@ i@@ br@@ ar@@ ies of Con@@ gres@@ s — bur@@ n@@ t down , fore@@ ver l@@ ost — each year ."
So that &apos;s the first big problem .
"And I w@@ ish G@@ o@@ d@@ spe@@ ed to A@@ u@@ bre@@ y de G@@ re@@ y , and other people like him , to try to do something about this as so@@ on as possible ."
E@@ x@@ ist@@ ential ri@@ s@@ k — the second big problem .
"E@@ x@@ ist@@ ential ri@@ s@@ k is a thre@@ at to human survi@@ v@@ al , or to the lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m p@@ ot@@ ential of our spec@@ ies ."
"You would think that it would be of some inter@@ est to try to find out more about this given that the sta@@ kes are so big , but it &apos;s a very ne@@ gl@@ ected are@@ a ."
"But there have been four stu@@ dies — one by J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ es@@ le@@ y , wr@@ ote a book on this ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the A@@ stron@@ om@@ er R@@ o@@ y@@ al , wh@@ om we heard spe@@ ak y@@ est@@ er@@ day , also has a 50 percent prob@@ ability es@@ tim@@ ate ."
"A@@ no@@ ther au@@ th@@ or doesn &apos;t give any num@@ er@@ ical es@@ tim@@ ate , but says the prob@@ ability is si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant that it will fa@@ il ."
I wr@@ ote a long p@@ ap@@ er on this .
I said assi@@ g@@ ning a less than 20 percent prob@@ ability would be a mi@@ sta@@ ke in light of the curren@@ t evidence we have .
E@@ very@@ body who has looked at this and stu@@ died it ag@@ re@@ es .
Now one percent of six billion people is equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to 60 million .
So that &apos;s a large number .
"If we were to take into ac@@ coun@@ t future gener@@ ations that will never come into exist@@ ence if we b@@ low ourselves up , then the fig@@ ure becom@@ es astron@@ om@@ ical ."
"Th@@ en , even a one per@@ cent@@ age point re@@ duc@@ tion in the ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion ri@@ s@@ k could be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to this astron@@ om@@ ical number — 10 to the power of 3@@ 2 ."
"So if you take into ac@@ coun@@ t future gener@@ ations as much as our own , every other moral im@@ per@@ ative of phil@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic c@@ ost just becom@@ es ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant ."
"Now , let me sp@@ end the rest of my time on the thir@@ d big problem , because it &apos;s more sub@@ t@@ le and perhaps difficult to gr@@ as@@ p ."
"Th@@ ink about some time in your life — some people might never have experienc@@ ed it — but some people , there are just those mom@@ ents that you have experienc@@ ed where life was f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ."
"It might have been at the moment of some great , cre@@ ative insp@@ ir@@ ation you might have had when you just en@@ ter@@ ed this f@@ low st@@ age ."
O@@ r when you underst@@ ood something you had never done before .
O@@ r an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience — a s@@ un@@ set or a great piece of art .
"And you won@@ der , why can &apos;t it be like that all the time ?"
You just want to cl@@ ing on@@ to this .
"And then , of course , it dri@@ f@@ ts back into ordin@@ ary life and the mem@@ ory f@@ ad@@ es ."
"And it &apos;s really difficult to rec@@ all , in a norm@@ al f@@ ra@@ me of mind , just how good life can be at its best ."
O@@ r how bad it can be at its wor@@ st .
The thir@@ d big problem is that life isn &apos;t u@@ su@@ ally as wonderful as it could be .
It &apos;s easy to say what we don &apos;t want .
"@@ Here are a number of things that we don &apos;t want — ill@@ ness , inv@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary death , un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary suff@@ ering , c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty , st@@ un@@ ted grow@@ th , mem@@ ory l@@ oss , ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance , ab@@ s@@ ence of cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
S@@ up@@ pose we fi@@ x@@ ed these things — we did something about all of these .
We were very suc@@ cess@@ ful .
We got ri@@ d of all of these things .
"We might end up with something like this , which is — I mean , it &apos;s a h@@ ec@@ k of a lot better than that ."
But is this really the best we can dre@@ am of ?
I@@ s this the best we can do ?
O@@ r is it possible to find something a little bit more insp@@ ir@@ ing to work to@@ wards ?
"And if we think about this , I think it &apos;s very c@@ lear that there are ways in which we could change things , not just by e@@ li@@ min@@ ating ne@@ g@@ ati@@ ves , but ad@@ ding posi@@ ti@@ ves ."
"O@@ n my w@@ ish li@@ st , at le@@ ast , would be : much longer , health@@ ier lives , gre@@ ater sub@@ jec@@ tive well@@ -@@ being , en@@ h@@ anc@@ ed cogni@@ tive cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , more knowledge and understanding , un@@ lim@@ ited op@@ port@@ unity for pers@@ onal grow@@ th be@@ y@@ on@@ d our curren@@ t bio@@ logical lim@@ its , better relation@@ shi@@ ps , an un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded p@@ ot@@ ential for sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al , moral and int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual develop@@ ment ."
"If we want to achi@@ e@@ ve this , what , in the world , would have to change ?"
And this is the answer — we would have to change .
"@@ Not just the world around us , but we , ourselves ."
"@@ Not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are — our very bio@@ logy ."
H@@ um@@ an nature would have to change .
It &apos;s a pretty p@@ a@@ the@@ tic li@@ st .
"They do great things for a few people who suff@@ er from some speci@@ fic condi@@ tion , but for most people , they don &apos;t really trans@@ form what it is to be human ."
It &apos;s wor@@ th rec@@ all@@ ing that there are a lot of other mo@@ di@@ fic@@ ation techno@@ logi@@ es and en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement techno@@ logi@@ es that we use .
"We have sk@@ in en@@ h@@ anc@@ em@@ ents , c@@ lo@@ thing ."
"As far as I can see , all of you are us@@ ers of this en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement technology in this room , so that &apos;s a great thing ."
"M@@ ood mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ers have been used from time im@@ me@@ mor@@ i@@ al — c@@ aff@@ e@@ ine , al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , n@@ ic@@ ot@@ ine , im@@ m@@ un@@ e system en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement , vi@@ sion en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement , an@@ es@@ the@@ tics — we take that very much for gr@@ an@@ ted , but just think about how great progress that is — like , having an oper@@ ation before an@@ es@@ the@@ tics was not fu@@ n ."
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ac@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ves , cos@@ me@@ tics and brain re@@ pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es — that s@@ ounds om@@ in@@ ous , but the dist@@ inc@@ tion between what is a technology — a g@@ ad@@ get would be the ar@@ ch@@ et@@ y@@ pe — and other ways of chang@@ ing and re@@ wr@@ iting human nature is quite sub@@ t@@ le ."
You &apos;re chang@@ ing the m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ tr@@ uc@@ ture of your brain as you go along .
"So in a bro@@ ad sense , we don &apos;t need to think about technology as only little g@@ ad@@ gets , like these things here , but even in@@ stitu@@ tions and tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , psycho@@ logical me@@ th@@ o@@ ds and so for@@ th ."
F@@ or@@ ms of organi@@ zation can have a pro@@ found imp@@ act on human nature .
"It &apos;s possible to as@@ su@@ me , se@@ tting as@@ i@@ de a possi@@ bility of cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he , that so@@ on@@ er or later we will devel@@ op all of these ."
And even just a couple of these would be enough to trans@@ form the human condi@@ tion .
So let &apos;s look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for impro@@ v@@ ement .
Th@@ ese are really great things .
P@@ art of the reason why we value these tra@@ its is that they make us better at com@@ pe@@ ting with other people — they &apos;re posi@@ ti@@ onal go@@ o@@ ds .
But part of the reason — and that &apos;s the reason why we have e@@ th@@ ical ground for pur@@ su@@ ing these — is that they &apos;re also in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically val@@ u@@ able .
"It &apos;s just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ating with , and to remember what you have learned ."
M@@ o@@ d@@ ali@@ ties and speci@@ al fac@@ ul@@ ties .
"Now , the human mind is not a single un@@ it@@ ary information pro@@ cess@@ or , but it has a lot of different , speci@@ al , ev@@ ol@@ ved mo@@ d@@ ul@@ es that do speci@@ fic things for us ."
"A@@ ll of these would en@@ able , in prin@@ ci@@ ple — be am@@ en@@ able to en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement ."
S@@ ome people have a better m@@ us@@ ical ability and ability to ap@@ preci@@ ate mu@@ sic than others have .
"It &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are — so if these all en@@ ab@@ led great val@@ ues , why should we think that evolution has happened to pro@@ vi@@ de us with all the mo@@ d@@ ali@@ ties we would need to eng@@ age with other val@@ ues that there might be ?"
"But maybe they have another fac@@ ul@@ ty , something else that would seem equ@@ ally ir@@ r@@ ational to us , but they actually ta@@ p into some great possible value there ."
B@@ o@@ di@@ ly fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ality and mor@@ p@@ ho@@ logy and aff@@ ec@@ tive self-@@ control .
G@@ re@@ ater sub@@ jec@@ tive well@@ -@@ being .
"B@@ e able to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch between rel@@ ax@@ ation and acti@@ vity — being able to go s@@ low when you need to do that , and to spe@@ ed up ."
Con@@ scienti@@ ous@@ ness and sym@@ p@@ ath@@ y .
"The ability to — it &apos;s another interesting app@@ lic@@ ation that would have large social r@@ am@@ i@@ fic@@ ation , perhaps ."
"If you could actually cho@@ ose to pres@@ er@@ ve your r@@ om@@ an@@ tic att@@ ach@@ ments to one person , un@@ di@@ min@@ i@@ shed through time , so that wouldn &apos;t have to — love would never have to f@@ ad@@ e if you didn &apos;t want it to ."
That &apos;s probably not all that difficult .
It might just be a simple h@@ orm@@ one or something that could do this .
It &apos;s been done in v@@ ol@@ es .
You can engine@@ er a p@@ ra@@ i@@ ri@@ e v@@ ole to become mon@@ o@@ g@@ am@@ ous when it &apos;s nat@@ ur@@ ally p@@ ol@@ y@@ g@@ am@@ ous .
It &apos;s just a single gen@@ e .
"A possible mo@@ de of being here would be a way of life — a way of being , experienc@@ ing , thinking , seeing , inter@@ ac@@ ting with the world ."
"D@@ own here in this little cor@@ ner , here , we have the little sub@@ -@@ space of this lar@@ ger space that is ac@@ c@@ es@@ sible to human be@@ ings — be@@ ings with our bio@@ logical cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties ."
"It &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s ac@@ c@@ es@@ sible to anim@@ als ; since we are anim@@ als , we are a sub@@ set of that ."
And then you can imagine some en@@ h@@ anc@@ em@@ ents of human cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties .
"There would be different mo@@ des of being you could experience if you were able to st@@ ay ali@@ ve for , say , 200 years ."
Th@@ en you could live sor@@ ts of lives and ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ate w@@ is@@ dom@@ s that are just not possible for hum@@ ans as we curren@@ tly are .
"So then , you move off to this lar@@ ger sp@@ here of &quot; &quot; human + , &quot; &quot; and you could contin@@ ue that process and even@@ tually expl@@ ore a lot of this lar@@ ger space of possible mo@@ des of being ."
"Now , why is that a good thing to do ?"
"Well , we know already that in this little human cir@@ c@@ le there , there are these en@@ orm@@ ously wonderful and wor@@ th@@ while mo@@ des of being — human life at its best is wonderful ."
"We have no reason to believe that within this much , much lar@@ ger space there would not also be extre@@ me@@ ly wor@@ th@@ while mo@@ des of being , perhaps ones that would be way be@@ y@@ on@@ d our w@@ il@@ d@@ est ability even to imagine or dre@@ am about ."
Th@@ an@@ ks .
What you have here is an electr@@ on@@ ic ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e .
"It &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was inv@@ en@@ ted a year or two ago , has given me un@@ told happiness ."
"( Laughter ) A little bit of it , I think , is the n@@ ic@@ ot@@ ine , but there &apos;s something much big@@ ger than that ."
"Wh@@ ich is ever since , in the U.@@ K@@ . , they b@@ an@@ ned s@@ mo@@ king in public places , I &apos;ve never en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed a dr@@ in@@ ks par@@ ty ever again ."
"( Laughter ) And the reason , I only worked out just the other day , which is when you go to a dr@@ in@@ ks par@@ ty and you st@@ and up and you hold a gl@@ ass of red w@@ ine and you talk en@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly to people , you don &apos;t actually want to sp@@ end all the time talking ."
"It &apos;s really , really ti@@ r@@ ing ."
"S@@ ome@@ times you just want to st@@ and there si@@ l@@ ently , al@@ one with your th@@ ough@@ ts ."
S@@ ome@@ times you just want to st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and st@@ are out of the w@@ in@@ do@@ w .
"Now the problem is , when you can &apos;t s@@ mo@@ ke , if you st@@ and and st@@ are out of the w@@ in@@ do@@ w on your own , you &apos;re an an@@ ti@@ social , fri@@ en@@ d@@ less i@@ di@@ ot ."
"( Laughter ) If you st@@ and and st@@ are out of the w@@ in@@ do@@ w on your own with a ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e , you &apos;re a f@@ uc@@ king philosop@@ her . ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So the power of re@@ fr@@ am@@ ing things cannot be over@@ st@@ ated .
"What we have is exactly the same thing , the same acti@@ vity , but one of them makes you feel great and the other one , with just a small change of pos@@ ture , makes you feel ter@@ ri@@ ble ."
And I think one of the problems with cl@@ ass@@ ical econom@@ ics is it &apos;s ab@@ solu@@ tely pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed with reality .
And reality isn &apos;t a partic@@ ul@@ arly good gu@@ i@@ de to human happiness .
"Wh@@ y , for example , are p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers much happ@@ ier than the young un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ?"
"B@@ ot@@ h of them , after all , are in exactly the same st@@ age of life ."
You both have too much time on your h@@ ands and not much money .
"But p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers are re@@ por@@ te@@ dly very , very happy , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily un@@ happy and depres@@ sed ."
"The reason , I think , is that the p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers believe they &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en to be p@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the young un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed feel it &apos;s been thr@@ ust up@@ on them ."
"In Eng@@ land the up@@ per middle cl@@ ass@@ es have actually sol@@ ved this problem per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly , because they &apos;ve re@@ -@@ br@@ an@@ ded un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ."
"If you &apos;re an up@@ per@@ -@@ mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ cl@@ ass English person , you call un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment &quot; &quot; a year off . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s because having a son who &apos;s un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed in M@@ an@@ ch@@ est@@ er is really quite em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing , but having a son who &apos;s un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and is really vie@@ wed as quite an ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment . ( Laughter )"
"But actually the power to re@@ -@@ br@@ and things — to understand that actually our experi@@ ences , cos@@ ts , things don &apos;t actually much dep@@ end on what they really are , but on how we view them — I gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely think can &apos;t be over@@ st@@ ated ."
There &apos;s an experiment I think D@@ ani@@ el P@@ ink re@@ f@@ ers to where you put two do@@ gs in a bo@@ x and the bo@@ x has an elec@@ tri@@ c f@@ lo@@ or .
"E@@ very now and then an elec@@ tri@@ c sho@@ ck is app@@ li@@ ed to the f@@ lo@@ or , which pain@@ s the do@@ gs ."
The only difference is one of the do@@ gs has a small bu@@ tt@@ on in its half of the bo@@ x .
"And when it n@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ les the bu@@ tt@@ on , the elec@@ tri@@ c sho@@ ck st@@ op@@ s ."
The other do@@ g doesn &apos;t have the bu@@ tt@@ on .
"It &apos;s ex@@ posed to exactly the same level of p@@ ain as the do@@ g in the first bo@@ x , but it has no control over the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es ."
G@@ ener@@ ally the first do@@ g can be relati@@ vely cont@@ ent .
The second do@@ g l@@ ap@@ ses into comple@@ te depres@@ sion .
The cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
We ask the question — the whole de@@ b@@ ate in the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world is about the level of ta@@ x@@ ation .
"But I think there &apos;s another de@@ b@@ ate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our ta@@ x money ."
That what cos@@ ts us 10 p@@ ounds in one cont@@ ex@@ t can be a cur@@ se .
What cos@@ ts us 10 p@@ ounds in a different cont@@ ex@@ t we may actually w@@ el@@ come .
"You know , p@@ ay 20@@ ,000 p@@ ounds in ta@@ x to@@ ward health and you &apos;re mer@@ ely feel@@ ing a mu@@ g ."
"@@ P@@ ay 20@@ ,000 p@@ ounds to en@@ do@@ w a h@@ osp@@ ital ward and you &apos;re called a phil@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ st ."
I &apos;m probably in the wrong country to talk about w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to p@@ ay ta@@ x .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;ll give you one in re@@ turn . How you f@@ ra@@ me things really mat@@ ters .
Do you call it the b@@ a@@ il@@ out of G@@ re@@ ece or the b@@ a@@ il@@ out of a lo@@ ad of stu@@ p@@ id b@@ an@@ ks which l@@ ent to G@@ re@@ ece ?
Because they are actually the same thing .
"What you call them actually aff@@ ec@@ ts how you re@@ act to them , vi@@ sc@@ er@@ ally and mor@@ ally ."
I think psycho@@ logical value is great to be ab@@ solu@@ tely h@@ on@@ est .
"One of my great friends , a prof@@ ess@@ or called N@@ ick Ch@@ ater , who &apos;s the P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or of D@@ eci@@ sion S@@ ci@@ ences in L@@ on@@ don , beli@@ ev@@ es that we should sp@@ end far less time looking into hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s hi@@ dd@@ en dep@@ ths and sp@@ end much more time expl@@ or@@ ing the hi@@ dd@@ en sh@@ al@@ lo@@ ws ."
I think that &apos;s true actually .
I think im@@ pres@@ sions have an in@@ s@@ an@@ e eff@@ ect on what we think and what we do .
But what we don &apos;t have is a really good mo@@ de@@ l of human psycho@@ logy .
"A@@ t le@@ ast pre@@ -@@ K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man perhaps , we didn &apos;t have a really good mo@@ de@@ l of human psycho@@ logy to put al@@ on@@ g@@ side mo@@ d@@ els of engine@@ ering , of ne@@ o@@ cl@@ ass@@ ical econom@@ ics ."
So people who beli@@ ev@@ ed in psycho@@ logical solu@@ tions didn &apos;t have a mo@@ de@@ l .
We didn &apos;t have a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work .
This is what W@@ ar@@ re@@ n B@@ u@@ ff@@ et@@ t &apos;s business par@@ t@@ ner Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e M@@ un@@ ger call@@ s &quot; a l@@ at@@ tic@@ e@@ work on which to h@@ ang your ideas . &quot;
"E@@ ng@@ ine@@ ers , econom@@ ists , cl@@ ass@@ ical econom@@ ists all had a very , very ro@@ b@@ ust exist@@ ing l@@ at@@ tic@@ e@@ work on which pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally every idea could be h@@ un@@ g ."
We mer@@ ely have a coll@@ ec@@ tion of ran@@ dom in@@ divi@@ du@@ al in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts without an over@@ all mo@@ de@@ l .
"And what that means is that in looking at solu@@ tions , we &apos;ve probably given too much pri@@ or@@ ity to what I call tech@@ n@@ ical engine@@ ering solu@@ tions , N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ an solu@@ tions , and not ne@@ arly enough to the psycho@@ logical ones ."
You know my example of the E@@ ur@@ os@@ t@@ ar .
S@@ i@@ x million p@@ ounds sp@@ ent to re@@ duce the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y time between P@@ ar@@ is and L@@ on@@ don by about 40 minutes .
"For 0@@ .@@ 0@@ 1 percent of this money you could have put W@@ i@@ F@@ i on the tr@@ ain@@ s , which wouldn &apos;t have re@@ duc@@ ed the d@@ ur@@ ation of the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , but would have impro@@ ved its en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment and its u@@ se@@ ful@@ l@@ ness far more ."
"For maybe 10 percent of the money , you could have p@@ a@@ id all of the world &apos;s top m@@ ale and f@@ em@@ ale super@@ mo@@ d@@ els to wal@@ k up and down the tr@@ ain h@@ anding out f@@ ree Ch@@ ate@@ a@@ u Pe@@ tr@@ us to all the p@@ as@@ sen@@ g@@ ers ."
"You &apos;d still have five &#91; million &#93; p@@ ounds in change , and people would ask for the tr@@ ain@@ s to be s@@ lowed down ."
( Laughter ) Why were we not given the chan@@ ce to sol@@ ve that problem psycho@@ log@@ ically ?
"I think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an im@@ bal@@ ance , an as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ try , in the way we treat cre@@ ative , emoti@@ on@@ all@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven psycho@@ logical ideas ver@@ su@@ s the way we treat r@@ ational , num@@ er@@ ical , sp@@ read@@ sh@@ e@@ et@@ -@@ dri@@ ven ideas ."
"If you &apos;re a cre@@ ative person , I think quite ri@@ gh@@ tly , you have to share all your ideas for appro@@ v@@ al with people much more r@@ ational than you ."
"You have to go in and you have to have a cos@@ t-@@ b@@ ene@@ f@@ it anal@@ ys@@ is , a fe@@ as@@ i@@ bility study , an R@@ O@@ I study and so for@@ th ."
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not app@@ ly the other way around .
"@@ People who have an exist@@ ing fr@@ am@@ e@@ work , an economic fr@@ am@@ e@@ work , an engine@@ ering fr@@ am@@ e@@ work , feel that actually logi@@ c is its own answer ."
"What they don &apos;t say is , &quot; &quot; Well the num@@ bers all seem to ad@@ d up , but before I present this idea , I &apos;ll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better . &quot; &quot; And so we , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally I think , pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze what I &apos;d call m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ tic ideas over psycho@@ logical ideas ."
"A@@ n example of a great psycho@@ logical idea : The single best impro@@ v@@ ement in p@@ as@@ sen@@ ger s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion on the L@@ on@@ don Un@@ der@@ ground per p@@ ound sp@@ ent came when they didn &apos;t ad@@ d any extra tr@@ ain@@ s n@@ or change the f@@ requ@@ enc@@ y of the tr@@ ain@@ s , they put do@@ t mat@@ ri@@ x dis@@ play bo@@ ard on the pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms ."
"Because the nature of a wa@@ it is not just dep@@ en@@ dent on its num@@ er@@ ical qu@@ ality , its d@@ ur@@ ation , but on the level of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty you experience d@@ uring that wa@@ it ."
"W@@ a@@ iting se@@ ven minutes for a tr@@ ain with a coun@@ t@@ down c@@ loc@@ k is less f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and ir@@ r@@ it@@ ating than wa@@ iting four minutes , k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ iting going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en &apos;s this tr@@ ain going to d@@ am@@ n well ar@@ ri@@ ve ? &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a beautiful example of a psycho@@ logical solu@@ tion dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed in K@@ o@@ re@@ a ."
R@@ ed tra@@ ff@@ ic ligh@@ ts have a coun@@ t@@ down d@@ el@@ ay .
It &apos;s pro@@ ven to re@@ duce the ac@@ ci@@ dent r@@ ate in experim@@ ents .
"Wh@@ y ? Because ro@@ ad r@@ age , imp@@ ati@@ ence and gener@@ al ir@@ r@@ it@@ ation are massi@@ vely re@@ duc@@ ed when you can actually see the time you have to wa@@ it ."
"In China , not really understanding the prin@@ ci@@ ple be@@ h@@ ind this , they app@@ li@@ ed the same prin@@ ci@@ ple to gre@@ en tra@@ ff@@ ic ligh@@ ts ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich isn &apos;t a great idea .
"You &apos;re 200 y@@ ar@@ ds away , you reali@@ ze you &apos;ve got five secon@@ ds to go , you f@@ lo@@ or it ."
"( Laughter ) The K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , very assi@@ du@@ ously , did test both ."
The ac@@ ci@@ dent r@@ ate goes down when you app@@ ly this to red tra@@ ff@@ ic ligh@@ ts ; it goes up when you app@@ ly it to gre@@ en tra@@ ff@@ ic ligh@@ ts .
"This is all I &apos;m as@@ king for really in human deci@@ sion making , is the consi@@ der@@ ation of these three things ."
I &apos;m not as@@ king for the comple@@ te pri@@ m@@ acy of one over the other .
"I &apos;m mer@@ ely saying that when you sol@@ ve problems , you should look at all three of these equ@@ ally and you should see@@ k as far as possible to find solu@@ tions which s@@ it in the s@@ we@@ et sp@@ ot in the middle ."
"If you actually look at a great business , you &apos;ll ne@@ arly always see all of these three things coming into play ."
"R@@ e@@ ally , really suc@@ cess@@ ful bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es — G@@ oo@@ g@@ le is great , great techno@@ logical suc@@ cess , but it &apos;s also bas@@ ed on a very good psycho@@ logical in@@ sight : People believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else ."
It &apos;s an in@@ n@@ ate thing called go@@ al di@@ l@@ u@@ tion .
A@@ y@@ el@@ et F@@ i@@ sh@@ b@@ ach has wr@@ it@@ ten a p@@ ap@@ er about this .
"E@@ very@@ body else at the time of G@@ oo@@ g@@ le , more or less , was trying to be a port@@ al ."
"Y@@ es , there &apos;s a sear@@ ch fun@@ c@@ tion , but you also have we@@ a@@ ther , sp@@ or@@ ts sc@@ o@@ res , b@@ its of news ."
"@@ G@@ oo@@ g@@ le underst@@ ood that if you &apos;re just a sear@@ ch eng@@ ine , people as@@ su@@ me you &apos;re a very , very good sear@@ ch eng@@ ine ."
A@@ ll of you know this actually from when you go in to bu@@ y a tel@@ evi@@ sion .
And in the s@@ ha@@ b@@ bi@@ er end of the row of fl@@ at scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s you can see are these rather des@@ p@@ is@@ ed things called com@@ b@@ ined T@@ V and D@@ V@@ D play@@ ers .
"And we have no knowledge wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever of the qu@@ ality of those things , but we look at a com@@ b@@ ined T@@ V and D@@ V@@ D play@@ er and we go , &quot; &quot; U@@ ck ."
It &apos;s probably a bit of a cra@@ p tel@@ ly and a bit ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish as a D@@ V@@ D play@@ er . &quot; &quot; So we wal@@ k out of the sho@@ ps with one of each .
G@@ oo@@ g@@ le is as much a psycho@@ logical suc@@ cess as it is a techno@@ logical one .
I pro@@ pose that we can use psycho@@ logy to sol@@ ve problems that we didn &apos;t even reali@@ ze were problems at all .
This is my su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion for getting people to fin@@ ish their course of an@@ ti@@ bi@@ ot@@ ics .
D@@ on &apos;t give them 2@@ 4 white p@@ ills .
G@@ i@@ ve them 18 white p@@ ills and six bl@@ ue ones and tell them to take the white p@@ ills first and then take the bl@@ ue ones .
It &apos;s called ch@@ un@@ king .
The li@@ ke@@ li@@ ho@@ od that people will get to the end is much gre@@ ater when there is a mil@@ est@@ one some@@ where in the middle .
"One of the great mi@@ sta@@ kes , I think , of econom@@ ics is it fa@@ il@@ s to understand that what something is , whether it &apos;s re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , c@@ ost , is a fun@@ c@@ tion , not only of its amount , but also its mean@@ ing ."
This is a t@@ ol@@ l cr@@ os@@ sing in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain .
Q@@ u@@ ite often qu@@ e@@ ues happen at the t@@ ol@@ ls .
"S@@ ome@@ times you get very , very se@@ v@@ ere qu@@ e@@ ues ."
"You could app@@ ly the same prin@@ ci@@ ple actually , if you like , to the sec@@ ur@@ ity lan@@ es in a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts ."
"What would happen if you could actually p@@ ay tw@@ ice as much money to cr@@ oss the bri@@ dge , but go through a lan@@ e that &apos;s an ex@@ pres@@ s lan@@ e ?"
It &apos;s not an un@@ reas@@ on@@ able thing to do . It &apos;s an econom@@ ically eff@@ ici@@ ent thing to do .
T@@ i@@ me means more to some people than others .
"If you &apos;re wa@@ iting trying to get to a job inter@@ view , you &apos;d pat@@ ently p@@ ay a couple of p@@ ounds more to go through the f@@ ast lan@@ e ."
"If you &apos;re on the way to vi@@ s@@ it your mother in@@ -@@ la@@ w , you &apos;d probably pre@@ f@@ er to st@@ ay on the left ."
"The only problem is if you int@@ ro@@ duce this econom@@ ically eff@@ ici@@ ent solu@@ tion , people h@@ ate it ."
"Because they think you &apos;re de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately cre@@ ating d@@ el@@ ays at the bri@@ dge in order to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze your re@@ ven@@ ue , and &quot; &quot; Why on ear@@ th should I p@@ ay to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze your im@@ com@@ pe@@ t@@ ence ? &quot; &quot; O@@ n the other hand , change the f@@ ra@@ me s@@ ligh@@ tly and create char@@ it@@ able y@@ i@@ el@@ d man@@ ag@@ ement , so the extra money you get goes not to the bri@@ dge comp@@ any , it goes to char@@ ity , and the mental w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to p@@ ay completely changes ."
"You have a relati@@ vely econom@@ ically eff@@ ici@@ ent solu@@ tion , but one that actually me@@ ets with public appro@@ v@@ al and even a small de@@ gre@@ e of aff@@ ec@@ tion , rather than being seen as b@@ a@@ star@@ dy ."
So where econom@@ ists make the fundamental mi@@ sta@@ ke is they think that money is money .
"A@@ c@@ tually my p@@ ain experienc@@ ed in p@@ ay@@ ing five p@@ ounds is not just pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate to the amount , but where I think that money is going ."
And I think understanding that could re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ i@@ ze ta@@ x po@@ lic@@ y .
It could re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ i@@ ze the public serv@@ ices .
It could really change things quite si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
He &apos;s an A@@ u@@ stri@@ an school econom@@ ist who was first ac@@ tive in the first half of the 20@@ th century in V@@ i@@ en@@ n@@ a .
What was interesting about the A@@ u@@ stri@@ an school is they actually gre@@ w up al@@ on@@ g@@ side F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
And so they &apos;re pre@@ dom@@ in@@ an@@ tly interest@@ ed in psycho@@ logy .
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that there was a di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine called p@@ ra@@ x@@ e@@ o@@ logy , which is a pri@@ or di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine to the study of econom@@ ics ."
"@@ P@@ ra@@ x@@ e@@ o@@ logy is the study of human cho@@ ice , action and deci@@ sion making ."
I think they &apos;re right .
I think the d@@ an@@ ger we have in today &apos;s world is we have the study of econom@@ ics consi@@ d@@ ers itself to be a pri@@ or di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine to the study of human psycho@@ logy .
"But as Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e M@@ un@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; If econom@@ ics isn &apos;t behavi@@ or@@ al , I don &apos;t know what the h@@ ell is . &quot; &quot; V@@ on M@@ is@@ es , interest@@ ing@@ ly , beli@@ ev@@ es econom@@ ics is just a sub@@ set of psycho@@ logy ."
I think he just re@@ f@@ ers to econom@@ ics as &quot; the study of human p@@ ra@@ x@@ e@@ o@@ logy under condi@@ tions of sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity . &quot;
"But v@@ on M@@ is@@ es , am@@ ong many other things , I think us@@ es an anal@@ o@@ gy which is probably the best j@@ us@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation and ex@@ plan@@ ation for the value of mar@@ ke@@ ting , the value of per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being ab@@ solu@@ tely equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to any other kind of value ."
"We t@@ end to , all of us — even those of us who work in mar@@ ke@@ ting — to think of value in two ways ."
"There &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a fac@@ t@@ ory and pro@@ vi@@ de a serv@@ ice , and then there &apos;s a kind of du@@ bi@@ ous value , which you create by chang@@ ing the way people look at things ."
V@@ on M@@ is@@ es completely re@@ jec@@ ted this dist@@ inc@@ tion .
And he used this fol@@ lowing anal@@ o@@ gy .
"He re@@ fer@@ red actually to stran@@ ge econom@@ ists called the F@@ ren@@ ch P@@ hy@@ si@@ o@@ cr@@ at@@ s , who beli@@ ev@@ ed that the only true value was what you extr@@ ac@@ ted from the land ."
"So if you &apos;re a sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d or a qu@@ ar@@ r@@ y@@ man or a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er , you cre@@ ated true value ."
"If ho@@ w@@ ever , you b@@ ought some w@@ o@@ ol from the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d and char@@ g@@ ed a pre@@ mi@@ um for con@@ ver@@ ting it into a h@@ at , you wer@@ en &apos;t actually cre@@ ating value , you were exp@@ lo@@ iting the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d ."
Now v@@ on M@@ is@@ es said that moder@@ n econom@@ ists make exactly the same mi@@ sta@@ ke with re@@ g@@ ard to ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing and mar@@ ke@@ ting .
"He says , if you run a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant , there is no health@@ y dist@@ inc@@ tion to be made between the value you create by co@@ o@@ king the food and the value you create by s@@ wee@@ ping the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"One of them cre@@ ates , perhaps , the pri@@ mar@@ y produc@@ t — the thing we think we &apos;re p@@ ay@@ ing for — the other one cre@@ ates a cont@@ ex@@ t within which we can en@@ jo@@ y and ap@@ preci@@ ate that produc@@ t ."
And the idea that one of them should actually have pri@@ or@@ ity over the other is fundam@@ ent@@ ally wrong .
T@@ ry this qu@@ ick thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant that ser@@ ves M@@ ic@@ hel@@ in@@ -@@ star@@ red food , but actually where the re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant sm@@ ells of se@@ w@@ age and there &apos;s human f@@ ec@@ es on the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to impro@@ ve the food still f@@ ur@@ ther , it &apos;s to get ri@@ d of the sm@@ ell and c@@ le@@ an up the f@@ lo@@ or ."
And it &apos;s v@@ ital we understand this .
"If that seems like some stran@@ ge , ab@@ str@@ use thing , in the U.@@ K@@ . , the p@@ ost off@@ ice had a 9@@ 8 percent suc@@ cess r@@ ate at de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing fir@@ st@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ma@@ il the next day ."
They decided this wasn &apos;t good enough and they wanted to get it up to 9@@ 9 .
The eff@@ ort to do that almost bro@@ ke the organi@@ zation .
"If at the same time you &apos;d g@@ one and asked people , &quot; What per@@ cent@@ age of fir@@ st@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ma@@ il ar@@ ri@@ ves the next day ? &quot;"
"@@ the average answer , or the mo@@ d@@ al answer would have been 50 to 60 percent ."
"Now if your per@@ cep@@ tion is much wor@@ se than your reality , what on ear@@ th are you doing trying to change the reality ?"
That &apos;s like trying to impro@@ ve the food in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant that st@@ in@@ ks .
"What you need to do is first of all tell people that 9@@ 8 percent of ma@@ il gets there the next day , fir@@ st@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ma@@ il ."
That &apos;s pretty good .
"I would ar@@ gu@@ e , in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain there &apos;s a much better f@@ ra@@ me of re@@ fer@@ ence , which is to tell people that more fir@@ st@@ -@@ cl@@ ass ma@@ il ar@@ ri@@ ves the next day in the U.@@ K@@ . than in G@@ er@@ many ."
"Because gener@@ ally in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the G@@ er@@ m@@ ans ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ ho@@ ose your f@@ ra@@ me of re@@ fer@@ ence and the per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved value and ther@@ e@@ fore the ac@@ tual value is completely tran@@ form@@ ed .
It has to be said of the G@@ er@@ m@@ ans that the G@@ er@@ m@@ ans and the F@@ ren@@ ch are doing a br@@ illi@@ ant job of cre@@ ating a un@@ ited Euro@@ pe .
The only thing they don &apos;t exp@@ ect is they &apos;re un@@ iting Euro@@ pe through a s@@ ha@@ red mi@@ ld h@@ at@@ red of the F@@ ren@@ ch and G@@ er@@ m@@ ans .
"But I &apos;m B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh , that &apos;s the way we like it ."
What you also not@@ ice is that in any case our per@@ cep@@ tion is le@@ ak@@ y .
We can &apos;t tell the difference between the qu@@ ality of the food and the environ@@ ment in which we con@@ su@@ me it .
A@@ ll of you will have seen this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on if you have your c@@ ar was@@ h@@ ed or val@@ e@@ ted .
"When you dri@@ ve away , your c@@ ar fe@@ els as if it dri@@ ves better ."
"And the reason for this , un@@ less my c@@ ar val@@ et my@@ st@@ eri@@ ously is chang@@ ing the o@@ il and per@@ form@@ ing work which I &apos;m not p@@ ay@@ ing him for and I &apos;m un@@ aw@@ are of , is because per@@ cep@@ tion is in any case le@@ ak@@ y ."
A@@ n@@ al@@ g@@ es@@ ics that are br@@ an@@ ded are more effec@@ tive at re@@ duc@@ ing p@@ ain than anal@@ g@@ es@@ ics that are not br@@ an@@ ded .
"I don &apos;t just mean through re@@ por@@ ted p@@ ain re@@ duc@@ tion , ac@@ tual meas@@ u@@ red p@@ ain re@@ duc@@ tion ."
And so per@@ cep@@ tion actually is le@@ ak@@ y in any case .
"So if you do something that &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tually bad in one resp@@ ect , you can d@@ am@@ age the other ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I work in mar@@ ke@@ ting , which I love , but my first p@@ assion was physics , a p@@ assion br@@ ought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gr@@ ay ha@@ ir ."
So he t@@ au@@ ght me that physics is co@@ ol because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So qu@@ ick show of h@@ ands — who stu@@ died some mar@@ ke@@ ting in univers@@ ity ?
Wh@@ o stu@@ died some physics in univers@@ ity ?
P@@ re@@ tty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , ho@@ pe@@ fully this will bring back some happy , or possi@@ bly some s@@ ligh@@ tly dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing me@@ mor@@ ies ."
"So , physics and mar@@ ke@@ ting ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on &apos;s L@@ a@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als mass times ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines should have stu@@ died a bit more care@@ fully before they r@@ an this cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge this form@@ ul@@ a qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , we can get to ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ation equ@@ als force over mass , which means that for a lar@@ ger partic@@ le — a lar@@ ger mass — it requ@@ i@@ res more force to change its direc@@ tion ."
"It &apos;s the same with br@@ ands : the more massive a br@@ and , the more b@@ ag@@ g@@ age it has , the more force is needed to change its posi@@ tion@@ ing ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why A@@ r@@ th@@ ur A@@ n@@ der@@ s@@ en ch@@ ose to lau@@ n@@ ch A@@ c@@ cent@@ ure rather than try to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the world that A@@ n@@ der@@ s@@ en &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ coun@@ t@@ anc@@ y .
"It expl@@ ain@@ s why H@@ o@@ over found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the world that it was more than v@@ ac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , and why comp@@ an@@ ies like Un@@ il@@ ever and P &@@ am@@ p@@ ; G keep br@@ ands se@@ par@@ ate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ r@@ ing@@ les and D@@ o@@ ve rather than having one gi@@ ant paren@@ t br@@ and ."
"The mar@@ ke@@ ting is , the big@@ ger a br@@ and , the more difficult it is to re@@ posi@@ tion it ."
So think about a port@@ fo@@ li@@ o of br@@ ands or maybe new br@@ ands for new ven@@ tures .
"Now , who remem@@ bers H@@ e@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty prin@@ ci@@ ple ?"
G@@ e@@ tting a little more tech@@ n@@ ical now .
"So this says that it &apos;s im@@ possible , by defin@@ i@@ tion , to measure exactly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the posi@@ tion — and the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m of a partic@@ le , because the act of meas@@ uring it , by defin@@ i@@ tion , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the ph@@ ot@@ on of light has mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m , which kno@@ c@@ ks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y meas@@ uring it , the act of meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of ob@@ serv@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in mar@@ ke@@ ting .
"So with the act of ob@@ ser@@ ving con@@ sum@@ ers , changes their behavior ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mom@@ s who are talking about their wonderful children in a fo@@ c@@ us group , and almost n@@ one of them bu@@ y lots of j@@ un@@ k food ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s sel@@ ls hund@@ re@@ ds of m@@ illions of bur@@ g@@ ers every year ."
"Y@@ et , at G@@ oo@@ g@@ le , we know it &apos;s the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sear@@ ched for cat@@ eg@@ ory ."
"So l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , the science — no , sor@@ ry — the mar@@ ke@@ ting is getting eas@@ ier ."
"@@ L@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , with now better po@@ int@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ s@@ ale tr@@ ac@@ king , more dig@@ ital me@@ dia con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , you can measure more what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never ac@@ cur@@ ately and exactly measure a partic@@ le , because the ob@@ serv@@ ation changes it ."
"The mar@@ ke@@ ting is — the mess@@ age for mar@@ ke@@ ting is — that try to measure what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can g@@ a@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is or a posi@@ tion@@ ing , and it will stre@@ ng@@ then it , but it will not con@@ clu@@ si@@ vely pro@@ ve it ."
And only one con@@ tr@@ ary data point can b@@ low your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ to@@ le@@ my had do@@ z@@ ens of data poin@@ ts to sup@@ port his theory that the plan@@ ets would r@@ ot@@ ate around the Earth .
It only took one ro@@ b@@ ust ob@@ serv@@ ation from C@@ oper@@ n@@ ic@@ us to b@@ low that idea out of the water .
"T@@ a@@ ke B@@ P — they sp@@ ent m@@ illions of p@@ ounds over many years building up its cre@@ d@@ enti@@ als as an environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ en@@ dly br@@ and , but then one little ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
Th@@ ink about T@@ o@@ y@@ ot@@ a .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ ver@@ ed as the most reli@@ able of car@@ s , and then they had the big rec@@ all in@@ ci@@ dent ."
"And T@@ i@@ ger W@@ oo@@ ds , for a long time , the per@@ f@@ ect br@@ and am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot pro@@ ve a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ pro@@ ve it — any hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is is s@@ ha@@ k@@ y ."
"And the mar@@ ke@@ ting is that not matter how much you &apos;ve inv@@ est@@ ed in your br@@ and , one bad week can under@@ m@@ ine dec@@ ad@@ es of good work ."
So be really care@@ ful to try and av@@ o@@ id the scre@@ w@@ -@@ u@@ ps that can under@@ m@@ ine your br@@ and .
"And la@@ st@@ ly , to the s@@ ligh@@ tly ob@@ sc@@ ure world of entropy — the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of mar@@ ke@@ ting .
"If we go back 20 years , the one mess@@ age pretty much contro@@ l@@ led by one mar@@ ke@@ ting man@@ ag@@ er could pretty much de@@ fine a br@@ and ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a str@@ ong br@@ and im@@ age or a mess@@ age and put it out there like the Con@@ serv@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you l@@ ose control of it .
"W@@ ith the kind of dig@@ ital com@@ ment cre@@ ation and dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion to@@ ols that are av@@ a@@ il@@ able now to every con@@ sum@@ er , it &apos;s im@@ possible to control where it goes ."
"Y@@ our br@@ and star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more cha@@ ot@@ ic . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your control . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him spe@@ ak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ se@@ tt@@ ling for mar@@ ke@@ ters , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of br@@ and energy gets your br@@ and cl@@ os@@ er to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of energy a democr@@ ati@@ zing force , which is ul@@ tim@@ ately good for your br@@ and ."
"So , the l@@ es@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fundamental la@@ w ."
The mess@@ age for mar@@ ke@@ ting is that your br@@ and is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ br@@ ace it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .

"We are going to take a qu@@ ick v@@ o@@ y@@ age over the cogni@@ tive history of the 20@@ th century , because d@@ uring that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally ."
"As you all know , the car@@ s that people dro@@ ve in 19@@ 00 have al@@ ter@@ ed because the ro@@ ads are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed , too ."
"And these in@@ clu@@ de things like c@@ lo@@ thing that con@@ cre@@ te world with cl@@ assi@@ fic@@ ation , int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ing ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions that we try to make log@@ ically consi@@ st@@ ent , and also taking the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , that is , wonder@@ ing about what might have been rather than what is ."
"Now , this dr@@ am@@ atic change was d@@ ra@@ wn to my att@@ en@@ tion through massive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . g@@ ain@@ s over time , and these have been tru@@ ly massive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts than each suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding generation back to the time that they were inv@@ en@@ ted .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , if you sc@@ ore the people a century ago against moder@@ n n@@ or@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 7@@ 0 ."
"If you sc@@ ore us against their n@@ or@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ is@@ ed all sor@@ ts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ me@@ di@@ ate an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ d@@ ation ?
Because 7@@ 0 is norm@@ ally the sc@@ ore for mental re@@ t@@ ar@@ d@@ ation .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the cu@@ tting line for gi@@ f@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and ar@@ gu@@ e for a thir@@ d al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that &apos;s much more ill@@ um@@ in@@ ating than e@@ ither of those , and to put this into per@@ spec@@ tive , let &apos;s imagine that a Mar@@ ti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined civi@@ li@@ zation ."
"And this Mar@@ ti@@ an was an ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ logi@@ st , and they found sc@@ o@@ res , t@@ ar@@ get sc@@ o@@ res , that people had used for sho@@ ot@@ ing ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a minut@@ e , people had only put one b@@ ul@@ let in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e in a minut@@ e ."
And then about 19@@ 18 they put a hundred b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts in the b@@ ul@@ l@@ se@@ y@@ e .
"And in@@ i@@ ti@@ ally , that ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ logi@@ st would be b@@ aff@@ led ."
"They would say , look , these te@@ sts were desig@@ ned to find out how much people were ste@@ ad@@ y of hand , how ke@@ en their ey@@ es@@ ight was , whether they had control of their we@@ ap@@ on ."
How could these per@@ form@@ anc@@ es have es@@ cal@@ ated to this en@@ orm@@ ous de@@ gre@@ e ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment that was in the h@@ ands of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was respon@@ sible , not gre@@ ater ke@@ en@@ ness of ey@@ e or ste@@ ad@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental arti@@ l@@ l@@ ery that we have pic@@ ked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ ker will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ ur@@ ia ."
"@@ L@@ ur@@ ia looked at people just before they en@@ ter@@ ed the scienti@@ fic age , and he found that these people were re@@ sist@@ ant to cl@@ assi@@ f@@ ying the con@@ cre@@ te world ."
They wanted to bre@@ ak it up into little b@@ its that they could use .
"He found that they were re@@ sist@@ ant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to spec@@ ul@@ ating about what might be , and he found fin@@ ally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions or using logi@@ c on those ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions ."
Now let me give you a s@@ am@@ ple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He tal@@ ked to the head man of a person in r@@ ural R@@ us@@ si@@ a .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 19@@ 00 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do c@@ ro@@ ws and f@@ ish have in common ?"
"And the f@@ el@@ low said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a f@@ ish . I can &apos;t e@@ at a c@@ row ."
A c@@ row can p@@ ec@@ k at a f@@ ish .
"The other is a bir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interest@@ ed , effec@@ ti@@ vely , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And then L@@ ur@@ ia went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
H@@ am@@ bur@@ g is a c@@ ity in G@@ er@@ many .
"A@@ re there cam@@ els in H@@ am@@ bur@@ g ? &quot; &quot; And the f@@ el@@ low said , &quot; Well , if it &apos;s large enough , there ought to be cam@@ els there . &quot;"
"And L@@ ur@@ ia said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words imp@@ ly ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for cam@@ els . &quot; &quot; I@@ n other words , he was un@@ w@@ ill@@ ing to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to cam@@ els being in vill@@ ages , and he was quite un@@ able to use the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical , to ask h@@ im@@ self what if there were no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
A thir@@ d inter@@ view was conduc@@ ted with someone about the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole .
"And L@@ ur@@ ia said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ar@@ s are white ."
"What col@@ or are the be@@ ar@@ s at the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; S@@ uch a thing is to be se@@ tt@@ led by t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y ."
"If a wi@@ se person came from the N@@ or@@ th P@@ ole and told me the be@@ ar@@ s were white , I might believe him , but every be@@ ar that I have seen is a bro@@ wn be@@ ar . &quot; &quot; Now you see again , this person has re@@ jec@@ ted going be@@ y@@ on@@ d the con@@ cre@@ te world and anal@@ y@@ zing it through every@@ day experience , and it was important to that person what col@@ or be@@ ar@@ s were — that is , they had to h@@ un@@ t be@@ ar@@ s ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ ill@@ ing to eng@@ age in this .
"One of them said to L@@ ur@@ ia , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that are@@ n &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few ill@@ u@@ str@@ ations .
"F@@ ir@@ st , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"That is , we &apos;ve g@@ one from four to eight years of education to 12 years of form@@ al education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experienc@@ ed some t@@ y@@ pe of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
"Now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scienti@@ fic , and you can &apos;t do science without cl@@ assi@@ f@@ ying the world ."
You can &apos;t do science without pro@@ pos@@ ing hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it log@@ ically consi@@ st@@ ent .
"And even down in gra@@ de school , things have changed ."
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 4@@ 5 st@@ ates that exist@@ ed at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exam@@ s that the state of O@@ hi@@ o gave in 19@@ 90 , they were all about ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions ."
"They were things like , why is the lar@@ g@@ est c@@ ity of a state ra@@ re@@ ly the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in H@@ ar@@ ri@@ s@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
So the ten@@ or of education has changed .
"We are educ@@ ating people to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , to use ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions , and to l@@ ink them log@@ ically ."
What about emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ?
"Well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of Americ@@ ans pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed prof@@ es@@ sions that were cogni@@ ti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding ."
O@@ n@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or doc@@ tors or teachers .
"T@@ o@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans pr@@ acti@@ ce cogni@@ ti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding prof@@ es@@ sions , not only to the prof@@ es@@ sions pro@@ per like la@@ w@@ y@@ er or doc@@ tor or scienti@@ st or l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ r , but many , many sub@@ -@@ prof@@ es@@ sions having to do with being a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an , a computer pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ er ."
A whole ran@@ ge of prof@@ es@@ sions now make cogni@@ tive de@@ m@@ ands .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cogni@@ ti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding prof@@ es@@ sions .
The prof@@ es@@ sions have been up@@ gra@@ ded .
"C@@ om@@ p@@ are the doc@@ tor in 19@@ 00 , who really had only a few tr@@ ic@@ ks up his s@@ le@@ e@@ ve , with the moder@@ n gener@@ al pr@@ acti@@ tion@@ er or speci@@ ali@@ st , with years of scienti@@ fic tr@@ ain@@ ing ."
They went far be@@ y@@ on@@ d that 19@@ 00 b@@ an@@ ker .
They had to look at computer pro@@ jec@@ tions for the h@@ ous@@ ing market .
They had to get comp@@ lic@@ ated C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ ared in order to b@@ und@@ le de@@ b@@ t together and make de@@ b@@ t look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er today .
I take the f@@ ar@@ m man@@ ag@@ er of today as very different from the f@@ ar@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 00 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ gra@@ ding of t@@ as@@ ks like la@@ w@@ y@@ er and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ m@@ ands on our cogni@@ tive fac@@ ul@@ ties .
But I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about education and emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ ily a moral philosop@@ her .
"Now over the last century , in develop@@ ed n@@ ations like America , moral de@@ b@@ ate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously , and we also take univers@@ als ser@@ i@@ ously and look for logical connec@@ tions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univers@@ ity at the time of Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents with their parents and gr@@ and@@ parents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ dly r@@ ac@@ i@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were in@@ f@@ eri@@ or .
"And when we said to our parents and gr@@ and@@ parents , &quot; How would you feel if tom@@ or@@ row mor@@ ning you w@@ o@@ ke up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the d@@ um@@ best thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mo@@ res and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they had in@@ her@@ ited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the ol@@ der generation says , well , our government ta@@ kes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ ill@@ ing to take the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ic father wh@@ ose d@@ aughter has been r@@ ap@@ ed , and he fe@@ els he &apos;s h@@ on@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ her@@ ited mo@@ res .
"T@@ o@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were kno@@ c@@ ked un@@ consci@@ ous and so@@ dom@@ i@@ zed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the K@@ or@@ an ."
That &apos;s not one of the prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univers@@ ali@@ ze your prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es ."
You state them as ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions and you use logi@@ c on them .
"You have to say , well , bl@@ ac@@ k@@ ness of sk@@ in , you couldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that ."
It must be that bl@@ ac@@ ks are some@@ how tain@@ ted .
"And then we can bring emp@@ ir@@ ical evidence to be@@ ar , can &apos;t we , and say , well how can you consi@@ der all bl@@ ac@@ ks tain@@ ted when St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine was black and Th@@ om@@ as S@@ o@@ well is black ."
"And you can get moral ar@@ g@@ ument off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es as con@@ cre@@ te enti@@ ties ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univers@@ als , to be ren@@ der@@ ed consi@@ st@@ ent by logi@@ c ."
That &apos;s what in@@ i@@ ti@@ ally got me going on cogni@@ tive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the g@@ ain@@ s have been gre@@ at@@ est in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ at@@ ter@@ y that are about using logi@@ c on ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tions .
"And in 19@@ 00 , people could do simple anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es ."
"That is , if you said to them , cat@@ s are like w@@ il@@ d@@ cat@@ s ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 19@@ 60 , people could att@@ ack R@@ a@@ ven &apos;s on a much more s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two s@@ qu@@ are@@ s fol@@ lowed by a tri@@ ang@@ le , what fol@@ lo@@ ws two cir@@ cl@@ es ?"
They could say a se@@ m@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ le .
"@@ J@@ ust as a tri@@ ang@@ le is half of a s@@ qu@@ are , a se@@ m@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ le is half of a cir@@ c@@ le ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates , if you said two cir@@ cl@@ es fol@@ lowed by a se@@ m@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ le , two si@@ x@@ te@@ ens fol@@ lowed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 1@@ 6 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very di@@ sh@@ ear@@ ten@@ ing ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t made progress on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve not@@ ic@@ ed , in a tre@@ nd am@@ ong young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about fore@@ ig@@ n l@@ ands , and they &apos;re ess@@ enti@@ ally a@@ hi@@ st@@ or@@ ical ."
They live in the bu@@ b@@ ble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the K@@ o@@ re@@ an W@@ ar from the war in V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time W@@ est@@ er@@ n ar@@ mi@@ es have g@@ one to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an to put its h@@ ouse in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous oc@@ cas@@ i@@ ons ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had b@@ are@@ ly left , and there wasn &apos;t a tr@@ ace in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six war@@ s .
"You know , the S@@ pan@@ ish didn &apos;t s@@ ink the b@@ att@@ l@@ es@@ hi@@ p M@@ a@@ ine , the L@@ us@@ it@@ ani@@ a was not an in@@ no@@ cent v@@ es@@ se@@ l but was lo@@ ad@@ ed with m@@ uni@@ tions , the N@@ or@@ th V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese did not att@@ ack the S@@ even@@ th F@@ le@@ et , and , of course , S@@ ad@@ d@@ am H@@ us@@ se@@ in h@@ ated al Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a and had nothing to do with it , and yet the ad@@ min@@ i@@ str@@ ation con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed 4@@ 5 percent of the people that they were bro@@ thers in ar@@ ms , when he would h@@ ang one from the ne@@ are@@ st l@@ am@@ p@@ p@@ ost ."
But I don &apos;t want to end on a p@@ es@@ sim@@ is@@ tic n@@ ote .
"@@ L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people b@@ a@@ thing in the N@@ or@@ th S@@ e@@ a , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what white bo@@ dies the lo@@ wer ord@@ ers have ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s if they were a re@@ p@@ ti@@ le ."
"A@@ n im@@ age is wor@@ th more than a thous@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few imag@@ es that I rec@@ ently cap@@ tu@@ red ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ her , as an arti@@ st , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it is an im@@ age of a so@@ ap bu@@ b@@ ble cap@@ tu@@ red at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ st@@ ing , as you can see in this im@@ age , whether it &apos;s a universe made of t@@ iny little be@@ ads of o@@ il pain@@ t , stran@@ ge li@@ qu@@ i@@ ds that be@@ have in very p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ways , or pain@@ t that is mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed by cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to l@@ ink those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate this bas@@ ed on three pro@@ jects .
The first one has to do with making sound vi@@ sible .
"Now as you may know , sound tra@@ v@@ els in wa@@ ves , so if you have a spe@@ a@@ ker , a spe@@ a@@ ker actually does nothing else than taking the au@@ di@@ o si@@ gn@@ al , trans@@ form it into a vi@@ br@@ ation , which is then tran@@ sp@@ or@@ ted through the air , is cap@@ tu@@ red by our e@@ ar , and trans@@ form@@ ed into an au@@ di@@ o si@@ gn@@ al again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound wa@@ ves vi@@ sible ?"
So I came up with the fol@@ lowing se@@ tu@@ p .
"I took a spe@@ a@@ ker , I plac@@ ed a th@@ in fo@@ il of pl@@ as@@ tic on top of that spe@@ a@@ ker , and then I ad@@ ded t@@ iny little cr@@ y@@ st@@ als on top of that spe@@ a@@ ker ."
"And now , if I would play a sound through that spe@@ a@@ ker , it would c@@ ause the cr@@ y@@ st@@ als to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very f@@ ast , in the bl@@ ink of an ey@@ e , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tu@@ red this moti@@ on with a cam@@ er@@ a that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 fr@@ am@@ es per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ u@@ sic : &quot; &quot; T@@ ear@@ dro@@ p &quot; &quot; by M@@ assi@@ ve A@@ tt@@ ack ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty ama@@ zing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ n@@ y story .
I got an in@@ do@@ or s@@ un@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ ot@@ ing in Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es .
"Now in Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es , you could get a dec@@ ent s@@ un@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ ach@@ es , but I got m@@ ine in@@ do@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at 3@@ ,000 fr@@ am@@ es per second , you need to have a si@@ l@@ ly amount of light , lots of ligh@@ ts ."
"What was so fun@@ n@@ y about it was that the spe@@ a@@ ker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the P@@ h@@ an@@ tom of the O@@ per@@ a for the rest of the week ."
Let me now turn to another pro@@ ject which inv@@ ol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ st@@ anc@@ es .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I s@@ ki@@ p that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very stran@@ ge behavior .
It &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an o@@ ily consi@@ st@@ enc@@ y .
"And it &apos;s got t@@ iny little partic@@ les of me@@ t@@ al in it , which makes it mag@@ ne@@ tic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qu@@ id into a mag@@ ne@@ tic field , it would change its appe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a cam@@ er@@ a poin@@ ting down at this pl@@ ate , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pl@@ ate , there is a mag@@ net ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that mag@@ net .
Let &apos;s just s@@ ligh@@ tly move it to the right and maybe fo@@ c@@ us it a little bit more . E@@ x@@ c@@ ell@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has form@@ ed sp@@ i@@ kes .
Th@@ ose are just st@@ and@@ ard wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors that you would pain@@ t with .
"So what happened now is , when the wat@@ er@@ col@@ or was f@@ lowing into the struc@@ ture , the wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ d@@ rop@@ ho@@ bi@@ c .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second pro@@ ject .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
D@@ id he dr@@ ink half a bot@@ t@@ le of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey and then d@@ ra@@ w the h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation he got from being dr@@ un@@ k on@@ to p@@ ap@@ er ?
"M@@ ay@@ be you have experienc@@ ed some of those pro@@ per@@ ties before , but I am talking about the physical pro@@ per@@ ties , not the other ones ."
"So when I op@@ en the bot@@ t@@ le , the al@@ co@@ ho@@ l m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es would sp@@ read in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ ho@@ l is a very v@@ ol@@ ati@@ le sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ ho@@ l is high@@ ly fl@@ am@@ m@@ able ."
And it was with those two pro@@ per@@ ties that I was able to create the imag@@ es that you &apos;re seeing right now .
Let me de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate this over here .
And what I have here is an emp@@ ty gl@@ ass v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ g@@ en and wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wa@@ it for a few secon@@ ds for the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es to sp@@ read inside the bot@@ t@@ le .
"It goes really f@@ ast , and it &apos;s not that im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"So the imag@@ es that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fl@@ ame st@@ op@@ ped in time while it is tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing through the bot@@ t@@ le , and you have to imagine it was f@@ li@@ p@@ ped around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those imag@@ es were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now sho@@ wed you three pro@@ jects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea be@@ h@@ ind it ?
I@@ s it just a wa@@ st@@ e of wh@@ is@@ k@@ ey ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jects , they &apos;re bas@@ ed on very simple scienti@@ fic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a , such as mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m , the sound wa@@ ves , or over here , the physical pro@@ per@@ ties of a sub@@ st@@ ance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a and show them in a po@@ e@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and ther@@ e@@ fore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to p@@ ause for a moment and think about all the beau@@ ty that is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding us ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Now , have any of y &apos;@@ all ever looked up this word ?"
"You know , in a dic@@ tion@@ ary ? ( Laughter ) Y@@ eah , that &apos;s what I thought ."
How about this word ?
"@@ Here , I &apos;ll show it to you ."
L@@ ex@@ ic@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y : the pr@@ acti@@ ce of comp@@ il@@ ing dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies .
"Now , one of the n@@ on@@ -@@ per@@ ks of being a le@@ x@@ ic@@ o@@ grap@@ her is that people don &apos;t u@@ su@@ ally have a kind of war@@ m , fu@@ z@@ zy , s@@ n@@ u@@ gg@@ ly im@@ age of the dic@@ tion@@ ary ."
"When a guy who looks like that , in that h@@ at , is the face of moder@@ n@@ ity , you have a problem ."
"And O@@ K , what about on@@ line dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies , right ?"
O@@ n@@ line dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies must be different .
"R@@ ight ? Th@@ ose little bu@@ tt@@ ons , I had them all exp@@ an@@ ded ex@@ cept for the d@@ ate char@@ t ."
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of c@@ lic@@ k@@ iness .
"And in fact , on@@ line dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate almost all the problems of prin@@ t , ex@@ cept for sear@@ cha@@ bility ."
We have a p@@ an that &apos;s too small !
Why are you bl@@ am@@ ing the ha@@ m for being too big for the p@@ an ?
"@@ How can this be ? I mean , I love bo@@ o@@ ks . I really love bo@@ o@@ ks ."
S@@ ome of my best friends are bo@@ o@@ ks .
But the book is not the best shap@@ e for the dic@@ tion@@ ary .
"Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; &quot; O@@ h , bo@@ y ."
"@@ People are going to take away my beautiful , p@@ ap@@ er dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; No . There will still be p@@ ap@@ er dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies ."
"When we had car@@ s — when car@@ s bec@@ ame the dom@@ in@@ ant mo@@ de of tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation , we didn &apos;t r@@ ound up all the h@@ or@@ ses and sho@@ ot them ."
"You know , there &apos;re still going to be p@@ ap@@ er dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies , but it &apos;s not going to be the dom@@ in@@ ant dic@@ tion@@ ary ."
The bo@@ o@@ k@@ -@@ shap@@ ed dic@@ tion@@ ary is not going to be the only shap@@ e dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies come in . And it &apos;s not going to be the prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe for the shap@@ es dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ ies come in .
"So , think about it this way : if you &apos;ve got an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts le@@ ad to ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary dist@@ inc@@ tions and a s@@ ke@@ wed wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
"We &apos;d know a whole lot about char@@ is@@ m@@ atic me@@ g@@ af@@ au@@ n@@ a , and not very much about much else ."
And I think this is a problem .
"I think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful ex@@ pres@@ sions from very hum@@ ble parts ."
L@@ ex@@ ic@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y is really more about material science .
"We are stud@@ ying the t@@ ol@@ er@@ anc@@ es of the materi@@ als that you use to build the struc@@ ture of your ex@@ pres@@ sion : your spe@@ ech@@ es and your wr@@ iting . And then , often people say to me , &quot; Well , O@@ K , how do I know that this word is real ? &quot;"
"If you love a word , use it . That makes it real ."
B@@ e@@ ing in the dic@@ tion@@ ary is an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al dist@@ inc@@ tion .
"So if we &apos;re not wor@@ r@@ ying about direc@@ ting tra@@ ff@@ ic , if we &apos;ve tran@@ sc@@ en@@ ded p@@ ap@@ er , if we are wor@@ r@@ ying less about control and more about descri@@ p@@ tion , then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"You didn &apos;t bre@@ ak it . It &apos;s just in a new posi@@ tion , and that new posi@@ tion can be just as beautiful ."
"But if your go@@ al is no longer to direc@@ t the tra@@ ff@@ ic , but maybe to coun@@ t the car@@ s that go by , then more e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s are better ."
You can ask for help !
"If you ask for help , you get more done . And we really need help ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gres@@ s : 1@@ 7 million bo@@ o@@ ks , of which half are in English ."
"@@ N@@ e@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve goes back to 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 , 5@@ 8@@ .@@ 1 million ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er p@@ ages . If only one in 100 of those p@@ ages had an un@@ -@@ dic@@ tion@@ ari@@ ed word on it , it would be an enti@@ re other O@@ E@@ D ."
"That &apos;s 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot ."
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
"S@@ e@@ e , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of num@@ bers , and this is more of a vi@@ su@@ al ex@@ plan@@ ation ."
"If we think of the dic@@ tion@@ ary as being the ma@@ p of the English language , these b@@ right sp@@ ots are what we know about , and the dark sp@@ ots are where we are in the dark ."
"If that was the ma@@ p of all the words in American English , we don &apos;t know very much ."
We &apos;re mis@@ sing C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a from American English .
"We just don &apos;t know enough , and we don &apos;t even know that we &apos;re mis@@ sing C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
"But even if it were , ro@@ c@@ k@@ et science is being done by de@@ dic@@ ated am@@ ate@@ ur@@ s these days . You know ?"
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a direc@@ tor of an elec@@ tro@@ pl@@ ating comp@@ any .
He &apos;s found more than 1@@ 40 com@@ ets .
"He do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed data from the N@@ A@@ S@@ A S@@ O@@ H@@ O s@@ at@@ elli@@ te , and that &apos;s how he found them ."
"If we can find com@@ ets without a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t we be able to find words ?"
"Now , y &apos;@@ all know where I &apos;m going with this ."
"Because I &apos;m going to the In@@ ter@@ net , which is where everybody goes ."
Wh@@ ere did it come from ? Wh@@ o said it ?
What ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ logical arti@@ fact .
It dies too f@@ ast .
"So , this whole time I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; The dic@@ tion@@ ary , the dic@@ tion@@ ary , the dic@@ tion@@ ary , the dic@@ tion@@ ary . &quot;"
"But the thing is , we could make the dic@@ tion@@ ary the whole language ."
"If we get a big@@ ger p@@ an , then we can put all the words in ."
We can put in all the mean@@ ings .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t everyone want more mean@@ ing in their lives ?
And we can make the dic@@ tion@@ ary not just be a sym@@ bo@@ l of the language — we can make it be the whole language .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
G@@ ood even@@ ing .
"You see , I &apos;m one of the 8@@ 4 million Americ@@ ans who are im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts or children of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts ."
"E@@ ach of us has a dre@@ am when we come here , a dre@@ am that u@@ su@@ ally has to be re@@ wr@@ it@@ ten and always has to be re@@ pur@@ posed ."
I was one of the l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ones .
"But I don &apos;t want you to think it was a c@@ a@@ ke@@ wal@@ k , that America op@@ en@@ ed its ar@@ ms wi@@ de and w@@ el@@ com@@ ed me ."
It &apos;s still not doing that .
I came because I wanted to study English liter@@ ature .
"You see , as a child , I bur@@ i@@ ed my n@@ ose in bo@@ o@@ ks , and I thought , why not make a living doing that as an ad@@ ult ?"
M@@ ay@@ be it was the op@@ tim@@ ism that I had about America that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change .
"The do@@ or that I thought was op@@ en was actually just s@@ ligh@@ tly a@@ j@@ ar — this do@@ or of America that would op@@ en wi@@ de if you had the right name , the right sk@@ in col@@ or , the right ne@@ t@@ works , but could just s@@ l@@ am in your face if you had the wrong religi@@ on , the wrong im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation st@@ at@@ us , the wrong sk@@ in col@@ or ."
And I just couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept that .
"So I started a care@@ er as a social ent@@ re@@ pre@@ ne@@ ur , star@@ ting an organi@@ zation for young people like my@@ self — I was young at the time that I started it — who tr@@ ac@@ ed their her@@ it@@ age to the In@@ di@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent ."
"In that work , I bec@@ ame and adv@@ oc@@ ate for S@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ ans and other im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts ."
I lob@@ bi@@ ed mem@@ bers of Con@@ gres@@ s on po@@ lic@@ y is@@ su@@ es .
I v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed on elec@@ tion day to do ex@@ it p@@ ol@@ ling .
"But I couldn &apos;t v@@ ote , and I couldn &apos;t run for off@@ ice ."
"So in 2@@ 000 , when it was an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed that the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship app@@ lic@@ ation fe@@ e was going to more than d@@ ou@@ ble from 9@@ 5 dollars to 2@@ 2@@ 5 dollars , I decided it was time to app@@ ly before I could no longer aff@@ or@@ d it ."
"I f@@ ill@@ ed out a long app@@ lic@@ ation , ans@@ w@@ ering questions about my curren@@ t and my past aff@@ ili@@ ations ."
You might call it extre@@ me ve@@ tting .
"And then in D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber of 2@@ 000 , I jo@@ ined hund@@ re@@ ds of other im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts in a h@@ all in B@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n where we ple@@ d@@ g@@ ed our lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to a country that we had long consi@@ der@@ ed home ."
T@@ w@@ o things happened as we cop@@ ed with l@@ oss and re@@ co@@ very in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
V@@ ot@@ ers elec@@ ted M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g may@@ or of New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
We also ad@@ op@@ ted by bal@@ lot re@@ fer@@ en@@ du@@ m the O@@ ff@@ ice of I@@ m@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant A@@ ff@@ a@@ ir@@ s for the C@@ ity of New Y@@ or@@ k .
"F@@ i@@ ve months after that elec@@ tion , the ne@@ w@@ ly elec@@ ted may@@ or ap@@ poin@@ ted me the first C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ er of I@@ m@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant A@@ ff@@ a@@ ir@@ s for this ne@@ w@@ ly est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed off@@ ice ."
I want you to come back to that time .
I was a young im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant woman from B@@ e@@ li@@ ze .
I had basically fl@@ oun@@ der@@ ed in vari@@ ous j@@ ob@@ s in America before I started a comm@@ un@@ it@@ y-@@ bas@@ ed organi@@ zation in a ch@@ ur@@ ch bas@@ ement in Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens .
The att@@ ac@@ ks of S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 11 s@@ ent sho@@ ck wa@@ ves through my comm@@ unity .
No job f@@ el@@ t more per@@ f@@ ect for me .
And here are two things I learned when I bec@@ ame C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ er .
"And most of us , when we see someone in uni@@ form going through our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds feel cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , if not con@@ cer@@ n ."
"Because a ra@@ id at your wor@@ k@@ place , a chan@@ ce en@@ coun@@ ter with loc@@ al poli@@ ce could change the course of your life fore@@ ver ."
People in my family were experienc@@ ing it .
What I learned in 200@@ 1 was that my v@@ ote mat@@ ter@@ ed but that my v@@ o@@ ice and v@@ an@@ t@@ age point also mat@@ ter@@ ed .
"And it &apos;s these three things — im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts &apos; v@@ ot@@ es , v@@ o@@ ices and v@@ an@@ t@@ age poin@@ ts — that I think can help make our democr@@ acy stron@@ ger ."
"We actually have the power to change the out@@ come of elec@@ tions , to int@@ ro@@ duce new is@@ su@@ es into the po@@ lic@@ y de@@ b@@ ate and to change the face of the p@@ ale , m@@ ale , st@@ ale lead@@ er@@ ship that we have in our country today ."
"Well , let &apos;s talk first about v@@ ot@@ es ."
It will come as no surpri@@ se to you that the maj@@ or@@ ity of v@@ ot@@ ers in America are white .
"But it might surpri@@ se you to know that one in three v@@ ot@@ ers are black , L@@ at@@ in@@ o or A@@ si@@ an ."
"So in 20@@ 12 , half of the L@@ at@@ in@@ o and A@@ si@@ an@@ -@@ American v@@ ot@@ ers did not v@@ ote ."
And these v@@ ot@@ es matter not just in pre@@ si@@ d@@ ential elec@@ tions .
They matter in loc@@ al and state elec@@ tions .
"In 20@@ 15 , L@@ an D@@ i@@ ep , the el@@ d@@ est son of political re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es from V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am , r@@ an for a se@@ at in the S@@ an J@@ ose C@@ ity C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l ."
He l@@ ost that elec@@ tion by 1@@ 3 v@@ ot@@ es .
"This year , he du@@ sted off those cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n sho@@ es and went back to run for that se@@ at , and this time he won , by 12 v@@ ot@@ es ."
E@@ very one of our v@@ ot@@ es mat@@ ters .
"And when people like L@@ an are sit@@ ting at the po@@ lic@@ y t@@ able , they can make a difference ."
in part because American lead@@ er@@ ship does not look like America &apos;s re@@ si@@ d@@ ents .
"There are over 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 loc@@ al and state off@@ ices in America ."
"F@@ e@@ wer than 2 percent of those off@@ ices are hel@@ d by A@@ si@@ an@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans or L@@ at@@ in@@ o@@ s , the two lar@@ g@@ est im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant grou@@ ps in our country ."
"In the c@@ ity of Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a , W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , where 4@@ 9 percent of the population is L@@ at@@ in@@ o , there has never been a L@@ at@@ in@@ o on the c@@ ity coun@@ ci@@ l until this year ."
Th@@ ree ne@@ w@@ ly elec@@ ted L@@ at@@ in@@ as jo@@ ined the Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a C@@ ity C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l in 20@@ 1@@ 6 .
One of them is C@@ ar@@ men M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z .
She is a fir@@ st@@ -@@ generation colle@@ ge stud@@ ent .
"S@@ he gre@@ w up par@@ tly in C@@ o@@ lim@@ a , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , and par@@ tly in Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a , W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on ."
"S@@ he &apos;s a single mother , a comm@@ unity adv@@ oc@@ ate ."
H@@ er v@@ o@@ ice on the Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a C@@ ity C@@ oun@@ ci@@ l is adv@@ oc@@ ating on be@@ half of the L@@ at@@ in@@ o comm@@ unity and of all Y@@ ak@@ im@@ a re@@ si@@ d@@ ents .
And she &apos;s a ro@@ le mo@@ de@@ l for her d@@ aughter and other L@@ at@@ in@@ as .
But the thir@@ d most un@@ t@@ app@@ ed res@@ our@@ ce in American democr@@ acy is the v@@ an@@ t@@ age point that im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts bring .
We have f@@ ought to be here .
We have come for economic and educ@@ ational op@@ port@@ unity .
We have come for political and religi@@ ous f@@ re@@ e@@ dom .
We have come in the pur@@ su@@ it of love .
"That de@@ dic@@ ation , that comm@@ it@@ ment to America we also bring to public serv@@ ice ."
"@@ People like A@@ th@@ en@@ a S@@ al@@ man , who just last week won the pri@@ mar@@ y for a se@@ at in the A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a St@@ ate H@@ ouse ."
T@@ o@@ gether they mo@@ ved to A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a and built a life .
It &apos;s not just my work . It &apos;s also your@@ s .
And it &apos;s not going to be easy .
We never know what pu@@ tting a new fac@@ tor into an equ@@ ation will do .
And it &apos;s a little sc@@ ary .
"You &apos;re sc@@ ared that I &apos;m going to take away your place at the t@@ able , and I &apos;m sc@@ ared that I &apos;m never going to get a place at the t@@ able ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s been a r@@ ough elec@@ tion year , a re@@ min@@ der that people with my im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation history could be re@@ mo@@ ved at the wh@@ i@@ m of a lead@@ er ."
But I have f@@ ought to be in this country and I contin@@ ue to do so every day .
"So my op@@ tim@@ ism never wa@@ ver@@ s , because I know that there are m@@ illions of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts just like me , in front of me , be@@ h@@ ind me and all around me ."
"It &apos;s our country , too ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a stud@@ ent at St@@ . J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s M@@ e@@ dic@@ al C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ an@@ gal@@ ore ."
I was a gu@@ est stud@@ ent d@@ uring one mon@@ th of a public health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set fore@@ ver .
"The course was good , but it was not the course cont@@ ent in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the br@@ ut@@ al reali@@ zation , the first mor@@ ning , that the In@@ di@@ an students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I lo@@ ved st@@ atis@@ tics from a young age .
And I stu@@ died very much in S@@ we@@ d@@ en .
I used to be in the up@@ per qu@@ ar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I att@@ en@@ ded .
"But in St@@ . J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s , I was in the lo@@ wer qu@@ ar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that In@@ di@@ an students stu@@ died har@@ der than we did in S@@ we@@ d@@ en .
"They read the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book tw@@ ice , or three times or four times ."
I@@ n S@@ we@@ d@@ en we read it once and then we went par@@ t@@ ying .
"( L@@ augh@@ er ) And that , to me , that pers@@ onal experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was changed ."
And I reali@@ zed that perhaps the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world will not contin@@ ue to dom@@ in@@ ate the world fore@@ ver .
And I think many of you have the same sort of pers@@ onal experience .
It &apos;s that reali@@ zation of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the st@@ atis@@ tics , al@@ though I tri@@ ed to make it fun@@ n@@ y ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ st@@ age , try to predic@@ t when that will happen — that A@@ si@@ a will re@@ g@@ ain its dom@@ in@@ ant posi@@ tion as the lead@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predic@@ t preci@@ se@@ ly at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will re@@ ach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econom@@ y , because to grow an econom@@ y of India to the size of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of c@@ a@@ ke , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average p@@ ay , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have re@@ ach@@ ed that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a hi@@ st@@ or@@ ical bac@@ k@@ ground .
And you can see my ma@@ p if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 18@@ 5@@ 8 .
18@@ 5@@ 8 was a year of great techno@@ logical adv@@ anc@@ ement in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ a was able , for the first time , to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate with P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ r@@ ans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic T@@ el@@ e@@ grap@@ hi@@ c C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ it@@ ter &quot; &quot; trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic@@ ally .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful G@@ oo@@ g@@ le and In@@ ter@@ net , to find the t@@ ex@@ t of the tel@@ e@@ gram s@@ ent back from P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ u@@ een V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ a ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This tel@@ e@@ grap@@ h is a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic in@@ str@@ ument to diff@@ use religi@@ on , civi@@ li@@ zation , li@@ ber@@ ty and la@@ w thr@@ ough@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are n@@ ice words . But I got sort of cur@@ i@@ ous of what he me@@ ant with li@@ ber@@ ty , and li@@ ber@@ ty for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the wi@@ der picture of the world in 18@@ 5@@ 8 .
Because 18@@ 5@@ 8 was also wat@@ er@@ shed year in the history of A@@ si@@ a .
18@@ 5@@ 8 was the year when the cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous u@@ pri@@ sing against the fore@@ ig@@ n oc@@ c@@ up@@ ation of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of fore@@ ig@@ n dom@@ in@@ ation .
18@@ 5@@ 8 in China was the v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory in the O@@ pi@@ um W@@ ar by the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that fore@@ ig@@ n@@ ers , as it said in the tre@@ at@@ y , were al@@ lowed to tr@@ ad@@ e f@@ re@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant p@@ ay@@ ing with op@@ i@@ um for Ch@@ in@@ ese go@@ o@@ ds .
And 18@@ 5@@ 8 in Jap@@ an was the year when Jap@@ an had to si@@ g@@ n the H@@ ar@@ r@@ is T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tr@@ ad@@ e on fav@@ or@@ able condi@@ tion for the U.@@ S@@ .
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Jap@@ an , in con@@ tr@@ ast to India and China , ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ed its national so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by br@@ ing@@ ing these bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der grap@@ h here , where you can see each bu@@ b@@ ble is a country ."
The size of the bu@@ b@@ ble here is the population .
"O@@ n this ax@@ is , as I used to have income per person in com@@ par@@ able dol@@ l@@ ar ."
"And on that ax@@ is I have life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ no@@ v@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ form@@ ed the l@@ as@@ er be@@ am into an ec@@ o@@ logical , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok here , 18@@ 5@@ 8 , India was here , China was here , Jap@@ an was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was r@@ ic@@ her over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the hi@@ st@@ or@@ ical rec@@ or@@ d , there was a time hund@@ re@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even abo@@ ve that of Euro@@ pe ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of fore@@ ig@@ n dom@@ in@@ ation , and India had been de@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econom@@ y was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting health@@ y , and Jap@@ an was star@@ ting to cat@@ ch up ."
India was trying down here .
C@@ an you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty was good for Jap@@ an ."
And Jap@@ an is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But care@@ ful now — we are appro@@ ach@@ ing the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .
"And the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ a@@ ths and econom@@ ical problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ pan@@ ish fl@@ u also .
"And then after the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , they contin@@ ue up ."
"S@@ ti@@ ll under fore@@ ig@@ n dom@@ in@@ ation , and without so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
Not much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Jap@@ an is going to a per@@ i@@ od of war , with lo@@ wer life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also econom@@ ically for Jap@@ an ."
But they did re@@ co@@ ver quite f@@ ast af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are mo@@ ving into the new world .
I@@ n 19@@ 4@@ 7 India fin@@ ally g@@ ained its in@@ dep@@ en@@ dence .
"And they could ra@@ ise the In@@ di@@ an fl@@ a@@ g and become a so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n n@@ ation , but in very big diffic@@ ul@@ ties down there ."
( Applause ) I@@ n 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of the moder@@ n China in a way which surpri@@ sed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after in@@ dep@@ en@@ dence ?
You can see that the health started to impro@@ ve .
Ch@@ il@@ dren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th serv@@ ices were pro@@ vi@@ ded .
"This is the G@@ re@@ at L@@ e@@ ap F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was cen@@ tr@@ al plan@@ ning by M@@ a@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed . Th@@ en they said , &quot; N@@ e@@ ver@@ more , stu@@ p@@ id cen@@ tr@@ al plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were cat@@ ch@@ ing up in@@ de@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econom@@ y ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and M@@ a@@ o T@@ se T@@ un@@ g died , and a new guy tur@@ ned up from the left ."
And it was D@@ en@@ g X@@ i@@ a@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is white or black , as long as it cat@@ ch@@ es m@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Because cat@@ ch@@ ing m@@ ice is what the two cat@@ s wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cat@@ s being here , China and India , wan@@ ting to cat@@ ch the m@@ ices over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also star@@ ting to grow their econom@@ y ."
And the market re@@ form@@ er was suc@@ cess@@ ful there .
I@@ n &apos; 9@@ 2 India fol@@ lo@@ ws with a market re@@ form .
"And they go quite cl@@ os@@ ely together , and you can see that the sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are gre@@ ater than the differ@@ ences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they cat@@ ch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the a@@ ver@@ ages there — this is the average of China .
"If I would sp@@ li@@ t China , look here , S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i has already cat@@ ched up ."
S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i is already there .
And it &apos;s health@@ ier than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ i@@ z@@ h@@ ou , one of the po@@ o@@ rest in@@ land pro@@ v@@ inc@@ es of China , is there ."
"And if I sp@@ li@@ t G@@ u@@ i@@ z@@ h@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and r@@ ural , the r@@ ural part of G@@ u@@ i@@ z@@ h@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ orm@@ ous in@@ equ@@ ity in China , in the mi@@ d@@ st of f@@ ast economic grow@@ th ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another t@@ y@@ pe of in@@ equ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical , m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical difference is not so big ."
"@@ U@@ tt@@ ar P@@ ra@@ des@@ h , the bi@@ gg@@ est of the st@@ ates here , is po@@ o@@ re@@ r and has a lo@@ wer health than the rest of India ."
"@@ K@@ er@@ al@@ a is fl@@ ying on top there , mat@@ ch@@ ing United States in health , but not in econom@@ y ."
"And here , M@@ a@@ har@@ as@@ h@@ tr@@ a , with M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i , is for@@ g@@ ing for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big in@@ equ@@ i@@ ties are within the state , rather than between the st@@ ates ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot in@@ equ@@ ity , m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical in@@ equ@@ i@@ ties can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a grow@@ th center relati@@ vely cl@@ ose to where po@@ or people are living ."
"@@ No , there is one more in@@ equ@@ ity . Lo@@ ok there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they bro@@ ke my f@@ ra@@ me ."
"W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
My friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new lead@@ er in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on who is really con@@ cer@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so r@@ ich over there but they are not as health@@ y as K@@ er@@ al@@ a .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a business op@@ port@@ unity for K@@ er@@ al@@ a , hel@@ ping fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ gen@@ d down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant cat@@ s here , pu@@ sh@@ ing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole em@@ er@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies of the world , which Th@@ om@@ as F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; fl@@ at world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is pu@@ tting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and other parts , as in r@@ ural G@@ u@@ i@@ z@@ h@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econom@@ y ."
We have an en@@ orm@@ ous di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are pu@@ sh@@ ing for@@ wards very f@@ ast .
"Now , back to my pro@@ jec@@ tions ."
Wh@@ en will it cat@@ ch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal grap@@ h .
"I will show income per person on this ax@@ is instead , po@@ or down here , r@@ ich up there ."
"And then time here , from 18@@ 5@@ 8 I start the world ."
And we sh@@ all see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under fore@@ ig@@ n dom@@ in@@ ation actually low@@ er@@ ed their income and came down to the In@@ di@@ an level here ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting r@@ ic@@ her and r@@ ic@@ her .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , United States is r@@ ic@@ her than U.@@ K@@ ."
But in@@ dep@@ en@@ dence is coming here .
"@@ G@@ ro@@ w@@ th is star@@ ting , economic re@@ form ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ w@@ th is fa@@ ster , and with pro@@ jec@@ tion from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you exp@@ ect them to be in 20@@ 1@@ 4 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the cat@@ ch up take place ? &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at , look at the United States ."
C@@ an you see the bu@@ b@@ ble ?
"The bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es , not my bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es , but the fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es ."
That &apos;s the do@@ t co@@ m bu@@ b@@ ble . This is the L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ ste@@ p there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another ro@@ ck coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more hum@@ ble grow@@ th way , you know ."
And people interest@@ ed in grow@@ th are tur@@ ning their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ si@@ a .
I can comp@@ are to Jap@@ an . This is Jap@@ an coming up .
"You see , Jap@@ an did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Jap@@ an to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that f@@ ast cat@@ ch up can take place .
C@@ an you see here what Jap@@ an did ?
"@@ Jap@@ an did it like this , until ful@@ l cat@@ ch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income econom@@ ies ."
"But the real pro@@ jec@@ tions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be wor@@ se , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predic@@ t , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an t@@ ells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predic@@ t about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult posi@@ tion here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ ali@@ ties in China and India I consi@@ der really the big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le because to bring the enti@@ re population into grow@@ th and pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity is what will create a dom@@ es@@ tic market , what will av@@ o@@ id social inst@@ ability , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social inv@@ est@@ ments in health , education and in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture , and electr@@ ic@@ ity is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the c@@ lim@@ ate . We have great inter@@ national exper@@ ts within India t@@ elling us that the c@@ lim@@ ate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se China and India would be the countries most to suff@@ er from c@@ lim@@ ate change ."
And I consi@@ der India and China the best par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the world in a good global c@@ lim@@ ate po@@ lic@@ y .
"But they ain &apos;t going to p@@ ay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ ge@@ ly cre@@ ated , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ri@@ ed about is war .
"W@@ ill the form@@ er r@@ ich countries really ac@@ cept a completely changed world econom@@ y , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 1@@ 50 years , back to A@@ si@@ a ?"
"And will A@@ si@@ a be able to h@@ and@@ le that new posi@@ tion of being in char@@ ge of being the most mi@@ gh@@ ty , and the govern@@ ors of the world ?"
"So , always av@@ o@@ id war , because that always pu@@ sh@@ es human be@@ ings bac@@ k@@ ward ."
"Now if these in@@ equ@@ ali@@ ties , c@@ lim@@ ate and war can be av@@ o@@ i@@ ded , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vi@@ sion that I got as a young stud@@ ent , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that In@@ di@@ ans can be much better than S@@ we@@ des , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen preci@@ se@@ ly the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the sum@@ m@@ er , in J@@ u@@ ly , more preci@@ se@@ ly , the 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of J@@ u@@ ly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I exp@@ ect to spe@@ ak in the first s@@ es@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TED India .
G@@ et your bo@@ o@@ k@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"Now , M@@ and@@ ar@@ in Ch@@ in@@ ese is sp@@ o@@ ken by more people , but more Ch@@ in@@ ese people are learning English than English spe@@ ak@@ ers are learning Ch@@ in@@ ese ."
"@@ L@@ ast I heard , there are two do@@ z@@ en univer@@ si@@ ties in China right now teach@@ ing all in English ."
English is taking over .
"And in ad@@ di@@ tion to that , it &apos;s been predic@@ ted that at the end of the century almost all of the langu@@ ages that ex@@ ist now — there are about 6@@ ,000 — will no longer be sp@@ o@@ ken ."
There will only be some hund@@ re@@ ds left .
"And that is the idea that a language chan@@ n@@ els your th@@ ough@@ ts , that the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary and the gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r of different langu@@ ages gi@@ ves everybody a different kind of ac@@ id tri@@ p , so to spe@@ ak ."
So it &apos;s not that it &apos;s un@@ true completely .
"So for example , in F@@ ren@@ ch and S@@ pan@@ ish the word for t@@ able is , for some reason , mar@@ ked as f@@ em@@ in@@ ine ."
"So , &quot; &quot; l@@ a t@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ a m@@ es@@ a , &quot; &quot; you just have to de@@ al with it ."
"So if you &apos;re F@@ ren@@ ch or S@@ pan@@ ish , to you , a t@@ able is kind of a gir@@ l , as op@@ posed to if you are an English spe@@ a@@ ker ."
"It &apos;s hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there &apos;s a wor@@ l@@ d@@ view that you have if you spe@@ ak one of those langu@@ ages ."
"But you have to wat@@ ch out , because imagine if somebody put us under the m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , the us being those of us who spe@@ ak English n@@ ati@@ vely ."
What is the wor@@ l@@ d@@ view from English ?
"So for example , let &apos;s take an English spe@@ a@@ ker ."
"@@ U@@ p on the scre@@ en , that is B@@ on@@ o ."
He spe@@ a@@ ks English .
I pre@@ su@@ me he has a wor@@ l@@ d@@ view .
"Now , that is D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ r@@ um@@ p ."
So here are three spe@@ ak@@ ers of the English language .
What wor@@ l@@ d@@ view do those three people have in common ?
What wor@@ l@@ d@@ view is shap@@ ed through the English language that un@@ it@@ es them ?
It &apos;s a high@@ ly fr@@ au@@ ght con@@ cept .
"And so gra@@ du@@ al con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is becom@@ ing that language can shap@@ e thought , but it t@@ ends to be in rather dar@@ ling , ob@@ sc@@ ure psycho@@ logical fl@@ ut@@ ters ."
It &apos;s not a matter of giving you a different p@@ air of gl@@ ass@@ es on the world .
"Now , if that &apos;s the case , then why learn langu@@ ages ?"
There are some .
"One of them is that if you want to im@@ bi@@ be a culture , if you want to dr@@ ink it in , if you want to become part of it , then whether or not the language chan@@ n@@ els the culture — and that seems d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ful — if you want to im@@ bi@@ be the culture , you have to control to some de@@ gre@@ e the language that the culture happens to be conduc@@ ted in ."
There &apos;s no other way .
There &apos;s an interesting ill@@ u@@ str@@ ation of this .
"I have to go s@@ ligh@@ tly ob@@ sc@@ ure , but really you should see@@ k it out ."
"H@@ i . So , this cha@@ p here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is name is N@@ os@@ tr@@ ad@@ am@@ us , al@@ though here the Su@@ n have made him look a little bit like S@@ e@@ an Con@@ n@@ ery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I su@@ sp@@ ect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in pre@@ cogni@@ tion , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predic@@ t something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a flu@@ ke , and we only hear about the flu@@ kes and about the f@@ re@@ a@@ ks ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we exp@@ ect that to happen with si@@ l@@ ly stories about pre@@ cogni@@ tion , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ a and in medic@@ ine , and in this environ@@ ment , it cos@@ ts lives ."
"So fir@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about pre@@ cogni@@ tion , as it turns out , just last year a resear@@ ch@@ er called D@@ ar@@ y@@ l B@@ e@@ m conduc@@ ted a piece of resear@@ ch where he found evidence of pre@@ cogni@@ tive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c j@@ our@@ n@@ al and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fa@@ ir enough , but I think that &apos;s a flu@@ ke , that &apos;s a f@@ re@@ ak , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students had pre@@ cogni@@ tive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a j@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because se@@ ver@@ al different grou@@ ps of resear@@ ch scienti@@ sts tri@@ ed to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the fin@@ d@@ ings of this pre@@ cogni@@ tion study , and when they sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted it to the ex@@ act same j@@ our@@ n@@ al , the j@@ our@@ n@@ al said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interest@@ ed in publi@@ sh@@ ing re@@ p@@ lic@@ ation . We &apos;re not interest@@ ed in your ne@@ g@@ ative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ as@@ ed s@@ am@@ ple of the true picture of all of the scienti@@ fic stu@@ dies that have been conduc@@ ted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the d@@ ry ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c field of psycho@@ logy .
"It also happens in , for example , cancer resear@@ ch ."
"So in Mar@@ ch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some resear@@ ch@@ ers re@@ por@@ ted in the j@@ our@@ n@@ al N@@ ature how they had tri@@ ed to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate 5@@ 3 different bas@@ ic science stu@@ dies looking at p@@ ot@@ ential tre@@ at@@ ment t@@ ar@@ gets in cancer , and out of those 5@@ 3 stu@@ dies , they were only able to suc@@ cess@@ fully re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate six ."
F@@ or@@ t@@ y-@@ se@@ ven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ able .
And they say in their disc@@ us@@ sion that this is very likely because f@@ re@@ a@@ ks get published .
"@@ People will do lots and lots and lots of different stu@@ dies , and the oc@@ cas@@ i@@ ons when it works they will publi@@ sh , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ comm@@ en@@ d@@ ation of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down bl@@ ind al@@ le@@ ys , their first re@@ comm@@ en@@ d@@ ation of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it eas@@ ier to publi@@ sh ne@@ g@@ ative res@@ ults in science , and to change the inc@@ enti@@ ves so that scienti@@ sts are enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed to p@@ ost more of their ne@@ g@@ ative res@@ ults in public ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very d@@ ry world of pre@@ cl@@ in@@ ical bas@@ ic science cancer resear@@ ch .
"It also happens in the very real , fl@@ es@@ h and b@@ loo@@ d of ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c medic@@ ine . So in 19@@ 80 , some resear@@ ch@@ ers did a study on a dru@@ g called l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de , and this was an an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ c dru@@ g , a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ norm@@ al heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart att@@ ack , they &apos;re quite likely to have ab@@ norm@@ al heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a dru@@ g that sup@@ pres@@ ses ab@@ norm@@ al heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving ."
"@@ Ear@@ ly on its develop@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de , and of those patients , 10 died ."
"A@@ no@@ ther 50 patients got a d@@ um@@ my plac@@ e@@ b@@ o su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them died ."
"So they ri@@ gh@@ tly re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded this dru@@ g as a fa@@ il@@ ure , and its comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , and because its comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other comp@@ an@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Th@@ ese dru@@ gs were br@@ ought to market . They were pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed very w@@ ide@@ ly because heart att@@ ac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also cau@@ sed an increas@@ ed r@@ ate of death that before we de@@ t@@ ected that sa@@ fe@@ ty si@@ gn@@ al , over 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people died un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily in America from the pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tion of an@@ ti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ c dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the resear@@ ch@@ ers who did that 19@@ 80 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ p@@ a , an ap@@ o@@ logy to the scienti@@ fic comm@@ unity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ri@@ ed out our study in 19@@ 80 , we thought that the increas@@ ed death r@@ ate that oc@@ cur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de group was an eff@@ ect of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develop@@ ment of l@@ or@@ c@@ ain@@ i@@ de was ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed for comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of pub@@ lic@@ ation bi@@ as ."
"That &apos;s the tech@@ n@@ ical ter@@ m for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on where un@@ fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing data gets l@@ ost , gets un@@ published , is left mis@@ sing in action , and they say the res@@ ults descri@@ bed here &quot; might have pro@@ vi@@ ded an early war@@ ning of tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from bas@@ ic science .
"Th@@ ese are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c publi@@ sh@@ ing environ@@ ment is very different now .
"There are ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c j@@ our@@ n@@ als like &quot; &quot; T@@ ri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the op@@ en ac@@ cess j@@ our@@ n@@ al , which will publi@@ sh any tri@@ al conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a posi@@ tive or a ne@@ g@@ ative res@@ ult ."
But this problem of ne@@ g@@ ative res@@ ults that go mis@@ sing in action is still very pre@@ val@@ ent . I@@ n fact it &apos;s so pre@@ val@@ ent that it cu@@ ts to the c@@ ore of evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ bas@@ ed medic@@ ine .
"So this is a dru@@ g called re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine , and this is a dru@@ g that I my@@ self have pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed . It &apos;s an an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ dy doc@@ tor , so I read all of the stu@@ dies that I could on this dru@@ g . I read the one study that was published that sho@@ wed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was better than plac@@ e@@ b@@ o , and I read the other three stu@@ dies that were published that sho@@ wed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was just as good as any other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant , and because this pati@@ ent ha@@ dn &apos;t done well on those other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts , I thought , well , re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it tur@@ ned out that I was mis@@ led . I@@ n fact , se@@ ven tri@@ als were conduc@@ ted com@@ par@@ ing re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine against a d@@ um@@ my plac@@ e@@ b@@ o su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill . One of them was posi@@ tive and that was published , but six of them were ne@@ g@@ ative and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree tri@@ als were published com@@ par@@ ing re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine against other an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts in which re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was coll@@ ected which sho@@ wed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was wor@@ se than those other tre@@ at@@ ments , and those tri@@ als were not published ."
I f@@ el@@ t mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ me@@ ly un@@ u@@ su@@ al example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of ch@@ er@@ r@@ y-@@ pic@@ king and sel@@ ec@@ tive re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing that I &apos;m ac@@ c@@ using other people of ."
"But it turns out that this ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of pub@@ lic@@ ation bi@@ as has actually been very , very well stu@@ died ."
So here is one example of how you appro@@ ach it .
"The cl@@ assi@@ c mo@@ de@@ l is , you get a b@@ un@@ ch of stu@@ dies where you know that they &apos;ve been conduc@@ ted and comple@@ ted , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c liter@@ ature . So this took all of the tri@@ als that had ever been conduc@@ ted on an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year per@@ i@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the tri@@ als which were sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ v@@ al p@@ ac@@ k@@ age .
"So that &apos;s not all of the tri@@ als that were ever conduc@@ ted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conduc@@ ted in order to get the mar@@ ke@@ ting au@@ th@@ ori@@ zation ."
And then they went to see if these tri@@ als had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0-@@ 50 sp@@ li@@ t . H@@ al@@ f of these tri@@ als were posi@@ tive , half of them were ne@@ g@@ ative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these tri@@ als in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"O@@ n@@ ly three of the ne@@ g@@ ative tri@@ als were published , but all but one of the posi@@ tive tri@@ als were published ."
"Now if we just f@@ lic@@ k back and for@@ th between those two , you can see what a st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering difference there was between reality and what doc@@ tors , patients , comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ers of health serv@@ ices , and ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ics were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a syst@@ em@@ atic fl@@ a@@ w in the c@@ ore of medic@@ ine ."
"In fact , there have been so many stu@@ dies conduc@@ ted on pub@@ lic@@ ation bi@@ as now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been coll@@ ected in a syst@@ em@@ atic re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on pub@@ lic@@ ation bi@@ as that they could find ."
P@@ u@@ b@@ lic@@ ation bi@@ as aff@@ ec@@ ts every field of medic@@ ine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all tri@@ als , on average , go mis@@ sing in action , and we know that posi@@ tive fin@@ d@@ ings are around tw@@ ice as likely to be published as ne@@ g@@ ative fin@@ d@@ ings ."
This is a cancer at the c@@ ore of evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ bas@@ ed medic@@ ine .
"If I f@@ li@@ p@@ ped a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the res@@ ults from you from half of those t@@ os@@ ses , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up he@@ ads ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a tw@@ o@@ -@@ he@@ ad@@ ed co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ c@@ er and you were an i@@ di@@ ot for le@@ tting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we bl@@ in@@ dly t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ bas@@ ed medic@@ ine .
"And to me , this is resear@@ ch mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"If I conduc@@ ted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data poin@@ ts from that one study , you would ri@@ gh@@ tly ac@@ c@@ use me , ess@@ enti@@ ally , of resear@@ ch fr@@ au@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 stu@@ dies but only publi@@ sh@@ es the five that give the res@@ ult that they want , we don &apos;t consi@@ der that to be resear@@ ch mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"And when that respon@@ si@@ bility is diff@@ used between a whole ne@@ t@@ work of resear@@ ch@@ ers , ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ics , in@@ du@@ str@@ y sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors , j@@ our@@ n@@ al ed@@ it@@ ors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ t@@ able , but the eff@@ ect on patients is d@@ am@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a dru@@ g called T@@ am@@ i@@ fl@@ u . T@@ am@@ i@@ fl@@ u is a dru@@ g which govern@@ ments around the world have sp@@ ent b@@ illions and b@@ illions of dollars on st@@ oc@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve st@@ oc@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ ed T@@ am@@ i@@ fl@@ u in pan@@ ic , in the belie@@ f that it will re@@ duce the r@@ ate of comp@@ lic@@ ations of in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a ."
"C@@ om@@ p@@ lic@@ ations is a medic@@ al e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism for p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ o@@ ch@@ ran@@ e syst@@ em@@ atic re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to coll@@ ect together all of the data from all of the tri@@ als that had ever been conduc@@ ted on whether T@@ am@@ i@@ fl@@ u actually did this or not , they found that se@@ ver@@ al of those tri@@ als were un@@ published ."
The res@@ ults were un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to them .
"And when they started ob@@ tain@@ ing the wr@@ it@@ e@@ u@@ ps of those tri@@ als through vari@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation A@@ c@@ t requ@@ est@@ s , through har@@ ass@@ ing vari@@ ous different organi@@ z@@ ations , what they found was in@@ consi@@ st@@ ent ."
"And when they tri@@ ed to get a hold of the cl@@ in@@ ical study re@@ por@@ ts , the 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ p@@ age long doc@@ um@@ ents that have the best possible ren@@ di@@ tion of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t al@@ lowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the ful@@ l cor@@ respon@@ dence and the exc@@ us@@ es and the ex@@ plan@@ ations given by the dru@@ g comp@@ any , you can see that wr@@ it@@ ten up in this week &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion of P@@ L@@ O@@ S M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine ."
"And the most st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recogni@@ ze that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suff@@ er fa@@ ke fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pre@@ t@@ end that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , we had tri@@ als re@@ gi@@ st@@ ers , and everybody said , o@@ h , it &apos;s o@@ kay . We &apos;ll get everyone to re@@ gi@@ ster their tri@@ als , they &apos;ll p@@ ost the prot@@ o@@ co@@ l , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to ch@@ ec@@ k and see if all the tri@@ als which have been conduc@@ ted and comple@@ ted have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t bo@@ ther to use those re@@ gi@@ st@@ ers .
"And so then the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ om@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ e of M@@ e@@ dic@@ al J@@ our@@ n@@ al E@@ d@@ it@@ ors came along , and they said , o@@ h , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publi@@ sh any j@@ our@@ n@@ als , we won &apos;t publi@@ sh any tri@@ als , un@@ less they &apos;ve been re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed before they beg@@ an ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . I@@ n 200@@ 8 , a study was conduc@@ ted which sho@@ wed that half of all of tri@@ als published by j@@ our@@ n@@ als ed@@ ited by mem@@ bers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t pro@@ per@@ ly re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed , and a qu@@ ar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed at all ."
"And then fin@@ ally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ c@@ t was p@@ ass@@ ed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must p@@ ost the res@@ ults of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first e@@ di@@ tion of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people ke@@ p@@ t to that r@@ ul@@ ing , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a di@@ sa@@ ster .
We cannot know the true effec@@ ts of the medic@@ ines that we pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ be if we do not have ac@@ cess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to publi@@ sh all tri@@ als conduc@@ ted in hum@@ ans , in@@ clu@@ ding the ol@@ der tri@@ als , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ c@@ t only as@@ ks that you publi@@ sh the tri@@ als conduc@@ ted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing medic@@ ine on the bas@@ is of tri@@ als that comple@@ ted in the past two years ."
"We need to publi@@ sh all tri@@ als in hum@@ ans , in@@ clu@@ ding the ol@@ der tri@@ als , for all dru@@ gs in curren@@ t use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ ul@@ l the k@@ not .
"One is that I &apos;m always on time , and I &apos;m not ."
"I have four small children , and I would like to bl@@ ame them for my oc@@ cas@@ i@@ onal t@@ ar@@ d@@ iness , but sometimes it &apos;s just not their f@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
The second thing they as@@ su@@ me is that I have lots of ti@@ ps and tr@@ ic@@ ks for sa@@ ving b@@ its of time here and there .
"S@@ ome@@ times I &apos;ll hear from mag@@ az@@ ines that are doing a story along these l@@ ines , gener@@ ally on how to help their read@@ ers find an extra h@@ our in the day ."
You know another way to find 3@@ 2 minutes to ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ?
"D@@ on &apos;t wat@@ ch two hours of T@@ V a day , right ?"
"( Laughter ) A@@ n@@ y@@ way , the idea is we &apos;ll sa@@ ve b@@ its of time here and there , ad@@ d it up , we will fin@@ ally get to everything we want to do ."
We don &apos;t build the lives we want by sa@@ ving time .
"We build the lives we want , and then time sa@@ ves itself ."
Here &apos;s what I mean .
"If you &apos;ve ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a hu@@ ge@@ ly d@@ am@@ aging , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , s@@ op@@ ping m@@ ess ."
A@@ ll this is being rec@@ or@@ ded on her time lo@@ g .
W@@ in@@ ds up taking se@@ ven hours of her week .
S@@ even hours .
That &apos;s like fin@@ ding an extra h@@ our in the day .
&quot; C@@ ould you find se@@ ven hours to m@@ ent@@ or se@@ ven wor@@ th@@ y people ? &quot;
And what this sho@@ ws us is that time is high@@ ly el@@ as@@ tic .
"We cannot make more time , but time will stre@@ t@@ ch to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate what we cho@@ ose to put into it ."
And so the k@@ ey to time man@@ ag@@ ement is tre@@ ating our pri@@ ori@@ ties as the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of that bro@@ ken water he@@ ater .
"I remember it was a Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day mor@@ ning , and she was not av@@ a@@ il@@ able to spe@@ ak with me ."
"O@@ f course , right ?"
"But the reason she was un@@ av@@ a@@ il@@ able to spe@@ ak with me is that she was out for a hi@@ ke , because it was a beautiful sp@@ r@@ ing mor@@ ning , and she wanted to go for a hi@@ ke ."
"So of course this makes me even more in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed , and when I fin@@ ally do cat@@ ch up with her , she expl@@ ain@@ s it like this ."
"And gr@@ an@@ ted , there may be h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences for making different cho@@ ices , I will give you that ."
So how do we do that ?
"Well , first we need to fig@@ ure out what they are ."
I want to give you two str@@ ate@@ gi@@ es for thinking about this .
"The first , on the prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal side : I &apos;m sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting an@@ n@@ u@@ al per@@ form@@ ance re@@ vie@@ ws ."
"You look back over your suc@@ cess@@ es over the year , your &quot; &quot; op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties for grow@@ th . &quot; &quot; And this ser@@ ves its pur@@ pose , but I find it &apos;s more effec@@ tive to do this looking for@@ ward ."
"You &apos;re giving yourself a per@@ form@@ ance re@@ view , and it has been an ab@@ solu@@ tely ama@@ zing year for you prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ ally ."
What three to five things did you do that made it so ama@@ zing ?
So you can wr@@ ite next year &apos;s per@@ form@@ ance re@@ view now .
"And you can do this for your pers@@ onal life , too ."
"I &apos;m sure many of you , like me , come D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber , get car@@ ds that con@@ tain these fol@@ ded up sh@@ e@@ ets of co@@ lo@@ red p@@ ap@@ er , on which is wr@@ it@@ ten what is known as the family ho@@ li@@ day le@@ tter ."
"But these le@@ t@@ ters ser@@ ve a pur@@ pose , which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your pers@@ onal life that mat@@ ter@@ ed to you over the year ."
What three to five things did you do that made it so ama@@ zing ?
So you can wr@@ ite next year &apos;s family ho@@ li@@ day le@@ tter now .
D@@ on &apos;t s@@ end it .
"( Laughter ) P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t s@@ end it ."
But you can wr@@ ite it .
"And now , between the per@@ form@@ ance re@@ view and the family ho@@ li@@ day le@@ tter , we have a li@@ st of six to ten go@@ als we can work on in the next year ."
And now we need to bre@@ ak these down into do@@ able ste@@ ps .
So maybe you want to wr@@ ite a family history .
O@@ r maybe you want to run a 5@@ K .
We do this by thinking through our wee@@ ks before we are in them .
I find a really good time to do this is F@@ ri@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ ons .
F@@ ri@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on is what an econom@@ ist might call a &quot; &quot; low op@@ port@@ unity c@@ ost &quot; &quot; time .
M@@ a@@ king a thre@@ e-@@ cat@@ eg@@ ory li@@ st re@@ min@@ ds us that there should be something in all three cat@@ eg@@ ories .
"C@@ are@@ er , we think about ; relation@@ shi@@ ps , self — not so much ."
"Th@@ en look out over the whole of the next week , and see where you can pl@@ an them in ."
Wh@@ ere you pl@@ an them in is up to you .
I know this is going to be more comp@@ lic@@ ated for some people than others .
"I mean , some people &apos;s lives are just har@@ der than others ."
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that po@@ e@@ try cl@@ ass if you are car@@ ing for m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple children on your own .
I get that .
And I don &apos;t want to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze any@@ one &apos;s str@@ u@@ gg@@ le .
But I do think that the num@@ bers I am about to tell you are em@@ po@@ w@@ ering .
There are 1@@ 6@@ 8 hours in a week .
T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ four times se@@ ven is 1@@ 6@@ 8 hours .
That is a lot of time .
"If you are working a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job , so 40 hours a week , s@@ le@@ e@@ ping eight hours a night , so 5@@ 6 hours a week — that le@@ a@@ ves 7@@ 2 hours for other things ."
That is a lot of time .
"You say you &apos;re working 50 hours a week , maybe a ma@@ in job and a side hu@@ st@@ le ."
"Well , that le@@ a@@ ves 6@@ 2 hours for other things ."
You say you &apos;re working 60 hours .
"Well , that le@@ a@@ ves 5@@ 2 hours for other things ."
You say you &apos;re working more than 60 hours .
"Well , are you sure ?"
( Laughter ) There was once a study com@@ par@@ ing people &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated work wee@@ ks with time di@@ ar@@ ies .
And that &apos;s even if you &apos;re working way more than ful@@ l@@ -@@ time hours .
We don &apos;t even need that much time to do ama@@ zing things .
"But when most of us have b@@ its of time , what do we do ?"
"@@ P@@ ul@@ l out the ph@@ one , right ?"
St@@ art d@@ el@@ e@@ ting e@@ ma@@ il@@ s .
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , we &apos;re pu@@ t@@ ter@@ ing around the h@@ ouse or wat@@ ch@@ ing T@@ V ."
But small mom@@ ents can have great power .
You can use your b@@ its of time for b@@ its of jo@@ y .
M@@ ay@@ be it &apos;s cho@@ os@@ ing to read something wonderful on the b@@ us on the way to work .
B@@ re@@ a@@ ks at work can be used for me@@ d@@ it@@ ating or p@@ ra@@ ying .
"If family d@@ in@@ ner is out because of your crazy work s@@ che@@ du@@ le , maybe family bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast could be a good sub@@ stitu@@ te ."
It &apos;s about looking at the whole of one &apos;s time and seeing where the good stuff can go .
I tru@@ ly believe this .
There is time .
"E@@ ven if we are bus@@ y , we have time for what mat@@ ters ."
"And when we fo@@ c@@ us on what mat@@ ters , we can build the lives we want in the time we &apos;ve got ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have a question : Wh@@ o here remem@@ bers when they first reali@@ zed they were going to die ?
"I do . I was a young bo@@ y , and my gr@@ and@@ father had just died , and I remember a few days later l@@ ying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened ."
What did it mean that he was de@@ ad ?
Wh@@ ere had he g@@ one ?
It was like a hole in reality had op@@ en@@ ed up and s@@ wal@@ lowed him .
"But then the really sho@@ c@@ king question oc@@ cur@@ red to me : If he could die , could it happen to me too ?"
C@@ ould that hole in reality op@@ en up and s@@ wal@@ low me ?
W@@ ould it op@@ en up b@@ ene@@ ath my bed and s@@ wal@@ low me as I s@@ le@@ p@@ t ?
"Well , at some point , all children become aw@@ are of death ."
"It can happen in different ways , of course , and u@@ su@@ ally comes in st@@ ages ."
O@@ ur idea of death develop@@ s as we grow ol@@ der .
"And if you re@@ ach back into the dark cor@@ n@@ ers of your mem@@ ory , you might remember something like what I f@@ el@@ t when my gr@@ and@@ father died and when I reali@@ zed it could happen to me too , that sense that be@@ h@@ ind all of this the v@@ o@@ id is wa@@ iting ."
And this develop@@ ment in chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ts the develop@@ ment of our spec@@ ies .
"@@ J@@ ust as there was a point in your develop@@ ment as a child when your sense of self and of time bec@@ ame s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated enough for you to reali@@ ze you were mor@@ t@@ al , so at some point in the evolution of our spec@@ ies , some early human &apos;s sense of self and of time bec@@ ame s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated enough for them to become the first human to reali@@ ze , &quot; I &apos;m going to die . &quot;"
"This is , if you like , our cur@@ se ."
It &apos;s the pr@@ ice we p@@ ay for being so d@@ am@@ n c@@ le@@ ver .
"We have to live in the knowledge that the wor@@ st thing that can possi@@ bly happen one day su@@ re@@ ly will , the end of all our pro@@ jects , our ho@@ p@@ es , our dre@@ ams , of our in@@ divi@@ du@@ al world ."
We each live in the s@@ ha@@ do@@ w of a pers@@ onal ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ se .
And that &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing . It &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying .
And so we look for a way out .
"And in my case , as I was about five years old , this me@@ ant as@@ king my mu@@ m ."
"Now when I first started as@@ king what happens when we die , the grow@@ n@@ -@@ u@@ ps around me at the time ans@@ wer@@ ed with a typ@@ ical English mi@@ x of aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ness and hal@@ f@@ -@@ hear@@ ted Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , and the ph@@ ra@@ se I heard most often was that gr@@ and@@ d@@ ad was now &quot; up there looking down on us , &quot; and if I should die too , which wouldn &apos;t happen of course , then I too would go up there , which made death sound a lot like an exist@@ ential el@@ ev@@ at@@ or ."
Now this didn &apos;t sound very pl@@ au@@ sible .
"I used to wat@@ ch a children &apos;s news program at the time , and this was the er@@ a of space expl@@ or@@ ation ."
"There were always ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts going up into the sk@@ y , up into space , going up there ."
But n@@ one of the astron@@ au@@ ts when they came back ever m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed having m@@ et my gr@@ and@@ d@@ ad or any other de@@ ad people .
"But I was sc@@ ared , and the idea of taking the exist@@ ential el@@ ev@@ at@@ or to see my gr@@ and@@ d@@ ad s@@ oun@@ ded a lot better than being s@@ wal@@ lowed by the v@@ o@@ id while I s@@ le@@ p@@ t ."
"And so I beli@@ ev@@ ed it any@@ way , even though it didn &apos;t make much sense ."
"And this thought process that I went through as a child , and have been through many times since , in@@ clu@@ ding as a grow@@ n@@ -@@ up , is a produc@@ t of what psycho@@ logi@@ sts call a bi@@ as ."
"Now a bi@@ as is a way in which we syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally get things wrong , ways in which we mis@@ cal@@ cul@@ ate , mis@@ ju@@ dge , dist@@ ort reality , or see what we want to see , and the bi@@ as I &apos;m talking about works like this : Con@@ front someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that t@@ ells them it isn &apos;t true and they can , instead , live fore@@ ver , even if it means taking the exist@@ ential el@@ ev@@ at@@ or ."
Now we can see this as the bi@@ gg@@ est bi@@ as of all .
It has been de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated in over 4@@ 00 emp@@ ir@@ ical stu@@ dies .
"Now these stu@@ dies are in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , but they &apos;re simple ."
They work like this .
"You take two grou@@ ps of people who are sim@@ il@@ ar in all re@@ lev@@ ant resp@@ ec@@ ts , and you re@@ mind one group that they &apos;re going to die but not the other , then you comp@@ are their behavior ."
So you &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving how it bi@@ ases behavior when people become aw@@ are of their mor@@ tal@@ ity .
"And every time , you get the same res@@ ult : People who are made aw@@ are of their mor@@ tal@@ ity are more w@@ ill@@ ing to believe stories that tell them they can es@@ cap@@ e death and live fore@@ ver ."
"So here &apos;s an example : One rec@@ ent study took two grou@@ ps of ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics , that is people who are und@@ eci@@ ded in their religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s ."
"Now , one group was asked to think about being de@@ ad ."
The other group was asked to think about being lon@@ ely .
They were then asked again about their religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s .
Th@@ ose who had been asked to think about being de@@ ad were af@@ ter@@ wards tw@@ ice as likely to ex@@ pres@@ s fa@@ ith in G@@ od and J@@ es@@ us .
T@@ w@@ ice as likely .
E@@ ven though the before they were all equ@@ ally ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic .
"But put the fear of death in them , and they run to J@@ es@@ us ."
"Now , this sho@@ ws that re@@ min@@ ding people of death bi@@ ases them to believe , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the evidence , and it works not just for religi@@ on , but for any kind of belie@@ f system that prom@@ is@@ es im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity in some form , whether it &apos;s becom@@ ing fam@@ ous or having children or even n@@ ati@@ on@@ al@@ ism , which prom@@ is@@ es you can live on as part of a gre@@ ater whole ."
This is a bi@@ as that has shap@@ ed the course of human history .
"Now , the theory be@@ h@@ ind this bi@@ as in the over 4@@ 00 stu@@ dies is called ter@@ ro@@ r man@@ ag@@ ement theory , and the idea is simple . It &apos;s just this ."
"We devel@@ op our wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ ws , that is , the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it , in order to help us man@@ age the ter@@ ro@@ r of death ."
"And these im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity stories have thousands of different man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ations , but I believe that be@@ h@@ ind the app@@ aren@@ t di@@ vers@@ ity there are actually just four bas@@ ic for@@ ms that these im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity stories can take ."
"And we can see them re@@ pe@@ ating themselves thr@@ ough@@ out history , just with s@@ light vari@@ ations to re@@ fl@@ ect the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of the day ."
"Now I &apos;m going to bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly int@@ ro@@ duce these four bas@@ ic for@@ ms of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity story , and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they &apos;re re@@ told by each culture or generation using the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of their day ."
"Now , the first story is the sim@@ pl@@ est ."
"We want to av@@ o@@ id death , and the dre@@ am of doing that in this body in this world fore@@ ver is the first and sim@@ pl@@ est kind of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity story , and it might at first sound im@@ pl@@ au@@ sible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some my@@ th or le@@ gen@@ d of an e@@ li@@ x@@ ir of life or a f@@ oun@@ tain of y@@ ou@@ th or something that prom@@ is@@ es to keep us going fore@@ ver ."
"A@@ n@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ yp@@ t had such my@@ ths , an@@ ci@@ ent B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on , an@@ ci@@ ent India ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough@@ out Euro@@ pe@@ an history , we find them in the work of the al@@ ch@@ em@@ ists , and of course we still believe this today , only we tell this story using the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of science ."
"So 100 years ago , h@@ or@@ mon@@ es had just been disc@@ over@@ ed , and people ho@@ ped that h@@ orm@@ one tre@@ at@@ ments were going to c@@ ure aging and disease , and now instead we set our ho@@ p@@ es on stem cells , gen@@ e@@ tic engine@@ ering , and n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy ."
"But the idea that science can c@@ ure death is just one more ch@@ ap@@ ter in the story of the mag@@ ical e@@ li@@ x@@ ir , a story that is as old as civi@@ li@@ zation ."
But be@@ tting everything on the idea of fin@@ ding the e@@ li@@ x@@ ir and st@@ ay@@ ing ali@@ ve fore@@ ver is a ri@@ sk@@ y str@@ ate@@ gy .
"When we look back through history at all those who have s@@ ought an e@@ li@@ x@@ ir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they &apos;re all de@@ ad ."
"So we need a bac@@ k@@ up pl@@ an , and exactly this kind of pl@@ an B is what the second kind of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity story off@@ ers , and that &apos;s res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion ."
"And it st@@ ays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical org@@ an@@ ism ."
"It ac@@ cep@@ ts that I &apos;m going to have to die but says , des@@ p@@ ite that , I can ri@@ se up and I can live again ."
"In other words , I can do what J@@ es@@ us did ."
"@@ J@@ es@@ us died , he was three days in the &#91; tom@@ b &#93; , and then he r@@ ose up and li@@ ved again ."
"And the idea that we can all be res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted to live again is or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x believe , not just for Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans but also J@@ e@@ ws and M@@ us@@ li@@ ms ."
"But our des@@ ire to believe this story is so de@@ e@@ ply em@@ be@@ d@@ ded that we are re@@ inv@@ ent@@ ing it again for the scienti@@ fic age , for example , with the idea of cr@@ y@@ on@@ ics ."
"That &apos;s the idea that when you die , you can have yourself f@@ ro@@ z@@ en , and then , at some point when technology has adv@@ anc@@ ed enough , you can be th@@ aw@@ ed out and re@@ p@@ a@@ i@@ red and re@@ vi@@ ved and so res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"And so some people believe an om@@ ni@@ p@@ ot@@ ent go@@ d will res@@ ur@@ rec@@ t them to live again , and other people believe an om@@ ni@@ p@@ ot@@ ent scienti@@ st will do it ."
"But for others , the whole idea of res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion , of c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing out of the gra@@ ve , it &apos;s just too much like a bad z@@ om@@ bi@@ e mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"They find the body too mess@@ y , too un@@ reli@@ able to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e e@@ ter@@ n@@ al life , and so they set their ho@@ p@@ es on the thir@@ d , more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity story , the idea that we can leave our body be@@ h@@ ind and live on as a s@@ ou@@ l ."
"Now , the maj@@ or@@ ity of people on Earth believe they have a s@@ ou@@ l , and the idea is cen@@ tr@@ al to many religi@@ ons ."
"But even though , in its curren@@ t form , in its tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal form , the idea of the s@@ ou@@ l is still hu@@ ge@@ ly pop@@ ular , n@@ on@@ e@@ the@@ less we are again re@@ inv@@ ent@@ ing it for the dig@@ ital age , for example with the idea that you can leave your body be@@ h@@ ind by up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing your mind , your ess@@ ence , the real you , on@@ to a computer , and so live on as an av@@ at@@ ar in the e@@ ther ."
"But of course there are s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics who say if we look at the evidence of science , partic@@ ul@@ arly neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , it su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that your mind , your ess@@ ence , the real you , is very much dep@@ en@@ dent on a particular part of your body , that is , your brain ."
"And such s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics can find com@@ for@@ t in the f@@ our@@ th kind of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity story , and that is le@@ g@@ acy , the idea that you can live on through the ech@@ o you leave in the world , like the great G@@ re@@ e@@ k war@@ ri@@ or A@@ ch@@ ill@@ es , who s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed his life fi@@ gh@@ ting at T@@ ro@@ y so that he might w@@ in im@@ mor@@ t@@ al fa@@ me ."
"And the pur@@ su@@ it of fa@@ me is as wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad and pop@@ ular now as it ever was , and in our dig@@ ital age , it &apos;s even eas@@ ier to achi@@ e@@ ve ."
You don &apos;t need to be a great war@@ ri@@ or like A@@ ch@@ ill@@ es or a great king or her@@ o .
"A@@ ll you need is an In@@ ter@@ net connec@@ tion and a fun@@ n@@ y c@@ at . ( Laughter ) But some people pre@@ f@@ er to leave a more t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble , bio@@ logical le@@ g@@ acy — children , for example ."
"O@@ r they like , they hope , to live on as part of some gre@@ ater whole , a n@@ ation or a family or a tri@@ be , their gen@@ e po@@ ol ."
"But again , there are s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics who d@@ ou@@ b@@ t whether le@@ g@@ acy really is im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity ."
"W@@ oo@@ dy A@@ l@@ l@@ en , for example , who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to live on in the hear@@ ts of my coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men ."
"I want to live on in my ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment . &quot; &quot; So those are the four bas@@ ic kinds of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity stories , and I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to give just some sense of how they &apos;re re@@ told by each generation with just s@@ light vari@@ ations to f@@ it the f@@ as@@ hi@@ ons of the day ."
"And the fact that they rec@@ ur in this way , in such a sim@@ il@@ ar form but in such different belie@@ f syst@@ ems , su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts , I think , that we should be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical of the tru@@ th of any particular ver@@ sion of these stories ."
The fact that some people believe an om@@ ni@@ p@@ ot@@ ent go@@ d will res@@ ur@@ rec@@ t them to live again and others believe an om@@ ni@@ p@@ ot@@ ent scienti@@ st will do it su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that ne@@ ither are really beli@@ ev@@ ing this on the stre@@ ng@@ th of the evidence .
"R@@ a@@ ther , we believe these stories because we are bi@@ as@@ ed to believe them , and we are bi@@ as@@ ed to believe them because we are so af@@ ra@@ id of death ."
"So the question is , are we do@@ om@@ ed to le@@ ad the one life we have in a way that is shap@@ ed by fear and den@@ i@@ al , or can we over@@ come this bi@@ as ?"
Well the G@@ re@@ e@@ k philosop@@ her E@@ pic@@ ur@@ us thought we could .
"He ar@@ gu@@ ed that the fear of death is natural , but it is not r@@ ational ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ath , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; is nothing to us , because when we are here , death is not , and when death is here , we are g@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now this is often quot@@ ed , but it &apos;s difficult to really gr@@ as@@ p , to really inter@@ n@@ ali@@ ze , because exactly this idea of being g@@ one is so difficult to imagine ."
"So 2@@ ,000 years later , another philosop@@ her , L@@ u@@ d@@ wi@@ g W@@ it@@ t@@ gen@@ ste@@ in , put it like this : &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ath is not an ev@@ ent in life : We do not live to experience death ."
"And so , &quot; &quot; he ad@@ ded , &quot; in this sense , life has no end . &quot;"
"So it was natural for me as a child to fear being s@@ wal@@ lowed by the v@@ o@@ id , but it wasn &apos;t r@@ ational , because being s@@ wal@@ lowed by the v@@ o@@ id is not something that any of us will ever live to experience ."
"Now , over@@ coming this bi@@ as is not easy because the fear of death is so de@@ e@@ ply em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in us , yet when we see that the fear itself is not r@@ ational , and when we bring out into the op@@ en the ways in which it can un@@ conscious@@ ly bi@@ as us , then we can at le@@ ast start to try to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze the in@@ flu@@ ence it has on our lives ."
"Now , I find it hel@@ ps to see life as being like a book : J@@ ust as a book is b@@ oun@@ ded by its co@@ ver@@ s , by beginning and end , so our lives are b@@ oun@@ ded by bir@@ th and death , and even though a book is lim@@ ited by beginning and end , it can en@@ comp@@ ass dist@@ ant l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , ex@@ ot@@ ic fi@@ gu@@ res , f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic adv@@ en@@ tures ."
"And even though a book is lim@@ ited by beginning and end , the char@@ ac@@ ters within it know no h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons ."
"They only know the mom@@ ents that make up their story , even when the book is cl@@ os@@ ed ."
And so the char@@ ac@@ ters of a book are not af@@ ra@@ id of re@@ ach@@ ing the last p@@ age .
L@@ ong J@@ o@@ h@@ n S@@ il@@ ver is not af@@ ra@@ id of you fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing your cop@@ y of &quot; &quot; T@@ reas@@ ure I@@ s@@ land . &quot; &quot; And so it should be with us .
"I@@ mag@@ ine the book of your life , its co@@ ver@@ s , its beginning and end , and your bir@@ th and your death ."
"You can only know the mom@@ ents in between , the mom@@ ents that make up your life ."
"It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those co@@ ver@@ s , whether before your bir@@ th or after your death ."
"And you nee@@ dn &apos;t wor@@ ry how long the book is , or whether it &apos;s a com@@ ic stri@@ p or an e@@ p@@ ic ."
The only thing that mat@@ ters is that you make it a good story .
Thank you .

The ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on you saw here for a bri@@ e@@ f moment is called qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m lev@@ it@@ ation and qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king .
And the ob@@ ject that was lev@@ it@@ ating here is called a super@@ conduc@@ tor .
"S@@ u@@ per@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity is a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m state of matter , and it oc@@ cur@@ s only b@@ el@@ ow a certain cri@@ tical t@@ em@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ; it was disc@@ over@@ ed 100 years ago ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , only rec@@ ently , d@@ ue to se@@ ver@@ al techno@@ logical adv@@ anc@@ em@@ ents , we are now able to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate to you qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m lev@@ it@@ ation and qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king ."
"So , a super@@ conduc@@ tor is defin@@ ed by two pro@@ per@@ ties ."
"The first is z@@ er@@ o electr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ ance , and the second is the exp@@ ul@@ sion of a mag@@ ne@@ tic field from the inter@@ i@@ or of the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"That s@@ ounds comp@@ lic@@ ated , right ?"
But what is electr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ ance ?
"So , electr@@ ic@@ ity is the f@@ low of electr@@ ons inside a material ."
"And these electr@@ ons , while f@@ lowing , they col@@ li@@ de with the at@@ om@@ s , and in these col@@ li@@ sions they l@@ ose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that eff@@ ect ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , inside a super@@ conduc@@ tor there are no col@@ li@@ sions , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mark@@ able . Th@@ ink about it .
"In cl@@ ass@@ ical physics , there is always some fr@@ ic@@ tion , some energy l@@ oss ."
"But not here , because it is a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m eff@@ ect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because super@@ conduc@@ tors don &apos;t like mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a super@@ conduc@@ tor will try to ex@@ pe@@ l mag@@ ne@@ tic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by cir@@ cul@@ ating curren@@ ts ."
"Now , the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of both effec@@ ts — the exp@@ ul@@ sion of mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds and z@@ er@@ o electr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ ance — is exactly a super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always per@@ f@@ ect , as we all know , and sometimes str@@ ands of mag@@ ne@@ tic field re@@ ma@@ in inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"Now , under pro@@ per condi@@ tions , which we have here , these str@@ ands of mag@@ ne@@ tic field can be tr@@ app@@ ed inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"And these str@@ ands of mag@@ ne@@ tic field inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor , they come in disc@@ re@@ te qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties ."
Why ? Because it is a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on . It &apos;s qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m partic@@ les .
"In this mo@@ vi@@ e here , you can see how they f@@ low one by one disc@@ re@@ tely ."
"This is str@@ ands of mag@@ ne@@ tic field . Th@@ ese are not partic@@ les , but they be@@ have like partic@@ les ."
"So , this is why we call this eff@@ ect qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m lev@@ it@@ ation and qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king ."
But what happens to the super@@ conduc@@ tor when we put it inside a mag@@ ne@@ tic field ?
"Well , first there are str@@ ands of mag@@ ne@@ tic field left inside , but now the super@@ conduc@@ tor doesn &apos;t like them mo@@ ving around , because their mov@@ em@@ ents dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which bre@@ a@@ ks the super@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity state ."
"So what it actually does , it loc@@ ks these str@@ ands , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it loc@@ ks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is loc@@ king itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any mov@@ ement of the super@@ conduc@@ tor will change their place , will change their con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation ."
So we get qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a super@@ conduc@@ tor , which I wr@@ app@@ ed up so it &apos;d st@@ ay co@@ ld long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ g@@ ular mag@@ net , it just st@@ ays loc@@ ked in mi@@ d@@ air ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just lev@@ it@@ ation . It &apos;s not just re@@ pul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be loc@@ ked in this new con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke this , or move it s@@ ligh@@ tly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king — actually loc@@ king — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal loc@@ king of the super@@ conduc@@ tor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ ma@@ in loc@@ ked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called lev@@ it@@ ation is actually loc@@ king , Y@@ eah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surpri@@ sed to hear that if I take this cir@@ cul@@ ar mag@@ net , in which the mag@@ ne@@ tic field is the same all around , the super@@ conduc@@ tor will be able to f@@ re@@ ely r@@ ot@@ ate around the ax@@ is of the mag@@ net ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it r@@ ot@@ ates , the loc@@ king is ma@@ in@@ tain@@ ed ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can r@@ ot@@ ate the super@@ conduc@@ tor .
"We have fr@@ ic@@ tion@@ less moti@@ on . It is still lev@@ it@@ ating , but can move f@@ re@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king and we can lev@@ it@@ ate it on top of this mag@@ net ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many mag@@ ne@@ tic str@@ ands are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cul@@ ate it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion str@@ ands of mag@@ ne@@ tic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the ama@@ zing part yet , because there is something I ha@@ ven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , ye@@ ah , the ama@@ zing part is that this super@@ conduc@@ tor that you see here is only half a m@@ ic@@ r@@ on th@@ ick . It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in ."
"And this extre@@ me@@ ly th@@ in l@@ ay@@ er is able to lev@@ it@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own we@@ ight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able eff@@ ect . It &apos;s very str@@ ong .
"Now , I can ex@@ t@@ end this cir@@ cul@@ ar mag@@ net , and make wh@@ at@@ ever tr@@ ack I want ."
"For example , I can make a large cir@@ cul@@ ar ra@@ il here ."
"And when I place the super@@ conduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this ra@@ il , it mo@@ ves f@@ re@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its posi@@ tion like this , and r@@ ot@@ ate , and it f@@ re@@ ely mo@@ ves in this new posi@@ tion ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it st@@ ays here — don &apos;t move — I will try to r@@ ot@@ ate the tr@@ ack , and ho@@ pe@@ fully , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it st@@ ays su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king , not lev@@ it@@ ation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it cir@@ cul@@ ate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about super@@ conduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ orm@@ ous amount of curren@@ ts inside super@@ conduc@@ tors , so we can use them to pro@@ duce str@@ ong mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I mach@@ ines , partic@@ le ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ ors and so on ."
"But we can also st@@ ore energy using super@@ conduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation ."
"And we could also pro@@ duce power c@@ ab@@ les , to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ orm@@ ous amoun@@ ts of curren@@ t between power st@@ ations ."
I@@ mag@@ ine you could back up a single power st@@ ation with a single super@@ conduc@@ ting c@@ able .
But what is the future of qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m lev@@ it@@ ation and qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m loc@@ king ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine you would have a dis@@ k sim@@ il@@ ar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch di@@ am@@ e@@ ter , with a single difference ."
"The super@@ conduc@@ ting l@@ ay@@ er , instead of being half a m@@ ic@@ r@@ on th@@ in , being two m@@ illi@@ me@@ ters th@@ in , quite th@@ in ."
"This tw@@ o@@ -@@ m@@ illi@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ in super@@ conduc@@ ting l@@ ay@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 ki@@ lo@@ gr@@ ams , a small c@@ ar , in my hand ."
A@@ ma@@ zing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y t@@ op@@ ic is the sec@@ re@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she st@@ ay ?"
Why would any@@ one st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s her ?
"I &apos;m not a psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st , a social wor@@ ker or an exper@@ t in dom@@ es@@ tic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just gra@@ du@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mo@@ ved to New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity for my first job as a wr@@ it@@ er and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ ev@@ ent@@ een mag@@ az@@ ine .
"I had my first ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pres@@ s c@@ ard , and I had a very big sec@@ re@@ t ."
"M@@ y sec@@ re@@ t was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ad@@ ed with ho@@ l@@ low@@ -@@ point b@@ ul@@ le@@ ts poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my s@@ oul@@ m@@ ate , many , many times ."
The man who I lo@@ ved more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remember .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as love , one that m@@ illions of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typ@@ ical dom@@ es@@ tic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in English from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in mar@@ ke@@ ting from Wh@@ ar@@ t@@ on B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent most of my care@@ er working for F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies in@@ clu@@ ding J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son &@@ am@@ p@@ ; J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son , L@@ e@@ o B@@ ur@@ ne@@ t@@ t and The W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on P@@ ost ."
I &apos;ve been marri@@ ed for almost 20 years to my second h@@ us@@ b@@ and and we have three kids together .
"M@@ y do@@ g is a black la@@ b , and I dri@@ ve a H@@ on@@ d@@ a O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ y min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) So my first mess@@ age for you is that dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to everyone — all r@@ ac@@ es , all religi@@ ons , all income and education lev@@ els ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second mess@@ age is that everyone thin@@ ks dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s is@@ sue ."
Not exactly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ tim@@ ate , inter@@ dep@@ en@@ dent , lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in fam@@ ili@@ es , the last place we would want or exp@@ ect to find violence , which is one reason dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use is so con@@ f@@ using ."
"I would have told you my@@ self that I was the last person on Earth who would st@@ ay with a man who be@@ at@@ s me , but in fact I was a very typ@@ ical v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ages 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as likely to be dom@@ es@@ tic violence v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s as women of other ages , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are k@@ ill@@ ed every year by ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , bo@@ y@@ friends , and h@@ us@@ b@@ ands in the United States ."
"I was also a very typ@@ ical v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m because I knew nothing about dom@@ es@@ tic violence , its war@@ ning si@@ g@@ ns or its patterns ."
"I m@@ et Con@@ or on a co@@ ld , ra@@ iny J@@ an@@ u@@ ary night ."
"He s@@ at next to me on the New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just gra@@ du@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y L@@ e@@ ag@@ ue school , and that he worked at a very im@@ pres@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the bi@@ gg@@ est im@@ pres@@ sion on me that first me@@ e@@ ting was that he was smar@@ t and fun@@ n@@ y and he looked like a f@@ ar@@ m bo@@ y .
"He had these big che@@ e@@ ks , these big app@@ le che@@ e@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ on@@ d ha@@ ir , and he se@@ em@@ ed so s@@ we@@ et ."
"One of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the ill@@ u@@ sion that I was the dom@@ in@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ zing me .
"We started d@@ ating , and he lo@@ ved everything about me , that I was smar@@ t , that I &apos;d g@@ one to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , that I was p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate about hel@@ ping te@@ en@@ age girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and my ho@@ p@@ es and dre@@ ams .
"C@@ on@@ or beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a wr@@ it@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also cre@@ ated a mag@@ ical at@@ m@@ osp@@ here of tr@@ ust between us by con@@ f@@ ess@@ ing his sec@@ re@@ t , which was that , as a very young bo@@ y star@@ ting at age four , he had been sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly phys@@ ically ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to dro@@ p out of school in e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very smar@@ t , and he &apos;d sp@@ ent almost 20 years re@@ building his life ."
Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y L@@ e@@ ag@@ ue de@@ gre@@ e and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right sh@@ iny future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this smar@@ t , fun@@ n@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive man who a@@ do@@ red me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how sh@@ ort my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I li@@ ved , what j@@ ob@@ s I took , who my friends were and where I sp@@ ent Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , I would have l@@ augh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ in@@ t of violence or control or an@@ ger in Con@@ or at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first st@@ age in any dom@@ es@@ tic violence relation@@ ship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second ste@@ p is to is@@ ol@@ ate the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m .
"Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , h@@ ey , all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next p@@ ha@@ se where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment where the ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this c@@ ity where you have friends and family and co@@ wor@@ k@@ ers who can see the br@@ u@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; In@@ ste@@ ad , Con@@ or came home one F@@ ri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,"
"@@ because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and lo@@ ved that he didn &apos;t need to pro@@ ve h@@ im@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the c@@ ity and away from his ab@@ u@@ sive , d@@ ys@@ fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal family , and move to a t@@ iny to@@ wn in New Eng@@ land where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New Y@@ or@@ k , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for your s@@ oul@@ m@@ ate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ all@@ ing into crazy love , that I was wal@@ king he@@ ad@@ first into a care@@ fully la@@ id physical , fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p ."
The next ste@@ p in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence patter@@ n is to int@@ ro@@ duce the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mo@@ ved to New Eng@@ land — you know , that place where Con@@ n@@ or was sup@@ posed to feel so sa@@ fe — he b@@ ought three g@@ un@@ s ."
He ke@@ p@@ t one in the g@@ love com@@ par@@ t@@ ment of our c@@ ar .
"He ke@@ p@@ t one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our bed , and the thir@@ d one he ke@@ p@@ t in his po@@ c@@ k@@ et at all times ."
And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tr@@ au@@ m@@ a he &apos;d experienc@@ ed as a young bo@@ y .
He needed them to feel prot@@ ected .
"But those g@@ un@@ s were really a mess@@ age for me , and even though he ha@@ dn &apos;t ra@@ is@@ ed a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve d@@ an@@ ger every minut@@ e of every day ."
Con@@ or first phys@@ ically att@@ ac@@ ked me five days before our we@@ d@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ gh@@ t@@ go@@ wn .
"I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a f@@ re@@ el@@ ance wr@@ iting assi@@ gn@@ ment , and I got f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , and Con@@ or used my an@@ ger as an exc@@ use to put both of his h@@ ands around my nec@@ k and to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze so ti@@ gh@@ tly that I could not bre@@ a@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ i@@ ve days later , the ten br@@ u@@ is@@ es on my nec@@ k had just f@@ ad@@ ed , and I put on my mother &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding d@@ ress , and I marri@@ ed him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I lo@@ ved him , and he lo@@ ved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sor@@ ry ."
He had just been really st@@ res@@ sed out by the we@@ d@@ ding and by becom@@ ing a family with me .
"It was an is@@ ol@@ ated in@@ ci@@ dent , and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again ."
It happened tw@@ ice more on the h@@ on@@ ey@@ mo@@ on .
"The first time , I was dri@@ ving to find a sec@@ re@@ t be@@ ach and I got l@@ ost , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly h@@ it the dri@@ ver &apos;s side w@@ in@@ do@@ w ."
"And then a few days later , dri@@ ving home from our h@@ on@@ ey@@ mo@@ on , he got f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by tra@@ ff@@ ic , and he thre@@ w a co@@ ld B@@ i@@ g M@@ a@@ c in my face ."
Con@@ or pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ded to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a week for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age .
I was mi@@ sta@@ ken in thinking that I was uni@@ qu@@ e and al@@ one in this sit@@ u@@ ation .
"One in three American women experi@@ ences dom@@ es@@ tic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ por@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good comp@@ any ."
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I st@@ ay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ad@@ ed g@@ un@@ s to my head , pu@@ shed me down sta@@ ir@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the k@@ ey out of the c@@ ar ig@@ ni@@ tion as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I d@@ res@@ sed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of my@@ self as a b@@ at@@ ter@@ ed wi@@ fe ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I was a very str@@ ong woman in love with a de@@ e@@ ply tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his de@@ m@@ ons ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"T@@ o me , this is the sa@@ dd@@ est and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s know something you u@@ su@@ ally don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ bly d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to leave an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fin@@ al ste@@ p in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence patter@@ n is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 7@@ 0 percent of dom@@ es@@ tic violence m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers happen after the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m has en@@ ded the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to l@@ ose ."
"O@@ ther out@@ comes in@@ clu@@ de lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ marri@@ es ; den@@ i@@ al of fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al res@@ our@@ ces ; and man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m and her children , who are re@@ g@@ ul@@ arly for@@ c@@ ed by family cour@@ t ju@@ d@@ g@@ es to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vi@@ sed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one fin@@ al , sa@@ di@@ sti@@ c be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my den@@ i@@ al ."
I reali@@ zed that the man who I lo@@ ved so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I bro@@ ke the si@@ l@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the poli@@ ce , my ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors , my friends and family , t@@ ot@@ al str@@ ang@@ ers , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ ped me ."
"We t@@ end to st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s as g@@ ri@@ s@@ ly he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive women , d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed go@@ o@@ ds ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she st@@ ay ? &quot; &quot; is co@@ de for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her f@@ au@@ l@@ t for st@@ ay@@ ing , &quot; &quot; as if v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s int@@ enti@@ on@@ ally cho@@ ose to f@@ all in love with men int@@ ent up@@ on dest@@ ro@@ ying us ."
"But since publi@@ sh@@ ing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ zy Lo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; I have heard hund@@ re@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an inv@@ al@@ u@@ able life l@@ es@@ son from what happened , and who re@@ built lives — jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives — as emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , wi@@ ves and mo@@ thers , lives completely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typ@@ ical dom@@ es@@ tic violence v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m and a typ@@ ical dom@@ es@@ tic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I re@@ marri@@ ed a kind and g@@ ent@@ le man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that min@@ i@@ v@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me ."
"R@@ ight now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how stu@@ p@@ id was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I prom@@ ise you there are se@@ ver@@ al people li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to me right now who are curren@@ tly being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers themselves .
"A@@ bu@@ se could be aff@@ ec@@ ting your d@@ aughter , your si@@ ster , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own crazy love story by bre@@ a@@ king the si@@ l@@ ence .
I &apos;m still bre@@ a@@ king the si@@ l@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ ping other v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s , and it &apos;s my fin@@ al requ@@ est of you ."
T@@ al@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ bu@@ se th@@ ri@@ ves only in si@@ l@@ ence .
You have the power to end dom@@ es@@ tic violence simply by sh@@ in@@ ing a sp@@ ot@@ light on it .
We v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the sec@@ re@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ wor@@ k@@ ers , your friends and family ."
"R@@ ec@@ ast survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with ful@@ l fu@@ tures ."
"R@@ ec@@ o@@ gni@@ ze the early si@@ g@@ ns of violence and consci@@ enti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s a sa@@ fe way out ."
"T@@ o@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our d@@ in@@ ner t@@ ab@@ les and our fam@@ ili@@ es the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful o@@ ases they should be ."
Thank you .

One billion people .
Th@@ ose are the problems in the develop@@ ing world .
And it &apos;s easy for us not to be emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with those people who seem so dist@@ anc@@ ed from us .
We see that in the S@@ and@@ ers / T@@ r@@ um@@ p cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ ns in my own country .
"We &apos;ve been working on this problem for 2@@ 5 years , since R@@ i@@ o , the K@@ y@@ ot@@ o P@@ r@@ ot@@ o@@ col@@ s ."
"O@@ ur most rec@@ ent move is the P@@ ar@@ is tre@@ at@@ y , and the res@@ ul@@ ting c@@ lim@@ ate ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents that are being r@@ ati@@ fied by n@@ ations around the world ."
"I think we can be very ho@@ pe@@ ful that those ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , which are bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , where n@@ ations have said what they think they can do , are gen@@ u@@ ine and for@@ th@@ coming for the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the par@@ ties ."
"The un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate thing is that now , as we look at the in@@ dep@@ en@@ dent anal@@ ys@@ es of what those c@@ lim@@ ate tre@@ ati@@ es are li@@ able to y@@ i@@ el@@ d , the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of the problem before us becom@@ es c@@ lear ."
It sho@@ ws basically C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ sions around the world over the next 30 years .
There are three things that you need to look at and ap@@ preci@@ ate .
"In order to control c@@ lim@@ ate , C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ sions have to liter@@ ally go to z@@ er@@ o because it &apos;s the c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative em@@ is@@ sions that dri@@ ve he@@ ating on the planet ."
This should tell you that we are l@@ os@@ ing the r@@ ace to f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
"The second thing you should not@@ ice is that the b@@ ul@@ k of the grow@@ th comes from the develop@@ ing countries , from China , from India , from the rest of the world , which in@@ clu@@ des S@@ ou@@ th A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a and In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , as most of these countries move their people into the lo@@ wer ran@@ ge of li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ les that we liter@@ ally take for gr@@ an@@ ted in the develop@@ ed world ."
"The fin@@ al thing that you should not@@ ice is that each year , about 10 gi@@ g@@ at@@ ons of car@@ b@@ on are getting ad@@ ded to the planet &apos;s at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , and then diff@@ using into the o@@ ce@@ an and into the land ."
That &apos;s on top of the 5@@ 50 gi@@ g@@ at@@ ons that are in place today .
"A@@ t the end of 30 years , we will have put 8@@ 50 gi@@ g@@ at@@ ons of car@@ b@@ on into the air , and that probably goes a long way to@@ wards loc@@ king in a 2@@ -@@ 4 de@@ gre@@ e C increase in global mean sur@@ face t@@ em@@ per@@ atures , loc@@ king in o@@ ce@@ an ac@@ i@@ di@@ fic@@ ation and loc@@ king in se@@ a level ri@@ se ."
"Now , this is a pro@@ jec@@ tion made by men by the ac@@ tions of society , and it &apos;s ours to change , not to ac@@ cept ."
It &apos;s a fun@@ c@@ tion of their natural res@@ our@@ ces .
It &apos;s a fun@@ c@@ tion of the develop@@ ment pat@@ h that they &apos;ve fol@@ lowed as a society .
It &apos;s a fun@@ c@@ tion of where on the sur@@ face of the planet they are .
"M@@ any , many , many things go into the cho@@ ices of countries , and they each make a different cho@@ ice ."
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing thing that we need to ap@@ preci@@ ate is the cho@@ ice that China has made .
"@@ China has made the cho@@ ice , and will make the cho@@ ice , to run on co@@ al ."
The United States has an al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative .
China has many fe@@ wer cho@@ ices and a much har@@ der row to ho@@ e .
"If you look at China , and you ask yourself why has co@@ al been important to it , you have to remember what China &apos;s done ."
"@@ China br@@ ought people to power , not power to people ."
It didn &apos;t do r@@ ural elec@@ tri@@ fic@@ ation .
It ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zed .
"It ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zed by taking low@@ -@@ c@@ ost l@@ ab@@ or and low@@ -@@ c@@ ost energy , cre@@ ating ex@@ port in@@ du@@ stri@@ es that could fu@@ nd a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amount of grow@@ th ."
"If we look at China &apos;s pat@@ h , all of us know that pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity in China has dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally increas@@ ed ."
"In 19@@ 80 , 80 percent of China &apos;s population li@@ ved b@@ el@@ ow the extre@@ me po@@ ver@@ ty level , b@@ el@@ ow the level of having $ 1@@ .@@ 90 per person per day ."
"R@@ ight now , we &apos;re basically wa@@ iting for a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le ."
"If they can &apos;t make it sa@@ fe , if they can &apos;t make it che@@ ap , it should not be dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ."
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so de@@ e@@ ply em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it wouldn &apos;t oc@@ cu@@ r to any@@ one to question it ."
This is my super@@ market .
"One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never bro@@ ke ."
"We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited vari@@ e@@ ty of ph@@ ones , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ ones ."
Th@@ ese are c@@ ell ph@@ ones of the future .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite is the middle one — the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er , n@@ ose ha@@ ir tri@@ m@@ m@@ er , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e t@@ or@@ ch ."
So par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices .
Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ cal@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
You want bu@@ tt@@ on f@@ ly or z@@ i@@ p@@ per f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed ?
"I had very low , no particular exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ av@@ or ."
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
"W@@ ith a hundred different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no exc@@ use for fa@@ il@@ ure ."
"And so the net res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , and we feel wor@@ se ."
So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
"There is a huge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in happiness , am@@ ong resear@@ ch@@ ers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier .
And my talk today will be m@@ os@@ tly about these cogni@@ tive tr@@ aps .
"This app@@ li@@ es to l@@ ay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ li@@ es to scho@@ lars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these tr@@ aps is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it comple@@ x@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a u@@ se@@ ful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the n@@ oti@@ on of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cogni@@ tive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my l@@ ec@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ solu@@ tely gl@@ ori@@ ous mu@@ sic and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emoti@@ on@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the me@@ mor@@ ies of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous mu@@ sic .
"They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ ined , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experienc@@ ing self , who lives in the present and kno@@ ws the present , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present ."
"It &apos;s the experienc@@ ing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remem@@ b@@ ering self , and the remem@@ b@@ ering self is the one that ke@@ e@@ ps sc@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing l@@ ately ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to A@@ l@@ b@@ ani@@ a ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different enti@@ ties , the experienc@@ ing self and the remem@@ b@@ ering self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the n@@ oti@@ on of happiness ."
"Now , the remem@@ b@@ ering self is a st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er ."
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic respon@@ se of our me@@ mor@@ ies — it star@@ ts im@@ me@@ di@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
They were asked to re@@ port on their p@@ ain every 60 secon@@ ds .
"@@ Here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them suff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suff@@ er@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every minut@@ e of p@@ ain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a surpri@@ se .
The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very cri@@ tical part of the story is how it ends ."
And ne@@ ither of these stories is very insp@@ ir@@ ing or great — but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where p@@ ain was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in t@@ ot@@ al ? &quot;"
"And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in mem@@ ory ."
Now this is a direc@@ t con@@ f@@ lic@@ t between the experienc@@ ing self and the remem@@ b@@ ering self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experienc@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually r@@ an cl@@ in@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ e@@ ping the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much ."
"That will c@@ ause the pati@@ ent to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant mom@@ ents and en@@ d@@ ings ."
"E@@ n@@ d@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding dom@@ in@@ ated ."
"Now , the experienc@@ ing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ously ."
"It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward : They are l@@ ost fore@@ ver .
M@@ ost of them are completely ig@@ no@@ red by the remem@@ b@@ ering self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens d@@ uring these mom@@ ents of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite res@@ our@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be re@@ lev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ b@@ ering self ke@@ e@@ ps for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experienc@@ ing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ b@@ ering self .
The experienc@@ ing self has no v@@ o@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences , we cho@@ ose between me@@ mor@@ ies of experi@@ ences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future norm@@ ally as experi@@ ences ."
We think of our future as an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated me@@ mor@@ ies .
"I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very f@@ requ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ t@@ ent , in the serv@@ ice of our remem@@ b@@ ering self ."
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our me@@ mor@@ ies ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the remem@@ b@@ ering self .
"Now , that is three wee@@ ks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a disc@@ re@@ p@@ anc@@ y .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ sum@@ ing me@@ mor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remember anything ."
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two n@@ oti@@ ons of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experienc@@ ing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experienc@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated process .
What are the emoti@@ ons that can be meas@@ u@@ red ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experienc@@ ing self over time ."
It is about how s@@ atis@@ fied or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ ery different n@@ oti@@ on .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish those n@@ oti@@ ons is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I b@@ el@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of students of well@@ -@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in preci@@ se@@ ly this way ."
"The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happiness of the experienc@@ ing self and the s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ b@@ ering self has been recogni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two se@@ par@@ ately ."
"So in rec@@ ent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the ma@@ in l@@ es@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ J@@ ust to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you m@@ et somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?"
You have that much un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ atis@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like ."
"There are other ple@@ as@@ ures , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well@@ -@@ being .
It is a completely different n@@ oti@@ on .
"Now , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , another reason we cannot think st@@ ra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer ."
"Well , it turns out that c@@ lim@@ ate is not very important to the experienc@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think st@@ ra@@ ight about well@@ -@@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few wee@@ ks ago , you m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ult came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , v@@ ary with income ."
"And it turns out that , b@@ el@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very large s@@ am@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative s@@ am@@ ple — b@@ el@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progres@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ o@@ re@@ r they get ."
"A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ solu@@ tely fl@@ at line ."
I mean I &apos;ve ra@@ re@@ ly seen l@@ ines so fl@@ at .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not bu@@ y you experi@@ ential happiness , but l@@ ack of money cer@@ tain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In ter@@ ms of the other self , the remem@@ b@@ ering self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more s@@ atis@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for emoti@@ ons .
"C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , li@@ ber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took ser@@ i@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th ."
People are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public po@@ lic@@ y .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ ad@@ e or two , part of national st@@ atis@@ tics ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this is@@ sue will — or at le@@ ast should be — the most interesting po@@ lic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a vari@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and o@@ il &apos;s a con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent star@@ ting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but o@@ il &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mark@@ able stuff .
"You take about eight or so car@@ b@@ on at@@ om@@ s , about 20 hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en at@@ om@@ s , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous li@@ qu@@ id : very ener@@ g@@ y-@@ den@@ se and very easy to re@@ fine into a number of very u@@ se@@ ful produc@@ ts and fu@@ els ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of o@@ il out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ c@@ k@@ et ma@@ p of where it &apos;s all loc@@ ated .
A big@@ ger one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the o@@ il in the world ."
G@@ e@@ o@@ logi@@ sts have a pretty good idea of where the o@@ il is .
This is about 100 tr@@ illion g@@ all@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de o@@ il still to be develop@@ ed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about o@@ il , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , o@@ il &apos;s going to last fore@@ ver because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this o@@ il , 1@@ 000 me@@ ters b@@ el@@ ow where you &apos;re all sit@@ ting is one of the lar@@ g@@ est produc@@ ing o@@ il fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ il@@ s if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of o@@ il ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about o@@ il ? Wh@@ ere is it in the energy system ?
"@@ Here &apos;s a little s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of 1@@ 50 years of o@@ il , and it &apos;s been a dom@@ in@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 1@@ 50 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little sec@@ re@@ t I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 2@@ 5 years , o@@ il has been play@@ ing less and less of a ro@@ le in global energy syst@@ ems ."
"There was one kind of pe@@ ak o@@ il in 19@@ 8@@ 5 , when o@@ il re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted 50 percent of global energy sup@@ ply ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been dec@@ l@@ in@@ ing and I believe it will contin@@ ue to dec@@ line .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion in the U.@@ S@@ . probably pe@@ a@@ ked in 200@@ 7 and is dec@@ l@@ in@@ ing .
So o@@ il is play@@ ing a less si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ro@@ le every year .
"And so , 2@@ 5 years ago , there was a pe@@ ak o@@ il ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a pe@@ ak co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a pe@@ ak w@@ ood ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy syst@@ ems .
And what &apos;s been taking up the s@@ l@@ ack in the last few dec@@ ad@@ es ?
"Well , a lot of natural g@@ as and a little bit of n@@ uc@@ lear , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few dec@@ ad@@ es is pe@@ ak g@@ as , and be@@ y@@ on@@ d that , pe@@ ak re@@ ne@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in t@@ ot@@ al isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the deta@@ il@@ s — but there &apos;s a very important mess@@ age here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally dec@@ ar@@ b@@ on@@ i@@ zing our energy system ."
"E@@ ner@@ gy syst@@ ems of the world becom@@ ing progres@@ si@@ vely — year on year , dec@@ ad@@ e on dec@@ ad@@ e , century on century — becom@@ ing less car@@ b@@ on int@@ en@@ se ."
"And that contin@@ ues into the future with the re@@ ne@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develop@@ ing today , re@@ ach@@ ing maybe 30 percent of pri@@ mar@@ y energy by m@@ id century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal re@@ ne@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ y@@ on@@ d .
"What is the future of tru@@ ly su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in cen@@ tr@@ al T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of li@@ me@@ st@@ one .
"I pic@@ ked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ all@@ s , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just li@@ me@@ st@@ one , nothing really speci@@ al about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of ch@@ al@@ k ."
I pic@@ ked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little youn@@ ger .
"And it &apos;s different than this li@@ me@@ st@@ one , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a l@@ ec@@ ture and wr@@ ite on the ch@@ al@@ k@@ bo@@ ard with this ."
"Y@@ eah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
What &apos;s different is how the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ ff the co@@ ast of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ al@@ one sh@@ ell .
"Now , m@@ illions of ab@@ al@@ one every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already gu@@ ess@@ ing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times t@@ ough@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the low@@ ly ab@@ al@@ one is able to l@@ ay down the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ b@@ on@@ ate cr@@ y@@ st@@ als in l@@ ay@@ ers , making this beautiful , i@@ ri@@ des@@ cent mother of pe@@ ar@@ l ."
"@@ V@@ ery speci@@ ali@@ zed material that the ab@@ al@@ one self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ es , m@@ illions of ab@@ al@@ one , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredi@@ ble stuff .
"A@@ ll the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll su@@ gg@@ est that this co@@ al is about as exc@@ iting as this ch@@ al@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about fu@@ els or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps no@@ v@@ el materi@@ als for b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies or fu@@ el cells , nature ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t ever built those per@@ f@@ ect materi@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"@@ N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ al@@ one sh@@ ell , the survi@@ v@@ al of a spec@@ ies didn &apos;t dep@@ end on building those materi@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ing the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es differ@@ ently ."
And so that is my story .
The o@@ il will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a b@@ a@@ j@@ illion w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ills .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people inv@@ en@@ ted ideas — they had ideas , in@@ no@@ v@@ ations , technology — and the St@@ one A@@ ge en@@ ded , not because we r@@ an out of st@@ ones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of o@@ il , long before we run out of o@@ il ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"It &apos;s like a co@@ in f@@ li@@ p ; it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , really ."
This is the way we treat people as respon@@ sible ad@@ ults .
And I think some people may have mis@@ underst@@ ood .
That &apos;s the way evolution works .
"Now , maybe we want to treat it as me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical ."
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both chall@@ eng@@ ed and exc@@ ited .
My exc@@ it@@ ement is : I get a chan@@ ce to give something back .
My chall@@ en@@ ge is : the sh@@ or@@ test se@@ min@@ ar I u@@ su@@ ally do is 50 hours .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;m not ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ating . I do wee@@ k@@ ends — I do more , ob@@ vi@@ ously , I also co@@ ach people — but I &apos;m into im@@ mer@@ sion , because how did you learn language ?"
"@@ Not just by learning prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es , you got in it and you did it so often that it bec@@ ame real ."
"The bot@@ tom line of why I &apos;m here , b@@ es@@ i@@ des being a crazy mo@@ f@@ o , is that — I &apos;m not here to moti@@ v@@ ate you , you don &apos;t need that , ob@@ vi@@ ously ."
"O@@ f@@ ten that &apos;s what people think I do , and it &apos;s the f@@ ur@@ the@@ st thing from it ."
"What happens , though , is people say to me , &quot; I don &apos;t need any moti@@ v@@ ation . &quot;"
But that &apos;s not what I do .
I &apos;m the &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; guy .
I want to know why you do what you do .
What is your moti@@ ve for action ?
What is it that dri@@ ves you in your life today ? Not 10 years ago .
A@@ re you run@@ ning the same patter@@ n ?
"Because I believe that the in@@ vi@@ sible force of inter@@ n@@ al dri@@ ve , acti@@ v@@ ated , is the most important thing ."
I &apos;m here because I believe emoti@@ on is the force of life .
A@@ ll of us here have great min@@ ds .
"M@@ ost of us here have great min@@ ds , right ?"
We all know how to think .
W@@ ith our min@@ ds we can r@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ ze anything .
We can make anything happen .
"I ag@@ ree with what was descri@@ bed a few days ago , that people work in their self-@@ inter@@ est ."
But we know that that &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ sh@@ it at times .
"You don &apos;t work in your self-@@ inter@@ est all the time , because when emoti@@ on comes into it , the w@@ ir@@ ing changes in the way it fun@@ c@@ tions ."
"So it &apos;s wonderful to think int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually about how the life of the world is , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally those who are very smar@@ t can play this g@@ ame in our head ."
But I really want to know what &apos;s dri@@ ving you .
One : so that you can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te more .
I &apos;ve got to do something right now or nothing mat@@ ters .
"I get the ph@@ one call when the child is going to comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de , I &apos;ve got to do something ."
"In 2@@ 9 years , I &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful to tell you I &apos;ve never l@@ ost one ."
"When I get those call@@ s about per@@ form@@ ance , that &apos;s one thing ."
How do you make a change ?
"I &apos;m also looking to see what is shap@@ ing the person &apos;s ability to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te , to do something be@@ y@@ on@@ d themselves ."
"M@@ ay@@ be the real question is , I look at life and say there &apos;s two ma@@ ster l@@ ess@@ ons ."
"One is : there &apos;s the science of achi@@ ev@@ ement , which almost everyone here has ma@@ st@@ er@@ ed ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ly ."
"&quot; How do you take the in@@ vi@@ sible and make it vi@@ sible , &quot; How do you make your dre@@ ams happen ?"
"O@@ n@@ ce you know the g@@ ame , you just up the an@@ te , don &apos;t you ?"
But when it comes to ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment — that &apos;s an art .
"The reason is , it &apos;s about ap@@ preci@@ ation and con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion ."
You can only feel so much by yourself .
I &apos;ve had an interesting l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to try to answer the real question how somebody &apos;s life changes if you look at them like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ?
L@@ i@@ ke all the res@@ our@@ ces they say they need .
"You gave not a 1@@ 00-@@ dol@@ l@@ ar computer , but the best computer ."
"You gave them love , jo@@ y , were there to com@@ for@@ t them ."
What is it that shap@@ es us ?
We live in a ther@@ ap@@ y culture .
"And you wouldn &apos;t be in this room if you b@@ ought that , but most of society thin@@ ks bio@@ grap@@ h@@ y is dest@@ iny ."
O@@ f course it does if you live there .
We &apos;ve got to re@@ mind ourselves that deci@@ sion is the ul@@ tim@@ ate power .
"When you ask people , have you fa@@ il@@ ed to achi@@ e@@ ve something si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant in your life ?"
"S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ y@@ e ."
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ e@@ ve something ?"
"S@@ ome@@ body who &apos;s working for you , or a par@@ t@@ ner , or even yourself ."
"When you fa@@ il to achi@@ e@@ ve , what &apos;s the reason people say ?"
What do they tell you ?
"D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t have the knowledge , didn &apos;t have the money , didn &apos;t have the time , didn &apos;t have the technology ."
I didn &apos;t have the right man@@ ag@@ er .
A@@ l G@@ ore : Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t . T@@ R : The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( C@@ he@@ ering ) ( Applause contin@@ ues ) T@@ R : And — ( Applause ) What do all those , in@@ clu@@ ding the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , have in common ? ( Laughter )"
"They are a cl@@ a@@ i@@ m to you mis@@ sing res@@ our@@ ces , and they may be ac@@ cur@@ ate ."
"You may not have the money , or the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , but that is not the defin@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ rec@@ t me if I &apos;m wrong .
The defin@@ ing fac@@ tor is never res@@ our@@ ces ; it &apos;s res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
"And what I mean speci@@ f@@ ically , rather than just some ph@@ ra@@ se , is if you have emoti@@ on , human emoti@@ on , something that I experienc@@ ed from you the day before y@@ est@@ er@@ day at a level that is as pro@@ found as I &apos;ve ever experienc@@ ed and I believe with that emoti@@ on you would have be@@ at his ass and won ."
A@@ u@@ dience : Y@@ eah !
( Applause ) ( C@@ he@@ ering ) How easy for me to tell him what he should do .
"But I know when we wat@@ ched the de@@ b@@ ate at that time , there were emoti@@ ons that bloc@@ ked people &apos;s ability to get this man &apos;s int@@ ell@@ ect and cap@@ ac@@ ity ."
But there was emoti@@ on there .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
"S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ y@@ e ."
"T@@ R : So , emoti@@ on is it ."
"And if we get the right emoti@@ on , we can get ourselves to do anything ."
"If you &apos;re cre@@ ative , play@@ ful , fu@@ n enough , can you get through to any@@ body , y@@ es or no ?"
"He &apos;s bro@@ ken my patter@@ n , that s@@ on@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ b@@ it@@ ch ."
"( Laughter ) But I ap@@ preci@@ ated the energy , I &apos;ll tell you that . ( Laughter )"
What de@@ ter@@ min@@ es your res@@ our@@ ces ?
"If deci@@ sions shap@@ e dest@@ iny , what de@@ ter@@ min@@ es it is three deci@@ sions ."
What will you fo@@ c@@ us on ?
You have to deci@@ de what you &apos;re going to fo@@ c@@ us on .
Con@@ sci@@ ously or un@@ conscious@@ ly .
"@@ the minut@@ e you deci@@ de to fo@@ c@@ us , you must give it a mean@@ ing , and that mean@@ ing produc@@ es emoti@@ on ."
I@@ s this the end or the beginning ?
"I@@ s G@@ od p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ing me or re@@ war@@ ding me , or is this the ro@@ ll of the di@@ ce ?"
"A@@ n emoti@@ on cre@@ ates what we &apos;re going to do , or the action ."
But what was his deci@@ sion of what to fo@@ c@@ us on ?
D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent than most people . What did it mean ?
It wasn &apos;t the end ; it was the beginning .
"He goes off and w@@ ins se@@ ven cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on@@ shi@@ ps he never once won before the cancer , because he got emoti@@ onal f@@ it@@ ness , psycho@@ logical stre@@ ng@@ th ."
That &apos;s the difference in human be@@ ings that I &apos;ve seen of the three million I &apos;ve been around .
"In my la@@ b , I &apos;ve had three million people from 80 countries over the last 2@@ 9 years ."
"And after a while , patterns become ob@@ vi@@ ous ."
"You see that S@@ ou@@ th America and A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a may be connec@@ ted in a certain way , right ?"
"O@@ thers say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , that s@@ ounds ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s simple ."
"So , what shap@@ ed L@@ ance ? What shap@@ es you ?"
T@@ w@@ o in@@ vi@@ sible for@@ ces . V@@ ery qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly . One : state .
"We all have had times , you did something , and after , you thought to yourself , &quot; I can &apos;t believe I said or did that , that was so stu@@ p@@ id . &quot;"
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ y@@ e ."
"O@@ r after you did something , you go , &quot; &quot; That was me ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t your ability ; it was your state ."
Y@@ our mo@@ de@@ l of the world is what shap@@ es you long ter@@ m .
Y@@ our mo@@ de@@ l of the world is the f@@ il@@ ter . That &apos;s what &apos;s shap@@ ing us .
It makes people make deci@@ sions .
"T@@ o in@@ flu@@ ence somebody , we need to know what already in@@ flu@@ ences them ."
It &apos;s made up of three parts .
"Wh@@ o has ever got a go@@ al or des@@ ire and thought , is this all there is ?"
"S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ y@@ e ."
It &apos;s nee@@ ds we have . I believe there are six human nee@@ ds .
"S@@ econ@@ d , once you know what the t@@ ar@@ get that &apos;s dri@@ ving you is and you un@@ co@@ ver it for the tru@@ th — you don &apos;t form it — then you find out what &apos;s your ma@@ p , what &apos;s the belie@@ f syst@@ ems that tell you how to get those nee@@ ds ."
Con@@ tro@@ l everybody ? D@@ ev@@ el@@ op a sk@@ ill ? G@@ i@@ ve up ? S@@ mo@@ ke a ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e ?
"And if you got t@@ ot@@ ally certain , ir@@ on@@ ically , even though we need that — you &apos;re not certain about your health , or your children , or money ."
"If you &apos;re not sure the ce@@ il@@ ing will hold up , you won &apos;t li@@ st@@ en to any spe@@ a@@ ker ."
"Wh@@ ile we go for cer@@ tain@@ ty differ@@ ently , if we get t@@ ot@@ al cer@@ tain@@ ty , we get what ?"
"You know what will happen , when and how it will happen , what would you feel ?"
"B@@ o@@ red out of your min@@ ds . So , G@@ od , in H@@ er in@@ fin@@ ite w@@ is@@ dom , gave us a second human need , which is un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
We need vari@@ e@@ ty . We need surpri@@ se .
"@@ How many of you here love surpri@@ ses ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ y@@ e . &quot; &quot; A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ y@@ e ."
T@@ R : B@@ ul@@ l@@ sh@@ it . You like the surpri@@ ses you want .
H@@ ave you ever ren@@ ted a vide@@ o or a f@@ il@@ m that you &apos;ve already seen ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s done this ? G@@ et a f@@ uc@@ king life .
Wh@@ at@@ ever it ta@@ kes .
"If I put a gu@@ n to your head and I live in the &apos; ho@@ od , inst@@ an@@ tly I &apos;m si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ."
Z@@ er@@ o to 10 . How high ? 10 .
How certain am I that you &apos;re going to respon@@ d to me ? 10 .
How much un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
Wh@@ o kno@@ ws what &apos;s going to happen next ? K@@ ind of exc@@ iting .
L@@ i@@ ke c@@ lim@@ b@@ ing up into a c@@ ave and doing that stuff all the way down there .
T@@ ot@@ al vari@@ e@@ ty and un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"And it &apos;s si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , isn &apos;t it ? So you want to ri@@ s@@ k your life for it ."
So that &apos;s why violence has always been around and will be around un@@ less we have a consciousness change as a spec@@ ies .
"You can get si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance a million ways , but to be si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , you &apos;ve got to be uni@@ qu@@ e and different ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what we really need : connec@@ tion and love , f@@ our@@ th need ."
Wh@@ o here has been h@@ ur@@ t in an in@@ tim@@ ate relation@@ ship ?
"If you don &apos;t ra@@ ise your hand , you &apos;ve had other sh@@ it , too ."
And you &apos;re going to get h@@ ur@@ t again .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you gl@@ ad you came to this posi@@ tive vi@@ s@@ it ?
Here &apos;s what &apos;s true : we need it .
"We can do it through in@@ tim@@ acy , fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship , p@@ ra@@ y@@ er , through wal@@ king in nature ."
"If nothing else works for you , don &apos;t get a c@@ at , get a do@@ g , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been g@@ one six months , when you come back 5 minutes later ."
"Th@@ ese first four nee@@ ds , every human fin@@ ds a way to me@@ et ."
"E@@ ven if you li@@ e to yourself , you need to have sp@@ li@@ t pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties ."
I call the first four nee@@ ds the nee@@ ds of the pers@@ on@@ ality .
The last two are the nee@@ ds of the sp@@ ir@@ it .
And this is where ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment comes .
You won &apos;t get it from the first four .
"You &apos;ll fig@@ ure a way , s@@ mo@@ ke , dr@@ ink , do wh@@ at@@ ever , me@@ et the first four ."
"But number five , you must grow ."
"If you don &apos;t grow , you &apos;re what ?"
"If a relation@@ ship or business is not gro@@ wing , if you &apos;re not gro@@ wing , doesn &apos;t matter how much money or friends you have , how many love you , you feel like h@@ ell ."
Because the si@@ x@@ th need is to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te be@@ y@@ on@@ d ourselves .
"Because we all know , cor@@ n@@ y as that s@@ ounds , the sec@@ re@@ t to living is giving ."
"We all know life is not about me , it &apos;s about we ."
"This culture kno@@ ws that , this room kno@@ ws that ."
"You can feel the difference in him , and it &apos;s beautiful ."
And that call@@ ing can tou@@ ch other people .
"M@@ y life was tou@@ ched because when I was 11 years old , Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , no money , no food , we were not going to star@@ ve , but my father was t@@ ot@@ ally mess@@ ed up , my mo@@ m was le@@ tting him know how bad he mess@@ ed up , and somebody came to the do@@ or and de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed food ."
"M@@ y father made three deci@@ sions , I know what they were , bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly ."
H@@ is fo@@ c@@ us was &quot; &quot; This is char@@ ity .
What does it mean ? I &apos;m wor@@ th@@ less .
"What do I have to do ? L@@ e@@ ave my family , &quot; &quot; which he did ."
It was one of the most pain@@ ful experi@@ ences of life .
My three deci@@ sions gave me a different pat@@ h .
I set fo@@ c@@ us on &quot; &quot; There &apos;s food . &quot; &quot; What a con@@ cept !
"( Laughter ) But this is what changed my life , shap@@ ed me as a human being ."
"S@@ ome@@ body &apos;s gi@@ ft , I don &apos;t even know who it is ."
"M@@ y father always said , &quot; &quot; No one gi@@ ves a sh@@ it . &quot; &quot; And now somebody I don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not as@@ king for anything , just giving us food , looking out for us ."
It made me believe this : that str@@ ang@@ ers care .
"And that made me deci@@ de , if str@@ ang@@ ers care about me and my family , I care about them ."
I &apos;m going to do something to make a difference .
"So when I was 1@@ 7 , I went out on Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , it was my t@@ ar@@ get for years to have enough money to fe@@ ed two fam@@ ili@@ es ."
The most fu@@ n and mo@@ ving thing I ever did in my life .
"@@ N@@ ex@@ t year , I did four , then eight ."
"I didn &apos;t tell any@@ body what I was doing , I wasn &apos;t doing it for bro@@ w@@ ni@@ e poin@@ ts ."
"But after eight , I thought I could use some help ."
"So I went out , got my friends inv@@ ol@@ ved , then I gre@@ w comp@@ an@@ ies , got 11 , and I built the f@@ ound@@ ation ."
"@@ 18 years later , I &apos;m pr@@ ou@@ d to tell you last year we f@@ ed 2 million people in 3@@ 5 countries through our f@@ ound@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll d@@ uring the ho@@ li@@ days , Th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , in different countries around the world ."
( Applause ) Thank you .
"I don &apos;t tell you that to bra@@ g , but because I &apos;m pr@@ ou@@ d of human be@@ ings because they get exc@@ ited to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te once they &apos;ve had the chan@@ ce to experience it , not talk about it ."
"So , fin@@ ally — I &apos;m about out of time ."
The t@@ ar@@ get that shap@@ es you — Here &apos;s what &apos;s different about people .
We have the same nee@@ ds .
"But are you a cer@@ tain@@ ty f@@ re@@ ak , is that what you value most , or un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?"
This man couldn &apos;t be a cer@@ tain@@ ty f@@ re@@ ak if he c@@ lim@@ bed through those c@@ a@@ ves .
A@@ re you dri@@ ven by si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance or love ?
"And as you move in a direc@@ tion , you have a dest@@ in@@ ation or dest@@ iny ."
They want to h@@ on@@ or G@@ od or h@@ on@@ or their family .
The last piece is emoti@@ on .
One of the parts of the ma@@ p is like time .
S@@ ome people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years .
"S@@ ome@@ body else &apos;s is three secon@@ ds , which is what I have ."
And the last one I &apos;ve already m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed that f@@ ell to you .
You use this thing and you don &apos;t get there .
I@@ mag@@ ine if your belie@@ f@@ s gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e you can never get to where you want to go .
( Laughter ) The last thing is emoti@@ on .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;ll tell you about emoti@@ on .
"There are 6@@ ,000 emoti@@ ons that we have words for in the English language , which is just a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation that changes by language ."
"But if your dom@@ in@@ ant emoti@@ ons — If I have 20@@ ,000 people or 1@@ ,000 and I have them wr@@ ite down all the emoti@@ ons that they experience in an average week , and I give them as long as they need , and on one side they wr@@ ite em@@ po@@ w@@ ering emoti@@ ons , the other &apos;s dise@@ m@@ po@@ w@@ ering , gu@@ ess how many emoti@@ ons they experience ? L@@ ess than 12 ."
And half of those make them feel like sh@@ it .
They have six good feel@@ ings .
"H@@ app@@ y , happy , exc@@ ited , o@@ h sh@@ it , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed , depres@@ sed ."
"@@ How many of you know somebody who , no matter what happens , fin@@ ds a way to get p@@ is@@ sed off ?"
"( Laughter ) O@@ r no matter what happens , they find a way to be happy or exc@@ ited ."
How many of you know somebody like this ?
"When 9 / 11 happened , I &apos;ll fin@@ ish with this , I was in H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i ."
"I got up , had no pl@@ an for this , and I said — we had fi@@ re@@ works , I do crazy sh@@ it , fu@@ n stuff , and at the end , I st@@ op@@ ped ."
"I had this pl@@ an , but I never know what I &apos;m going to say ."
"And all of a su@@ dd@@ en , I said , &quot; Wh@@ en do people really start to live ? Wh@@ en they face death . &quot;"
"And I went through this whole thing about , if you wer@@ en &apos;t going to get off this is@@ land , if n@@ ine days from now , you were going to die , who would you call , what would you say , what would you do ?"
That night is when 9 / 11 happened .
"One woman had come to the se@@ min@@ ar , and when she came there , her pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end had been ki@@ d@@ n@@ app@@ ed and m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed ."
"H@@ er new bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end wanted to mar@@ ry her , and she said no ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; If you go to that H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i thing , it &apos;s over with us . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I fin@@ i@@ shed that night , she called him and left a mess@@ age at the top of the W@@ or@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter where he worked , saying , &quot; &quot; I love you , I want you to know I want to mar@@ ry you ."
"It was stu@@ p@@ id of me . &quot; &quot; She was as@@ le@@ ep , because it was 3 a@@ .@@ m@@ . for us , when he called her back , and said , &quot; &quot; H@@ on@@ ey , I can &apos;t tell you what this means ."
"I don &apos;t know how to tell you this , but you gave me the gre@@ at@@ est gi@@ ft , because I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; And she play@@ ed the rec@@ or@@ ding for us in the room ."
She was on L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing later .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re probably wonder@@ ing how on Earth this could happen to you tw@@ ice ."
A@@ ll I can say is this must be G@@ od &apos;s mess@@ age to you .
"F@@ rom now on , every day , give your all , love your all ."
"D@@ on &apos;t let anything ever stop you . &quot; &quot; She fin@@ i@@ sh@@ es , and a man st@@ ands up , and he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an , I &apos;m a M@@ us@@ li@@ m ."
"I &apos;d love to hold your hand and say I &apos;m sor@@ ry , but fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , this is re@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you the rest , because I &apos;m out of time ."

"One fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al tr@@ ad@@ er , woman made of ste@@ el , b@@ aw@@ ling — 30 friends cr@@ os@@ sing off that all died ."

"What does this mean and what are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; And I got the group to fo@@ c@@ us on : if you didn &apos;t l@@ ose somebody today , your fo@@ c@@ us is going to be how to ser@@ ve somebody else ."

Now I want to share with you three things I learned about my@@ self that day .
"In my own hum@@ an@@ ity and mi@@ sta@@ kes , I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to get better at everything I tri@@ ed ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
There &apos;s something that I &apos;d like you to see .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) R@@ e@@ por@@ ter : It &apos;s a story that &apos;s de@@ e@@ ply un@@ se@@ tt@@ led m@@ illions in China : fo@@ ot@@ age of a tw@@ o@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old gir@@ l h@@ it by a v@@ an and left b@@ le@@ e@@ ding in the stre@@ et by p@@ as@@ ser@@ s@@ by , fo@@ ot@@ age too grap@@ hi@@ c to be sho@@ wn ."
The enti@@ re ac@@ ci@@ dent is cau@@ ght on cam@@ er@@ a .
"The dri@@ ver p@@ au@@ ses after h@@ it@@ ting the child , his back whe@@ els seen re@@ st@@ ing on her for over a second ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in two minutes , three people p@@ ass tw@@ o@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old W@@ ang Y@@ ue by ."
The first wal@@ ks around the b@@ ad@@ ly in@@ ju@@ red to@@ dd@@ l@@ er completely .
O@@ thers look at her before mo@@ ving off .
"S@@ he was ru@@ shed to h@@ osp@@ ital , but it was too l@@ ate . She died ."
"I won@@ der how many of you , looking at that , said to your@@ selves just now , &quot; &quot; I would not have done that ."
I would have st@@ op@@ ped to help . &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands if that thought oc@@ cur@@ red to you .
"As I thought , that &apos;s most of you ."
"But before you give yourself too much cre@@ d@@ it , look at this ."
"@@ U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F re@@ por@@ ts that in 20@@ 11 , 6@@ .@@ 9 million children under five died from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able , po@@ ver@@ t@@ y-@@ rel@@ ated dise@@ ases ."
U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F thin@@ ks that that &apos;s good news because the fig@@ ure has been ste@@ a@@ di@@ ly coming down from 12 million in 19@@ 90 . That is good .
"But still , 6@@ .@@ 9 million is 19@@ ,000 children d@@ ying every day ."
D@@ o@@ es it really matter that we &apos;re not wal@@ king past them in the stre@@ et ?
D@@ o@@ es it really matter that they &apos;re far away ?
I don &apos;t think it does make a mor@@ ally re@@ lev@@ ant difference .
"The fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different n@@ ati@@ on@@ ality or r@@ ace , n@@ one of that seems mor@@ ally re@@ lev@@ ant to me ."
"What is really important is , can we re@@ duce that death t@@ ol@@ l ? C@@ an we sa@@ ve some of those 19@@ ,000 children d@@ ying every day ?"
"And the answer is , y@@ es we can ."
E@@ ach of us sp@@ ends money on things that we do not really need .
"You can think what your own ha@@ bit is , whether it &apos;s a new c@@ ar , a v@@ ac@@ ation or just something like bu@@ ying bot@@ t@@ led water when the water that comes out of the ta@@ p is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly sa@@ fe to dr@@ ink ."
"You could take the money you &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding on those un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary things and give it to this organi@@ zation , the A@@ g@@ ainst M@@ al@@ ari@@ a F@@ ound@@ ation , which would take the money you had given and use it to bu@@ y ne@@ ts like this one to prot@@ ect children like this one , and we know reli@@ ably that if we pro@@ vi@@ de ne@@ ts , they &apos;re used , and they re@@ duce the number of children d@@ ying from m@@ al@@ ari@@ a , just one of the many pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able dise@@ ases that are respon@@ sible for some of those 19@@ ,000 children d@@ ying every day ."
"F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ately , more and more people are understanding this idea , and the res@@ ult is a gro@@ wing mov@@ ement : effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ism ."
It &apos;s important because it com@@ b@@ ines both the heart and the head .
"The heart , of course , you f@@ el@@ t ."
You f@@ el@@ t the emp@@ ath@@ y for that child .
"But it &apos;s really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effec@@ tive and well@@ -@@ direc@@ ted , and not only that , but also I think reason hel@@ ps us to understand that other people , wh@@ er@@ ever they are , are like us , that they can suff@@ er as we can , that parents g@@ ri@@ e@@ ve for the de@@ a@@ ths of their children , as we do , and that just as our lives and our well@@ -@@ being matter to us , it mat@@ ters just as much to all of these people ."
So I think reason is not just some ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al to@@ ol to help you get wh@@ at@@ ever you want .
It does help us to put per@@ spec@@ tive on our sit@@ u@@ ation .
And I think that &apos;s why many of the most si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant people in effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ism have been people who have had bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ounds in philosop@@ h@@ y or econom@@ ics or mat@@ h .
"And that might seem surpri@@ sing , because a lot of people think , &quot; &quot; P@@ h@@ il@@ osop@@ h@@ y is re@@ m@@ ote from the real world ; econom@@ ics , we &apos;re told , just makes us more self@@ ish , and we know that mat@@ h is for ner@@ ds . &quot; &quot; But in fact it does make a difference , and in fact there &apos;s one particular ner@@ d who has been a partic@@ ul@@ arly effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ist because he got this ."
"This is the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite of the B@@ ill &@@ am@@ p@@ ; M@@ el@@ in@@ d@@ a G@@ ates F@@ ound@@ ation , and if you look at the words on the top ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side , it says , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll lives have equ@@ al value . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the understanding , the r@@ ational understanding of our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world that has led to these people being the most effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ists in history , B@@ ill and M@@ el@@ in@@ d@@ a G@@ ates and W@@ ar@@ re@@ n B@@ u@@ ff@@ et@@ t ."
"( Applause ) No one , not A@@ n@@ dre@@ w C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e , not J@@ o@@ h@@ n D@@ . R@@ oc@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er , has ever given as much to char@@ ity as each one of these three , and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is high@@ ly effec@@ tive ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to one es@@ tim@@ ate , the G@@ ates F@@ ound@@ ation has already sa@@ ved 5@@ .@@ 8 million lives and many m@@ illions more , people , getting dise@@ ases that would have made them very s@@ ick , even if even@@ tually they survi@@ ved ."
"O@@ ver the coming years , und@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ably the G@@ ates F@@ ound@@ ation is going to give a lot more , is going to sa@@ ve a lot more lives ."
"Well , you might say , that &apos;s fine if you &apos;re a b@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ ire , you can have that kind of imp@@ act ."
"But if I &apos;m not , what can I do ?"
So I &apos;m going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe st@@ and in the way of them giving .
They wor@@ ry how much of a difference they can make .
"He bec@@ ame an effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ist when he cal@@ cul@@ ated that with the money that he was likely to ear@@ n thr@@ ough@@ out his care@@ er , an ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c care@@ er , he could give enough to c@@ ure 8@@ 0,000 people of bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness in develop@@ ing countries and still have enough left for a per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate st@@ and@@ ard of living ."
T@@ o@@ by h@@ im@@ self does better than that .
"He &apos;s ple@@ d@@ g@@ ed to live on 18@@ ,000 p@@ ounds a year — that &apos;s less than 3@@ 0,000 dollars — and to give the rest to those organi@@ z@@ ations ."
"And y@@ es , T@@ o@@ by is marri@@ ed and he does have a mor@@ t@@ g@@ age ."
"And then , as they got to the age at which many people start to think of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , they re@@ tur@@ ned to them , and they &apos;ve decided to c@@ ut back on their sp@@ en@@ ding , to live mo@@ dest@@ ly , and to give both money and time to hel@@ ping to fi@@ ght global po@@ ver@@ ty ."
"Now , m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing time might le@@ ad you to think , &quot; &quot; Well , should I ab@@ an@@ don my care@@ er and put all of my time into sa@@ ving some of these 19@@ ,000 lives that are l@@ ost every day ? &quot; &quot; One person who &apos;s thought quite a bit about this is@@ sue of how you can have a care@@ er that will have the bi@@ gg@@ est imp@@ act for good in the world is W@@ ill C@@ r@@ ou@@ ch ."
"He &apos;s a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent in philosop@@ h@@ y , and he &apos;s set up a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite called 8@@ 0,000 H@@ ours , the number of hours he es@@ tim@@ ates most people sp@@ end on their care@@ er , to ad@@ vi@@ se people on how to have the best , most effec@@ tive care@@ er ."
"But you might be surpri@@ sed to know that one of the care@@ ers that he enc@@ our@@ ages people to consi@@ der , if they have the right abili@@ ties and char@@ ac@@ ter , is to go into b@@ an@@ king or fin@@ ance ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because if you ear@@ n a lot of money , you can give away a lot of money , and if you &apos;re suc@@ cess@@ ful in that care@@ er , you could give enough to an a@@ id organi@@ zation so that it could emp@@ lo@@ y , let &apos;s say , five a@@ id wor@@ k@@ ers in develop@@ ing countries , and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done ."
Here &apos;s one young man who &apos;s taken this adv@@ ice .
H@@ is name is M@@ at@@ t W@@ e@@ i@@ ger .
"He was a stud@@ ent at P@@ r@@ in@@ ce@@ t@@ on in philosop@@ h@@ y and mat@@ h , actually won the pri@@ ze for the best under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate philosop@@ h@@ y the@@ s@@ is last year when he gra@@ du@@ ated ."
But he &apos;s g@@ one into fin@@ ance in New Y@@ or@@ k .
He &apos;s already ear@@ ning enough so that he &apos;s giving a si@@ x@@ -@@ fig@@ ure su@@ m to effec@@ tive ch@@ ari@@ ties and still le@@ a@@ ving h@@ im@@ self with enough to live on .
"M@@ at@@ t has also hel@@ ped me to set up an organi@@ zation that I &apos;m working with that has the name taken from the ti@@ t@@ le of a book I wr@@ ote , &quot; The L@@ i@@ fe You C@@ an S@@ ave , &quot; which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we &apos;re going to live an e@@ th@@ ical life , it &apos;s not enough just to fol@@ low the th@@ ou@@ -@@ sh@@ al@@ t-@@ n@@ ots and not che@@ at , ste@@ al , ma@@ i@@ m , k@@ ill , but that if we have enough , we have to share some of that with people who have so little ."
"And the organi@@ zation d@@ ra@@ ws together people of different gener@@ ations , like H@@ ol@@ ly M@@ org@@ an , who &apos;s an under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate , who &apos;s ple@@ d@@ g@@ ed to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has , and on the right , A@@ d@@ a W@@ an , who has worked direc@@ tly for the po@@ or , but has now g@@ one to Y@@ ale to do an M@@ B@@ A to have more to give ."
"M@@ any people will think , though , that ch@@ ari@@ ties are@@ n &apos;t really all that effec@@ tive ."
So let &apos;s talk about effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
"T@@ o@@ by O@@ r@@ d is very con@@ cer@@ ned about this , and he &apos;s cal@@ cul@@ ated that some ch@@ ari@@ ties are hund@@ re@@ ds or even thousands of times more effec@@ tive than others , so it &apos;s very important to find the effec@@ tive ones ."
"T@@ a@@ ke , for example , pro@@ vi@@ ding a gu@@ i@@ de do@@ g for a bl@@ ind person ."
"That &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?"
"Well , right , it is a good thing to do , but you have to think what else you could do with the res@@ our@@ ces ."
It cos@@ ts some@@ where between 20 and 50 dollars to c@@ ure a bl@@ ind person in a develop@@ ing country if they have tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a .
"So you do the su@@ ms , and you get something like that ."
"You could pro@@ vi@@ de one gu@@ i@@ de do@@ g for one bl@@ ind American , or you could c@@ ure between 4@@ 00 and 2@@ ,000 people of bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness ."
I think it &apos;s c@@ lear what &apos;s the better thing to do .
"But if you want to look for effec@@ tive ch@@ ari@@ ties , this is a good we@@ b@@ s@@ ite to go to ."
"@@ G@@ i@@ ve@@ Well ex@@ ists to really ass@@ ess the imp@@ act of ch@@ ari@@ ties , not just whether they &apos;re well@@ -@@ run , and it &apos;s scre@@ en@@ ed hund@@ re@@ ds of ch@@ ari@@ ties and curren@@ tly is re@@ comm@@ en@@ ding only three , of which the A@@ g@@ ainst M@@ al@@ ari@@ a F@@ ound@@ ation is number one ."
"So it &apos;s very t@@ ough . If you want to look for other re@@ comm@@ en@@ d@@ ations , the@@ li@@ fe@@ y@@ ou@@ can@@ sa@@ ve@@ .@@ co@@ m and G@@ i@@ ving What We C@@ an both have a some@@ what bro@@ ad@@ er li@@ st , but you can find effec@@ tive organi@@ z@@ ations , and not just in the are@@ a of sa@@ ving lives from the po@@ or ."
I &apos;m ple@@ as@@ ed to say that there is now also a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite looking at effec@@ tive anim@@ al organi@@ z@@ ations .
"That &apos;s another c@@ ause that I &apos;ve been con@@ cer@@ ned about all my life , the im@@ men@@ se amount of suff@@ ering that hum@@ ans in@@ f@@ lic@@ t on liter@@ ally ten@@ s of b@@ illions of anim@@ als every year ."
"So if you want to look for effec@@ tive organi@@ z@@ ations to re@@ duce that suff@@ ering , you can go to E@@ ff@@ ec@@ tive A@@ n@@ im@@ al A@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ s@@ m ."
And some effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ists think it &apos;s very important to make sure that our spec@@ ies survi@@ ves at all .
So they &apos;re looking at ways to re@@ duce the ri@@ s@@ k of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion .
"@@ Here &apos;s one ri@@ s@@ k of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion that we all bec@@ ame aw@@ are of rec@@ ently , when an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id p@@ ass@@ ed cl@@ ose to our planet ."
"@@ P@@ os@@ si@@ bly resear@@ ch could help us not only to predic@@ t the pat@@ h of ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds that might col@@ li@@ de with us , but actually to de@@ fl@@ ect them ."
So some people think that would be a good thing to give to .
There &apos;s many possi@@ bili@@ ties .
"M@@ y fin@@ al question is , some people will think it &apos;s a bur@@ d@@ en to give ."
I don &apos;t really believe it is .
I &apos;ve en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed giving all of my life since I was a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
It &apos;s been something ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing to me .
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e B@@ res@@ l@@ er said to me that he &apos;s not an al@@ tru@@ ist .
He thin@@ ks that the life he &apos;s sa@@ ving is his own .
"And H@@ ol@@ ly M@@ org@@ an told me that she used to b@@ att@@ le depres@@ sion until she got inv@@ ol@@ ved with effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ism , and now is one of the happ@@ i@@ est people she kno@@ ws ."
I think one of the reas@@ ons for this is that being an effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ist hel@@ ps to over@@ come what I call the S@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us problem .
"@@ Here &apos;s S@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us as por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed by T@@ i@@ ti@@ an , con@@ de@@ m@@ ned by the go@@ ds to p@@ us@@ h a huge b@@ oul@@ der up to the top of the h@@ ill ."
"@@ J@@ ust as he gets there , the eff@@ ort becom@@ es too much , the b@@ oul@@ der es@@ cap@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ls all the way down the h@@ ill , he has to tru@@ dge back down to p@@ us@@ h it up again , and the same thing happens again and again for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity ."
"D@@ o@@ es that re@@ mind you of a con@@ sum@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le , where you work hard to get money , you sp@@ end that money on con@@ sum@@ er go@@ o@@ ds which you hope you &apos;ll en@@ jo@@ y using ?"
"But then the money &apos;s g@@ one , you have to work hard to get more , sp@@ end more , and to ma@@ in@@ tain the same level of happiness , it &apos;s kind of a he@@ d@@ on@@ ic tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ill ."
"You never get off , and you never really feel s@@ atis@@ fied ."
Bec@@ om@@ ing an effec@@ tive al@@ tru@@ ist gi@@ ves you that mean@@ ing and ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment .
It en@@ ab@@ les you to have a so@@ li@@ d bas@@ is for self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m on which you can feel your life was really wor@@ th living .
I &apos;m going to con@@ clu@@ de by t@@ elling you about an e@@ ma@@ il that I re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved while I was wr@@ iting this talk just a mon@@ th or so ago .
"It &apos;s from a man nam@@ ed Ch@@ r@@ is C@@ ro@@ y , who I &apos;d never heard of ."
This is a picture of him sho@@ wing him re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing from sur@@ g@@ ery .
Why was he re@@ co@@ ver@@ ing from sur@@ g@@ ery ?
"The e@@ ma@@ il beg@@ an , &quot; &quot; L@@ ast T@@ u@@ es@@ day , I an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ously d@@ on@@ ated my right ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y to a stran@@ ger ."
That started a ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y cha@@ in which en@@ ab@@ led four people to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s about 100 people each year in the U.@@ S@@ .
and more in other countries who do that .
I was ple@@ as@@ ed to read it . Ch@@ r@@ is went on to say that he &apos;d been in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by my wr@@ it@@ ings in what he did .
"Well , I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I &apos;m also some@@ what em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed by that , because I still have two ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys ."
"And that did make me feel a little bit better , because I have given more than 5@@ ,000 dollars to the A@@ g@@ ainst M@@ al@@ ari@@ a F@@ ound@@ ation and to vari@@ ous other effec@@ tive ch@@ ari@@ ties ."
"So if you &apos;re feel@@ ing bad because you still have two ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys as well , there &apos;s a way for you to get off the ho@@ ok ."
Thank you .

"O@@ ur mis@@ sion is to build a deta@@ il@@ ed , re@@ al@@ is@@ tic computer mo@@ de@@ l of the human brain ."
"And we &apos;ve done , in the past four years , a pro@@ of of con@@ cept on a small part of the ro@@ dent brain , and with this pro@@ of of con@@ cept we are now sc@@ al@@ ing the pro@@ ject up to re@@ ach the human brain ."
Why are we doing this ?
There are three important reas@@ ons .
"The first is , it &apos;s ess@@ ential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and I think that it is a k@@ ey ste@@ p in evolution ."
"The second reason is , we cannot keep doing anim@@ al experim@@ ent@@ ation fore@@ ver , and we have to em@@ body all our data and all our knowledge into a working mo@@ de@@ l ."
It &apos;s like a N@@ o@@ ah &apos;s A@@ r@@ k . It &apos;s like an ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve .
"And the thir@@ d reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are aff@@ ected by mental dis@@ order , and the dru@@ gs that are used today are lar@@ ge@@ ly emp@@ ir@@ ical ."
I think that we can come up with very con@@ cre@@ te solu@@ tions on how to treat dis@@ ord@@ ers .
"Now , even at this st@@ age , we can use the brain mo@@ de@@ l to expl@@ ore some fundamental questions about how the brain works ."
"And here , at TED , for the first time , I &apos;d like to share with you how we &apos;re ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing one theory — there are many the@@ ories — one theory of how the brain works ."
"So , this theory is that the brain cre@@ ates , buil@@ ds , a ver@@ sion of the universe , and pro@@ jects this ver@@ sion of the universe , like a bu@@ b@@ ble , all around us ."
"Now , this is of course a t@@ op@@ ic of philosop@@ h@@ ical de@@ b@@ ate for cent@@ ur@@ ies ."
"But , for the first time , we can actually ad@@ d@@ ress this , with brain sim@@ ulation , and ask very syst@@ em@@ atic and ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous questions , whether this theory could possi@@ bly be true ."
"The reason why the mo@@ on is huge on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on is simply because our per@@ cep@@ tual bu@@ b@@ ble does not stre@@ t@@ ch out 3@@ 8@@ 0,000 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters ."
It run@@ s out of space .
"And so what we do is we comp@@ are the buil@@ d@@ ings within our per@@ cep@@ tual bu@@ b@@ ble , and we make a deci@@ sion ."
"We make a deci@@ sion it &apos;s that big , even though it &apos;s not that big ."
And what that ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates is that deci@@ sions are the k@@ ey things that sup@@ port our per@@ cep@@ tual bu@@ b@@ ble . It ke@@ e@@ ps it ali@@ ve .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out deci@@ sions you cannot see , you cannot think , you cannot feel ."
"And you may think that an@@ es@@ the@@ tics work by sen@@ ding you into some de@@ ep s@@ le@@ ep , or by bloc@@ king your re@@ cep@@ tors so that you don &apos;t feel p@@ ain , but in fact most an@@ es@@ the@@ tics don &apos;t work that way ."
What they do is they int@@ ro@@ duce a no@@ ise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other .
"They are con@@ f@@ used , and you cannot make a deci@@ sion ."
"So , while you &apos;re trying to make up your mind what the doc@@ tor , the sur@@ ge@@ on , is doing while he &apos;s h@@ ac@@ king away at your body , he &apos;s long g@@ one ."
He &apos;s at home having te@@ a .
"( Laughter ) So , when you wal@@ k up to a do@@ or and you op@@ en it , what you comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely have to do to per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve is to make deci@@ sions , thousands of deci@@ sions about the size of the room , the w@@ all@@ s , the he@@ ight , the ob@@ jects in this room ."
9@@ 9 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the ey@@ es .
It is what you in@@ f@@ er about that room .
"So I can say , with some cer@@ tain@@ ty , &quot; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"But I cannot say , &quot; &quot; You think , ther@@ e@@ fore you are , &quot; &quot; because &quot; &quot; you &quot; &quot; are within my per@@ cep@@ tual bu@@ b@@ ble ."
"Now , we can spec@@ ul@@ ate and philosop@@ hi@@ ze this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years ."
We can ask a very con@@ cre@@ te question .
&quot; C@@ an the brain build such a per@@ cep@@ tion ? &quot;
I@@ s it cap@@ able of doing it ?
D@@ o@@ es it have the sub@@ st@@ ance to do it ?
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to descri@@ be to you today .
"So , it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain ."
It had to impro@@ ve it a little bit .
"It had to ad@@ d to the fron@@ t@@ al part , so that you would have inst@@ inc@@ ts , because they had to cop@@ e on land ."
But the real big ste@@ p was the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x .
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
"The ma@@ m@@ m@@ als needed it because they had to cop@@ e with paren@@ th@@ ood , social inter@@ ac@@ tions , comple@@ x cogni@@ tive fun@@ c@@ tions ."
"So , you can think of the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x actually as the ul@@ tim@@ ate solu@@ tion today , of the universe as we know it ."
"It &apos;s the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le , it &apos;s the fin@@ al produc@@ t that the universe has produc@@ ed ."
"It was so suc@@ cess@@ ful in evolution that from m@@ ouse to man it exp@@ an@@ ded about a thous@@ and@@ fo@@ ld in ter@@ ms of the num@@ bers of neurons , to pro@@ duce this almost fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing org@@ an , struc@@ ture ."
And it has not st@@ op@@ ped its ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary pat@@ h .
"In fact , the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x in the human brain is ev@@ ol@@ ving at an en@@ orm@@ ous spe@@ ed ."
"If you z@@ o@@ om into the sur@@ face of the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , you disc@@ over that it &apos;s made up of little mo@@ d@@ ul@@ es , G@@ 5 pro@@ cess@@ ors , like in a computer ."
But there are about a million of them .
They were so suc@@ cess@@ ful in evolution that what we did was to du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate them over and over and ad@@ d more and more of them to the brain until we r@@ an out of space in the sk@@ ul@@ l .
"And the brain started to fo@@ ld in on itself , and that &apos;s why the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x is so high@@ ly con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted ."
"We &apos;re just p@@ ac@@ king in col@@ um@@ ns , so that we &apos;d have more ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ ns to per@@ form more comple@@ x fun@@ c@@ tions ."
"So you can think of the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x actually as a massive gr@@ and pi@@ an@@ o , a m@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ k@@ ey gr@@ and pi@@ an@@ o ."
E@@ ach of these ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ ns would pro@@ duce a n@@ ote .
You s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ate it ; it produc@@ es a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y .
But it &apos;s not just a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y of per@@ cep@@ tion .
"It &apos;s a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y of your universe , your reality ."
"Now , of course it ta@@ kes years to learn how to ma@@ ster a gr@@ and pi@@ an@@ o with a million ke@@ ys ."
"That &apos;s why you have to s@@ end your kids to good scho@@ ols , ho@@ pe@@ fully even@@ tually to O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
But it &apos;s not only education .
It &apos;s also gen@@ e@@ tics .
"You may be born l@@ uc@@ k@@ y , where you know how to ma@@ ster your ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ n , and you can play a f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y ."
"In fact , there is a new theory of au@@ ti@@ s@@ m called the &quot; &quot; int@@ en@@ se world &quot; &quot; theory , which su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ ns are super@@ -@@ col@@ um@@ ns ."
"They are high@@ ly re@@ ac@@ tive , and they are super@@ -@@ pl@@ as@@ tic , and so the au@@ ti@@ sts are probably cap@@ able of building and learning a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y which is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able for us ."
"But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these col@@ um@@ ns , the n@@ ote is going to be off ."
"The per@@ cep@@ tion , the sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y that you create is going to be cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ted , and you will have sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of disease ."
"So , the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il for neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence is really to understand the desig@@ n of the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ i@@ tical col@@ um@@ n — and it &apos;s not just for neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence ; it &apos;s perhaps to understand per@@ cep@@ tion , to understand reality , and perhaps to even also understand physical reality ."
"So , what we did was , for the past 15 years , was to dis@@ s@@ ect out the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally ."
It &apos;s a bit like going and cat@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ing a piece of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st .
How many tre@@ es does it have ?
What shap@@ es are the tre@@ es ?
How many of each t@@ y@@ pe of t@@ ree do you have ? Wh@@ ere are they posi@@ tion@@ ed ?
"But it &apos;s a bit more than cat@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ing because you actually have to descri@@ be and disc@@ over all the r@@ ul@@ es of comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation , the r@@ ul@@ es of connec@@ ti@@ vity , because the neurons don &apos;t just like to con@@ n@@ ect with any neur@@ on ."
They cho@@ ose very care@@ fully who they con@@ n@@ ect with .
It &apos;s also more than cat@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ing because you actually have to build thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal dig@@ ital mo@@ d@@ els of them .
"And we did that for ten@@ s of thousands of neurons , built dig@@ ital mo@@ d@@ els of all the different typ@@ es of neurons we came across ."
"And once you have that , you can actually beg@@ in to build the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ n ."
And here we &apos;re co@@ il@@ ing them up .
"But as you do this , what you see is that the br@@ an@@ ch@@ es inter@@ s@@ ect actually in m@@ illions of loc@@ ations , and at each of these inter@@ sec@@ tions they can form a sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se ."
And a sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se is a ch@@ em@@ ical loc@@ ation where they comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate with each other .
And these sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses together form the ne@@ t@@ work or the cir@@ cu@@ it of the brain .
"Now , the cir@@ cu@@ it , you could also think of as the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the brain ."
"And when you think of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the brain , the struc@@ ture , how is it built ? What is the patter@@ n of the car@@ pe@@ t ?"
"You reali@@ ze that this pos@@ es a fundamental chall@@ en@@ ge to any theory of the brain , and es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally to a theory that says that there is some reality that em@@ er@@ g@@ es out of this car@@ pe@@ t , out of this particular car@@ pe@@ t with a particular patter@@ n ."
The reason is because the most important desig@@ n sec@@ re@@ t of the brain is di@@ vers@@ ity .
E@@ very neur@@ on is different .
It &apos;s the same in the fore@@ st . E@@ very p@@ ine t@@ ree is different .
"You may have many different typ@@ es of tre@@ es , but every p@@ ine t@@ ree is different . And in the brain it &apos;s the same ."
"So there is no neur@@ on in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neur@@ on in my brain that is the same as in your@@ s ."
And your neurons are not going to be ori@@ en@@ ted and posi@@ tion@@ ed in exactly the same way .
And you may have more or less neurons .
"So it &apos;s very un@@ likely that you got the same f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry ."
"So , how could we possi@@ bly create a reality that we can even understand each other ?"
"Well , we don &apos;t have to spec@@ ul@@ ate ."
We can look at all 10 million sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses now .
We can look at the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c . And we can change neurons .
We can use different neurons with different vari@@ ations .
"We can posi@@ tion them in different places , ori@@ ent them in different places ."
We can use less or more of them .
And when we do that what we disc@@ over@@ ed is that the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry does change .
But the patter@@ n of how the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry is desig@@ ned does not .
"So , the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the brain , even though your brain may be sm@@ all@@ er , big@@ ger , it may have different typ@@ es of neurons , different mor@@ p@@ ho@@ logi@@ es of neurons , we actually do share the same f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c ."
"And we think this is speci@@ es@@ -@@ speci@@ fic , which means that that could explain why we can &apos;t comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate across spec@@ ies ."
"So , let &apos;s s@@ w@@ it@@ ch it on . But to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come ali@@ ve ."
"We make it come ali@@ ve with equ@@ ations , a lot of ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s ."
"And , in fact , the equ@@ ations that make neurons into electr@@ ical gener@@ at@@ ors were disc@@ over@@ ed by two C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge N@@ o@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates ."
"So , we have the ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s to make neurons come ali@@ ve ."
"We also have the ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s to descri@@ be how neurons coll@@ ect information , and how they create a little ligh@@ t@@ ning b@@ ol@@ t to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate with each other ."
"And when they get to the sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se , what they do is they effec@@ ti@@ vely , liter@@ ally , sho@@ ck the sy@@ n@@ ap@@ se ."
It &apos;s like electr@@ ical sho@@ ck that re@@ le@@ ases the ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als from these sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses .
And we &apos;ve got the ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s to descri@@ be this process .
So we can descri@@ be the comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation between the neurons .
There liter@@ ally are only a h@@ and@@ ful of equ@@ ations that you need to sim@@ ul@@ ate the acti@@ vity of the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x .
But what you do need is a very big computer .
And in fact you need one l@@ ap@@ top to do all the cal@@ cul@@ ations just for one neur@@ on .
"So you need 1@@ 0,000 l@@ ap@@ t@@ op@@ s ."
"So where do you go ? You go to I@@ B@@ M , and you get a super@@ computer , because they know how to take 1@@ 0,000 l@@ ap@@ t@@ op@@ s and put it into the size of a re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or ."
So now we have this B@@ l@@ ue G@@ en@@ e super@@ computer .
"We can lo@@ ad up all the neurons , each one on to its pro@@ cess@@ or , and fir@@ e it up , and see what happens ."
T@@ a@@ ke the mag@@ ic car@@ pe@@ t for a ri@@ de .
Here we acti@@ v@@ ate it . And this gi@@ ves the first g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of what is happening in your brain when there is a s@@ tim@@ ulation .
It &apos;s the first view .
"Now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; My go@@ d . How is reality coming out of that ? &quot;"
"But , in fact , you can start , even though we ha@@ ven &apos;t tr@@ ained this ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ n to create a speci@@ fic reality ."
"But we can ask , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere is the r@@ ose ? &quot; &quot; We can ask , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere is it inside , if we s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ate it with a picture ? &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere is it inside the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x ?"
U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately it &apos;s got to be there if we s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ated it with it .
"So , the way that we can look at that is to ig@@ n@@ ore the neurons , ig@@ n@@ ore the sy@@ n@@ ap@@ ses , and look just at the ra@@ w electr@@ ical acti@@ vity ."
Because that is what it &apos;s cre@@ ating .
It &apos;s cre@@ ating electr@@ ical patterns .
"So when we did this , we in@@ de@@ ed , for the first time , saw these gh@@ os@@ t-@@ like struc@@ tures : electr@@ ical ob@@ jects appe@@ ar@@ ing within the ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical col@@ um@@ n ."
And it &apos;s these electr@@ ical ob@@ jects that are ho@@ l@@ ding all the information about wh@@ at@@ ever s@@ tim@@ ul@@ ated it .
"And then when we z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this , it &apos;s like a ver@@ it@@ able universe ."
So the next ste@@ p is just to take these brain co@@ ordin@@ ates and to pro@@ ject them into per@@ cep@@ tual space .
"And if you do that , you will be able to ste@@ p inside the reality that is cre@@ ated by this machine , by this piece of the brain ."
"So , in sum@@ mar@@ y , I think that the universe may have — it &apos;s possible — ev@@ ol@@ ved a brain to see itself , which may be a first ste@@ p in becom@@ ing aw@@ are of itself ."
"There is a lot more to do to test these the@@ ories , and to test any other the@@ ories ."
But I hope that you are at le@@ ast par@@ tly con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that it is not im@@ possible to build a brain .
"We can do it within 10 years , and if we do suc@@ ce@@ ed , we will s@@ end to TED , in 10 years , a ho@@ lo@@ gram to talk to you . Thank you ."
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man out there , some@@ where , who looks a little bit like the ac@@ tor I@@ dr@@ is E@@ l@@ b@@ a , or at le@@ ast he did 20 years ago ."
"And I did exactly what you &apos;re not sup@@ posed to do , which is s@@ wer@@ ve to av@@ o@@ id it ."
( Applause ) I tell you all of this because the ev@@ ents of that night changed the course of my life to some de@@ gre@@ e .
"Wh@@ ere does it come from , and how does it devel@@ op , and what are the extre@@ me for@@ ms that it can take ?"
So it &apos;s a sel@@ fl@@ ess act int@@ en@@ ded to b@@ ene@@ f@@ it only the other .
And the answer may be that the bra@@ ins of high@@ ly al@@ tru@@ is@@ tic people are different in fundamental ways .
"@@ P@@ sy@@ cho@@ p@@ ath@@ y is a develop@@ mental dis@@ order with stron@@ g@@ ly gen@@ e@@ tic or@@ ig@@ ins , and it res@@ ults in a pers@@ on@@ ality that &apos;s co@@ ld and un@@ car@@ ing and a ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y to eng@@ age in an@@ ti@@ social and sometimes very viol@@ ent behavior ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , al@@ though they &apos;re not gener@@ ally in@@ sen@@ si@@ tive to other people &apos;s emoti@@ ons , they are in@@ sen@@ si@@ tive to si@@ g@@ ns that other people are in dist@@ ress ."
"And in particular , they have diffic@@ ul@@ ty recogni@@ zing f@@ ear@@ ful fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions like this one ."
So these are people who have v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed to under@@ go maj@@ or sur@@ g@@ ery so that one of their own health@@ y ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys can be re@@ mo@@ ved and trans@@ plan@@ ted into a very ill stran@@ ger that they &apos;ve never m@@ et and may never me@@ et .
They are better at recogni@@ zing other people &apos;s fear .
They &apos;re liter@@ ally better at de@@ t@@ ec@@ ting when somebody else is in dist@@ ress .
This may be in part because their am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is more re@@ ac@@ tive to these ex@@ pres@@ sions .
H@@ i .

"The live au@@ dience was asked to ap@@ pl@@ au@@ d A@@ S@@ L@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le , in si@@ l@@ ence . &#93; So , five years ago , this was me ."
Th@@ en one day I had a f@@ ever of 1@@ 0@@ 4@@ .@@ 7 de@@ gre@@ es .
"I probably should have g@@ one to the doc@@ tor , but I &apos;d never really been s@@ ick in my life , and I knew that u@@ su@@ ally , if you have a vir@@ us , you st@@ ay home and you make some ch@@ ic@@ ken s@@ ou@@ p , and in a few days , everything will be fine ."
But this time it wasn &apos;t fine .
"A@@ f@@ ter the f@@ ever bro@@ ke , for three wee@@ ks I was so di@@ z@@ zy , I couldn &apos;t leave my h@@ ouse ."
I would wal@@ k st@@ ra@@ ight into do@@ or fr@@ am@@ es .
I had to hu@@ g the w@@ all@@ s just to make it to the b@@ ath@@ room .
"That sp@@ r@@ ing I got in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion after in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion , and every time I went to the doc@@ tor , he said there was ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing wrong ."
M@@ ay@@ be this is what it &apos;s like to be on the other side of 2@@ 5 .
( Laughter ) Th@@ en the neuro@@ logical sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s started .
S@@ ome@@ times I would find that I couldn &apos;t d@@ ra@@ w the right side of a cir@@ c@@ le .
O@@ ther times I wouldn &apos;t be able to spe@@ ak or move at all .
"I saw every kind of speci@@ ali@@ st : in@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous disease doc@@ tors , der@@ mat@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ."
I even saw a psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st .
"M@@ y psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s c@@ lear you &apos;re really s@@ ick , but not with anything psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c ."
"I hope they can find out what &apos;s wrong with you . &quot; &quot; The next day , my neuro@@ logi@@ st di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed me with con@@ ver@@ sion dis@@ order ."
"He told me that everything — the fe@@ ver@@ s , the s@@ ore th@@ ro@@ at@@ s , the s@@ in@@ us in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion , all of the g@@ ast@@ ro@@ in@@ te@@ st@@ in@@ al , neuro@@ logical and car@@ di@@ a@@ c sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s — were being cau@@ sed by some dist@@ ant emoti@@ onal tr@@ au@@ m@@ a that I could not remember ."
"The sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s were real , he said , but they had no bio@@ logical c@@ ause ."
I was tr@@ ain@@ ing to be a social scienti@@ st .
"I had stu@@ died st@@ atis@@ tics , prob@@ ability theory , ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing , experim@@ ental desig@@ n ."
I f@@ el@@ t like I couldn &apos;t just re@@ ject my neuro@@ logi@@ st &apos;s di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is .
"It didn &apos;t feel true , but I knew from my tr@@ ain@@ ing that the tru@@ th is often coun@@ ter@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive , so eas@@ ily ob@@ sc@@ u@@ red by what we want to believe ."
So I had to consi@@ der the possi@@ bility that he was right .
"That day , I r@@ an a small experiment ."
"I wal@@ ked back the two mil@@ es from my neuro@@ logi@@ st &apos;s off@@ ice to my h@@ ouse , my le@@ gs wr@@ app@@ ed in this stran@@ ge , almost elec@@ tri@@ c kind of p@@ ain ."
"I me@@ d@@ it@@ ated on that p@@ ain , cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ating how my mind could have possi@@ bly gener@@ ated all this ."
My brain and my sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d were bur@@ ning .

I would sp@@ end most of the next two years in bed .
How could my doc@@ tor have g@@ ot@@ ten it so wrong ?
"I thought I had a r@@ are disease , something doc@@ tors had never seen ."
I was di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed with my@@ al@@ gi@@ c en@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ om@@ ye@@ li@@ t@@ is .
"If my h@@ us@@ b@@ and goes for a run , he might be s@@ ore for a couple of days ."
It is a per@@ f@@ ect cu@@ st@@ om pri@@ son .
"It &apos;s been four years , and I &apos;ve still never been as well as I was the minut@@ e before I wal@@ ked home from my neuro@@ logi@@ st &apos;s off@@ ice ."
"In the U@@ S , where I &apos;m from , it &apos;s about one million people ."
How could a disease this common and this dev@@ ast@@ ating have been for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten by medic@@ ine ?
The R@@ om@@ an phys@@ ici@@ an G@@ al@@ en thought that hy@@ st@@ eri@@ a was cau@@ sed by se@@ x@@ u@@ al de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation in partic@@ ul@@ arly p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate women .
"The G@@ re@@ e@@ ks thought the u@@ ter@@ us would liter@@ ally d@@ ry up and wan@@ der around the body in sear@@ ch of mo@@ ist@@ ure , pres@@ sing on inter@@ n@@ al org@@ ans — y@@ es — cau@@ sing sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s from extre@@ me emoti@@ ons to di@@ z@@ z@@ iness and par@@ al@@ ys@@ is ."
The c@@ ure was marri@@ age and mo@@ ther@@ ho@@ od .
"A@@ ll of these out@@ bre@@ a@@ ks have ten@@ ded to dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately aff@@ ect women , and in time , when doc@@ tors fa@@ il@@ ed to find the one c@@ ause of the disease , they thought that these out@@ bre@@ a@@ ks were mass hy@@ st@@ eri@@ a ."
Why has this idea had such st@@ ay@@ ing power ?
"They want to know the answer , and this cat@@ eg@@ ory al@@ lo@@ ws doc@@ tors to treat what would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be un@@ tre@@ at@@ able , to explain ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es that have no ex@@ plan@@ ation ."
The problem is that this can c@@ ause real har@@ m .
"In the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , a psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ st nam@@ ed E@@ li@@ ot S@@ later stu@@ died a co@@ h@@ ort of 8@@ 5 patients who had been di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed with hy@@ st@@ eri@@ a ."
"@@ N@@ ine years later , 12 of them were de@@ ad and 30 had become dis@@ ab@@ led ."
"A@@ ll around the world , M@@ E is one of the le@@ ast fund@@ ed dise@@ ases ."
"In the U@@ S , we sp@@ end each year r@@ ough@@ ly 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 dollars per A@@ I@@ D@@ S pati@@ ent , 2@@ 50 dollars per M@@ S pati@@ ent and just 5 dollars per year per M@@ E pati@@ ent ."
This was not just ligh@@ t@@ ning .
I was not just un@@ l@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
"The ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding my disease has been a cho@@ ice , a cho@@ ice made by the in@@ stitu@@ tions that were sup@@ posed to prot@@ ect us ."
"A@@ no@@ ther woman with o@@ vari@@ an cancer , who for years was told that it was just early men@@ op@@ ause ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke the hy@@ st@@ eri@@ a of old , this has everything to do with gen@@ der and with wh@@ ose stories we believe ."
"S@@ ev@@ ent@@ y-@@ five percent of au@@ to@@ im@@ m@@ un@@ e disease patients are women , and in some dise@@ ases , it &apos;s as high as 90 percent ."
And men may even have a more difficult time getting di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed .
My brain is not what it used to be .
"@@ Here &apos;s the good part : des@@ p@@ ite everything , I still have hope ."
So many dise@@ ases were once thought of as psycho@@ logical until science un@@ co@@ ver@@ ed their bio@@ logical m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ e@@ ve things that seem to de@@ f@@ y all of the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ?"

Th@@ e@@ ir com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ ate@@ way came out with fl@@ at@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re em@@ in@@ ently qu@@ ali@@ fied to make fl@@ at@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
N@@ o@@ body b@@ ought one .
It &apos;s all gr@@ oun@@ ded in the ten@@ ets of bio@@ logy .
"@@ Not psycho@@ logy , bio@@ logy ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ w@@ est brain , our H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ en brain , our ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x is respon@@ sible for all of our r@@ ational and anal@@ y@@ tical thought and language .
"The middle two sec@@ tions make up our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ bi@@ c bra@@ ins are respon@@ sible for all of our feel@@ ings , like tr@@ ust and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t dri@@ ve behavior .
This is where g@@ ut deci@@ sions come from .
The go@@ al is not just to h@@ ire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to h@@ ire people who believe what you believe .
M@@ ost people don &apos;t know about S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ p@@ on@@ t L@@ ang@@ le@@ y .
"And S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ p@@ on@@ t L@@ ang@@ le@@ y had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ pe for suc@@ cess ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He hi@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the market condi@@ tions were f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic .
"The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es fol@@ lowed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for L@@ ang@@ le@@ y ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of S@@ am@@ u@@ el P@@ i@@ er@@ p@@ on@@ t L@@ ang@@ le@@ y ?
"The difference was , O@@ r@@ v@@ il@@ le and W@@ il@@ bu@@ r were dri@@ ven by a c@@ ause , by a pur@@ pose , by a belie@@ f ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could fig@@ ure out this fl@@ ying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the res@@ ult .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the r@@ ic@@ h@@ es .
"And l@@ o and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the p@@ ay@@ ch@@ ec@@ k .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get r@@ ich , he didn &apos;t get fam@@ ous , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to at@@ tr@@ act those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early ad@@ op@@ ters .
"And these gu@@ ys , the in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors and the early ad@@ op@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ fort@@ able making those g@@ ut deci@@ sions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that pro@@ ve what they believe ."
"So let me give you a fam@@ ous example , a fam@@ ous fa@@ il@@ ure and a fam@@ ous suc@@ cess of the la@@ w of diff@@ u@@ sion of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al example .
I T@@ i@@ V@@ o stuff on my pi@@ ec@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ i@@ me W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their st@@ oc@@ k was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted , and it &apos;s never tr@@ ad@@ ed abo@@ ve 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the sum@@ m@@ er of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people sho@@ wed up on the m@@ all in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing spe@@ ak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them sho@@ wed up for him ?
They sho@@ wed up for themselves .
"We fol@@ lowed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are lead@@ ers and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ L@@ e@@ ad@@ ers hold a posi@@ tion of power or au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , but those who le@@ ad insp@@ ire us ."
So I &apos;m going to spe@@ ak about a problem that I have and that &apos;s that I &apos;m a philosop@@ her .
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en I go to a par@@ ty and people ask me what do I do and I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a prof@@ ess@@ or , &quot; &quot; their ey@@ es g@@ la@@ ze over ."
"When I go to an ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ty and there are all the prof@@ ess@@ ors around , they ask me what field I &apos;m in and I say , &quot; &quot; philosop@@ h@@ y &quot; &quot; — their ey@@ es g@@ la@@ ze over ."
"( Laughter ) Wh@@ en I go to a philosop@@ her &apos;s par@@ ty ( Laughter ) and they ask me what I work on and I say , &quot; &quot; consciousness , &quot; &quot; their ey@@ es don &apos;t g@@ la@@ ze over — their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a s@@ n@@ ar@@ l . ( Laughter )"
"And I get ho@@ ots of der@@ i@@ sion and c@@ ac@@ k@@ les and grow@@ ls because they think , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s im@@ possible ! You can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot; &quot; The very ch@@ ut@@ z@@ p@@ ah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question ."
"M@@ y l@@ ate , l@@ am@@ en@@ ted fri@@ end B@@ o@@ b N@@ o@@ z@@ ick , a fine philosop@@ her , in one of his bo@@ o@@ ks , &quot; &quot; P@@ h@@ il@@ osop@@ h@@ ical E@@ x@@ plan@@ ations , &quot; &quot; is comm@@ ent@@ ing on the e@@ th@@ o@@ s of philosop@@ h@@ y — the way philosop@@ h@@ ers go about their business ."
"And he says , you know , &quot; &quot; P@@ h@@ il@@ osop@@ h@@ ers love r@@ ational ar@@ g@@ ument . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; It seems as if the ide@@ al ar@@ g@@ ument for most philosop@@ h@@ ers is you give your au@@ dience the pre@@ mis@@ es and then you give them the in@@ fer@@ ences and the con@@ clu@@ sion , and if they don &apos;t ac@@ cept the con@@ clu@@ sion , they die ."
Th@@ e@@ ir he@@ ads exp@@ lo@@ de . &quot; &quot; The idea is to have an ar@@ g@@ ument that is so po@@ wer@@ ful that it kno@@ c@@ ks out your op@@ p@@ on@@ ents .
But in fact that doesn &apos;t change people &apos;s min@@ ds at all .
"It &apos;s very hard to change people &apos;s min@@ ds about something like consciousness , and I fin@@ ally fi@@ gu@@ red out the reason for that ."
The reason for that is that everybody &apos;s an exper@@ t on consciousness .
We heard the other day that everybody &apos;s got a str@@ ong op@@ in@@ i@@ on about vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es .
"They all have an idea for a vide@@ o g@@ ame , even if they &apos;re not exper@@ ts ."
But they don &apos;t consi@@ der themselves exper@@ ts on vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es ; they &apos;ve just got str@@ ong op@@ in@@ i@@ ons .
"I &apos;m sure that people here who work on , say , c@@ lim@@ ate change and global war@@ m@@ ing , or on the future of the In@@ ter@@ net , en@@ coun@@ ter people who have very str@@ ong op@@ in@@ i@@ ons about what &apos;s going to happen next ."
But they probably don &apos;t think of these op@@ in@@ i@@ ons as exper@@ ti@@ se .
They &apos;re just stron@@ g@@ ly hel@@ d op@@ in@@ i@@ ons .
"But with re@@ g@@ ard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; &quot; I am an exper@@ t ."
"S@@ imp@@ ly by being consci@@ ous , I know all about this . &quot; &quot; And so , you tell them your theory and they say , &quot; &quot; No , no , that &apos;s not the way consciousness is !@@ "
"@@ No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot; &quot; And they say this with an ama@@ zing con@@ fi@@ dence ."
And so what I &apos;m going to try to do today is to s@@ ha@@ ke your con@@ fi@@ dence . Because I know the feel@@ ing — I can feel it my@@ self .
"I want to s@@ ha@@ ke your con@@ fi@@ dence that you know your own in@@ ner@@ most min@@ ds — that you are , your@@ selves , au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ative about your own consciousness ."
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
"Now , this n@@ ice picture sho@@ ws a th@@ ough@@ t-@@ bal@@ lo@@ on , a th@@ ough@@ t-@@ bu@@ b@@ ble ."
I think everybody underst@@ ands what that means .
That &apos;s sup@@ posed to ex@@ hi@@ bit the stre@@ am of consciousness .
This is my fav@@ or@@ ite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
It &apos;s a S@@ au@@ l S@@ te@@ in@@ ber@@ g of course — it was a New Y@@ or@@ ker co@@ ver .
And this f@@ el@@ low here is looking at the pain@@ ting by B@@ ra@@ qu@@ e .
"That re@@ min@@ ds him of the word bar@@ o@@ qu@@ e , bar@@ r@@ ack , bar@@ k , po@@ o@@ d@@ le , Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne R@@ . — he &apos;s off to the r@@ ac@@ es ."
"There &apos;s a wonderful stre@@ am of consciousness here and if you fol@@ low it along , you learn a lot about this man ."
"What I partic@@ ul@@ arly like about this picture , too , is that S@@ te@@ in@@ ber@@ g has ren@@ der@@ ed the guy in this sort of poin@@ ti@@ l@@ li@@ st st@@ y@@ le ."
"Wh@@ ich re@@ min@@ ds us , as R@@ od B@@ ro@@ o@@ ks was saying y@@ est@@ er@@ day : what we are , what each of us is — what you are , what I am — is appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately 100 tr@@ illion little c@@ ell@@ ular ro@@ b@@ ots ."
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
"@@ No other in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents at all . We &apos;re just made of cells , about 100 tr@@ illion of them ."
"@@ Not a single one of those cells is consci@@ ous ; not a single one of those cells kno@@ ws who you are , or care@@ s ."
"S@@ ome@@ how , we have to explain how when you put together te@@ ams , ar@@ mi@@ es , b@@ at@@ tal@@ i@@ ons of hund@@ re@@ ds of m@@ illions of little ro@@ bot@@ ic un@@ consci@@ ous cells — not so different really from a bac@@ ter@@ i@@ um , each one of them — the res@@ ult is this . I mean , just look at it ."
"The cont@@ ent — there &apos;s col@@ or , there &apos;s ideas , there &apos;s me@@ mor@@ ies , there &apos;s history . And some@@ how all that cont@@ ent of consciousness is ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed by the bus@@ y acti@@ vity of those ho@@ ar@@ ds of neurons ."
How is that possible ? M@@ any people just think it isn &apos;t possible at all .
"They think , &quot; &quot; No , there can &apos;t be any sort of nat@@ ur@@ al@@ is@@ tic ex@@ plan@@ ation of consciousness . &quot; &quot; This is a lo@@ vely book by a fri@@ end of m@@ ine nam@@ ed L@@ e@@ e S@@ i@@ e@@ ge@@ l , who &apos;s a prof@@ ess@@ or of religi@@ on , actually , at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i , and he &apos;s an exper@@ t mag@@ ici@@ an , and an exper@@ t on the stre@@ et mag@@ ic of India , which is what this book is about , &quot; N@@ et of M@@ ag@@ ic . &quot;"
And there &apos;s a p@@ ass@@ age in it which I would love to share with you .
It spe@@ a@@ ks so el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently to the problem .
"&quot; &quot; &apos; I &apos;m wr@@ iting a book on mag@@ ic , &apos; I explain , and I &apos;m asked , &apos; R@@ e@@ al mag@@ ic ? &apos; B@@ y &apos; real mag@@ ic , &apos; people mean m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les , th@@ au@@ mat@@ ur@@ g@@ ical ac@@ ts , and super@@ natural po@@ w@@ ers ."
"@@ &apos;@@ No , &apos; I answer . &apos; Con@@ j@@ uring tr@@ ic@@ ks , not real mag@@ ic . &apos; &apos; R@@ e@@ al mag@@ ic , &apos; in other words , re@@ f@@ ers to the mag@@ ic that is not real ; while the mag@@ ic that is real , that can actually be done , is not real mag@@ ic . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s the way a lot of people feel about consciousness . ( Laughter )"
R@@ e@@ al consciousness is not a b@@ a@@ g of tr@@ ic@@ ks .
"If you &apos;re going to explain this as a b@@ a@@ g of tr@@ ic@@ ks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , wh@@ at@@ ever it is ."
"And , as Mar@@ v@@ in said , and as other people have said , &quot; Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is a b@@ a@@ g of tr@@ ic@@ ks . &quot;"
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dis@@ s@@ atis@@ fied and incre@@ d@@ ul@@ ous when I att@@ emp@@ t to explain consciousness .
"So this is the problem . So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a mag@@ ic tr@@ ick expl@@ ained to you ."
"@@ How many of you here , if somebody — some smar@@ t al@@ ec@@ k — star@@ ts t@@ elling you how a particular mag@@ ic tr@@ ick is done , you sort of want to bloc@@ k your ear@@ s and say , &quot; &quot; No , no , I don &apos;t want to know !@@ "
D@@ on &apos;t take the thr@@ ill of it away . I &apos;d rather be my@@ sti@@ fied .
"D@@ on &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot; &quot; A lot of people feel that way about consciousness , I &apos;ve disc@@ over@@ ed ."
"And I &apos;m sor@@ ry if I imp@@ ose some cl@@ ar@@ ity , some understanding on you ."
You &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tr@@ ic@@ ks .
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosop@@ h@@ ers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosop@@ her expl@@ ain@@ s the sa@@ w@@ ing@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ad@@ y-@@ in@@ -@@ half tr@@ ick .
You know the sa@@ w@@ ing@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ l@@ ad@@ y-@@ in@@ -@@ half tr@@ ick ?
"The philosop@@ her says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to explain to you how that &apos;s done ."
"You see , the mag@@ ici@@ an doesn &apos;t really saw the l@@ ad@@ y in half . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; He mer@@ ely makes you think that he does . &quot;"
"And you say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , and how does he do that ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , that &apos;s not my de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m going to ill@@ u@@ str@@ ate how philosop@@ h@@ ers explain consciousness ."
But I &apos;m going to try to also show you that consciousness isn &apos;t quite as mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous — your own consciousness isn &apos;t quite as wonderful — as you may have thought it is .
"This is something , by the way , that L@@ e@@ e S@@ i@@ e@@ ge@@ l tal@@ ks about in his book ."
"He mar@@ v@@ els at how he &apos;ll do a mag@@ ic show , and af@@ ter@@ wards people will s@@ we@@ ar they saw him do X , Y , and Z@@ . He never did those things ."
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s me@@ mor@@ ies in@@ fl@@ ate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
"Now , let &apos;s see if this will work . A@@ ll right . Let &apos;s just wat@@ ch this ."
W@@ at@@ ch it care@@ fully .
"I &apos;m working with a young compu@@ ter@@ -@@ anim@@ at@@ or doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ari@@ an nam@@ ed N@@ ick D@@ e@@ am@@ er , and this is a little de@@ m@@ o that he &apos;s done for me , part of a lar@@ ger pro@@ ject some of you may be interest@@ ed in ."
We &apos;re looking for a bac@@ ker .
It &apos;s a fe@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ l@@ eng@@ th doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary on consciousness .
"O@@ K , now , you all saw what changed , right ?"
How many of you not@@ ic@@ ed that every one of those s@@ qu@@ are@@ s changed col@@ or ?
E@@ very one . I &apos;ll just show you by run@@ ning it again .
"E@@ ven when you know that they &apos;re all going to change col@@ or , it &apos;s very hard to not@@ ice . You have to really con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate to pic@@ k up any of the changes at all ."
"Now , this is an example — one of many — of a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that &apos;s now being stu@@ died quite a bit ."
"It &apos;s one that I predic@@ ted in the last p@@ age or two of my 19@@ 9@@ 1 book , &quot; &quot; Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness E@@ x@@ pl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; where I said if you did experim@@ ents of this sort , you &apos;d find that people were un@@ able to pic@@ k up really large changes ."
"If there &apos;s time at the end , I &apos;ll show you the much more dr@@ am@@ atic case ."
"Now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aw@@ are of them ?"
"Well , ear@@ li@@ er today , J@@ e@@ ff H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed the way your ey@@ e s@@ ac@@ c@@ ad@@ es , the way your ey@@ e mo@@ ves around three or four times a second ."
"He didn &apos;t men@@ tion the spe@@ ed . Y@@ our ey@@ e is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in moti@@ on , mo@@ ving around , looking at ey@@ es , n@@ os@@ es , el@@ bo@@ ws , looking at interesting things in the world ."
"And where your ey@@ e isn &apos;t looking , you &apos;re re@@ mark@@ ably im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed in your vi@@ sion ."
"That &apos;s because the fo@@ ve@@ al part of your ey@@ e , which is the high@@ -@@ res@@ olution part , is only about the size of your th@@ um@@ b@@ n@@ a@@ il hel@@ d at ar@@ ms l@@ eng@@ th ."
That &apos;s the deta@@ il part .
"It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?"
"It doesn &apos;t seem that way , but that &apos;s the way it is ."
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
Here &apos;s a completely different eff@@ ect . This is a pain@@ ting by B@@ ell@@ ot@@ to .
It &apos;s in the mu@@ se@@ um in N@@ or@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina .
B@@ ell@@ ot@@ to was a stud@@ ent of C@@ anal@@ et@@ to &apos;s .
And I love pain@@ t@@ ings like that — the pain@@ ting is actually about as big as it is right here .
"And I love C@@ anal@@ et@@ to@@ s , because C@@ anal@@ et@@ to has this f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic deta@@ il , and you can get right up and see all the deta@@ il@@ s on the pain@@ ting ."
"And I started across the h@@ all in N@@ or@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina , because I thought it was probably a C@@ anal@@ et@@ to , and would have all that in deta@@ il ."
"And I not@@ ic@@ ed that on the bri@@ dge there , there &apos;s a lot of people — you can just b@@ are@@ ly see them wal@@ king across the bri@@ dge ."
"And I thought as I got cl@@ os@@ er I would be able to see all the deta@@ il of most people , see their c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , and so for@@ th ."
"And as I got cl@@ os@@ er and cl@@ os@@ er , I actually scre@@ am@@ ed ."
"I y@@ ell@@ ed out because when I got cl@@ os@@ er , I found the deta@@ il wasn &apos;t there at all ."
There were just little ar@@ t@@ fully plac@@ ed b@@ lob@@ s of pain@@ t .
"And as I wal@@ ked to@@ wards the picture , I was exp@@ ec@@ ting deta@@ il that wasn &apos;t there ."
"The arti@@ st had very c@@ le@@ ver@@ ly su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted people and c@@ lo@@ th@@ es and w@@ ag@@ ons and all sor@@ ts of things , and my brain had taken the su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion ."
"You &apos;re fam@@ ili@@ ar with a more rec@@ ent technology , which is — There , you can get a better view of the b@@ lob@@ s ."
"S@@ e@@ e , when you get cl@@ ose they &apos;re really just b@@ lob@@ s of pain@@ t ."
You will have seen something like this — this is the re@@ ver@@ se eff@@ ect .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
"Now , what does your brain do when it ta@@ kes the su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion ?"
"When an ar@@ t@@ ful b@@ lo@@ b of pain@@ t or two , by an arti@@ st , su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts a person — say , one of Mar@@ v@@ in M@@ in@@ sk@@ y &apos;s little society of mind — do they s@@ end little p@@ a@@ inter@@ s out to f@@ ill in all the deta@@ il@@ s in your brain some@@ where ?"
"I don &apos;t think so . Not a chan@@ ce . But then , how on Earth is it done ?"
"Well , remember the philosop@@ her &apos;s ex@@ plan@@ ation of the l@@ ad@@ y ?"
It &apos;s the same thing .
The brain just makes you think that it &apos;s got the deta@@ il there .
"You think the deta@@ il &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there ."
The brain isn &apos;t actually pu@@ tting the deta@@ il in your head at all .
It &apos;s just making you exp@@ ect the deta@@ il .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
"I@@ s the shap@@ e on the left the same as the shap@@ e on the right , r@@ ot@@ ated ?"
Y@@ es .
"@@ How many of you did it by r@@ ot@@ ating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s ey@@ e , to see if it mat@@ ched up with the one on the right ?"
How many of you r@@ ot@@ ated the one on the right ? O@@ K .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
"( Laughter ) There &apos;s in fact been a very interesting de@@ b@@ ate r@@ aging for over 20 years in cogni@@ tive science — vari@@ ous experim@@ ents started by R@@ o@@ ger S@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d , who meas@@ u@@ red the ang@@ ular v@@ el@@ oc@@ ity of r@@ ot@@ ation of mental imag@@ es ."
"Y@@ es , it &apos;s possible to do that ."
But the deta@@ il@@ s of the process are still in si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant contro@@ vers@@ y .
"And if you read that liter@@ ature , one of the things that you really have to come to ter@@ ms with is even when you &apos;re the sub@@ ject in the experiment , you don &apos;t know ."
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain belie@@ f@@ s .
"And they come in a certain order , at a certain time ."
And what expl@@ ain@@ s the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
"Well , that &apos;s where you have to go bac@@ k@@ st@@ age and ask the mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"This is a fig@@ ure that I love : B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y , Pe@@ tri@@ e , and D@@ u@@ ma@@ is ."
"You may think that I &apos;ve che@@ ated , that I &apos;ve put a little wh@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ white b@@ ound@@ ary there ."
"@@ How many of you see that sort of b@@ ound@@ ary , with the N@@ ec@@ ker cu@@ be f@@ lo@@ ating in front of the cir@@ cl@@ es ?"
C@@ an you see it ?
"Well , you know , in eff@@ ect , the b@@ ound@@ ary &apos;s really there , in a certain sense ."
"Y@@ our brain is actually compu@@ ting that b@@ ound@@ ary , the b@@ ound@@ ary that goes right there ."
"But now , not@@ ice there are two ways of seeing the cu@@ be , right ?"
It &apos;s a N@@ ec@@ ker cu@@ be .
E@@ very@@ body can see the two ways of seeing the cu@@ be ? O@@ K .
C@@ an you see the four ways of seeing the cu@@ be ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
"If you &apos;re seeing it as a cu@@ be f@@ lo@@ ating in front of some cir@@ cl@@ es , some black cir@@ cl@@ es , there &apos;s another way of seeing it ."
"As a cu@@ be , on a black bac@@ k@@ ground , as seen through a piece of S@@ w@@ is@@ s che@@ ese ."
( Laughter ) C@@ an you get it ? How many of you can &apos;t get it ? That &apos;ll help . ( Laughter )
Now you can get it . Th@@ ese are two very different ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a .
"When you see the cu@@ be one way , be@@ h@@ ind the scre@@ en , those b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies go away ."
"But there &apos;s still a sort of f@@ ill@@ ing in , as we can tell if we look at this ."
"We don &apos;t have any tr@@ ou@@ ble seeing the cu@@ be , but where does the col@@ or change ?"
D@@ o@@ es your brain have to s@@ end little p@@ a@@ inter@@ s in there ?
The pur@@ ple@@ -@@ p@@ a@@ inter@@ s and the gre@@ en@@ -@@ p@@ a@@ inter@@ s fi@@ ght over who &apos;s going to pain@@ t that bit be@@ h@@ ind the cur@@ tain ? No .
Y@@ our brain just le@@ ts it go . The brain doesn &apos;t need to f@@ ill that in .
"When I first started talking about the B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y , Pe@@ tri@@ e , D@@ u@@ ma@@ is example that you just saw — I &apos;ll go back to it , this one — I said that there was no f@@ ill@@ ing@@ -@@ in be@@ h@@ ind there ."
"And I sup@@ posed that that was just a fl@@ at tru@@ th , always true ."
But R@@ o@@ b V@@ an L@@ ier has rec@@ ently sho@@ wn that it isn &apos;t .
"Now , if you think you see some p@@ ale y@@ el@@ low — I &apos;ll run this a few more times ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok in the gr@@ ay are@@ as , and see if you seem to see something sort of s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y mo@@ ving in there — ye@@ ah , it &apos;s ama@@ zing . There &apos;s nothing there . It &apos;s no tr@@ ick ."
"@@ &#91; &quot; &quot; F@@ a@@ il@@ ure to D@@ et@@ ect Ch@@ ang@@ es in S@@ cen@@ es &quot; &quot; sli@@ de &#93; This is R@@ on R@@ en@@ s@@ ink &apos;s work , which was in some de@@ gre@@ e insp@@ i@@ red by that su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion right at the end of the book ."
Let me just p@@ ause this for a second if I can .
This is chan@@ ge@@ -@@ bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"What you &apos;re going to see is two pic@@ tures , one of which is s@@ ligh@@ tly different from the other ."
"You see here the red ro@@ of and the gr@@ ay ro@@ of , and in between them there will be a m@@ ask , which is just a bl@@ ank scre@@ en , for about a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a second ."
"So you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a m@@ ask , then the second picture , then a m@@ ask ."
"And this will just contin@@ ue , and your job as the sub@@ ject is to pres@@ s the bu@@ tt@@ on when you see the change ."
"So , show the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al picture for 2@@ 40 m@@ illi@@ secon@@ ds . B@@ l@@ ank ."
S@@ how the next picture for 2@@ 40 m@@ illi@@ secon@@ ds . B@@ l@@ ank .
"And keep going , until the sub@@ ject pres@@ ses the bu@@ tt@@ on , saying , &quot; I see the change . &quot;"
So now we &apos;re going to be sub@@ jects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . S@@ ome exam@@ pl@@ es .

C@@ an everybody see ? A@@ ll right .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , R@@ en@@ s@@ ink &apos;s sub@@ jects took only a little bit more than a second to pres@@ s the bu@@ tt@@ on ."
C@@ an you see that one ?
2@@ .@@ 9 secon@@ ds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the ro@@ of of that bar@@ n ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s easy .
I@@ s it a bri@@ dge or a doc@@ k ?
"There are a few more really dr@@ am@@ atic ones , and then I &apos;ll cl@@ ose ."
I want you to see a few that are partic@@ ul@@ arly stri@@ king .
This one because it &apos;s so large and yet it &apos;s pretty hard to see .
C@@ an you see it ?
A@@ u@@ dience : Y@@ es .
D@@ an D@@ en@@ ne@@ t@@ t : S@@ e@@ e the s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws going back and for@@ th ? P@@ re@@ tty big .
So 1@@ 5@@ .@@ 5 secon@@ ds is the me@@ di@@ an time for sub@@ jects in his experiment there .
"I love this one . I &apos;ll end with this one , just because it &apos;s such an ob@@ vi@@ ous and important thing ."
How many still don &apos;t see it ? How many still don &apos;t see it ?
How many eng@@ ines on the wing of that B@@ o@@ e@@ ing ?
( Laughter ) R@@ ight in the middle of the picture !
Th@@ an@@ ks very much for your att@@ en@@ tion .
"What I wanted to show you is that scienti@@ sts , using their fr@@ om@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ outside , thir@@ d@@ -@@ person me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dre@@ am of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity on your own consciousness that you think you are ."
And we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
"@@ J@@ e@@ ff H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , this mor@@ ning , was descri@@ b@@ ing his att@@ emp@@ t to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence ."
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
"H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard M@@ e@@ dic@@ al S@@ cho@@ ol once — I was at a talk — direc@@ tor of the la@@ b said , &quot; &quot; I@@ n our la@@ b , we have a saying ."
"If you work on one neur@@ on , that &apos;s neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence ."
"If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psycho@@ logy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down ."
Thank you very much .

"&quot; &quot; I@@ n the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance is the arti@@ fic@@ er ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the fundamental prin@@ ci@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a per@@ f@@ ect and beautiful machine , it is not requ@@ is@@ ite to know how to make it ."
"This pro@@ posi@@ tion will be found on care@@ ful exam@@ in@@ ation to ex@@ pres@@ s , in con@@ den@@ sed form , the ess@@ ential pur@@ port of the Th@@ e@@ ory , and to ex@@ pres@@ s in a few words all M@@ r@@ .

A cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ist p@@ am@@ ph@@ let has this wonderful p@@ age in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ w@@ o : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pain@@ ting that didn ’ t have a pain@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any c@@ ar that didn ’ t have a ma@@ ker ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the abo@@ ve , give deta@@ il@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ h@@ a ! I mean , it really is a stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
You would have thought it st@@ ands to reason that desig@@ n requ@@ i@@ res an intellig@@ ent desig@@ ner .
But D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws that it ’ s just f@@ al@@ se .
"T@@ o@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ’ s other stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It st@@ ands to reason that we love cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ a@@ ke because it is s@@ we@@ et .
G@@ u@@ ys go for girls like this because they are se@@ x@@ y .
We ad@@ ore b@@ ab@@ ies because they ’ re so c@@ ute .
"And , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ kes because they are fun@@ n@@ y ."
This is all bac@@ k@@ wards . It is . And D@@ ar@@ w@@ in sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with s@@ we@@ et . O@@ ur s@@ we@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is basically an ev@@ ol@@ ved su@@ g@@ ar de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , because su@@ g@@ ar is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ ru@@ de@@ ly , and that ’ s why we like su@@ g@@ ar ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is s@@ we@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because h@@ on@@ ey is s@@ we@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically s@@ we@@ et about h@@ on@@ ey ."
"If you looked at gl@@ uc@@ ose m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es ti@@ ll you were bl@@ ind , you wouldn ’ t see why they ta@@ sted s@@ we@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re s@@ we@@ et .
"So if you think first there was s@@ wee@@ t@@ ness , and then we ev@@ ol@@ ved to like s@@ wee@@ t@@ ness , you ’ ve got it bac@@ k@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way r@@ ound ."
S@@ wee@@ t@@ ness was born with the w@@ ir@@ ing which ev@@ ol@@ ved .
And there ’ s nothing in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically se@@ x@@ y about these young la@@ dies .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on ear@@ th do you get ch@@ im@@ ps to m@@ ate ?"
"Now you might think , ah , there ’ s a solu@@ tion : h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ations ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a qu@@ ic@@ ker way ."
"@@ J@@ ust w@@ ire the ch@@ im@@ ps up to love that look , and app@@ aren@@ tly they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ im@@ ps ev@@ ol@@ ved our different ways ."
"We bec@@ ame bal@@ d@@ -@@ bo@@ died , o@@ dd@@ ly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we ha@@ dn ’ t , then probably this would be the he@@ ight of se@@ x@@ iness ."
O@@ ur s@@ we@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an ev@@ ol@@ ved and inst@@ inc@@ tual pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy food .
It wasn ’ t desig@@ ned for cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ a@@ ke .
C@@ ho@@ col@@ ate c@@ a@@ ke is a super@@ norm@@ al s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ i@@ k@@ o T@@ in@@ ber@@ g@@ en , who did his fam@@ ous experim@@ ents with g@@ ul@@ ls , where he found that that or@@ an@@ ge sp@@ ot on the g@@ ul@@ l ’ s be@@ ak — if he made a big@@ ger , or@@ an@@ ger sp@@ ot the g@@ ul@@ l ch@@ ic@@ ks would p@@ ec@@ k at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ pers@@ tim@@ ul@@ us for them , and they lo@@ ved it ."
"What we see with , say , cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ a@@ ke is it ’ s a super@@ norm@@ al s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us to tw@@ e@@ ak our desig@@ n w@@ ir@@ ing ."
And there are lots of super@@ norm@@ al s@@ tim@@ ul@@ i ; cho@@ col@@ ate c@@ a@@ ke is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ norm@@ al s@@ tim@@ ul@@ i for se@@ x@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ norm@@ al s@@ tim@@ ul@@ i for c@@ ut@@ en@@ ess . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love b@@ ab@@ ies , and that we not be put off by , say , mess@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers ."
"So b@@ ab@@ ies have to at@@ tr@@ act our aff@@ ec@@ tion and our n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a rec@@ ent study sho@@ ws that mo@@ thers pre@@ f@@ er the sm@@ ell of the di@@ r@@ ty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own b@@ ab@@ y ."
So nature works on many lev@@ els here .
"But now , if b@@ ab@@ ies didn ’ t look the way they do — if b@@ ab@@ ies looked like this , that ’ s what we would find ad@@ or@@ able , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , o@@ h my go@@ o@@ d@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the stran@@ ge in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , fin@@ ally what about fun@@ n@@ y . My answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s di@@ r@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a po@@ wer@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
It ’ s a neur@@ al system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a gr@@ u@@ b@@ by cl@@ er@@ ical job .
O@@ ur b@@ um@@ per s@@ tic@@ ker for this view is that this is the jo@@ y of de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using hum@@ or as a sort of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic pro@@ be by s@@ w@@ it@@ ch@@ ing hum@@ or on and off , by tur@@ ning the kno@@ b on a jo@@ ke — now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y ... o@@ h , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..@@ ."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ n@@ y — in this way , we can actually learn something about the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain , the fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ le@@ y is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ le@@ y M@@ o@@ de@@ l .
"He ’ s a computer scienti@@ st , R@@ eg@@ in@@ al@@ d A@@ d@@ ams a psycho@@ logi@@ st , and there I am , and we ’ re pu@@ tting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"You si@@ r , that &apos;s three ."
And any@@ body on this side here ?
"W@@ ould somebody get us started by giving us a tw@@ o@@ -@@ dig@@ it number , ple@@ ase ?"
"A@@ B : 2@@ 2 . And another tw@@ o@@ -@@ dig@@ it number , si@@ r ?"

"You have a 1@@ 0-@@ dig@@ it cal@@ cul@@ at@@ or , si@@ r , as well ?"
"O@@ h , I did this row already ."
I &apos;m going to bre@@ ak the problem down into three parts .
"Now , let me rec@@ ap ."
Let me explain what that is .

"@@ 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2 becom@@ es co@@ o@@ ki@@ e f@@ is@@ sion , co@@ o@@ ki@@ e f@@ is@@ sion is 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 2@@ 2 ."
"That seems right , I &apos;ll go on . C@@ oo@@ ki@@ e f@@ is@@ sion , O@@ K ."
A@@ u@@ dience : Y@@ eah ! A@@ B : G@@ ood .
Thank you very much .
"Now , not@@ ice that the lead@@ er em@@ br@@ ac@@ es him as an equ@@ al ."
It ta@@ kes gu@@ ts to st@@ and out like that .
So a mov@@ ement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m . This is the ti@@ p@@ ping point .
"And what a per@@ f@@ ect place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
"But there is a new , techno@@ logical in@@ stitu@@ tion that will fundam@@ ent@@ ally change how we ex@@ change value , and it &apos;s called the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in ."
"Now , that &apos;s a pretty bo@@ ld st@@ at@@ ement , but if you take nothing else away from this talk , I actually want you to remember that while bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in technology is relati@@ vely new , it &apos;s also a contin@@ u@@ ation of a very human story , and the story is this ."
"As hum@@ ans , we find ways to lo@@ wer un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty about one another so that we can ex@@ change value ."
"He p@@ ass@@ ed away at the end of 20@@ 15 , but N@@ or@@ th pi@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ed what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; new in@@ stitu@@ ti@@ onal econom@@ ics . &quot; &quot; And what he me@@ ant by in@@ stitu@@ tions were really just form@@ al r@@ ul@@ es like a con@@ stitu@@ tion , and in@@ form@@ al con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts , like bri@@ b@@ ery ."
"As our societies gre@@ w more comple@@ x and our tr@@ ad@@ e r@@ out@@ es gre@@ w more dist@@ ant , we built up more form@@ al in@@ stitu@@ tions , in@@ stitu@@ tions like b@@ an@@ ks for curren@@ c@@ y , govern@@ ments , cor@@ por@@ ations ."
"As D@@ ou@@ gl@@ ass N@@ or@@ th saw it , in@@ stitu@@ tions are a to@@ ol to lo@@ wer un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty so that we can con@@ n@@ ect and ex@@ change all kinds of value in society ."
So what is the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in ?
"The trans@@ ac@@ tions are sec@@ u@@ red through cr@@ yp@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ y , and over time , that trans@@ action history gets loc@@ ked in bloc@@ ks of data that are then cr@@ yp@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ ically l@@ in@@ ked together and sec@@ u@@ red ."
"This cre@@ ates an im@@ m@@ ut@@ able , un@@ for@@ ge@@ able rec@@ or@@ d of all of the trans@@ ac@@ tions across this ne@@ t@@ work ."
This rec@@ or@@ d is re@@ p@@ lic@@ ated on every computer that us@@ es the ne@@ t@@ work .
It &apos;s not an ap@@ p .
It &apos;s not a comp@@ any .
I think it &apos;s cl@@ os@@ est in descri@@ p@@ tion to something like W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia .
We can see everything on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia .
It &apos;s a comp@@ os@@ ite view that &apos;s con@@ st@@ an@@ tly chang@@ ing and being up@@ d@@ ated .
"O@@ n W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , it &apos;s an op@@ en pl@@ at@@ form that st@@ o@@ res words and imag@@ es and the changes to that data over time ."
"O@@ n the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in , you can think of it as an op@@ en in@@ f@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture that st@@ o@@ res many kinds of as@@ se@@ ts ."
"It st@@ o@@ res the history of cu@@ st@@ o@@ di@@ an@@ ship , ow@@ ner@@ ship and loc@@ ation for as@@ se@@ ts like the dig@@ ital curren@@ c@@ y B@@ it@@ co@@ in , other dig@@ ital as@@ se@@ ts like a ti@@ t@@ le of ow@@ ner@@ ship of I@@ P ."
"It could be a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , a con@@ tr@@ act , real world ob@@ jects , even pers@@ onal i@@ d@@ enti@@ fi@@ able information ."
"So let &apos;s take the first example , not kno@@ wing who we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with ."
S@@ ay I want to bu@@ y a used smar@@ t@@ ph@@ one on e@@ B@@ ay .
The first thing I &apos;m going to do is look up who I &apos;m bu@@ ying from .
A@@ re they a power us@@ er ?
"D@@ o they have great re@@ vie@@ ws and r@@ at@@ ings , or do they have no pro@@ fi@@ le at all ?"
"R@@ evi@@ e@@ ws , r@@ at@@ ings , ch@@ ec@@ k@@ mar@@ ks : these are the at@@ te@@ st@@ ations about our i@@ d@@ enti@@ ties that we co@@ b@@ ble together today and use to lo@@ wer un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty about who we &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with ."
But the problem is they &apos;re very fr@@ ag@@ men@@ ted .
Th@@ ink about how many prof@@ il@@ es you have .
"B@@ loc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins al@@ low for us to create an op@@ en , global pl@@ at@@ form on which to st@@ ore any at@@ te@@ st@@ ation about any in@@ divi@@ du@@ al from any s@@ our@@ ce ."
This al@@ lo@@ ws us to create a us@@ er@@ -@@ contro@@ l@@ led port@@ able i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty .
"@@ U@@ sing the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in , we can create a s@@ ha@@ red reality across n@@ on@@ tru@@ st@@ ing enti@@ ties ."
Th@@ ink back to W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia .
"It &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ red dat@@ ab@@ ase , and even though it has m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple read@@ ers and m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple wr@@ it@@ ers at the same time , it has one single tru@@ th ."
We can create a dec@@ en@@ tr@@ ali@@ zed dat@@ ab@@ ase that has the same eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y of a mon@@ op@@ o@@ ly without actually cre@@ ating that cen@@ tr@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"It means for con@@ sum@@ ers , we can have a lot more tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y ."
This is a whole new world in ter@@ ms of our vi@@ si@@ bility .
"So I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about how bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins can lo@@ wer our un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties about i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty and how they change what we mean about tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y in long dist@@ anc@@ es and comple@@ x tr@@ ad@@ es , like in a sup@@ ply cha@@ in ."
"The last un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty that we often face is one of the most op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ne@@ g@@ ing ."
What if you don &apos;t s@@ end me the smar@@ t@@ ph@@ one ?
C@@ an I get my money back ?
"B@@ loc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins al@@ low us to wr@@ ite co@@ de , b@@ in@@ ding con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts , between in@@ divi@@ du@@ als and then gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that those con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts will be@@ ar out without a thir@@ d par@@ ty en@@ for@@ c@@ er ."
"So if we look at the smar@@ t@@ ph@@ one example , you could think about es@@ c@@ row ."
"You are fin@@ anc@@ ing that ph@@ one , but you don &apos;t need to re@@ le@@ ase the fun@@ ds until you can ver@@ i@@ f@@ y that all the condi@@ tions have been m@@ et ."
You got the ph@@ one .
"It means a lot of human economic acti@@ vity can get coll@@ at@@ er@@ ali@@ zed and au@@ tom@@ ated , and p@@ us@@ h a lot of human inter@@ ven@@ tion to the ed@@ g@@ es , the places where information mo@@ ves from the real world to the bloc@@ k@@ cha@@ in ."
"So rather than all of our un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties s@@ lowing us down and requ@@ ir@@ ing in@@ stitu@@ tions like b@@ an@@ ks , our govern@@ ments , our cor@@ por@@ ations , we can actually har@@ ness all of that coll@@ ec@@ tive un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty and use it to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and ex@@ change more and fa@@ ster and more op@@ en ."
It &apos;s also an in@@ no@@ v@@ ation in computer science .
"B@@ loc@@ k@@ cha@@ ins give us the techno@@ logical cap@@ ability of cre@@ ating a rec@@ or@@ d of human ex@@ change , of ex@@ change of curren@@ c@@ y , of all kinds of dig@@ ital and physical as@@ se@@ ts , even of our own pers@@ onal at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es , in a t@@ ot@@ ally new way ."
Thank you .

"I think I underst@@ ood that it &apos;s coming , it off@@ ers a lot of p@@ ot@@ ential , and it &apos;s comple@@ x ."
What is your es@@ tim@@ ate for the r@@ ate of ad@@ op@@ tion ?
What is a paren@@ t ? What is a paren@@ t ?
"It &apos;s not an easy question . T@@ o@@ day we have ad@@ op@@ tion ,"
S@@ h@@ all we tell our child about the s@@ per@@ m d@@ on@@ ation ?
"If so , when ?"
What words to use ?
"S@@ per@@ m d@@ on@@ ors are often re@@ fer@@ red to as &quot; &quot; bio@@ logical fa@@ thers , &quot; &quot; but should we really be using the word &quot; &quot; father ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s a philosop@@ her and social scienti@@ st , I have been stud@@ ying these questions about the con@@ cept of paren@@ th@@ ood ."
"But today , I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children ."
"I will show you that they know what mat@@ ters most in a family , even though their family looks a little different ."
I will show you their cre@@ ative ways of de@@ al@@ ing with t@@ ough questions .
But I will also show you the parents &apos; un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ties .
"In this tre@@ at@@ ment tim@@ el@@ ine , you can see two poin@@ ts at which we conduc@@ ted inter@@ vie@@ ws ."
"We in@@ clu@@ ded he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al cou@@ pl@@ es , where the man for some reason did not have go@@ o@@ d@@ -@@ qu@@ ality s@@ per@@ m , and l@@ es@@ bi@@ an cou@@ pl@@ es who ob@@ vi@@ ously needed to find s@@ per@@ m el@@ se@@ where ."
We also in@@ clu@@ ded children .
I wanted to know how those children de@@ fine con@@ cep@@ ts like paren@@ th@@ ood and family .
"In fact , that is what I asked them , only not in that way ."
I dre@@ w an app@@ le t@@ ree instead .
"This way , I could ask ab@@ str@@ act , philosop@@ h@@ ical questions in a way that did not make them run off ."
And that ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates my resear@@ ch appro@@ ach .
"B@@ y desig@@ ning tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es like this , I can bring as little mean@@ ing and cont@@ ent as possible to the inter@@ view , because I want to hear that from them ."
I asked them : What would your family look like if it were an app@@ le t@@ ree ?
"And they could take a p@@ ap@@ er app@@ le for everyone who , in their view , was a mem@@ ber of the family , wr@@ ite a name on it and h@@ ang it wh@@ er@@ ever they wanted ."
And I would ask questions .
M@@ ost children started with a paren@@ t or a si@@ bl@@ ing .
"One started with &quot; &quot; B@@ ox@@ er , &quot; &quot; the de@@ ad do@@ g of his gr@@ and@@ parents ."
"A@@ t this point , n@@ one of the children started m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing the d@@ on@@ or ."
"So , I asked them about their bir@@ th story ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore you were born , it was just your mo@@ m and d@@ ad , or mo@@ m and mom@@ my ."
C@@ an you tell me how you came into the family ? &quot; &quot; And they expl@@ ained .
"One said , &quot; &quot; My parents did not have good see@@ ds , but there are fri@@ en@@ dly men out there who have sp@@ are see@@ ds ."
"S@@ he put the see@@ ds in her b@@ el@@ ly — some@@ how — and her b@@ el@@ ly gre@@ w really big , and there I was . &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m ."
"So only when they started m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing the d@@ on@@ or , I asked questions about him , using their own words ."
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t put this one up there with the others ."
He &apos;s not part of my family .
But I will not put him on the ground .
That &apos;s too co@@ ld and too hard .
"I think he should be in the tr@@ un@@ k , because he made my family possible ."
"If he would not have done this , that would really be sa@@ d because my family would not be here , and I would not be here . &quot; &quot; So also , parents con@@ struc@@ ted family tal@@ es — tal@@ es to tell their children ."
And why not ?
It &apos;s their way of expl@@ ain@@ ing ; their do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself with family n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves .
D@@ I@@ Y .
"And these stories were high@@ ly di@@ ver@@ se , but they all had one thing in common : it was a tal@@ e of lon@@ g@@ ing for a child and a qu@@ est for that child ."
It was about how speci@@ al and how de@@ e@@ ply lo@@ ved their child was .
And resear@@ ch so far sho@@ ws that these children are doing fine .
They do not have more problems than other kids .
Un@@ der@@ l@@ ying was a fear that their children might dis@@ appro@@ ve and would re@@ ject the n@@ on@@ -@@ gen@@ e@@ tic paren@@ t .
Well .
I want to tell you about a te@@ en@@ age bo@@ y .
He was d@@ on@@ or@@ -@@ con@@ ce@@ i@@ ved but not part of our study .
You &apos;re not even my father ! &quot; &quot; That was exactly what the parents in our study fe@@ ared .
"Now , the bo@@ y so@@ on f@@ el@@ t sor@@ ry , and they made up ."
But it is the re@@ action of his father that is most interesting .
"He said , &quot; &quot; This out@@ bur@@ st had nothing to do with the l@@ ack of a gen@@ e@@ tic l@@ ink ."
It &apos;s what they do at that age .
Th@@ ese things happen in all fam@@ ili@@ es .
"And every now and then , all parents may won@@ der : A@@ m I a good enough paren@@ t ?"
"Th@@ ese parents , too ."
"They , abo@@ ve all , wanted to do what &apos;s best for their child ."
But they also sometimes wonder@@ ed : A@@ m I a real paren@@ t ?
"E@@ ven 10 years later , they still remember the adv@@ ice they were given ."
The coun@@ sel@@ or said so . &quot; &quot; Well .
I don &apos;t know ; that &apos;s quite different from how we respon@@ d to children &apos;s questions .
"We will not say , &quot; No , mil@@ k is not made in a fac@@ t@@ ory . &quot;"
"So something stran@@ ge happened here , and of course these children not@@ ic@@ ed that ."
"One bo@@ y said , &quot; &quot; I asked my parents lo@@ ads of questions , but they ac@@ ted really we@@ ir@@ d ."
"So , you know , I have a fri@@ end at school , and she &apos;s made in the same way ."
"When I have a question , I just go and ask her . &quot; &quot; C@@ le@@ ver guy ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m sol@@ ved .
And that &apos;s the stran@@ ge thing about adv@@ ice .
"When we off@@ er people p@@ ills , we g@@ a@@ ther evidence first ."
And adv@@ ice ?
It should be adv@@ ice that there is evidence for — evidence that it actually impro@@ ves patients &apos; lives .
So the philosop@@ her in me would now like to off@@ er you a par@@ a@@ do@@ x : I ad@@ vi@@ se you to stop fol@@ lowing adv@@ ice .
"But , y@@ es ."
( Applause ) I will not end here with what went wrong ; I would not be doing j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce to the war@@ m@@ th we found in those fam@@ ili@@ es .
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber the bo@@ o@@ ks and the tri@@ p to the f@@ ar@@ m@@ er ?
"When parents do things that work for them , they do br@@ illi@@ ant things ."
And we do not need to be prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als to create those .
"In that case , be@@ ar in mind three things ."
W@@ or@@ k with adv@@ ice that works for your family .
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber — you &apos;re the exper@@ t , because you live your family life ."
"And fin@@ ally , believe in your abili@@ ties and your cre@@ ati@@ vity , because you can do it yourself ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"I was depres@@ sed ; I said , but I can make a difference in this field ."
So why don &apos;t we have a good theory of bra@@ ins ?
"R@@ e@@ ality , though — I call it real intelligence ."
It can att@@ ack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
But the ro@@ bot@@ ics part is the har@@ d@@ est part . That &apos;s old brain . That &apos;s really hard .
I have a con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to make .
"But first , I want you to make a little con@@ f@@ es@@ sion to me ."
"In the past year , I want you to just ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;ve experienc@@ ed relati@@ vely little stress ."
A@@ n@@ y@@ one ?
How about a moder@@ ate amount of stress ?
Wh@@ o has experienc@@ ed a lot of stress ?
Y@@ eah . M@@ e too .
But that is not my con@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
"M@@ y con@@ f@@ es@@ sion is this : I am a health psycho@@ logi@@ st , and my mis@@ sion is to help people be happ@@ ier and health@@ ier ."
"But I fear that something I &apos;ve been teach@@ ing for the last 10 years is doing more har@@ m than good , and it has to do with stress ."
"For years I &apos;ve been t@@ elling people , stress makes you s@@ ick ."
It incre@@ ases the ri@@ s@@ k of everything from the common co@@ ld to car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease .
"B@@ as@@ ically , I &apos;ve tur@@ ned stress into the ene@@ my ."
"But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
Let me start with the study that made me re@@ think my whole appro@@ ach to stress .
"This study tr@@ ac@@ ked 3@@ 0,000 ad@@ ults in the United States for eight years , and they started by as@@ king people , &quot; How much stress have you experienc@@ ed in the last year ? &quot;"
"They also asked , &quot; Do you believe that stress is har@@ m@@ ful for your health ? &quot;"
And then they used public death rec@@ or@@ ds to find out who died .
( Laughter ) O@@ kay .
S@@ ome bad news first .
People who experienc@@ ed a lot of stress in the pre@@ vi@@ ous year had a 4@@ 3 percent increas@@ ed ri@@ s@@ k of d@@ ying .
But that was only true for the people who also beli@@ ev@@ ed that stress is har@@ m@@ ful for your health .
( Laughter ) People who experienc@@ ed a lot of stress but did not view stress as har@@ m@@ ful were no more likely to die .
"Now the resear@@ ch@@ ers es@@ tim@@ ated that over the eight years they were tr@@ ac@@ king de@@ a@@ ths , 18@@ 2@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans died pre@@ mat@@ u@@ re@@ ly , not from stress , but from the belie@@ f that stress is bad for you ."
"( Laughter ) That is over 20@@ ,000 de@@ a@@ ths a year ."
( Laughter ) You can see why this study f@@ re@@ a@@ ked me out .
Here I &apos;ve been sp@@ en@@ ding so much energy t@@ elling people stress is bad for your health .
So this study got me wonder@@ ing : C@@ an chang@@ ing how you think about stress make you health@@ ier ?
And here the science says y@@ es .
"When you change your mind about stress , you can change your body &apos;s respon@@ se to stress ."
"Now to explain how this works , I want you all to pre@@ t@@ end that you are par@@ tici@@ pan@@ ts in a study desig@@ ned to stress you out ."
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
"You come into the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , and you &apos;re told you have to give a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ minut@@ e im@@ prom@@ p@@ t@@ u spe@@ ec@@ h on your pers@@ onal we@@ ak@@ n@@ ess@@ es to a pan@@ el of exper@@ t ev@@ al@@ u@@ at@@ ors sit@@ ting right in front of you , and to make sure you feel the pres@@ sure , there are b@@ right ligh@@ ts and a cam@@ er@@ a in your face , kind of like this ."
"( Laughter ) And the ev@@ al@@ u@@ at@@ ors have been tr@@ ained to give you disc@@ our@@ aging , n@@ on@@ -@@ ver@@ b@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back , like this ."
"( E@@ x@@ hal@@ es ) ( Laughter ) Now that you &apos;re suff@@ ici@@ ently de@@ mor@@ ali@@ zed , time for part two : a mat@@ h test ."
"And un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to you , the experim@@ en@@ ter has been tr@@ ained to har@@ ass you d@@ uring it ."
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fu@@ n .
F@@ or me .
O@@ kay .
( Laughter ) I want you all to coun@@ t bac@@ k@@ wards from 9@@ 9@@ 6 in incre@@ ments of se@@ ven .
"You &apos;re going to do this out l@@ ou@@ d , as f@@ ast as you can , star@@ ting with 9@@ 9@@ 6 ."
G@@ o !
( A@@ u@@ dience coun@@ ting ) G@@ o fa@@ ster . F@@ ast@@ er ple@@ ase .
You &apos;re going too s@@ low .
"( A@@ u@@ dience coun@@ ting ) S@@ top . S@@ top , stop , stop ."
That guy made a mi@@ sta@@ ke .
We are going to have to start all over again .
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?"
"O@@ kay , so you get the idea ."
"Y@@ our heart might be p@@ oun@@ ding , you might be bre@@ a@@ thing fa@@ ster , maybe bre@@ a@@ king out into a s@@ we@@ at ."
"And norm@@ ally , we inter@@ pre@@ t these physical changes as an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty or si@@ g@@ ns that we are@@ n &apos;t cop@@ ing very well with the pres@@ sure ."
Now that is exactly what par@@ tici@@ pan@@ ts were told in a study conduc@@ ted at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity .
"B@@ e@@ fore they went through the social stress test , they were t@@ au@@ ght to re@@ think their stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful ."
That p@@ oun@@ ding heart is pre@@ par@@ ing you for action .
"If you &apos;re bre@@ a@@ thing fa@@ ster , it &apos;s no problem ."
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ g@@ en to your brain .
"And par@@ tici@@ pan@@ ts who learned to view the stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful for their per@@ form@@ ance , well , they were less st@@ res@@ sed out , less an@@ x@@ i@@ ous , more con@@ fi@@ dent , but the most f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating fin@@ ding to me was how their physical stress respon@@ se changed ."
And this is one of the reas@@ ons that ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic stress is sometimes as@@ soci@@ ated with car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease .
It &apos;s not really health@@ y to be in this state all the time .
"But in the study , when par@@ tici@@ pan@@ ts vie@@ wed their stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful , their b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ sel@@ s st@@ ay@@ ed rel@@ ax@@ ed like this ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir heart was still p@@ oun@@ ding , but this is a much health@@ ier car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar pro@@ fi@@ le ."
It actually looks a lot like what happens in mom@@ ents of jo@@ y and cour@@ age .
"O@@ ver a li@@ fe@@ time of st@@ res@@ s@@ ful experi@@ ences , this one bio@@ logical change could be the difference between a st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed heart att@@ ack at age 50 and living well into your 9@@ 0s ."
"And this is really what the new science of stress re@@ ve@@ als , that how you think about stress mat@@ ters ."
So my go@@ al as a health psycho@@ logi@@ st has changed .
I no longer want to get ri@@ d of your stress .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little inter@@ ven@@ tion .
"And when you view stress in that way , your body beli@@ ev@@ es you , and your stress respon@@ se becom@@ es health@@ ier ."
"Now I said I have over a dec@@ ad@@ e of de@@ mon@@ i@@ zing stress to re@@ de@@ e@@ m my@@ self from , so we are going to do one more inter@@ ven@@ tion ."
"I want to tell you about one of the most under@@ -@@ ap@@ preci@@ ated as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of the stress respon@@ se , and the idea is this : St@@ ress makes you social ."
"T@@ o understand this side of stress , we need to talk about a h@@ orm@@ one , oxytocin , and I know oxytocin has already g@@ ot@@ ten as much hy@@ pe as a h@@ orm@@ one can get ."
"It even has its own c@@ ute n@@ ic@@ k@@ name , the cu@@ ddle h@@ orm@@ one , because it &apos;s re@@ le@@ as@@ ed when you hu@@ g someone ."
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is inv@@ ol@@ ved in .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin is a neuro@@ -@@ h@@ orm@@ one .
It fin@@ e-@@ t@@ un@@ es your brain &apos;s social inst@@ inc@@ ts .
It pri@@ m@@ es you to do things that stre@@ ng@@ then cl@@ ose relation@@ shi@@ ps .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin makes you cra@@ ve physical cont@@ act with your friends and family .
It en@@ h@@ anc@@ es your emp@@ ath@@ y .
It even makes you more w@@ ill@@ ing to help and sup@@ port the people you care about .
S@@ ome people have even su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted we should s@@ n@@ ort oxytocin ...
to become more comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate and car@@ ing .
But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
It &apos;s a stress h@@ orm@@ one .
Y@@ our p@@ it@@ u@@ it@@ ary g@@ land p@@ um@@ ps this stuff out as part of the stress respon@@ se .
It &apos;s as much a part of your stress respon@@ se as the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine that makes your heart p@@ ound .
"And when oxytocin is re@@ le@@ as@@ ed in the stress respon@@ se , it is moti@@ v@@ ating you to see@@ k sup@@ port ."
"Y@@ our bio@@ logical stress respon@@ se is n@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ing you to tell someone how you feel , instead of bot@@ t@@ ling it up ."
Y@@ our stress respon@@ se wan@@ ts to make sure you not@@ ice when someone else in your life is str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling so that you can sup@@ port each other .
"O@@ kay , so how is kno@@ wing this side of stress going to make you health@@ ier ?"
"Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain ."
It &apos;s a natural an@@ ti@@ -@@ in@@ fl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory .
It also hel@@ ps your b@@ loo@@ d v@@ es@@ sel@@ s st@@ ay rel@@ ax@@ ed d@@ uring stress .
But my fav@@ or@@ ite eff@@ ect on the body is actually on the heart .
"Y@@ our heart has re@@ cep@@ tors for this h@@ orm@@ one , and oxytocin hel@@ ps heart cells re@@ gener@@ ate and he@@ al from any st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ed d@@ am@@ age ."
This stress h@@ orm@@ one stre@@ ng@@ th@@ ens your heart .
And the co@@ ol thing is that all of these physical b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of oxytocin are en@@ h@@ anc@@ ed by social cont@@ act and social sup@@ port .
"So when you re@@ ach out to others under stress , e@@ ither to see@@ k sup@@ port or to help someone else , you re@@ le@@ ase more of this h@@ orm@@ one , your stress respon@@ se becom@@ es health@@ ier , and you actually re@@ co@@ ver fa@@ ster from stress ."
"I find this ama@@ zing , that your stress respon@@ se has a buil@@ t-@@ in m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism for stress re@@ si@@ li@@ ence , and that m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism is human connec@@ tion ."
I want to fin@@ ish by t@@ elling you about one more study .
"This study tr@@ ac@@ ked about 1@@ ,000 ad@@ ults in the United States , and they ran@@ g@@ ed in age from 3@@ 4 to 9@@ 3 , and they started the study by as@@ king , &quot; How much stress have you experienc@@ ed in the last year ? &quot;"
"O@@ kay , so the bad news first : F@@ or every maj@@ or st@@ res@@ s@@ ful life experience , like fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al diffic@@ ul@@ ties or family cri@@ s@@ is , that increas@@ ed the ri@@ s@@ k of d@@ ying by 30 percent ."
But — and I hope you are exp@@ ec@@ ting a &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; by now — but that wasn &apos;t true for everyone .
People who sp@@ ent time car@@ ing for others sho@@ wed ab@@ solu@@ tely no st@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ rel@@ ated increase in d@@ ying .
Z@@ er@@ o .
C@@ ar@@ ing cre@@ ated re@@ si@@ li@@ ence .
And so we see once again that the har@@ m@@ ful effec@@ ts of stress on your health are not in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
How you think and how you act can trans@@ form your experience of stress .
"When you cho@@ ose to view your stress respon@@ se as hel@@ p@@ ful , you create the bio@@ logy of cour@@ age ."
"And when you cho@@ ose to con@@ n@@ ect with others under stress , you can create re@@ si@@ li@@ ence ."
"Now I wouldn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily ask for more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful experi@@ ences in my life , but this science has given me a whole new ap@@ preci@@ ation for stress ."
St@@ ress gi@@ ves us ac@@ cess to our hear@@ ts .
"The comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate heart that fin@@ ds jo@@ y and mean@@ ing in connec@@ ting with others , and y@@ es , your p@@ oun@@ ding physical heart , working so hard to give you stre@@ ng@@ th and energy ."
"And when you cho@@ ose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty pro@@ found st@@ at@@ ement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can tr@@ ust yourself to h@@ and@@ le life &apos;s chall@@ eng@@ es .
And you &apos;re remem@@ b@@ ering that you don &apos;t have to face them al@@ one .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : This is kind of ama@@ zing , what you &apos;re t@@ elling us ."
It seems ama@@ zing to me that a belie@@ f about stress can make so much difference to someone &apos;s life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y .
"It &apos;s equ@@ ally wi@@ se to go for the st@@ res@@ s@@ ful job so long as you believe that you can h@@ and@@ le it , in some sense ?"
"In 19@@ 8@@ 7 , T@@ ina L@@ or@@ d found her@@ self in quite the pic@@ k@@ le ."
C@@ or@@ d &apos;s mother M@@ ari@@ a was thr@@ ill@@ ed until they ho@@ o@@ ked up again .
"T@@ ina had already been ki@@ d@@ n@@ app@@ ed , str@@ app@@ ed to a ra@@ ft and s@@ ent over a wat@@ er@@ f@@ all ."
She and her b@@ ab@@ y were pre@@ sum@@ ed de@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; S@@ top ! &quot; &quot; she scre@@ am@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; A@@ m I too l@@ ate ?
"C@@ or@@ d , I &apos;ve come so far ."
"( Laughter ) Now , if you &apos;ve ever seen a so@@ ap oper@@ a , you know the stories and the char@@ ac@@ ters can be ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ated , lar@@ ger than life , and if you &apos;re a f@@ an , you find that ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation fu@@ n , and if you &apos;re not , maybe you find them m@@ el@@ o@@ dr@@ am@@ atic or un@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ."
"M@@ ay@@ be you think wat@@ ch@@ ing so@@ ap oper@@ as is a wa@@ st@@ e of time , that their big@@ ness means their l@@ ess@@ ons are small or n@@ on@@ exist@@ ent ."
But I believe the op@@ pos@@ ite to be true .
"S@@ o@@ ap oper@@ as re@@ fl@@ ect life , just big@@ ger ."
So I know my stuff .
"( Laughter ) And y@@ es , so@@ ap oper@@ as are lar@@ ger than life , dr@@ am@@ a on a gr@@ and sc@@ ale , but our lives can be f@@ ill@@ ed with as much int@@ en@@ s@@ ity , and the sta@@ kes can feel just as dr@@ am@@ atic ."
We c@@ y@@ c@@ le through tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy and jo@@ y just like these char@@ ac@@ ters .
"And most import@@ an@@ tly , they show us it &apos;s never too l@@ ate to change your story ."
"So with that , let &apos;s start with so@@ ap oper@@ a l@@ es@@ son one : sur@@ ren@@ der is not an op@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; A@@ ll My Ch@@ il@@ dren &quot; &quot; &apos; s E@@ r@@ ic@@ a K@@ an@@ e was d@@ ay@@ time &apos;s ver@@ sion of S@@ car@@ le@@ t@@ t O &apos;@@ H@@ ar@@ a , a hy@@ per@@ bo@@ lic@@ ally self-@@ important prin@@ cess who de@@ ep down was sc@@ r@@ app@@ y and dar@@ ing ."
"Now , in her 4@@ 1 years on T@@ V , perhaps E@@ r@@ ic@@ a &apos;s most fam@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e is her al@@ one in the w@@ oo@@ ds su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly face to face with a g@@ ri@@ z@@ z@@ ly be@@ ar ."
"S@@ he scre@@ am@@ ed at the be@@ ar , &quot; &quot; You may not do this !@@ "

P@@ and@@ or@@ a &apos;s T@@ i@@ m W@@ est@@ er@@ gre@@ n kno@@ ws this better than most .
You might even call him the E@@ r@@ ic@@ a K@@ an@@ e of S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y .
They were out of cas@@ h the next year .
"Now , lots of comp@@ an@@ ies fo@@ ld at that point , but T@@ i@@ m ch@@ ose to fi@@ ght ."
He ma@@ x@@ ed out 11 cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds and r@@ ac@@ ked up six fi@@ gu@@ res in pers@@ onal de@@ b@@ t and it still wasn &apos;t enough .
"M@@ ore than 50 people de@@ fer@@ red two million dollars , and now , more than a dec@@ ad@@ e later , P@@ and@@ or@@ a is wor@@ th b@@ illions ."
"Now , this is sc@@ ary ."
It &apos;s an ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ment of need or f@@ al@@ li@@ bility .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ ani@@ e F@@ or@@ re@@ ster of &quot; &quot; The B@@ old and the B@@ e@@ au@@ ti@@ ful &quot; &quot; thought she was pretty dar@@ n speci@@ al .
"But after ne@@ arly 2@@ 5 years of e@@ p@@ ic fi@@ gh@@ ting , S@@ te@@ ph@@ ani@@ e got s@@ ick and let B@@ ro@@ o@@ ke in ."
D@@ ro@@ p your e@@ go .
L@@ i@@ fe is not about you .
"H@@ o@@ ward re@@ jo@@ ined the te@@ am in 200@@ 8 , and one of the first things he did was ap@@ o@@ logi@@ ze to all 18@@ 0,000 emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ."
He ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zed .
"And then he asked for help , h@@ on@@ est@@ y , and ideas in re@@ turn ."
"And now , St@@ ar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks has more than d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed its net re@@ ven@@ ue since H@@ o@@ ward came back ."
"It &apos;s not hel@@ ping any@@ one , le@@ ast of all you ."
S@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice your e@@ go .
You &apos;re not me@@ ant to be st@@ atic char@@ ac@@ ters .
"O@@ n tel@@ evi@@ sion , st@@ atic equ@@ als bor@@ ing and bor@@ ing equ@@ als fi@@ red ."
Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ters are sup@@ posed to grow and change .
"Now , on T@@ V , those d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic changes can make for some r@@ ough tran@@ si@@ tions , partic@@ ul@@ arly when a char@@ ac@@ ter is play@@ ed by one person y@@ est@@ er@@ day and play@@ ed by someone new today ."
R@@ ec@@ ast@@ ing happens all the time on so@@ aps .
"Now , there was always an ess@@ ential n@@ u@@ g@@ get of C@@ arly in there , but the char@@ ac@@ ter and the story ad@@ ap@@ ted to wh@@ om@@ ever was play@@ ing her ."
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
"We can cho@@ ose to d@@ ra@@ w a cir@@ c@@ le around our fe@@ et and st@@ ay in that sp@@ ot , or we can op@@ en ourselves to op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties like C@@ arly , who went from n@@ ur@@ sing stud@@ ent to h@@ ot@@ el ow@@ ner , or like J@@ u@@ li@@ a C@@ hi@@ ld ."
"We all have the power to in@@ i@@ ti@@ ate change in our lives , to ev@@ ol@@ ve and ad@@ ap@@ t ."
"We make the cho@@ ice , but sometimes life cho@@ os@@ es for us , and we don &apos;t get a he@@ ads up ."
S@@ ur@@ pri@@ se s@@ l@@ ams us in the face .
"You &apos;re fl@@ at on the ground , the air is g@@ one , and you need re@@ su@@ sc@@ it@@ ation ."
So th@@ ank go@@ o@@ d@@ ness for so@@ ap oper@@ a l@@ es@@ son four : res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion is possible .

( Laughter )"
"But before the tu@@ m@@ or could k@@ ill him , Mar@@ l@@ en@@ a sho@@ t him , and he tu@@ m@@ bl@@ ed off a cat@@ wal@@ k to his death ."
And so it went for 30 years .
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven when we saw the body , we knew better ."
He &apos;s called the P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x for a reason .
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
"As long as the show is still on the air , or you &apos;re still bre@@ a@@ thing , nothing is per@@ man@@ ent ."
R@@ es@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion is possible .
"Now , of course , just like life , so@@ ap oper@@ as do ul@@ tim@@ ately me@@ et the big fin@@ ale ."
It was six months of d@@ ying and I ro@@ de that tr@@ ain right into the m@@ oun@@ tain .
"( Laughter ) Th@@ ree months later , nothing was O@@ K ."
"That was when I wat@@ ched the fin@@ al e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de air , and I reali@@ zed the show was not the only f@@ at@@ ality ."
I was one too .
I just had to ta@@ p into everything I had ever learned about so@@ ap oper@@ as .
"I had to be bra@@ ve like E@@ r@@ ic@@ a and re@@ fu@@ se to sur@@ ren@@ der , so every day , I made a deci@@ sion to fi@@ ght ."
I had to be v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able like S@@ te@@ ph@@ ani@@ e and s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice my e@@ go .
I had to ask for help a lot of times across many st@@ ates .
"I had to be ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able like C@@ arly and ev@@ ol@@ ve my sk@@ ills , my min@@ d@@ set , and my cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es , and then I had to be re@@ si@@ li@@ ent , like S@@ te@@ f@@ an@@ o , and res@@ ur@@ rec@@ t my@@ self and my care@@ er like a p@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x from the as@@ h@@ es ."
E@@ ven@@ tually I got an inter@@ view .
"A@@ f@@ ter 15 years in news and en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , n@@ ine months of un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment and this one inter@@ view , I had an off@@ er for an en@@ try level job ."
I was 3@@ 7 years old and I was back from the de@@ ad .
"We will all experience what looks like an en@@ ding , and we can cho@@ ose to make it a beginning ."
"@@ K@@ ind of like T@@ ina , who m@@ ir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously survi@@ ved that wat@@ er@@ f@@ all , and because I h@@ ate to leave a c@@ li@@ ff@@ h@@ an@@ ger h@@ ang@@ ing , T@@ ina and C@@ or@@ d did get di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed , but they got re@@ marri@@ ed three times before the show went off the air in 20@@ 12 ."
"So remember , as long as there is bre@@ ath in your body , it &apos;s never too l@@ ate to change your story ."
Thank you .

I am B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ever before has the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; I am B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh &quot; &quot; e@@ lic@@ ited so much p@@ ity . ( Laughter )
I come from an is@@ land where many of us like to believe there &apos;s been a lot of contin@@ u@@ ity over the last thous@@ and years .
We t@@ end to have hi@@ st@@ or@@ ically im@@ posed change on others but done much less of it ourselves .
"So it came as an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck to me when I w@@ o@@ ke up on the mor@@ ning of J@@ un@@ e 2@@ 4 to disc@@ over that my country had v@@ ot@@ ed to leave the Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , my P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er had re@@ si@@ g@@ ned , and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land was consi@@ der@@ ing a re@@ fer@@ en@@ du@@ m that could bring to an end the very exist@@ ence of the United K@@ ing@@ dom ."
"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for many people , but it was also something that , over the fol@@ lowing se@@ ver@@ al days , cre@@ ated a comple@@ te political m@@ el@@ t@@ down in my country ."
"There were call@@ s for a second re@@ fer@@ en@@ du@@ m , almost as if , fol@@ lowing a sp@@ or@@ ts mat@@ ch , we could ask the op@@ posi@@ tion for a re@@ play ."
E@@ very@@ body was bl@@ am@@ ing everybody else .
They bl@@ am@@ ed the lead@@ er of the op@@ posi@@ tion for not fi@@ gh@@ ting it hard enough .

"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ gre@@ e of sho@@ ck that we &apos;ve experienc@@ ed since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ e@@ per struc@@ tur@@ al fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a ste@@ p back and ask two very bas@@ ic questions .
"F@@ ir@@ st , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respon@@ d ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present ?"
H@@ in@@ d@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ote sp@@ li@@ t along l@@ ines of age , education , cl@@ ass and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ically , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land that most stron@@ g@@ ly comm@@ it@@ ted to being part of the Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very str@@ ong am@@ bi@@ val@@ ence ."
Th@@ ose divi@@ sions are things we really need to recogni@@ ze and take ser@@ i@@ ously .
"But more prof@@ oun@@ dly , the v@@ ote teach@@ es us something about the nature of poli@@ tics today ."
Con@@ t@@ em@@ por@@ ary poli@@ tics is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about glob@@ ali@@ zation .
The f@@ au@@ l@@ t line of cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary poli@@ tics is between those that em@@ br@@ ace glob@@ ali@@ zation and those that fear glob@@ ali@@ zation .
But those ideas are ones that si@@ gni@@ f@@ y fear and ali@@ en@@ ation .
They re@@ present a re@@ treat back to@@ wards n@@ ati@@ on@@ al@@ ism and b@@ ord@@ ers in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The bl@@ ue are@@ as show R@@ e@@ ma@@ in and the red are@@ as L@@ e@@ ave .
"When I looked at this , what pers@@ on@@ ally struc@@ k me was the very little time in my life I &apos;ve actually sp@@ ent in many of the red are@@ as ."
"In some of those places , I didn &apos;t even know the nam@@ es of the v@@ ot@@ ing di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And the chall@@ en@@ ge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to n@@ ar@@ r@@ ate glob@@ ali@@ zation to those people , to recogni@@ ze that for those people who have not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily been to univers@@ ity , who ha@@ ven &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily gro@@ wn up with the In@@ ter@@ net , that don &apos;t get op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties to tra@@ v@@ el , they may be un@@ per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed by the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative that we find per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve in our often li@@ ber@@ al bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es . ( Applause )"
It means that we need to re@@ ach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the L@@ e@@ ave v@@ ote , a min@@ or@@ ity have pe@@ dd@@ led the poli@@ tics of fear and h@@ at@@ red , cre@@ ating li@@ es and mi@@ str@@ ust around , for inst@@ ance , the idea that the v@@ ote on Euro@@ pe could re@@ duce the number of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ l@@ um@@ -@@ see@@ k@@ ers coming to Euro@@ pe , when the v@@ ote on le@@ a@@ ving had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation from outside the Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on ."
But for a si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant maj@@ or@@ ity of the L@@ e@@ ave v@@ ot@@ ers the con@@ cer@@ n was di@@ si@@ l@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ on@@ ment with the political est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
This re@@ p@@ lic@@ ates around Euro@@ pe and much of the li@@ ber@@ al democr@@ atic world .
"We see it with the ri@@ se in pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ r@@ um@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing n@@ ati@@ on@@ al@@ ism of V@@ i@@ k@@ tor O@@ r@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , with the increase in pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ r@@ ance ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating li@@ ber@@ al , op@@ en , t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ g@@ ently need a new vi@@ sion , a vi@@ sion of a more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant , in@@ clu@@ sive glob@@ ali@@ zation , one that br@@ ings people with us rather than le@@ a@@ ving them be@@ h@@ ind ."
That vi@@ sion of glob@@ ali@@ zation is one that has to start by a recogni@@ tion of the posi@@ tive b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of glob@@ ali@@ zation .
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s am@@ on@@ g@@ st econom@@ ists is that f@@ ree tr@@ ad@@ e , the mov@@ ement of cap@@ ital , the mov@@ ement of people across b@@ ord@@ ers b@@ ene@@ f@@ it everyone on ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate ."
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s am@@ on@@ g@@ st inter@@ national rel@@ ations scho@@ lars is that glob@@ ali@@ zation br@@ ings inter@@ dep@@ en@@ dence , which br@@ ings co@@ oper@@ ation and pe@@ ace ."
But glob@@ ali@@ zation also has re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tive effec@@ ts .
It cre@@ ates w@@ in@@ n@@ ers and l@@ os@@ ers .
"T@@ o take the example of mi@@ gr@@ ation , we know that im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation is a net posi@@ tive for the econom@@ y as a whole under almost all cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es ."
"But we also have to be very aw@@ are that there are re@@ dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tive con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences , that import@@ an@@ tly , low@@ -@@ sk@@ ill@@ ed im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation can le@@ ad to a re@@ duc@@ tion in w@@ ages for the most im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed in our societies and also put pres@@ sure on h@@ ouse pr@@ ices ."
"In 200@@ 2 , the form@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ar@@ y-@@ G@@ ener@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ of@@ i A@@ n@@ n@@ an , gave a spe@@ ec@@ h at Y@@ ale U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity , and that spe@@ ec@@ h was on the t@@ op@@ ic of in@@ clu@@ sive glob@@ ali@@ zation ."
That was the spe@@ ec@@ h in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
B@@ ig@@ ot@@ ry and ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance are the u@@ g@@ ly face of ex@@ clu@@ si@@ on@@ ary and an@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ is@@ tic glob@@ ali@@ zation . &quot; &quot; That idea of in@@ clu@@ sive glob@@ ali@@ zation was bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly re@@ vi@@ ved in 200@@ 8 in a con@@ fer@@ ence on progres@@ sive govern@@ ance inv@@ ol@@ ving many of the lead@@ ers of Euro@@ pe@@ an countries .
"But am@@ id au@@ st@@ er@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al cri@@ s@@ is of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept dis@@ appe@@ ared almost without a tr@@ ace ."
G@@ lob@@ ali@@ zation has been taken to sup@@ port a ne@@ o@@ li@@ ber@@ al ag@@ en@@ d@@ a .
It &apos;s per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved to be part of an e@@ li@@ te ag@@ en@@ d@@ a rather than something that b@@ ene@@ f@@ its all .
"So the question is , how can we achi@@ e@@ ve that go@@ al ?"
How can we bal@@ ance on the one hand ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing fear and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand re@@ f@@ using ve@@ h@@ em@@ ently to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and n@@ ati@@ on@@ al@@ ism ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scienti@@ st , that social science off@@ ers some places to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ formation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a star@@ ting point ."
The first rel@@ ates to the idea of civi@@ c education .
What st@@ ands out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the g@@ ap between public per@@ cep@@ tion and emp@@ ir@@ ical reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we re@@ build resp@@ ect for tru@@ th and evidence into our li@@ ber@@ al democr@@ ac@@ ies ?
"It has to beg@@ in with education , but it has to start with the recogni@@ tion that there are huge g@@ aps ."
"In 20@@ 1@@ 4 , the p@@ ol@@ l@@ ster I@@ p@@ so@@ s M@@ O@@ R@@ I published a sur@@ v@@ ey on at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des to im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation , and it sho@@ wed that as num@@ bers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts increase , so public con@@ cer@@ n with im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation also incre@@ ases , al@@ though it ob@@ vi@@ ously didn &apos;t un@@ p@@ ack cau@@ s@@ ality , because this could equ@@ ally be to do not so much with num@@ bers but the political and me@@ dia n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative around it ."
But the same sur@@ v@@ ey also re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed huge public mis@@ information and mis@@ understanding about the nature of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation .
"For example , in these at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des in the United K@@ ing@@ dom , the public beli@@ ev@@ ed that lev@@ els of as@@ y@@ l@@ um were a gre@@ ater pro@@ por@@ tion of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation than they were , but they also beli@@ ev@@ ed the lev@@ els of educ@@ ational mi@@ gr@@ ation were far lo@@ wer as a pro@@ por@@ tion of over@@ all mi@@ gr@@ ation than they actually are ."
"So we have to ad@@ d@@ ress this mis@@ information , the g@@ ap between per@@ cep@@ tion and reality on k@@ ey as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of glob@@ ali@@ zation ."
"And that can &apos;t just be something that &apos;s left to our scho@@ ols , al@@ though that &apos;s important to beg@@ in at an early age ."
The second thing that I think is an op@@ port@@ unity is the idea to enc@@ our@@ age more inter@@ action across di@@ ver@@ se comm@@ uni@@ ties .
"So for inst@@ ance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast have the high@@ est num@@ bers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts , and they are also by far the most t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the low@@ est lev@@ els of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ation that actually are the most ex@@ clu@@ si@@ on@@ ary and int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts .
So we need to enc@@ our@@ age ex@@ change pro@@ gr@@ ams .
We need to en@@ sure that ol@@ der gener@@ ations who maybe can &apos;t tra@@ v@@ el get ac@@ cess to the In@@ ter@@ net .
This ill@@ u@@ str@@ ation from the F@@ in@@ an@@ ci@@ al T@@ im@@ es pos@@ t-@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really stri@@ king .
But the problem is that those people in those are@@ as didn &apos;t per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve themselves to be b@@ ene@@ f@@ ici@@ ar@@ ies .
They didn &apos;t believe that they were actually getting ac@@ cess to material b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of increas@@ ed tr@@ ad@@ e and increas@@ ed mo@@ bility around the world .
"I work on questions pre@@ dom@@ in@@ an@@ tly to do with re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , and one of the ideas I sp@@ ent a lot of my time pre@@ ach@@ ing , ma@@ in@@ ly to develop@@ ing countries around the world , is that in order to enc@@ our@@ age the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ation of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , we can &apos;t just b@@ ene@@ f@@ it the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e pop@@ ul@@ ations , we also have to ad@@ d@@ ress the con@@ cer@@ ns of the h@@ ost comm@@ uni@@ ties in loc@@ al are@@ as ."
"F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , if we &apos;re going to really take ser@@ i@@ ously the need to en@@ sure people share in the economic b@@ ene@@ f@@ its , our bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es and cor@@ por@@ ations need a mo@@ de@@ l of glob@@ ali@@ zation that recogni@@ z@@ es that they , too , have to take people with them ."
The f@@ our@@ th and fin@@ al idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more respon@@ sible poli@@ tics .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that comp@@ are@@ s at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des on glob@@ ali@@ zation .
"We might not achi@@ e@@ ve that today , but at the very le@@ ast we have to call up@@ on our poli@@ tici@@ ans and our me@@ dia to dro@@ p a language of fear and be far more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant of one another ."
I am still B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh .
I am still Euro@@ pe@@ an .
I am still a global ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en .
"For those of us who believe that our i@@ d@@ enti@@ ties are not mu@@ tually ex@@ clu@@ sive , we have to all work together to en@@ sure that glob@@ ali@@ zation ta@@ kes everyone with us and doesn &apos;t leave people be@@ h@@ ind ."
O@@ n@@ ly then will we tru@@ ly re@@ con@@ ci@@ le democr@@ acy and glob@@ ali@@ zation .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real ple@@ as@@ ure to be here .
I last did a TED T@@ al@@ k I think about se@@ ven years ago or so .
I tal@@ ked about sp@@ a@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i s@@ au@@ ce .
"And so many people , I gu@@ ess , wat@@ ch those vide@@ o@@ s ."
"@@ People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about sp@@ a@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i s@@ au@@ ce , which is a wonderful thing in the sh@@ ort ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ ven to be less than ide@@ al over se@@ ven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put sp@@ a@@ gh@@ e@@ tt@@ i s@@ au@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this mor@@ ning &apos;s s@@ es@@ sion is Th@@ ings We M@@ a@@ ke .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most preci@@ ous ob@@ jects of his er@@ a .
And the man &apos;s name is C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en .
C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en was born in 18@@ 80 .
And he was S@@ w@@ is@@ s .
"And of course , the S@@ w@@ is@@ s can be divi@@ ded into two gener@@ al cat@@ eg@@ ories : those who make small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects and those who h@@ and@@ le the money of those who bu@@ y small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , exp@@ en@@ sive ob@@ jects ."
And C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en is very fir@@ m@@ ly in the form@@ er cam@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ e@@ der@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ ec@@ h in Z@@ ur@@ ich .
"In fact , one of his cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es is a young man nam@@ ed L@@ en@@ in who would go on to bre@@ ak small , exp@@ en@@ sive , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ob@@ jects ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ w@@ is@@ s engine@@ er , C@@ ar@@ l ."
And I mean that in its ful@@ l@@ est sense of the word .
"He w@@ ear@@ s thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he ; and he is dom@@ ine@@ ering and n@@ ar@@ ci@@ s@@ si@@ sti@@ c and dri@@ ven and has an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary e@@ go ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our days ; and he has very str@@ ong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ n@@ ating curren@@ t ; and he fe@@ els like a s@@ un@@ t@@ an is a si@@ g@@ n of moral we@@ ak@@ ness ; and he dr@@ in@@ ks lots of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ; and he does his best work sit@@ ting in his mother &apos;s k@@ it@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ ur@@ ich for hours in comple@@ te si@@ l@@ ence with nothing but a sli@@ de ru@@ le ."
"In any case , C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en em@@ i@@ gr@@ ates to the United States just before the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar and se@@ ts up sho@@ p on L@@ af@@ ay@@ e@@ tt@@ e S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an ."
And he becom@@ es ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with the question of how to dro@@ p bomb@@ s from an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ d@@ ar , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a comp@@ lic@@ ated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ es an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to dro@@ p an ob@@ ject , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some st@@ ati@@ on@@ ary t@@ ar@@ get in the face of all kinds of w@@ in@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d co@@ ver and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments ."
"And all sor@@ ts of people , mo@@ ving up to the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar and between the war@@ s , tri@@ ed to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ arly everybody came up sh@@ ort ."
The bomb@@ si@@ gh@@ ts that were av@@ a@@ il@@ able were incredi@@ bly c@@ ru@@ de .
But C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en is really the one who cr@@ ac@@ ks the co@@ de .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated dev@@ ice .
It we@@ igh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Nord@@ en Mar@@ k 15 bomb@@ sight .
And it has all kinds of le@@ ver@@ s and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and g@@ ad@@ gets and g@@ au@@ g@@ es .
And he makes this comp@@ lic@@ ated thing .
"And what he al@@ lo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er take this particular ob@@ ject , vi@@ su@@ ally sight the t@@ ar@@ get , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ l@@ as c@@ one of the bom@@ ber , and then they pl@@ u@@ g in the al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the w@@ ind and the co@@ ordin@@ ates of the t@@ ar@@ get ."
And the bomb@@ sight will tell him when to dro@@ p the bom@@ b .
"And as Nord@@ en fam@@ ously says , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore that bomb@@ sight came along , bomb@@ s would r@@ out@@ in@@ ely mis@@ s their t@@ ar@@ get by a mi@@ le or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mar@@ k 15 Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight , he could dro@@ p a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ bly exc@@ ited the U.@@ S@@ . mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary was by the news of the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight .
It was like man@@ n@@ a from he@@ a@@ ven .
"@@ Here was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , where m@@ illions of men f@@ ought each other in the tre@@ n@@ ch@@ es , getting no@@ where , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a dev@@ ice that al@@ lowed them to f@@ ly up in the sk@@ ies high abo@@ ve ene@@ my ter@@ r@@ it@@ ory and dest@@ ro@@ y wh@@ at@@ ever they wanted with p@@ in@@ point ac@@ cur@@ acy ."
And the U.@@ S@@ . mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develop@@ ing the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight .
"And to put that in per@@ spec@@ tive , the t@@ ot@@ al c@@ ost of the M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an pro@@ ject was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was sp@@ ent on this Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight as was sp@@ ent on the most fam@@ ous mi@@ li@@ t@@ ar@@ y-@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ al pro@@ ject of the moder@@ n er@@ a .
"And there were people , str@@ ate@@ gi@@ sts , within the U.@@ S@@ . mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single dev@@ ice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory when it came to the b@@ att@@ le against the N@@ az@@ is and against the Jap@@ an@@ ese ."
"And for Nord@@ en as well , this dev@@ ice had incredi@@ ble moral import@@ ance , because Nord@@ en was a comm@@ it@@ ted Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bomb@@ sight as his inv@@ en@@ tion , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ str@@ ument of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of suff@@ ering in any kind of war be re@@ duc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight do ?
Well it al@@ lowed you to do that .
It al@@ lowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you ab@@ solu@@ tely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years lead@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , the U.@@ S@@ . mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these Nord@@ en bomb@@ si@@ gh@@ ts at a c@@ ost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tr@@ ained 5@@ 0,000 bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ex@@ ten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tr@@ ain@@ ing s@@ es@@ sions — because these things are ess@@ enti@@ ally anal@@ o@@ g compu@@ ters ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to s@@ we@@ ar that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tu@@ red , they will not di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge a single deta@@ il of this particular dev@@ ice to the ene@@ my , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the ene@@ my not get their h@@ ands on this ab@@ solu@@ tely ess@@ ential piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a ser@@ ies of ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ri@@ ed in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ r@@ ou@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is h@@ and@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never al@@ lowed to be ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ed .
"And there &apos;s a little in@@ cen@@ di@@ ary dev@@ ice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever cr@@ as@@ h@@ es , it will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed and there &apos;s no way the ene@@ my can ever get their h@@ ands on it ."
The Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight is the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il .
So what happens d@@ uring the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il ."
"In pr@@ acti@@ ce , the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight can dro@@ p a bom@@ b into a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under per@@ f@@ ect condi@@ tions ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , condi@@ tions are@@ n &apos;t per@@ f@@ ect ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers have the ability to pro@@ per@@ ly program an anal@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , it bre@@ a@@ ks down a lot ."
"It &apos;s ful@@ l of all kinds of g@@ y@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es and pul@@ le@@ ys and g@@ ad@@ gets and b@@ all@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ought to in the he@@ at of b@@ att@@ le ."
"Th@@ ir@@ dly , when Nord@@ en was making his cal@@ cul@@ ations , he as@@ sum@@ ed that a plan@@ e would be fl@@ ying at a relati@@ vely s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sho@@ t down ."
So they started fl@@ ying them at high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des at incredi@@ bly high spe@@ e@@ ds .
And the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight doesn &apos;t work as well under those condi@@ tions .
"But most of all , the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight requ@@ i@@ red the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er to make vi@@ su@@ al cont@@ act with the t@@ ar@@ get ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It nee@@ ds cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ y to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were abo@@ ve C@@ en@@ tr@@ al Euro@@ pe between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 4@@ 5 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how in@@ ac@@ cur@@ ate the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight was , there was a fam@@ ous case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the A@@ l@@ li@@ es bomb@@ ed a ch@@ em@@ ical pl@@ ant in L@@ e@@ un@@ a , G@@ er@@ many ."
And the ch@@ em@@ ical pl@@ ant comp@@ ri@@ sed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ res .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the A@@ l@@ li@@ es d@@ rop@@ ped 8@@ 5@@ ,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re ch@@ em@@ ical pl@@ ant , using the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight ."
Well what per@@ cent@@ age of those bomb@@ s do you think actually lan@@ ded inside the 7@@ 00-@@ ac@@ re per@@ im@@ e@@ ter of the pl@@ ant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that lan@@ ded , 1@@ 6 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The L@@ e@@ un@@ a ch@@ em@@ ical pl@@ ant , after one of the most ex@@ ten@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within wee@@ ks ."
"And by the way , all those pre@@ cau@@ tions to keep the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight out of the h@@ ands of the N@@ az@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en , as a pro@@ per S@@ w@@ is@@ s , was very en@@ am@@ o@@ red of G@@ er@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he hi@@ red a whole b@@ un@@ ch of them , in@@ clu@@ ding a man nam@@ ed H@@ er@@ man@@ n L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a comple@@ te set of the pl@@ ans for the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight to the N@@ az@@ is ."
"So they had their own Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight thr@@ ough@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Nord@@ en bomb@@ si@@ gh@@ ts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smar@@ t people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve inv@@ en@@ ted g@@ ad@@ gets that will fore@@ ver change our world ."
They &apos;ve inv@@ en@@ ted we@@ b@@ sit@@ es that will al@@ low people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve inv@@ en@@ ted some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world fore@@ ver better ."
"If you go into the mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary , you &apos;ll find lots of C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ ens as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very c@@ lear about how little that means .
"In the I@@ ra@@ q W@@ ar , at the beginning of the first I@@ ra@@ q W@@ ar , the U.@@ S@@ . mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary , the air force , s@@ ent two s@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ons of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ igh@@ ter E@@ ag@@ les to the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i des@@ er@@ t equ@@ i@@ p@@ ped with these five million dol@@ l@@ ar cam@@ er@@ as that al@@ lowed them to see the enti@@ re des@@ er@@ t f@@ lo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to dest@@ ro@@ y — remember the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the I@@ ra@@ q@@ is were lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing at the I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ is ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two s@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ons was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ers .
"And so they f@@ le@@ w mis@@ sions day and night , and they d@@ rop@@ ped thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ si@@ les in an att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of this particular sc@@ our@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ d@@ it done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually dest@@ ro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ er@@ o , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ ap@@ ons wer@@ en &apos;t ac@@ cur@@ ate ?
"O@@ h no , they were br@@ illi@@ an@@ tly ac@@ cur@@ ate ."
"They could have dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5@@ ,000 ft ."
The is@@ sue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ rel@@ s is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pic@@ k@@ le bar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to fi@@ gh@@ ting war@@ s .
O@@ r take the b@@ att@@ le in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an .
What is the si@@ g@@ nature we@@ ap@@ on of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ?
It &apos;s the dr@@ one . What is the dr@@ one ?
Well it is the gr@@ and@@ son of the Nord@@ en Mar@@ k 15 bomb@@ sight .
It is this we@@ ap@@ on of dev@@ ast@@ ating ac@@ cur@@ acy and preci@@ sion .
"And over the course of the last six years in N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an , the C@@ I@@ A has f@@ lo@@ wn hund@@ re@@ ds of dr@@ one mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those dr@@ ones to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 su@@ spec@@ ted P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i and T@@ ali@@ b@@ an mi@@ li@@ t@@ an@@ ts ."
Now what is the ac@@ cur@@ acy of those dr@@ ones ?
Well it &apos;s ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent ac@@ cur@@ acy when it comes to dr@@ one stri@@ kes .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be k@@ ill@@ ed , right ?"
That is one of the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary rec@@ or@@ ds in the history of moder@@ n war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same per@@ i@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these dr@@ ones with dev@@ ast@@ ating ac@@ cur@@ acy , the number of att@@ ac@@ ks , of su@@ ici@@ de att@@ ac@@ ks and ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st att@@ ac@@ ks , against American for@@ ces in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an has increas@@ ed ten@@ fo@@ ld ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more eff@@ ici@@ ent in k@@ ill@@ ing them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more moti@@ v@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not descri@@ bed to you a suc@@ cess story .
I &apos;ve descri@@ bed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a suc@@ cess story .
And this is the problem with our in@@ f@@ at@@ u@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more comple@@ x than that ."
"The is@@ sue isn &apos;t the ac@@ cur@@ acy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more import@@ an@@ tly , whether you ought to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a pos@@ t@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t to the Nord@@ en story of C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bomb@@ sight .
"And that is , on A@@ u@@ g@@ ust 6 , 19@@ 4@@ 5 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bom@@ ber called the E@@ no@@ l@@ a G@@ ay f@@ le@@ w over Jap@@ an and , using a Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight , d@@ rop@@ ped a very large ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear dev@@ ice on the c@@ ity of H@@ ir@@ os@@ h@@ im@@ a ."
"And as was typ@@ ical with the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight , the bom@@ b actually mis@@ sed its t@@ ar@@ get by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the gre@@ at@@ est ir@@ on@@ y of all when it comes to the Nord@@ en bomb@@ sight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dol@@ l@@ ar bomb@@ sight was used to dro@@ p its three billion dol@@ l@@ ar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bomb@@ sight at all ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , back in New Y@@ or@@ k , no one told C@@ ar@@ l Nord@@ en that his bomb@@ sight was used over H@@ ir@@ os@@ h@@ im@@ a ."
He was a comm@@ it@@ ted Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an .
He thought he had desig@@ ned something that would re@@ duce the t@@ ol@@ l of suff@@ ering in war .
It would have bro@@ ken his heart .
( Applause )
"I ad@@ m@@ it that I &apos;m a little bit ner@@ v@@ ous here because I &apos;m going to say some ra@@ dic@@ al things , about how we should think about cancer differ@@ ently , to an au@@ dience that con@@ ta@@ ins a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do ."
But I will also cont@@ est that I &apos;m not as ner@@ v@@ ous as I should be because I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;m right about this .
"( Laughter ) And that this , in fact , will be the way that we treat cancer in the future ."
"In order to talk about cancer , I &apos;m going to actually have to — let me get the big sli@@ de here ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , I &apos;m going to try to give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive of gen@@ om@@ ics ."
"I want to put it in per@@ spec@@ tive of the big@@ ger picture of all the other things that are going on — and then talk about something you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard so much about , which is prot@@ e@@ om@@ ics ."
"H@@ a@@ ving expl@@ ained those , that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about tre@@ ating cancer ."
So let me start with gen@@ om@@ ics .
It is the ho@@ t t@@ op@@ ic .
It is the place where we &apos;re learning the most .
This is the great fron@@ ti@@ er .
But it has its lim@@ it@@ ations .
"And in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the anal@@ o@@ gy that the gen@@ ome is like the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ t of your body , and if that were only true , it would be great , but it &apos;s not ."
It &apos;s like the parts li@@ st of your body .
"It doesn &apos;t say how things are connec@@ ted , what cau@@ ses what and so on ."
"So if I can make an anal@@ o@@ gy , let &apos;s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant , a health@@ y re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and a s@@ ick re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant , and all you had was the li@@ st of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that they had in their lar@@ der ."
"So it might be that , if you went to a F@@ ren@@ ch re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and you looked through it and you found they only had mar@@ g@@ ar@@ ine and they didn &apos;t have bu@@ tter , you could say , &quot; &quot; A@@ h , I see what &apos;s wrong with them ."
I can make them health@@ y . &quot; &quot; And there probably are speci@@ al c@@ ases of that .
You could cer@@ tain@@ ly tell the difference between a Ch@@ in@@ ese re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and a F@@ ren@@ ch re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant by what they had in a lar@@ der .
"So the li@@ st of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents does tell you something , and sometimes it t@@ ells you something that &apos;s wrong ."
"If they have t@@ ons of s@@ al@@ t , you might gu@@ ess they &apos;re using too much s@@ al@@ t , or something like that ."
"But it &apos;s lim@@ ited , because really to know if it &apos;s a health@@ y re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant , you need to ta@@ st@@ e the food , you need to know what goes on in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , you need the produc@@ t of all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents ."
"So if I look at a person and I look at a person &apos;s gen@@ ome , it &apos;s the same thing ."
The part of the gen@@ ome that we can read is the li@@ st of in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents .
"And so in@@ de@@ ed , there are times when we can find in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that &#91; are &#93; bad ."
"C@@ y@@ sti@@ c fi@@ br@@ os@@ is is an example of a disease where you just have a bad in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent and you have a disease , and we can actually make a direc@@ t cor@@ respon@@ dence between the in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent and the disease ."
"But most things , you really have to know what &apos;s going on in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , because , m@@ os@@ tly , s@@ ick people used to be health@@ y people — they have the same gen@@ ome ."
So the gen@@ ome really t@@ ells you much more about pre@@ di@@ sp@@ os@@ i@@ tion .
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an A@@ si@@ an person and a Euro@@ pe@@ an person by looking at their in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents li@@ st .
But you really for the most part can &apos;t tell the difference between a health@@ y person and a s@@ ick person — ex@@ cept in some of these speci@@ al c@@ ases .
So why all the big de@@ al about gen@@ e@@ tics ?
"Well first of all , it &apos;s because we can read it , which is f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ."
It is very u@@ se@@ ful in certain cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es .
It &apos;s also the great the@@ o@@ re@@ tical tri@@ um@@ p@@ h of bio@@ logy .
It &apos;s the one theory that the bio@@ logi@@ sts ever really got right .
It &apos;s fundamental to D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and M@@ en@@ de@@ l and so on .
And so it &apos;s the one thing where they predic@@ ted a the@@ o@@ re@@ tical con@@ struc@@ t .
"So M@@ en@@ de@@ l had this idea of a gen@@ e as an ab@@ str@@ act thing , and D@@ ar@@ w@@ in built a whole theory that dep@@ en@@ ded on them exist@@ ing , and then W@@ at@@ son and C@@ r@@ ick actually looked and found one ."
So this happens in physics all the time .
"You predic@@ t a black hole , and you look out the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e and there it is , just like you said ."
But it ra@@ re@@ ly happens in bio@@ logy .
"So this great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h — it &apos;s so good , there &apos;s almost a religi@@ ous experience in bio@@ logy ."
And D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ i@@ an evolution is really the c@@ ore theory .
"So the other reason it &apos;s been very pop@@ ular is because we can measure it , it &apos;s dig@@ ital ."
"And in fact , th@@ an@@ ks to K@@ ary M@@ ul@@ l@@ is , you can basically measure your gen@@ ome in your k@@ it@@ ch@@ en with a few extra in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents ."
"So for inst@@ ance , by meas@@ uring the gen@@ ome , we &apos;ve learned a lot about how we &apos;re rel@@ ated to other kinds of anim@@ als by the cl@@ os@@ en@@ ess of our gen@@ ome , or how we &apos;re rel@@ ated to each other — the family t@@ ree , or the t@@ ree of life ."
There &apos;s a huge amount of information about the gen@@ e@@ tics just by com@@ par@@ ing the gen@@ e@@ tic sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ity .
"Now of course , in medic@@ al app@@ lic@@ ation , that is very u@@ se@@ ful because it &apos;s the same kind of information that the doc@@ tor gets from your family medic@@ al history — ex@@ cept probably , your gen@@ ome kno@@ ws much more about your medic@@ al history than you do ."
"And so by read@@ ing the gen@@ ome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know ."
"And so we can disc@@ over things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relati@@ ves , but they may be surpri@@ sing ."
I did the 2@@ 3@@ and@@ M@@ e thing and was very surpri@@ sed to disc@@ over that I am f@@ at and bal@@ d .
( Laughter ) But sometimes you can learn much more u@@ se@@ ful things about that .
"But m@@ os@@ tly what you need to know , to find out if you &apos;re s@@ ick , is not your pre@@ di@@ sp@@ os@@ i@@ tions , but it &apos;s actually what &apos;s going on in your body right now ."
"So to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the gen@@ es are produc@@ ing and what &apos;s happening after the gen@@ e@@ tics , and that &apos;s what prot@@ e@@ om@@ ics is about ."
"@@ J@@ ust like gen@@ ome mi@@ x@@ es the study of all the gen@@ es , prot@@ e@@ om@@ ics is the study of all the prot@@ e@@ ins ."
"And the prot@@ e@@ ins are all of the little things in your body that are si@@ gn@@ al@@ ing between the cells — actually , the mach@@ ines that are oper@@ ating — that &apos;s where the action is ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , a human body is a con@@ vers@@ ation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re t@@ elling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re s@@ ick , something &apos;s g@@ one wrong with that con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"And so the tr@@ ick is — un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , we don &apos;t have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the gen@@ ome ."
"So the problem is that meas@@ uring — if you try to measure all the prot@@ e@@ ins , it &apos;s a very el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate process ."
"It requ@@ i@@ res hund@@ re@@ ds of ste@@ ps , and it ta@@ kes a long , long time ."
And it mat@@ ters how much of the prot@@ e@@ in it is .
"It could be very si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant that a prot@@ e@@ in changed by 10 percent , so it &apos;s not a n@@ ice dig@@ ital thing like D@@ N@@ A ."
"And basically our problem is somebody &apos;s in the middle of this very long st@@ age , they p@@ ause for just a moment , and they leave something in an en@@ z@@ y@@ me for a second , and all of a su@@ dd@@ en all the meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments from then on don &apos;t work ."
And so then people get very in@@ consi@@ st@@ ent res@@ ults when they do it this way .
People have tri@@ ed very hard to do this .
I tri@@ ed this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it .
I ke@@ p@@ t getting this call from this on@@ co@@ logi@@ st nam@@ ed D@@ a@@ vi@@ d A@@ g@@ us .
"And Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed M@@ in@@ ds gets a lot of call@@ s from people who want help with their problems , and I didn &apos;t think this was a very likely one to call back , so I ke@@ p@@ t on giving him to the d@@ el@@ ay li@@ st ."
"And then one day , I get a call from J@@ o@@ h@@ n D@@ o@@ er@@ r , B@@ ill B@@ er@@ k@@ man and A@@ l G@@ ore on the same day saying re@@ turn D@@ a@@ vi@@ d A@@ g@@ us &apos;s ph@@ one call ."
"( Laughter ) So I was like , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay . This guy &apos;s at le@@ ast res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So we started talking , and he said , &quot; &quot; I really need a better way to measure prot@@ e@@ ins . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; L@@ oo@@ ked at that . B@@ een there ."
"@@ Not going to be easy . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No , no . I really need it ."
"I mean , I see patients d@@ ying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them ."
We have to have a w@@ in@@ do@@ w into this . &quot; &quot; And he took me through speci@@ fic exam@@ pl@@ es of when he really needed it .
"And I reali@@ zed , w@@ ow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so I said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot; &quot; Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed M@@ in@@ ds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting any@@ body &apos;s fund@@ ing or per@@ mis@@ sion or anything ."
So we started play@@ ing around with this .
"And as we did it , we reali@@ zed this was the bas@@ ic problem — that taking the si@@ p of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e — that there were hum@@ ans doing this comp@@ lic@@ ated process and that what really needed to be done was to au@@ tom@@ ate this process like an as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line and build ro@@ b@@ ots that would measure prot@@ e@@ om@@ ics ."
"And so we did that , and working with D@@ a@@ vi@@ d , we made a little comp@@ any called Ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed P@@ r@@ ot@@ e@@ om@@ ics even@@ tually , which makes this ro@@ bot@@ ic as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line , which , in a very consi@@ st@@ ent way , meas@@ ures the prot@@ e@@ in ."
And I &apos;ll show you what that prot@@ e@@ in meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment looks like .
"B@@ as@@ ically , what we do is we take a dro@@ p of b@@ loo@@ d out of a pati@@ ent , and we sort out the prot@@ e@@ ins in the dro@@ p of b@@ loo@@ d ac@@ cor@@ ding to how much they we@@ i@@ gh , how sli@@ p@@ per@@ y they are , and we ar@@ ran@@ ge them in an im@@ age ."
And so we can look at liter@@ ally hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of fe@@ atures at once out of that dro@@ p of b@@ loo@@ d .
"And we can take a different one tom@@ or@@ row , and you will see your prot@@ e@@ ins tom@@ or@@ row will be different — they &apos;ll be different after you e@@ at or after you s@@ le@@ ep ."
They really tell us what &apos;s going on there .
"And so this picture , which looks like a big sm@@ u@@ dge to you , is actually the thing that got me really thr@@ ill@@ ed about this and made me feel like we were on the right tr@@ ack ."
"So if I z@@ o@@ om into that picture , I can just show you what it means ."
"We sort out the prot@@ e@@ ins — from left to right is the we@@ ight of the fr@@ ag@@ ments that we &apos;re getting , and from top to bot@@ tom is how sli@@ p@@ per@@ y they are ."
So we &apos;re z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in here just to show you a little bit of it .
And so each of these l@@ ines re@@ pres@@ ents some si@@ gn@@ al that we &apos;re getting out of a piece of a prot@@ e@@ in .
"And you can see how the l@@ ines oc@@ cu@@ r in these little grou@@ ps of b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p , b@@ um@@ p ."
"And that &apos;s because we &apos;re meas@@ uring the we@@ ight so preci@@ se@@ ly that — car@@ b@@ on comes in different is@@ ot@@ op@@ es , so if it has an extra ne@@ u@@ tr@@ on on it , we actually measure it as a different ch@@ em@@ ical ."
So we &apos;re actually meas@@ uring each is@@ ot@@ op@@ e as a different one .
And so that gi@@ ves you an idea of how ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely sen@@ si@@ tive this is .
"So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o and looking at the stars and looking through the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e for the first time , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly you say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , it &apos;s way more comp@@ lic@@ ated than we thought it was . &quot; &quot; But we can see that stuff out there and actually see fe@@ atures of it ."
So this is the si@@ g@@ nature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
"So what we do with this is , for example , we can look at two patients , one that respon@@ ded to a dru@@ g and one that didn &apos;t respon@@ d to a dru@@ g , and ask , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on differ@@ ently inside of them ? &quot; &quot; And so we can make these meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments preci@@ se@@ ly enough that we can over@@ l@@ ay two patients and look at the differ@@ ences ."
So here we have A@@ li@@ ce in gre@@ en and B@@ o@@ b in red .
We over@@ l@@ ay them . This is ac@@ tual data .
"And you can see , m@@ os@@ tly it over@@ l@@ aps and it &apos;s y@@ el@@ low , but there &apos;s some things that just A@@ li@@ ce has and some things that just B@@ o@@ b has ."
"And if we find a patter@@ n of things of the respon@@ d@@ ers to the dru@@ g , we see that in the b@@ loo@@ d , they have the condi@@ tion that al@@ lo@@ ws them to respon@@ d to this dru@@ g ."
"We might not even know what this prot@@ e@@ in is , but we can see it &apos;s a mark@@ er for the respon@@ se to the disease ."
"So this already , I think , is tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously u@@ se@@ ful in all kinds of medic@@ ine ."
But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we &apos;re going to treat cancer .
So let me move to cancer .
"The thing about cancer — when I got into this , I really knew nothing about it , but working with D@@ a@@ vi@@ d A@@ g@@ us , I started wat@@ ch@@ ing how cancer was actually being tre@@ ated and went to oper@@ ations where it was being c@@ ut out ."
"And as I looked at it , to me it didn &apos;t make sense how we were appro@@ ach@@ ing cancer , and in order to make sense of it , I had to learn where did this come from ."
We &apos;re tre@@ ating cancer almost like it &apos;s an in@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous disease .
We &apos;re tre@@ ating it as something that got inside of you that we have to k@@ ill .
So this is the great par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
This is another case where a the@@ o@@ re@@ tical par@@ a@@ dig@@ m in bio@@ logy really worked — was the g@@ er@@ m theory of disease .
"So what doc@@ tors are m@@ os@@ tly tr@@ ained to do is di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose — that is , put you into a cat@@ eg@@ ory and app@@ ly a scienti@@ f@@ ically pro@@ ven tre@@ at@@ ment for that di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is — and that works great for in@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous dise@@ ases ."
"So if we put you in the cat@@ eg@@ ory of you &apos;ve got sy@@ phil@@ is , we can give you p@@ en@@ ic@@ ill@@ in ."
We know that that works .
"If you &apos;ve got m@@ al@@ ari@@ a , we give you qu@@ in@@ ine or some der@@ i@@ v@@ ative of it ."
"And so that &apos;s the bas@@ ic thing doc@@ tors are tr@@ ained to do , and it &apos;s m@@ ir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous in the case of in@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous disease — how well it works ."
And many people in this au@@ dience probably wouldn &apos;t be ali@@ ve if doc@@ tors didn &apos;t do this .
But now let &apos;s app@@ ly that to syst@@ ems dise@@ ases like cancer .
"The problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you ."
It &apos;s you ; you &apos;re bro@@ ken .
That con@@ vers@@ ation inside of you got mi@@ x@@ ed up in some way .
So how do we di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose that con@@ vers@@ ation ?
"Well , right now what we do is we divi@@ de it by part of the body — you know , where did it appe@@ ar ? — and we put you in different cat@@ eg@@ ories ac@@ cor@@ ding to the part of the body ."
"And then we do a cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ al for a dru@@ g for l@@ un@@ g cancer and one for pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer and one for bre@@ ast cancer , and we treat these as if they &apos;re se@@ par@@ ate dise@@ ases and that this way of divi@@ ding them had something to do with what actually went wrong ."
"And of course , it really doesn &apos;t have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a fa@@ il@@ ure of the system ."
"And in fact , I think we &apos;re even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing ."
I think this is the big mi@@ sta@@ ke .
I think cancer should not be a n@@ ou@@ n .
"We should talk about canc@@ ering as something we do , not something we have ."
"And so those tu@@ m@@ ors , those are sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of cancer ."
"And so your body is probably canc@@ ering all the time , but there are lots of syst@@ ems in your body that keep it under control ."
"And so to give you an idea of an anal@@ o@@ gy of what I mean by thinking of canc@@ ering as a ver@@ b , imagine we didn &apos;t know anything about pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing , and the way that we tal@@ ked about it , we &apos;d come home and we &apos;d find a le@@ ak in our k@@ it@@ ch@@ en and we &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , my h@@ ouse has water . &quot; &quot; We might divi@@ de it — the pl@@ um@@ ber would say , &quot; &quot; Well , where &apos;s the water ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you must have k@@ it@@ ch@@ en water . &quot;"
That &apos;s kind of the level at which it is .
"&quot; &quot; K@@ it@@ ch@@ en water , well , first of all , we &apos;ll go in there and we &apos;ll mo@@ p out a lot of it ."
"And then we know that if we sp@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le D@@ ran@@ o around the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , that hel@@ ps ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as living room water , it &apos;s better to do t@@ ar on the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; And it s@@ ounds si@@ l@@ ly , but that &apos;s basically what we do ."
"And I &apos;m not saying you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t mo@@ p up your water if you have cancer , but I &apos;m saying that &apos;s not really the problem ; that &apos;s the sym@@ p@@ tom of the problem ."
"What we really need to get at is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s happening at the level of the prot@@ e@@ on@@ om@@ ic ac@@ tions , happening at the level of why is your body not heal@@ ing itself in the way that it norm@@ ally does ?"
"Because norm@@ ally , your body is de@@ al@@ ing with this problem all the time ."
"So your h@@ ouse is de@@ al@@ ing with le@@ a@@ ks all the time , but it &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ing them . It &apos;s d@@ ra@@ in@@ ing them out and so on ."
"So what we need is to have a cau@@ s@@ ative mo@@ de@@ l of what &apos;s actually going on , and prot@@ e@@ om@@ ics actually gi@@ ves us the ability to build a mo@@ de@@ l like that ."
D@@ a@@ vi@@ d got me inv@@ ited to give a talk at N@@ ational C@@ anc@@ er In@@ stitu@@ te and A@@ n@@ n@@ a B@@ ar@@ ker was there .
"And so I gave this talk and said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you gu@@ ys do this ? &quot; &quot; And A@@ n@@ n@@ a said , &quot; &quot; Because no@@ body within cancer would look at it this way ."
"But what we &apos;re going to do , is we &apos;re going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doc@@ tors who really know about cancer and work out different pro@@ gr@@ ams of resear@@ ch . &quot; &quot; So D@@ a@@ vi@@ d and I app@@ li@@ ed to this program and cre@@ ated a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um at U@@ S@@ C where we &apos;ve got some of the best on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts in the world and some of the best bio@@ logi@@ sts in the world , from C@@ old S@@ pr@@ ing H@@ ar@@ b@@ or , St@@ an@@ for@@ d , A@@ us@@ ti@@ n — I won &apos;t even go through and name all the places — to have a resear@@ ch pro@@ ject that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a mo@@ de@@ l of cancer like this ."
"We &apos;re doing it in m@@ ice first , and we will k@@ ill a lot of m@@ ice in the process of doing this , but they will die for a good c@@ ause ."
"And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predic@@ tive mo@@ de@@ l where we can understand , when cancer happens , what &apos;s actually happening in there and which tre@@ at@@ ment will treat that cancer ."
So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer tre@@ at@@ ment will be like in the future .
"So I think even@@ tually , once we have one of these mo@@ d@@ els for people , which we &apos;ll get even@@ tually — I mean , our group won &apos;t get all the way there — but even@@ tually we &apos;ll have a very good computer mo@@ de@@ l — sort of like a global c@@ lim@@ ate mo@@ de@@ l for we@@ a@@ ther ."
It has lots of different information about what &apos;s the process going on in this prot@@ e@@ om@@ ic con@@ vers@@ ation on many different sc@@ al@@ es .
"And so we will sim@@ ul@@ ate in that mo@@ de@@ l for your particular cancer — and this also will be for A@@ L@@ S , or any kind of system neuro@@ de@@ gener@@ ative dise@@ ases , things like that — we will sim@@ ul@@ ate speci@@ f@@ ically you , not just a gener@@ ic person , but what &apos;s actually going on inside you ."
"And in that sim@@ ulation , what we could do is desig@@ n for you speci@@ f@@ ically a se@@ qu@@ ence of tre@@ at@@ ments , and it might be very g@@ ent@@ le tre@@ at@@ ments , very small amoun@@ ts of dru@@ gs ."
"It might be things like , don &apos;t e@@ at that day , or give them a little ch@@ em@@ o@@ ther@@ ap@@ y , maybe a little radi@@ ation ."
"O@@ f course , we &apos;ll do sur@@ g@@ ery sometimes and so on ."
But desig@@ n a program of tre@@ at@@ ments speci@@ f@@ ically for you and help your body gu@@ i@@ de back to health — gu@@ i@@ de your body back to health .
Because your body will do most of the work of fi@@ x@@ ing it if we just sort of pro@@ p it up in the ways that are wrong .
We put it in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of s@@ pl@@ in@@ ts .
"And so your body basically has lots and lots of m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms for fi@@ x@@ ing cancer , and we just have to pro@@ p those up in the right way and get them to do the job ."
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be tre@@ ated in the future .
"It &apos;s going to requ@@ ire a lot of work , a lot of resear@@ ch ."
There will be many te@@ ams like our te@@ am that work on this .
"But I think even@@ tually , we will desig@@ n for everybody a cu@@ st@@ om tre@@ at@@ ment for cancer ."
So th@@ ank you very much .

"In many pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies and tri@@ b@@ al societies , fa@@ thers are u@@ su@@ ally known by their s@@ ons , but I &apos;m one of the few fa@@ thers who is known by his d@@ aughter , and I am pr@@ ou@@ d of it ."
"( Applause ) M@@ al@@ al@@ a started her cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n for education and st@@ ood for her ri@@ gh@@ ts in 200@@ 7 , and when her eff@@ or@@ ts were h@@ on@@ o@@ red in 20@@ 11 , and she was given the national y@@ ou@@ th pe@@ ace pri@@ ze , and she bec@@ ame a very fam@@ ous , very pop@@ ular young gir@@ l of her country ."
"B@@ e@@ fore that , she was my d@@ aughter , but now I am her father ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , if we gl@@ ance to human history , the story of women is the story of in@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , in@@ equality , violence and exp@@ lo@@ it@@ ation ."
"You see , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies , right from the very beginning , when a gir@@ l is born , her bir@@ th is not c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated ."
"S@@ he is not w@@ el@@ com@@ ed , ne@@ ither by father n@@ or by mother ."
"The ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od comes and comm@@ is@@ er@@ ates with the mother , and no@@ body con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ates the father ."
And a mother is very un@@ com@@ fort@@ able for having a gir@@ l child .
"When she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to the first gir@@ l child , first d@@ aughter , she is sa@@ d ."
"When she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to the second d@@ aughter , she is sho@@ c@@ ked , and in the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation of a son , when she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to a thir@@ d d@@ aughter , she fe@@ els gu@@ il@@ ty like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
"@@ Not only the mother suff@@ ers , but the d@@ aughter , the ne@@ w@@ ly born d@@ aughter , when she gro@@ ws old , she suff@@ ers too ."
"A@@ t the age of five , while she should be going to school , she st@@ ays at home and her bro@@ thers are ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted in a school ."
"@@ Un@@ til the age of 12 , some@@ how , she has a good life ."
She can have fu@@ n .
"S@@ he can play with her friends in the stre@@ ets , and she can move around in the stre@@ ets like a bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly ."
"But when she en@@ ters her te@@ ens , when she becom@@ es 1@@ 3 years old , she is for@@ bi@@ dd@@ en to go out of her home without a m@@ ale es@@ cor@@ t ."
She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four w@@ all@@ s of her home .
She is no more a f@@ ree in@@ divi@@ du@@ al .
"S@@ he becom@@ es the so@@ -@@ called h@@ on@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ thers and of her family , and if she trans@@ gres@@ ses the co@@ de of that so@@ -@@ called h@@ on@@ or , she could even be k@@ ill@@ ed ."
"I know a family of se@@ ven sist@@ ers and one bro@@ ther , and that one bro@@ ther , he has mi@@ gr@@ ated to the G@@ ul@@ f countries , to ear@@ n a living for his se@@ ven sist@@ ers and parents , because he thin@@ ks that it will be hum@@ ili@@ ating if his se@@ ven sist@@ ers learn a sk@@ ill and they go out of the home and ear@@ n some li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ od ."
"So this bro@@ ther , he s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sist@@ ers at the al@@ t@@ ar of so@@ -@@ called h@@ on@@ or ."
And there is one more n@@ or@@ m of the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies that is called o@@ be@@ dience .
"A good gir@@ l is sup@@ posed to be very qu@@ i@@ et , very hum@@ ble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive ."
It is the cr@@ it@@ eri@@ a .
The ro@@ le mo@@ de@@ l good gir@@ l should be very qu@@ i@@ et .
"S@@ he is sup@@ posed to be si@@ l@@ ent and she is sup@@ posed to ac@@ cept the deci@@ sions of her father and mother and the deci@@ sions of el@@ d@@ ers , even if she does not like them ."
"If she is marri@@ ed to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is marri@@ ed to an old man , she has to ac@@ cept , because she does not want to be du@@ b@@ bed as di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent ."
"If she is marri@@ ed very early , she has to ac@@ cept ."
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , she will be called di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is we@@ d@@ ded , be@@ d@@ ded , and then she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to more s@@ ons and d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"And it is the ir@@ on@@ y of the sit@@ u@@ ation that this mother , she teach@@ es the same l@@ es@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience to her d@@ aughter and the same l@@ es@@ son of h@@ on@@ or to her s@@ ons ."
"And this v@@ ici@@ ous c@@ y@@ c@@ le goes on , goes on ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , this p@@ light of m@@ illions of women could be changed if we think differ@@ ently , if women and men think differ@@ ently , if men and women in the tri@@ b@@ al and pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies in the develop@@ ing countries , if they can bre@@ ak a few n@@ or@@ ms of family and society , if they can abo@@ lish the disc@@ ri@@ min@@ at@@ ory la@@ ws of the syst@@ ems in their st@@ ates , which go against the bas@@ ic human ri@@ gh@@ ts of the women ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , when M@@ al@@ al@@ a was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like ne@@ w@@ born children , to be h@@ on@@ est , but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es , believe me , I got extre@@ me@@ ly h@@ on@@ o@@ red ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with a her@@ o@@ ic le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary f@@ re@@ e@@ dom fi@@ gh@@ ter in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an ."
"H@@ er name was M@@ al@@ al@@ a@@ i of M@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ and , and I nam@@ ed my d@@ aughter after her ."
"A few days after M@@ al@@ al@@ a was born , my d@@ aughter was born , my c@@ ous@@ in came — and it was a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence — he came to my home and he br@@ ought a family t@@ ree , a family t@@ ree of the Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ a@@ i family , and when I looked at the family t@@ ree , it tr@@ ac@@ ed back to 3@@ 00 years of our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I pic@@ ked my p@@ en , dre@@ w a line from my name , and wr@@ ote , &quot; &quot; M@@ al@@ al@@ a . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted her in my school ."
"You will be as@@ king , then , why should I men@@ tion about the ad@@ mis@@ sion of a gir@@ l in a school ?"
"Y@@ es , I must men@@ tion it ."
"It may be taken for gr@@ an@@ ted in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , in America , in many develop@@ ed countries , but in po@@ or countries , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies , in tri@@ b@@ al societies , it &apos;s a big ev@@ ent for the life of gir@@ l ."
E@@ n@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ment in a school means recogni@@ tion of her i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty and her name .
A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has en@@ ter@@ ed the world of dre@@ ams and as@@ p@@ ir@@ ations where she can expl@@ ore her p@@ ot@@ enti@@ als for her future life .
"I have five sist@@ ers , and n@@ one of them could go to school , and you will be ast@@ on@@ i@@ shed , two wee@@ ks before , when I was f@@ ill@@ ing out the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an vi@@ s@@ a form , and I was f@@ ill@@ ing out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ nam@@ es of some of my sist@@ ers ."
"And the reason was that I have never , never seen the nam@@ es of my sist@@ ers wr@@ it@@ ten on any doc@@ ument ."
That was the reason that I val@@ u@@ ed my d@@ aughter .
"What my father could not give to my sist@@ ers and to his d@@ augh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to ap@@ preci@@ ate the intelligence and the br@@ illi@@ ance of my d@@ aughter .
I enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed her to s@@ it with me when my friends used to come .
I enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings .
"And all these good val@@ ues , I tri@@ ed to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her pers@@ on@@ ality ."
"And this was not only she , only M@@ al@@ al@@ a ."
"I im@@ par@@ ted all these good val@@ ues to my school , gir@@ l students and bo@@ y students as well ."
I used education for em@@ an@@ ci@@ p@@ ation .
"I t@@ au@@ ght my girls , I t@@ au@@ ght my gir@@ l students , to un@@ learn the l@@ es@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience ."
I t@@ au@@ ght my bo@@ y students to un@@ learn the l@@ es@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ h@@ on@@ or .
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , we were stri@@ ving for more ri@@ gh@@ ts for women , and we were str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ gh@@ ts and partic@@ ul@@ arly to women &apos;s ri@@ gh@@ ts .
It was called T@@ ali@@ b@@ ani@@ zation .
"It means a comple@@ te ne@@ g@@ ation of women &apos;s par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation in all political , econom@@ ical and social acti@@ vi@@ ties ."
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of scho@@ ols were l@@ ost .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited from going to school .
W@@ om@@ en were for@@ c@@ ed to we@@ ar ve@@ il@@ s and they were st@@ op@@ ped from going to the mar@@ ke@@ ts .
"M@@ us@@ ici@@ ans were si@@ l@@ enc@@ ed , girls were f@@ log@@ g@@ ed and sing@@ ers were k@@ ill@@ ed ."
It &apos;s really the most sc@@ ary thing .
"S@@ he wr@@ ote a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C b@@ lo@@ g , she v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er@@ ed her@@ self for the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ ies , and she sp@@ o@@ ke from every pl@@ at@@ form she could ."
And her v@@ o@@ ice was the most po@@ wer@@ ful v@@ o@@ ice .
It sp@@ read like a cre@@ sc@@ en@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an could not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate her cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n , and on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 9 20@@ 12 , she was sho@@ t in the head at point bl@@ ank ran@@ ge ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world tur@@ ned into a big black hole .
"Wh@@ ile my d@@ aughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and death , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of my wi@@ fe , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be bl@@ am@@ ed for what happened to my d@@ aughter and your d@@ aughter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t bl@@ ame yourself ."
You st@@ ood for the right c@@ ause .
"You put your life at sta@@ ke for the c@@ ause of tru@@ th , for the c@@ ause of pe@@ ace , and for the c@@ ause of education , and your d@@ aughter in insp@@ i@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right pat@@ h and G@@ od will prot@@ ect her . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ese few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When M@@ al@@ al@@ a was in the h@@ osp@@ ital , and she was going through the se@@ v@@ ere pain@@ s and she had had se@@ v@@ ere he@@ ad@@ ach@@ es because her fac@@ i@@ al ner@@ ve was c@@ ut down , I used to see a dark s@@ ha@@ do@@ w sp@@ read@@ ing on the face of my wi@@ fe ."
But my d@@ aughter never com@@ pl@@ ained .
"S@@ he used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fine with my c@@ ro@@ o@@ ked s@@ mi@@ le and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be o@@ kay . P@@ le@@ ase don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us ."
"D@@ e@@ ar bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , we learned from her how to be re@@ si@@ li@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m gl@@ ad to share with you that des@@ p@@ ite being an ic@@ on for the ri@@ gh@@ ts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old gir@@ l ."
She cri@@ es when her h@@ ome@@ work is in@@ comple@@ te .
"S@@ he qu@@ ar@@ rel@@ s with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"@@ People ask me , what speci@@ al is in my m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship which has made M@@ al@@ al@@ a so bo@@ ld and so cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous and so v@@ oc@@ al and po@@ is@@ ed ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not c@@ li@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about ho@@ pe@@ fully con@@ ver@@ ting fear into hope .
"When we go to the phys@@ ici@@ an today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s off@@ ice and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re tru@@ ly af@@ ra@@ id of .
"D@@ i@@ ab@@ et@@ es , cancer , P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , l@@ un@@ g fa@@ il@@ ure — things that we know are de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating dise@@ ases , for which there &apos;s relati@@ vely little that can be done ."
"And what I want to l@@ ay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will m@@ el@@ t down if you think it already ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t , and where we are cl@@ in@@ ically today , and where we might go tom@@ or@@ row , and what some of the h@@ ur@@ d@@ les are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I prom@@ ise ."
"I want to start with this sli@@ de , because this sli@@ de sort of t@@ ells the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an is@@ sue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ tic@@ les on the bi@@ on@@ ic human .
It was basically a re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is@@ sue .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating the p@@ ace at which the body he@@ als itself to a cl@@ in@@ ically re@@ lev@@ ant tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed hi@@ p , you can put an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine used on their front co@@ ver .
This is the comple@@ te an@@ ti@@ the@@ s@@ is of re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine .
This is not re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is what B@@ us@@ iness W@@ e@@ e@@ k put up when they did a story about re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of fig@@ uring out how to am@@ e@@ li@@ or@@ ate sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s with dev@@ ices and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will re@@ gener@@ ate l@@ ost fun@@ c@@ tion of the body by re@@ gener@@ ating the fun@@ c@@ tion of org@@ ans and d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed ti@@ s@@ sue ."
"So that at the end of the tre@@ at@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the tre@@ at@@ ment ."
V@@ ery few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are tru@@ ly no@@ v@@ el .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , Ch@@ ar@@ les L@@ in@@ d@@ ber@@ gh , who was better known for fl@@ ying a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the N@@ o@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates from R@@ oc@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er , to beg@@ in to think about , could you culture org@@ ans ?"
"And they published this book in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually beg@@ an to think about , what could you do in bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole org@@ ans ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exc@@ iting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks y@@ est@@ er@@ day tal@@ ked about impro@@ ving the qu@@ ality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing po@@ ver@@ ty , and ess@@ enti@@ ally increas@@ ing life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y all around the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"One of the chall@@ eng@@ es is that the r@@ ic@@ her we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more exp@@ en@@ sive it is to take care of our dise@@ ases as we get ol@@ der ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ su@@ s the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can basically see that the r@@ ic@@ her a country is , the ol@@ der the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a partic@@ ul@@ arly dr@@ am@@ atic chall@@ en@@ ge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a bro@@ ken an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ m@@ a ."
"If the average age in your country is 4@@ 5 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , heart fa@@ il@@ ure , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease — things that are in@@ her@@ ently more difficult to treat , and much more exp@@ en@@ sive to treat ."
J@@ ust have a look at the demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ics in the U.@@ S@@ . here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The Un@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; I@@ n 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 wor@@ k@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really s@@ ick , p@@ ay@@ ing for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experienc@@ ing de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two wor@@ k@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.@@ S@@ ."
"And this is mat@@ ched in every in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed , we@@ al@@ th@@ y country in the world ."
How can you actually aff@@ or@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ su@@ s c@@ ost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 4@@ 5 , 40 to 4@@ 5 , there &apos;s a su@@ dd@@ en sp@@ i@@ ke in the c@@ ost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right stu@@ dies , you can look at how much you as an in@@ divi@@ du@@ al sp@@ end on your own health care , pl@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about se@@ ven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a sp@@ i@@ ke ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dise@@ ases and experience what I would call health@@ y aging ."
"I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est there are four things , and n@@ one of these things in@@ clu@@ de an in@@ sur@@ ance system or a le@@ g@@ al system ."
A@@ ll those things do is change who p@@ ays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tual c@@ ost of the tre@@ at@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can r@@ ation health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too depres@@ sing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mon@@ ies should be put into pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the progres@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to c@@ ure the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sym@@ p@@ tom ."
"Th@@ ink of it in ter@@ ms of di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , for inst@@ ance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , with di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , what do we do ?"
"We di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease even@@ tually , once it becom@@ es sym@@ p@@ tom@@ atic , and then we treat the sym@@ p@@ tom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ s@@ ul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good ther@@ ap@@ y .
"But even@@ tually it st@@ op@@ s working , and di@@ ab@@ et@@ es le@@ ads to a predic@@ t@@ able on@@ set of de@@ bili@@ t@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y couldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to re@@ gener@@ ate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sym@@ p@@ tom@@ atic ?"
"And it might be a little bit exp@@ en@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would tru@@ ly be able to do something different ."
"This vide@@ o , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally ."
This is a ne@@ w@@ t re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a ne@@ w@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b re@@ generation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in re@@ gener@@ ative medic@@ ine is doing this in every org@@ an system of the body , for ti@@ s@@ su@@ es and for org@@ ans themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get s@@ ick , the mess@@ age is we will treat your sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would pose to you that tom@@ or@@ row — and when tom@@ or@@ row is we could de@@ b@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the fore@@ see@@ able future — we will talk about re@@ gener@@ ative re@@ ha@@ bili@@ t@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic up here , sim@@ il@@ ar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 7@@ 0 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q that have l@@ ost lim@@ b@@ s .
"I@@ mag@@ ine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the re@@ generation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a wi@@ ld con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s app@@ lic@@ able , again , to every org@@ an system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to devel@@ op a con@@ vers@@ ation with the body .
We need to learn to spe@@ ak the body &apos;s language .
And to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch on pro@@ cess@@ es that we knew how to do when we were a fe@@ tu@@ s .
"A ma@@ m@@ m@@ ali@@ an fe@@ tu@@ s , if it l@@ os@@ es a lim@@ b d@@ uring the first tri@@ me@@ ster of pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ N@@ A has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ ound@@ -@@ heal@@ ing m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is l@@ ost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they l@@ ose their fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p in an ac@@ ci@@ dent , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to eng@@ age in that con@@ vers@@ ation with the body , we need to spe@@ ak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that al@@ low us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ ver@@ se with the body .
The first is c@@ ell@@ ular ther@@ ap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ pl@@ ant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , we can use materi@@ als ."
We heard y@@ est@@ er@@ day about the import@@ ance of new materi@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent materi@@ als , desig@@ n materi@@ als , or extr@@ act materi@@ als from a natural environ@@ ment , then we might be able to have those materi@@ als in@@ duce the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And fin@@ ally , we may be able to use smar@@ t dev@@ ices that will off@@ lo@@ ad the work of the body and al@@ low it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materi@@ als ."
S@@ te@@ ve B@@ ad@@ y@@ la@@ k — who &apos;s at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh — about a dec@@ ad@@ e ago had a re@@ mark@@ able idea .
"And that idea was that the small in@@ te@@ st@@ ine of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that al@@ lowed it to re@@ ma@@ in bio@@ log@@ ically ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary fac@@ tors and si@@ gn@@ als that would si@@ gn@@ al the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that u@@ su@@ ally in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small in@@ te@@ st@@ ine , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a ti@@ s@@ su@@ e-@@ speci@@ fic respon@@ se , or would it make small in@@ te@@ st@@ ine if I tri@@ ed to make a new e@@ ar ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be t@@ elling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t comp@@ elling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a comp@@ elling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , for those of you that are even the s@@ ligh@@ test bit s@@ qu@@ e@@ am@@ ish — even though you may not like to ad@@ m@@ it it in front of your friends — the ligh@@ ts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , ch@@ ec@@ k your B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the scre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a di@@ ab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ c@@ er .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to lau@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of di@@ ab@@ et@@ es .
"I think a lot of times we hear about di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t con@@ n@@ ect the ul@@ c@@ er with the even@@ tual tre@@ at@@ ment , which is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sli@@ de up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a di@@ ab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ c@@ er . It &apos;s tr@@ ag@@ ic .
The tre@@ at@@ ment for this is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ation .
"This is an ol@@ der l@@ ad@@ y . She has cancer of the li@@ ver as well as di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body int@@ act ."
"And this l@@ ad@@ y decided , after a year of att@@ emp@@ ted tre@@ at@@ ment of that ul@@ c@@ er , that she would try this new ther@@ ap@@ y that S@@ te@@ ve inv@@ en@@ ted ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 11 wee@@ ks later .
That material con@@ tain@@ ed only natural si@@ gn@@ als .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more dist@@ res@@ sing sli@@ des for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a h@@ or@@ se . The h@@ or@@ se is not in p@@ ain .
"If the h@@ or@@ se was in p@@ ain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sli@@ de ."
The h@@ or@@ se just has another n@@ os@@ tri@@ l that &apos;s develop@@ ed because of a ri@@ ding ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"@@ J@@ ust a few wee@@ ks after tre@@ at@@ ment — in this case , taking that material , tur@@ ning it into a ge@@ l , and p@@ ac@@ king that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the tre@@ at@@ ment a few times — and the h@@ or@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ att@@ ach@@ ed .
"There are now 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ ounds ."
C@@ ould you re@@ gener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave S@@ te@@ ve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ in@@ stitu@@ tion pro@@ ject to beg@@ in the process of as@@ king that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dol@@ l@@ ar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 year@@ -@@ old man who &apos;s l@@ ost the end of his fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p .
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber that I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed before the children who l@@ ose their fin@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ ps .
A@@ f@@ ter tre@@ at@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is cl@@ in@@ ically re@@ lev@@ ant today .
There are materi@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pat@@ ch@@ es .
But could you go a little f@@ ur@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed piece of ti@@ s@@ sue , put a bio@@ -@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart mu@@ sc@@ le be@@ ating in a dis@@ h .
This was done by T@@ er@@ u@@ o O@@ k@@ an@@ o at T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o W@@ om@@ en &apos;s H@@ osp@@ ital .
He can actually grow be@@ ating ti@@ s@@ sue in a dis@@ h .
"He ch@@ ills the dis@@ h , it changes its pro@@ per@@ ties and he pe@@ els it right out of the dis@@ h ."
It &apos;s the co@@ ol@@ est stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you c@@ ell@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ generation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being re@@ mo@@ ved from the hi@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ g@@ ain , if you &apos;re s@@ qu@@ e@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to wat@@ ch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of co@@ ol .
"So this is a b@@ yp@@ ass oper@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ ore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ yp@@ ass oper@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mo@@ ved at the beginning of the pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure being in@@ jec@@ ted direc@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"@@ Here go the stem cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really care@@ fully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a bac@@ k@@ -@@ fl@@ us@@ h ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sor@@ ts of new technology , new dev@@ ices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ J@@ ust a little bit of data , a t@@ iny bit of data ."
This was a r@@ and@@ om@@ i@@ zed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if you take an extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ ick pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ yp@@ ass , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their b@@ yp@@ ass , for these particular patients , they bec@@ ame as@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ tom@@ atic ."
Th@@ ese are now two years out .
"The co@@ ol@@ est thing would be is if you could di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure , but now done min@@ im@@ ally inv@@ as@@ i@@ vely , with only three ho@@ les in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply in@@ jec@@ ting stem cells through a l@@ ap@@ ar@@ os@@ cop@@ ic pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those deta@@ il@@ s , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less s@@ ick , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ tom@@ atic state through that kind of ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"@@ Here &apos;s another example of st@@ em@@ -@@ c@@ ell ther@@ ap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite cl@@ in@@ ical yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey Mar@@ r@@ a from P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great s@@ our@@ ce of stem cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are p@@ ac@@ ked in that li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ t@@ uc@@ k ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ pos@@ uc@@ tion flu@@ id , and in this case , the stem cells are is@@ ol@@ ated and tur@@ ned into neurons ."
A@@ ll done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ der@@ i@@ ved , or a@@ di@@ pos@@ e-@@ der@@ i@@ ved , stem cells ."
I tal@@ ked before about the use of dev@@ ices to dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I cl@@ ose up .
This is equ@@ ally tr@@ ag@@ ic .
"We have a very ab@@ i@@ ding and hear@@ t@@ bre@@ a@@ king par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with our colle@@ ag@@ ues at the In@@ stitu@@ te for S@@ ur@@ g@@ ical R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch in the U@@ S A@@ r@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very se@@ ver@@ ely bur@@ ned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ very@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding appro@@ ach .
"We make something over here , and then we trans@@ pl@@ ant it on@@ to the s@@ ite of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , w@@ ear@@ able bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been desig@@ ned — it should be te@@ sted cl@@ in@@ ically later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by J@@ o@@ er@@ g G@@ er@@ l@@ ach in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will l@@ ay down in the w@@ ound bed .
The gu@@ n that you see there sp@@ ra@@ ys cells .
That &apos;s going to sp@@ r@@ ay cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will ser@@ ve to fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ze the environ@@ ment , de@@ li@@ ver other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ e@@ fore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ posed to try the so@@ d@@ ding appro@@ ach ."
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very po@@ wer@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the imag@@ es kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ bly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ di@@ sci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary .
A@@ l@@ most every field of science engine@@ ering and cl@@ in@@ ical pr@@ acti@@ ce is inv@@ ol@@ ved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of govern@@ ments , and a number of re@@ gi@@ ons , have recogni@@ zed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The Jap@@ an@@ ese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to inv@@ est first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence .
Jap@@ an is the ol@@ d@@ est country on ear@@ th in ter@@ ms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re pu@@ tting a lot of str@@ ate@@ gi@@ c inv@@ est@@ ment fo@@ c@@ used in this are@@ a .
"The Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just lau@@ n@@ ched a national ti@@ s@@ su@@ e-@@ engine@@ ering center .
The first year bu@@ d@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
I@@ n the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different appro@@ ach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ ore to come and be in the real world as pre@@ si@@ dent ."
We &apos;ve had a different appro@@ ach .
And the appro@@ ach has basically been to just sort of fu@@ nd things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no str@@ ate@@ gi@@ c inv@@ est@@ ment to bring all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and fo@@ c@@ us them in a care@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little che@@ ap sho@@ t , at the direc@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ m@@ ing man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ an@@ t@@ i from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard went to vi@@ s@@ it with him and a number of his direc@@ tors of his in@@ stitu@@ te just a few months ago , to try and con@@ v@@ ince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and fo@@ c@@ us it , in a str@@ ate@@ gi@@ c way , to make sure we can ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ate the p@@ ace at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very te@@ st@@ y me@@ e@@ ting , what the N@@ I@@ H direc@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vi@@ sion is lar@@ ger than our appe@@ ti@@ te . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to cl@@ ose by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vi@@ sion , but together we can change his appe@@ ti@@ te ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple requ@@ est .
"I &apos;d like all of you to p@@ ause for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched we@@ ak@@ l@@ ings , and take st@@ oc@@ k of your mis@@ er@@ able exist@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the adv@@ ice that St@@ . B@@ ene@@ dic@@ t gave his rather star@@ t@@ led fol@@ low@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the adv@@ ice that I decided to fol@@ low my@@ self when I tur@@ ned 40 .
"@@ U@@ p until that moment , I had been that cl@@ assi@@ c cor@@ por@@ ate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was dr@@ in@@ king too much , I was working too hard and I was ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ d@@ ress the th@@ or@@ n@@ y is@@ sue of wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
"So I ste@@ p@@ ped back from the wor@@ k@@ force , and I sp@@ ent a year at home with my wi@@ fe and four young children ."
But all I learned about wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance from that year was that I found it quite easy to bal@@ ance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very u@@ se@@ ful sk@@ ill , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve sp@@ ent these se@@ ven years since str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with , stud@@ ying and wr@@ iting about wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
And I have four ob@@ serv@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this is@@ sue , we need an h@@ on@@ est de@@ b@@ ate ."
But the tr@@ ou@@ ble is so many people talk so much ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish about wor@@ k@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance .
"A@@ ll the disc@@ us@@ sions about f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or d@@ res@@ s@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ days or pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity leave only ser@@ ve to m@@ ask the c@@ ore is@@ sue , which is that certain job and care@@ er cho@@ ices are fundam@@ ent@@ ally in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with being mean@@ ing@@ fully eng@@ ag@@ ed on a d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day bas@@ is with a young family ."
Now the first ste@@ p in sol@@ ving any problem is ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ing the reality of the sit@@ u@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there lead@@ ing lives of qu@@ i@@ et , scre@@ am@@ ing des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at j@@ ob@@ s they h@@ ate to en@@ able them to bu@@ y things they don &apos;t need to im@@ pres@@ s people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my cont@@ en@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in j@@ e@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the n@@ u@@ b of the is@@ sue . ( Laughter )
The second ob@@ serv@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tru@@ th that govern@@ ments and cor@@ por@@ ations are@@ n &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this is@@ sue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als to take control and respon@@ si@@ bility for the t@@ y@@ pe of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t desig@@ n your life , someone else will desig@@ n it for you , and you may just not like their idea of bal@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s partic@@ ul@@ arly important — this isn &apos;t on the W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ de W@@ e@@ b , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s partic@@ ul@@ arly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the h@@ ands of a comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al cor@@ por@@ ation ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad comp@@ an@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all comp@@ an@@ ies .
Because comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al comp@@ an@@ ies are in@@ her@@ ently desig@@ ned to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ N@@ A ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well@@ -@@ int@@ enti@@ on@@ ed comp@@ an@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , pu@@ tting chil@@ d@@ care fac@@ ili@@ ties in the wor@@ k@@ place is wonderful and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the b@@ loo@@ dy off@@ ice ."
We have to be respon@@ sible for se@@ tting and en@@ for@@ c@@ ing the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The thir@@ d ob@@ serv@@ ation is we have to be care@@ ful with the time f@@ ra@@ me that we cho@@ ose up@@ on which to ju@@ dge our bal@@ ance .
"B@@ e@@ fore I went back to work after my year at home , I s@@ at down and I wr@@ ote out a deta@@ il@@ ed , ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ ste@@ p descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al bal@@ anc@@ ed day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : wa@@ ke up well re@@ sted after a good night &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ ave se@@ x .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ ave bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast with my wi@@ fe and children .
H@@ ave se@@ x again .
( Laughter ) D@@ ri@@ ve the kids to school on the way to the off@@ ice .
Do three hours &apos; work .
P@@ l@@ ay a sp@@ ort with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
M@@ e@@ et some mat@@ es in the pu@@ b for an early even@@ ing dr@@ ink .
D@@ ri@@ ve home for d@@ in@@ ner with my wi@@ fe and kids .
M@@ ed@@ it@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ ave se@@ x .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ ave se@@ x again .
G@@ o to bed .
( Applause ) How often do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be re@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate the time f@@ ra@@ me up@@ on which we ju@@ dge the bal@@ ance in our life , but we need to el@@ on@@ g@@ ate it without f@@ all@@ ing into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wi@@ fe has di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed me , my health is fa@@ il@@ ing , I &apos;ve got no mat@@ es or interest@@ s left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too sh@@ ort ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A f@@ our@@ th ob@@ serv@@ ation : We need to appro@@ ach bal@@ ance in a bal@@ anc@@ ed way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me t@@ elling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ i@@ ge@@ l , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I reali@@ ze that my life is completely out of bal@@ ance .
It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally dom@@ in@@ ated by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I comm@@ ute two hours a day .
A@@ ll of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fa@@ il@@ ed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life ap@@ art from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a g@@ ri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a g@@ y@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a f@@ it 1@@ 0-@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day off@@ ice r@@ at isn &apos;t more bal@@ anc@@ ed ; it &apos;s more f@@ it . ( Laughter )"
"@@ Lo@@ vely though physical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual side ; there &apos;s the emoti@@ onal side ; there &apos;s the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al side ."
"And to be bal@@ anc@@ ed , I believe we have to att@@ end to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 st@@ om@@ ach cr@@ un@@ ch@@ es ."
Now that can be d@@ au@@ n@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ loo@@ dy h@@ ell m@@ ate , I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to get f@@ it ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I tru@@ ly understand how that can be d@@ au@@ n@@ ting .
But an in@@ ci@@ dent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
"M@@ y wi@@ fe , who is some@@ where in the au@@ dience today , called me up at the off@@ ice and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ i@@ ge@@ l , you need to pic@@ k our youn@@ g@@ est son &quot; &quot; — H@@ ar@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that even@@ ing ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pic@@ ked H@@ ar@@ ry up at the school g@@ ates .
"We wal@@ ked down to the loc@@ al par@@ k , mess@@ ed around on the s@@ w@@ ings , play@@ ed some si@@ l@@ ly g@@ am@@ es ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the loc@@ al c@@ a@@ fe , and we s@@ ha@@ red a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man p@@ a@@ j@@ am@@ as ."
"I then read him a ch@@ ap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ a@@ h@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es and the G@@ i@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to bed , t@@ uc@@ ked him in , gave him a k@@ is@@ s on his fore@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; G@@ oo@@ d@@ night , m@@ ate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his be@@ d@@ room ."
"As I was wal@@ king out of his be@@ d@@ room , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , m@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I ha@@ dn &apos;t done anything , ha@@ dn &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ne@@ y W@@ or@@ ld or b@@ ought him a P@@ l@@ ay@@ st@@ ation ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
B@@ e@@ ing more bal@@ anc@@ ed doesn &apos;t mean dr@@ am@@ atic u@@ ph@@ e@@ av@@ al in your life .
"W@@ ith the sm@@ all@@ est inv@@ est@@ ment in the right places , you can ra@@ dic@@ ally trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ o@@ re@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ i@@ tion of suc@@ cess away from the mor@@ on@@ ically sim@@ p@@ li@@ sti@@ c n@@ oti@@ on that the person with the most money when he dies w@@ ins , to a more th@@ ough@@ t@@ ful and bal@@ anc@@ ed defin@@ i@@ tion of what a life well li@@ ved looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th sp@@ read@@ ing ."
( Applause )
I mo@@ ved to America 12 years ago with my wi@@ fe T@@ er@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed every country we &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s le@@ a@@ ving m@@ illions of children be@@ h@@ ind .
It actually cos@@ ts an en@@ orm@@ ous amount to mo@@ p up the d@@ am@@ age from the d@@ rop@@ out cri@@ s@@ is .
But the d@@ rop@@ out cri@@ s@@ is is just the ti@@ p of an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ l@@ ass si@@ z@@ es are sm@@ all@@ er than in many countries .
"The tr@@ ou@@ ble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion ."
"There are three prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es , and they are con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to l@@ ab@@ or and most students have to en@@ d@@ ure ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t they ?
What scho@@ ols are enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very n@@ ar@@ row spec@@ tru@@ m of achi@@ ev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to ar@@ gu@@ e against science and mat@@ h .
"A real education has to give equ@@ al we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the hum@@ ani@@ ties , to physical education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achi@@ ev@@ ement to put that particular ability out , or to sti@@ f@@ le it ."
T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers are the li@@ fe@@ b@@ loo@@ d of the suc@@ cess of scho@@ ols .
"A@@ n old fri@@ end of m@@ ine — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ e@@ ting .
The ro@@ le of a teacher is to fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ate learning .
They should be di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic . They should help .
"So in place of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed to fol@@ low r@@ out@@ ine al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms rather than to exc@@ ite that power of imag@@ in@@ ation and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t li@@ st@@ en to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , what we have is a culture of st@@ and@@ ar@@ di@@ zation ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ land .
M@@ any st@@ ates in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sa@@ il@@ ing into a he@@ ad@@ w@@ ind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very stud@@ ent who dro@@ ps out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bio@@ grap@@ h@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very pers@@ on@@ ali@@ zed .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an org@@ an@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the w@@ in@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y ."
S@@ even in@@ ch@@ es of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od .
The whole f@@ lo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ le@@ y was car@@ pe@@ ted in f@@ low@@ ers for a while .
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers know that .
"And if the mov@@ ement is str@@ ong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ v@@ olution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people re@@ ach suc@@ cess and then fa@@ il ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think suc@@ cess is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that le@@ ads up to suc@@ cess , but then we get there . We fig@@ ure we &apos;ve made it , we s@@ it back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us suc@@ cess@@ ful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing suc@@ cess , I worked hard , I pu@@ shed my@@ self ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fi@@ gu@@ red , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just s@@ it back and rel@@ a@@ x . &quot; &quot; R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing suc@@ cess , I always tri@@ ed to impro@@ ve and do good work ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped because I fi@@ gu@@ red , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to impro@@ ve any more . &quot; &quot; R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing suc@@ cess , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I fi@@ gu@@ red I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sho@@ t guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like mag@@ ic ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative bloc@@ k .
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"R@@ e@@ ach@@ ing suc@@ cess , I always fo@@ c@@ used on c@@ li@@ ents and pro@@ jects , and ig@@ no@@ red the money . Th@@ en all this money started p@@ our@@ ing in ."
And I got di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted by it .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I was on the ph@@ one to my st@@ oc@@ k@@ bro@@ ker and my real est@@ ate ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my c@@ li@@ ents ."
"And re@@ ach@@ ing suc@@ cess , I always did what I lo@@ ved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ ag@@ ement . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ag@@ er , but I fi@@ gu@@ red I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pre@@ si@@ dent of the comp@@ any ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d form@@ ed over my head and here I was , ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly very suc@@ cess@@ ful , but in@@ war@@ dly very depres@@ sed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ought a f@@ ast c@@ ar .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fa@@ ster but just as depres@@ sed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can bu@@ y anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m depres@@ sed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t bu@@ y happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can bu@@ y P@@ ro@@ z@@ a@@ c . &quot; &quot; And he put me on an@@ ti@@ -@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts ."
"And ye@@ ah , the black cl@@ ou@@ d f@@ ad@@ ed a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just f@@ lo@@ ating along . I couldn &apos;t care less if c@@ li@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And c@@ li@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer ser@@ ving them , I was only ser@@ ving my@@ self ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jects to others who would ser@@ ve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for business to dro@@ p like a ro@@ ck ."
"M@@ y par@@ t@@ ner and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , there was no@@ body for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jects I lo@@ ved .
"I had fu@@ n again , I worked har@@ der and , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort , did all the things that took me back up to suc@@ cess ."
But it wasn &apos;t a qu@@ ick tri@@ p .
It took se@@ ven years .
"But in the end , business gre@@ w big@@ ger than ever ."
"And when I went back to fol@@ lowing these eight prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head dis@@ appe@@ ared al@@ together ."
"And I w@@ o@@ ke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need P@@ ro@@ z@@ a@@ c any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and ha@@ ven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that suc@@ cess isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a contin@@ u@@ ous j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"And if we want to av@@ o@@ id &quot; &quot; suc@@ cess@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , &quot; &quot; we just keep fol@@ lowing these eight prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es , because that is not only how we achi@@ e@@ ve suc@@ cess , it &apos;s how we su@@ st@@ ain it ."
So here is to your contin@@ u@@ ed suc@@ cess .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as ad@@ ults , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
"There &apos;s still some con@@ fu@@ sion about that question , as this is a fa@@ ir@@ ly new field of resear@@ ch ."
"For example , I was talking to one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , who is an on@@ co@@ logi@@ st , and he was t@@ elling me , &quot; &quot; S@@ and@@ r@@ ine , this is pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling ."
"S@@ ome of my patients that have been told they are cu@@ red of their cancer still devel@@ op sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of depres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; And I respon@@ ded to him , &quot; &quot; Well , from my point of view that makes sense ."
"The dru@@ g you give to your patients that st@@ op@@ s the cancer cells m@@ ul@@ ti@@ pl@@ ying also st@@ op@@ s the ne@@ w@@ born neurons being gener@@ ated in their brain . &quot; &quot; And then R@@ ob@@ er@@ t looked at me like I was crazy and said , &quot; &quot; But S@@ and@@ r@@ ine , these are ad@@ ult patients — ad@@ ults do not grow new ner@@ ve cells . &quot; &quot; And much to his surpri@@ se , I said , &quot; &quot; Well actually , we do . &quot; &quot; And this is a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that we call neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
"@@ &#91; N@@ e@@ uro@@ gen@@ es@@ is &#93; Now R@@ ob@@ er@@ t is not a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , and when he went to medic@@ al school he was not t@@ au@@ ght what we know now — that the ad@@ ult brain can gener@@ ate new ner@@ ve cells ."
"So R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , you know , being the good doc@@ tor that he is , wanted to come to my la@@ b to understand the t@@ op@@ ic a little bit better ."
And I took him for a t@@ our of one of the most exc@@ iting parts of the brain when it comes to neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is — and this is the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us .
So this is this gr@@ ay struc@@ ture in the center of the brain .
"And what we &apos;ve known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , mem@@ ory , mo@@ od and emoti@@ on ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , what we have learned more rec@@ ently is that this is one of the uni@@ qu@@ e struc@@ tures of the ad@@ ult brain where new neurons can be gener@@ ated ."
"And if we sli@@ ce through the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us and z@@ o@@ om in , what you actually see here in bl@@ ue is a ne@@ w@@ born neur@@ on in an ad@@ ult m@@ ouse brain ."
"So when it comes to the human brain — my colle@@ ag@@ ue J@@ on@@ as F@@ ri@@ s@@ é@@ n from the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ t@@ et , has es@@ tim@@ ated that we pro@@ duce 7@@ 00 new neurons per day in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
"You might think this is not much , comp@@ ared to the b@@ illions of neurons we have ."
"But by the time we turn 50 , we will have all ex@@ changed the neurons we were born with in that struc@@ ture with ad@@ ul@@ t-@@ born neurons ."
So why are these new neurons important and what are their fun@@ c@@ tions ?
"F@@ ir@@ st , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and mem@@ ory ."
"And this is es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally new and true for sp@@ ati@@ al recogni@@ tion — so like , how you n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate your way in the c@@ ity ."
And more interesting to my colle@@ ag@@ ue R@@ ob@@ er@@ t is the resear@@ ch we have been doing on neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is and depres@@ sion .
"And if we give an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ an@@ ts , then we increase the produc@@ tion of these ne@@ w@@ born neurons , and we dec@@ re@@ ase the sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of depres@@ sion , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing a c@@ lear l@@ ink between neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is and depres@@ sion ."
"But mo@@ re@@ over , if you just bloc@@ k neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , then you bloc@@ k the eff@@ ic@@ acy of the an@@ ti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant ."
"So by then , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t had underst@@ ood that very likely his patients were suff@@ ering from depres@@ sion even after being cu@@ red of their cancer , because the cancer dru@@ g had st@@ op@@ ped ne@@ w@@ born neurons from being gener@@ ated ."
And it will take time to gener@@ ate new neurons that re@@ ach norm@@ al fun@@ c@@ tions .
"So , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , now we think we have enough evidence to say that neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is is a t@@ ar@@ get of cho@@ ice if we want to impro@@ ve mem@@ ory formation or mo@@ od , or even pre@@ v@@ ent the dec@@ line as@@ soci@@ ated with aging , or as@@ soci@@ ated with stress ."
So the next question is : can we control neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ?
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qu@@ i@@ z .
"I &apos;m going to give you a set of behavi@@ ors and acti@@ vi@@ ties , and you tell me if you think they will increase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is or if they will dec@@ re@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
Y@@ es .
L@@ ear@@ ning will increase the produc@@ tion of these new neurons .
How about stress ?
"Y@@ es , stress will dec@@ re@@ ase the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
How about s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation ?
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , it will dec@@ re@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
How about se@@ x ?
"O@@ h , w@@ ow !@@ "
"( Laughter ) Y@@ es , you are right , it will increase the produc@@ tion of new neurons ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , it &apos;s all about bal@@ ance here ."
We don &apos;t want to f@@ all in a sit@@ u@@ ation — ( Laughter ) about too much se@@ x lead@@ ing to s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation . ( Laughter )
How about getting ol@@ der ?
"So the neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is r@@ ate will dec@@ re@@ ase as we get ol@@ der , but it is still oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing ."
"And then fin@@ ally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you ju@@ dge that one by yourself .
And here you see a sec@@ tion of the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us of a m@@ ouse that had no run@@ ning whe@@ el in its c@@ age .
And the little black d@@ ots you see are actually ne@@ w@@ born neur@@ on@@ s@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ be .
"And now , you see a sec@@ tion of the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us of a m@@ ouse that had a run@@ ning whe@@ el in its c@@ age ."
"So acti@@ vity imp@@ ac@@ ts neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , but that &apos;s not all ."
What you e@@ at will have an eff@@ ect on the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us .
So here we have a s@@ am@@ ple of di@@ et — of n@@ u@@ tri@@ ents that have been sho@@ wn to have eff@@ ic@@ acy .
And I &apos;m just going to point a few out to you : C@@ al@@ ori@@ e re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion of 20 to 30 percent will increase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
In@@ ter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent fa@@ st@@ ing — sp@@ ac@@ ing the time between your me@@ als — will increase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
"I@@ n@@ take of fl@@ av@@ on@@ o@@ i@@ ds , which are con@@ tain@@ ed in dark cho@@ col@@ ate or bl@@ u@@ e@@ ber@@ ri@@ es , will increase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
"O@@ me@@ g@@ a@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ i@@ ds , present in f@@ at@@ ty f@@ ish , like s@@ al@@ m@@ on , will increase the produc@@ tion of these new neurons ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , a di@@ et r@@ ich in high s@@ at@@ ur@@ ated f@@ at will have a ne@@ g@@ ative imp@@ act on neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
E@@ th@@ an@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l — will dec@@ re@@ ase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , not everything is l@@ ost ; res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , which is con@@ tain@@ ed in red w@@ ine , has been sho@@ wn to prom@@ ote the survi@@ v@@ al of these new neurons ."
"So next time you are at a d@@ in@@ ner par@@ ty , you might want to re@@ ach for this possi@@ bly &quot; &quot; neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is@@ -@@ ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al &quot; &quot; dr@@ ink ."
"( Laughter ) And then fin@@ ally , let me point out the last one — a qu@@ ir@@ k@@ y one ."
"So Jap@@ an@@ ese grou@@ ps are f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with food t@@ ex@@ tures , and they have sho@@ wn that actually so@@ ft di@@ et imp@@ a@@ ir@@ s neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , as op@@ posed to food that requ@@ i@@ res m@@ as@@ tic@@ ation — che@@ wing — or cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y food ."
"So all of this data , where we need to look at the c@@ ell@@ ular level , has been gener@@ ated using anim@@ al mo@@ d@@ els ."
"But this di@@ et has also been given to human par@@ tici@@ pan@@ ts , and what we could see is that the di@@ et mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ates mem@@ ory and mo@@ od in the same direc@@ tion as it mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ates neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , such as : cal@@ ori@@ e re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion will impro@@ ve mem@@ ory cap@@ ac@@ ity , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as a high@@ -@@ f@@ at di@@ et will ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of depres@@ sion — as op@@ posed to ome@@ g@@ a@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ i@@ ds , which increase neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , and also help to dec@@ re@@ ase the sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s of depres@@ sion ."
"So we think that the eff@@ ect of di@@ et on mental health , on mem@@ ory and mo@@ od , is actually me@@ di@@ ated by the produc@@ tion of the new neurons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us ."
"O@@ n our side — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts interest@@ ed in neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is — we need to understand better the fun@@ c@@ tion of these new neurons , and how we can control their survi@@ v@@ al and their produc@@ tion ."
We also need to find a way to prot@@ ect the neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is of R@@ ob@@ er@@ t &apos;s patients .
And on your side — I leave you in char@@ ge of your neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
Thank you .

C@@ ould it be any kind of vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ?
"S@@ T : So for the moment , we can &apos;t really say if it &apos;s just the run@@ ning itself , but we think that anything that in@@ de@@ ed will increase the produc@@ tion — or mo@@ ving the b@@ loo@@ d f@@ low to the brain , should be b@@ ene@@ f@@ ici@@ al ."

What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pl@@ an , but in order for me to tell you what that pl@@ an is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of se@@ ts the st@@ age ."
"I tri@@ ed to look at where did the kind of learning we do in scho@@ ols , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to fig@@ ure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the bi@@ gg@@ est of the em@@ pi@@ res on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh E@@ m@@ p@@ ire &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ mag@@ ine trying to run the show , trying to run the enti@@ re planet , without compu@@ ters , without tel@@ e@@ ph@@ ones , with data h@@ and@@ wr@@ it@@ ten on pi@@ ec@@ es of p@@ ap@@ er , and tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was ama@@ zing .
They cre@@ ated a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic ad@@ min@@ i@@ str@@ ative machine .
"In order to have that machine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to pro@@ duce those people : the school .
The scho@@ ols would pro@@ duce the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ atic ad@@ min@@ i@@ str@@ ative machine .
They must be i@@ den@@ tical to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good h@@ and@@ wr@@ iting , because the data is h@@ and@@ wr@@ it@@ ten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation , divi@@ sion , ad@@ di@@ tion and sub@@ tr@@ action in their head ."
They must be so i@@ den@@ tical that you could pic@@ k one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and he would be inst@@ an@@ tly fun@@ c@@ ti@@ onal .
The V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ er@@ ed a system that was so ro@@ b@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , contin@@ u@@ ously produc@@ ing i@@ den@@ tical people for a machine that no longer ex@@ ists ."
"The emp@@ ire is g@@ one , so what are we doing with that desig@@ n that produc@@ es these i@@ den@@ tical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ so@@ le@@ te &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty str@@ ong com@@ ment there .
"I said scho@@ ols as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s quite f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ able to say that the education system &apos;s bro@@ ken .
It &apos;s not bro@@ ken . It &apos;s wonder@@ fully con@@ struc@@ ted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s out@@ d@@ ated .
What are the kind of j@@ ob@@ s that we have today ?
"Well , the cl@@ er@@ ks are the compu@@ ters ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every off@@ ice .
And you have people who gu@@ i@@ de those compu@@ ters to do their cl@@ er@@ ical j@@ ob@@ s .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to wr@@ ite beauti@@ fully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ply num@@ bers in their he@@ ads .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read disc@@ er@@ n@@ ing@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ ob@@ s of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in wh@@ at@@ ever way they want ."
How is pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ p@@ are them for that world ?
"Well , I b@@ um@@ ped into this whole thing completely by ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I used to te@@ ach people how to wr@@ ite computer pro@@ gr@@ ams in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , 1@@ 4 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a s@@ l@@ um ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to wr@@ ite computer pro@@ gr@@ ams ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of parents , r@@ ich people , who had compu@@ ters , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with compu@@ ters ."
"And my d@@ aughter — o@@ h , su@@ re@@ ly she is ex@@ tra@@ -@@ intellig@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly fi@@ gu@@ red that , how come all the r@@ ich people are having these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the po@@ or do wrong ?
"I made a hole in the b@@ ound@@ ary w@@ all of the s@@ l@@ um next to my off@@ ice , and st@@ uc@@ k a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the In@@ ter@@ net was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; J@@ ust like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an we tou@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you w@@ ish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight hours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s im@@ possible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; My colle@@ ag@@ ues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solu@@ tion ."
"One of your students must have been p@@ ass@@ ing by , sho@@ wed them how to use the m@@ ouse . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 mil@@ es out of D@@ el@@ h@@ i into a really re@@ m@@ ote village where the chan@@ ces of a p@@ ass@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are develop@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to st@@ ay , so I st@@ uc@@ k my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids play@@ ing g@@ am@@ es on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fa@@ ster pro@@ cess@@ or and a better m@@ ouse . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ r@@ it@@ ated v@@ o@@ ice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to te@@ ach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; te@@ ach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so cas@@ u@@ ally ."

"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting exactly the same res@@ ults that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all f@@ il@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; A@@ n e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year@@ -@@ old t@@ elling his el@@ der si@@ ster what to do .
"And fin@@ ally a gir@@ l expl@@ ain@@ ing in Mar@@ ath@@ i what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a pro@@ cess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publi@@ sh@@ ing ."
"I published every@@ where . I wr@@ ote down and meas@@ u@@ red everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left al@@ one with a computer in any language will re@@ ach the same st@@ and@@ ard as an off@@ ice sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cur@@ i@@ ous to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experim@@ ent@@ ing with other sub@@ jects , am@@ ong them , for example , pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one comm@@ unity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose English pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would impro@@ ve their j@@ ob@@ s ."
"I gave them a spe@@ ech@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ t@@ ex@@ t eng@@ ine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it typ@@ es what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and wat@@ ch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter : N@@ ice to me@@ et y@@ ou@@ .@@ C@@ hi@@ ld : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
Su@@ g@@ at@@ a M@@ it@@ r@@ a : The reason I en@@ ded with the face of this young l@@ ad@@ y over there is because I su@@ sp@@ ect many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call center in H@@ y@@ der@@ ab@@ ad and may have t@@ or@@ tu@@ red you about your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard b@@ ills in a very c@@ lear English ac@@ cent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
Wh@@ ere does it stop ?
I decided I would dest@@ ro@@ y my own ar@@ g@@ ument by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ posi@@ tion .
"I made a hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is , a ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is ."
"T@@ am@@ il is a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ di@@ an language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ spe@@ a@@ king children in a s@@ ou@@ th In@@ di@@ an village learn the bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy of D@@ N@@ A re@@ p@@ lic@@ ation in English from a stre@@ et@@ side computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a z@@ er@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another z@@ er@@ o ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all compu@@ ters there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed all kinds of stuff from the In@@ ter@@ net about D@@ N@@ A re@@ p@@ lic@@ ation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came ru@@ sh@@ ing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very t@@ op@@ ical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and di@@ ag@@ r@@ ams and ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had develop@@ ed a new pe@@ d@@ ag@@ o@@ g@@ ical me@@ th@@ od , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I ha@@ ven &apos;t the fo@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a z@@ er@@ o . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve underst@@ ood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I exp@@ ect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We ha@@ ven &apos;t given up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these scre@@ ens and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little gir@@ l who you see just now , she ra@@ is@@ ed her hand , and she says to me in bro@@ ken T@@ am@@ il and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , ap@@ art from the fact that impro@@ per re@@ p@@ lic@@ ation of the D@@ N@@ A m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le cau@@ ses disease , we ha@@ ven &apos;t underst@@ ood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I te@@ sted them ."
"I got an educ@@ ational im@@ possi@@ bility , z@@ er@@ o to 30 percent in two months in the t@@ rop@@ ical he@@ at with a computer under the t@@ ree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a dec@@ ad@@ e a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an n@@ or@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fa@@ il .
How do I get them to p@@ ass ? I have to get them 20 more mar@@ ks .
"I couldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old gir@@ l who was an ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ant and she play@@ ed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this gir@@ l , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that t@@ ree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ th@@ od of the gr@@ and@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; St@@ and be@@ h@@ ind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , w@@ ow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next p@@ age ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what gr@@ an@@ n@@ ies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The sc@@ o@@ res j@@ um@@ ped to 50 percent .
"@@ K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am had cau@@ ght up with my control school in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , a r@@ ich pri@@ v@@ ate school with a tr@@ ained bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ no@@ logy teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that grap@@ h I knew there is a way to level the play@@ ing field .
Here &apos;s K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ p@@ am .
( Ch@@ il@@ dren spe@@ a@@ king ) N@@ e@@ ur@@ ons ... comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation .
"I got the cam@@ er@@ a ang@@ le wrong . That one is just am@@ ate@@ ur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her h@@ ands were like that , and she was saying neurons comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ ob@@ s going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children p@@ our@@ ing over with their mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones on the one hand and then rel@@ uc@@ t@@ an@@ tly going to school to pic@@ k up their bo@@ o@@ ks with their other hand ."
What will it be tom@@ or@@ row ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a dev@@ ast@@ ating question , a question that was fr@@ am@@ ed for me by N@@ ic@@ ho@@ l@@ as N@@ e@@ gro@@ p@@ on@@ te — could it be that we are he@@ ad@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are h@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens .
"@@ K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ sh@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ap@@ e st@@ and up and become H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
What an achi@@ ev@@ ement that is .
But we have to in@@ te@@ gr@@ ate that into our own future .
E@@ n@@ cour@@ ag@@ ement seems to be the k@@ ey .
"If you look at K@@ up@@ p@@ am , if you look at all of the experim@@ ents that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; s@@ al@@ u@@ ting learning ."
There is evidence from neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"The re@@ p@@ ti@@ li@@ an part of our brain , which s@@ its in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ u@@ ts down everything else , it sh@@ u@@ ts down the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ u@@ ts all of that down ."
P@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and exam@@ in@@ ations are seen as thre@@ at@@ s .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res when you needed those people who can survi@@ ve under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re st@@ anding in a tre@@ n@@ ch all al@@ one , if you could have survi@@ ved , you &apos;re o@@ kay , you &apos;ve p@@ ass@@ ed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fa@@ il@@ ed ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res is g@@ one .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that bal@@ ance back from thre@@ at to ple@@ as@@ ure .
I came back to Eng@@ land looking for B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers .
"I put out not@@ ices in p@@ ap@@ ers saying , if you are a B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh gr@@ and@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a we@@ b cam@@ er@@ a , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per week for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two wee@@ ks .
I know more B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ n@@ y C@@ l@@ ou@@ d s@@ its on the In@@ ter@@ net .
"If there &apos;s a child in tr@@ ou@@ ble , we be@@ am a G@@ r@@ an ."
She goes on over S@@ k@@ y@@ pe and she sor@@ ts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called D@@ ig@@ g@@ les in n@@ or@@ th@@ we@@ st@@ er@@ n Eng@@ land , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ am@@ il N@@ ad@@ u , India , 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es away ."
She does it with only one ag@@ e-@@ old ge@@ st@@ ure .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ at@@ ch this .
G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . You say it . You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
Ch@@ il@@ dren : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ bre@@ ad M@@ an@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ bre@@ ad M@@ an . G@@ r@@ and@@ mother : Well done ! V@@ ery good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the produc@@ t of educ@@ ational self-@@ organi@@ zation .
"If you al@@ low the educ@@ ational process to self-@@ organi@@ ze , then learning em@@ er@@ g@@ es ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about le@@ tting it happen .
The teacher se@@ ts the process in moti@@ on and then she st@@ ands back in a@@ we and wat@@ ch@@ es as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is poin@@ ting at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I int@@ end to build these S@@ el@@ f@@ -@@ O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ zed L@@ ear@@ ning E@@ n@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are basically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation and enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ement put together ."
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed this in many , many scho@@ ols ."
"It &apos;s been tri@@ ed all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ il@@ dren talking ) This one is in Eng@@ land .
"He ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins la@@ w and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
G@@ ir@@ l : The t@@ ot@@ al number of electr@@ ons is not equ@@ al to the t@@ ot@@ al number of prot@@ ons — S@@ M : A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a G@@ ir@@ l : — giving it a net posi@@ tive or ne@@ g@@ ative electr@@ ical char@@ ge .
The net char@@ ge on an i@@ on is equ@@ al to the number of prot@@ ons in the i@@ on min@@ us the number of electr@@ ons .
S@@ M : A dec@@ ad@@ e a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when St@@ one A@@ ge men and women used to s@@ it and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling ligh@@ ts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um , but we &apos;ve l@@ ost sight of those won@@ dr@@ ous questions ."
We &apos;ve br@@ ought it down to the t@@ ang@@ ent of an ang@@ le .
But that &apos;s not se@@ x@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a me@@ te@@ or@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you fig@@ ure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a mag@@ ic word . It &apos;s called the t@@ ang@@ ent of an ang@@ le , &quot; &quot; and leave him al@@ one . He &apos;ll fig@@ ure it out ."
So here are a couple of imag@@ es from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed incredi@@ ble , incredi@@ ble questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world beg@@ in ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we bre@@ a@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ is@@ es the question , and then st@@ ands back and ad@@ mi@@ res the answer ."
So what &apos;s my w@@ ish ?
My w@@ ish is that we desig@@ n the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be sp@@ are parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to desig@@ n a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — h@@ ang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
My w@@ ish is to help desig@@ n a future of learning by sup@@ por@@ ting children all over the world to ta@@ p into their won@@ der and their ability to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual adv@@ en@@ tures dri@@ ven by the big questions which their me@@ di@@ at@@ ors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ ili@@ ty where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ ili@@ ty which is pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one gr@@ an@@ n@@ y who man@@ ages health and sa@@ fe@@ ty .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The ligh@@ ts are tur@@ ned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ pose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f@@ -@@ O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ zed L@@ ear@@ ning E@@ n@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clu@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great doc@@ ument produc@@ ed by TED which t@@ ells you how to do it .
"If you would ple@@ ase , ple@@ ase do it across all five contin@@ ents and s@@ end me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the S@@ cho@@ ol of C@@ l@@ ou@@ ds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my w@@ ish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as .
"A@@ t 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et , where the air is th@@ in , I once built two H@@ ole in the W@@ all compu@@ ters , and the children f@@ loc@@ ked there ."
And there was this little gir@@ l who was fol@@ lowing me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly ."
"S@@ he su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly ra@@ is@@ ed her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; G@@ et on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good adv@@ ice .
I &apos;ll fol@@ low her adv@@ ice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . W@@ ow . ( Applause )
I want to talk to you about something kind of big .
We &apos;ll start here .
6@@ 5 million years ago the d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s had a bad day .
"( Laughter ) A ch@@ un@@ k of ro@@ ck six mil@@ es across , mo@@ ving something like 50 times the spe@@ ed of a ri@@ f@@ le b@@ ul@@ let , s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ed into the Earth ."
"It re@@ le@@ as@@ ed its energy all at once , and it was an expl@@ os@@ i@@ on that was min@@ d@@ -@@ num@@ b@@ ing ."
"If you took every n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ on ever built at the he@@ ight of the C@@ old W@@ ar , l@@ um@@ ped them together and b@@ le@@ w them up at the same time , that would be one on@@ e-@@ m@@ illi@@ on@@ th of the energy re@@ le@@ as@@ ed at that moment ."
The d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s had a really bad day .
O@@ kay ?
"Now , a si@@ x@@ -@@ mil@@ e-@@ wi@@ de ro@@ ck is very large ."
We all live here in B@@ oul@@ der .
"If you look out your w@@ in@@ do@@ w and you can see L@@ ong &apos;s Pe@@ ak , you &apos;re probably fam@@ ili@@ ar with it ."
"Now , sc@@ o@@ op up L@@ ong &apos;s Pe@@ ak , and put it out in space ."
"T@@ a@@ ke M@@ e@@ e@@ ker , M@@ t . M@@ e@@ e@@ ker . L@@ um@@ p that in there , and put that in space as well , and M@@ t . E@@ ver@@ est , and K@@ 2 , and the In@@ di@@ an pe@@ a@@ ks ."
"Th@@ en you &apos;re star@@ ting to get an idea of how much ro@@ ck we &apos;re talking about , o@@ kay ?"
We know it was that big because of the imp@@ act it had and the cr@@ ater it left .
"It h@@ it in what we now know as Y@@ uc@@ at@@ an , the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o ."
"You can see here , there &apos;s the Y@@ uc@@ at@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ s@@ ul@@ a , if you recogni@@ ze C@@ o@@ z@@ u@@ me@@ l off the e@@ ast co@@ ast there ."
Here is how big of a cr@@ ater was left .
"It was huge . T@@ o give you a sense of the sc@@ ale , o@@ kay , there you go . The sc@@ ale here is 50 mil@@ es on top , a hundred k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters on the bot@@ tom . This thing was 3@@ 00 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters across — 200 mil@@ es — an en@@ orm@@ ous cr@@ ater that exc@@ av@@ ated out v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of ear@@ th that s@@ pl@@ as@@ h@@ ed around the g@@ lo@@ be and set fi@@ res all over the planet , thre@@ w up enough d@@ ust to bloc@@ k out the su@@ n ."
It wi@@ ped out 7@@ 5 percent of all spec@@ ies on Earth .
"Now , not all ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds are that big ."
S@@ ome of them are sm@@ all@@ er .
Here is one that came in over the United States in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber of 19@@ 9@@ 2 .
It came in on a F@@ ri@@ day night .
Why is that important ?
"Because back then , vide@@ o cam@@ er@@ as were just star@@ ting to become pop@@ ular , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all g@@ am@@ es to f@@ il@@ m their kids play fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all . And since this came in on a F@@ ri@@ day , they were able to get this great fo@@ ot@@ age of this thing bre@@ a@@ king up as it came in over W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ ina , Mar@@ y@@ land , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a and New J@@ er@@ se@@ y until it did that to a c@@ ar in New Y@@ or@@ k ."
"( Laughter ) Now , this is not a 20@@ 0-@@ mil@@ e-@@ wi@@ de cr@@ ater , but then again you can see the ro@@ ck which is sit@@ ting right here , about the size of a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all , that h@@ it that c@@ ar and did that d@@ am@@ age ."
Now this thing was probably about the size of a school b@@ us when it first came in .
"It bro@@ ke up through at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic pres@@ sure , it cr@@ um@@ bl@@ ed , and then the pi@@ ec@@ es f@@ ell ap@@ art and did some d@@ am@@ age ."
"Now , you wouldn &apos;t want that f@@ all@@ ing on your fo@@ ot or your head , because it would do that to it ."
That would be bad .
"But it won &apos;t wi@@ pe out , you know , all life on Earth , so that &apos;s fine . But it turns out , you don &apos;t need something six mil@@ es across to do a lot of d@@ am@@ age ."
"There is a me@@ di@@ an point between t@@ iny ro@@ ck and gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic ro@@ ck , and in fact , if any of you have ever been to ne@@ ar W@@ in@@ s@@ low , A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a , there is a cr@@ ater in the des@@ er@@ t there that is so ic@@ on@@ ic that it is actually called M@@ e@@ te@@ or C@@ r@@ ater ."
"T@@ o give you a sense of sc@@ ale , this is about a mi@@ le wi@@ de ."
"If you look up at the top , that &apos;s a par@@ king lot , and those are re@@ cre@@ ational ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les right there ."
"So it &apos;s about a mi@@ le across , 6@@ 00 fe@@ et de@@ ep ."
"The ob@@ ject that form@@ ed this was probably about 30 to 50 y@@ ar@@ ds across , so r@@ ough@@ ly the size of M@@ ac@@ k@@ ey A@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um here ."
"It came in at spe@@ e@@ ds that were tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous , s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ed into the ground , b@@ le@@ w up , and exp@@ lo@@ ded with the energy of r@@ ough@@ ly a 20@@ -@@ me@@ g@@ at@@ on n@@ uc@@ lear bom@@ b — a very he@@ f@@ ty bom@@ b ."
"This was 5@@ 0,000 years ago , so it may have wi@@ ped out a few bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o or an@@ tel@@ op@@ e , or something like that out in the des@@ er@@ t , but it probably would not have cau@@ sed global dev@@ ast@@ ation ."
It turns out that these things don &apos;t have to h@@ it the ground to do a lot of d@@ am@@ age .
"Now , in 19@@ 0@@ 8 , over S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a , ne@@ ar the T@@ un@@ g@@ us@@ k@@ a re@@ gi@@ on — for those of you who are D@@ an A@@ y@@ k@@ ro@@ y@@ d f@@ ans and saw &quot; &quot; G@@ h@@ os@@ t@@ bu@@ st@@ ers , &quot; &quot; when he tal@@ ked about the gre@@ at@@ est cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal ri@@ ft since the S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a bl@@ ast of 19@@ 0@@ 9 , where he got the d@@ ate wrong , but that &apos;s o@@ kay . ( Laughter ) It was 19@@ 0@@ 8 . That &apos;s fine . I can live with that . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ no@@ ther ro@@ ck came into the Earth &apos;s at@@ m@@ osp@@ here and this one b@@ le@@ w up abo@@ ve the ground , se@@ ver@@ al mil@@ es up abo@@ ve the sur@@ face of the Earth ."
"The he@@ at from the expl@@ os@@ i@@ on set fir@@ e to the fore@@ st b@@ el@@ ow it , and then the sho@@ ck w@@ ave came down and kno@@ c@@ ked down tre@@ es for hund@@ re@@ ds of s@@ qu@@ are mil@@ es , o@@ kay ?"
This did a huge amount of d@@ am@@ age .
"And again , this was a ro@@ ck probably r@@ ough@@ ly the size of this au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um that we &apos;re sit@@ ting in ."
"In M@@ e@@ te@@ or C@@ r@@ ater it was made of me@@ t@@ al , and me@@ t@@ al is much t@@ ough@@ er , so it made it to the ground ."
"The one over T@@ un@@ g@@ us@@ k@@ a was probably made of ro@@ ck , and that &apos;s much more cr@@ um@@ bly , so it b@@ le@@ w up in the air . E@@ ither way , these are tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous expl@@ os@@ i@@ ons , 20 me@@ g@@ at@@ ons ."
"Now , when these things b@@ low up , they &apos;re not going to do global ec@@ o@@ logical d@@ am@@ age ."
They &apos;re not going to do something like the d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ k@@ ill@@ er did .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
"But they will do global economic d@@ am@@ age , because they don &apos;t have to h@@ it , nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , to do this kind of d@@ am@@ age ."
They don &apos;t have to do global dev@@ ast@@ ation .
"If one of these things were to h@@ it pretty much any@@ where , it would c@@ ause a pan@@ ic ."
"But if it came over a c@@ ity , an important c@@ ity — not that any c@@ ity is more important than others , but some of them we dep@@ end on them more on the global economic bas@@ is — that could do a huge amount of d@@ am@@ age to us as a civi@@ li@@ zation ."
"So , now that I &apos;ve sc@@ ared the cra@@ p out of you ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) what can we do about this ? A@@ ll right ?
This is a p@@ ot@@ ential thre@@ at .
Let me n@@ ote that we have not had a gi@@ ant imp@@ act like the d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ -@@ k@@ ill@@ er for 6@@ 5 million years . They &apos;re very r@@ are .
"The sm@@ all@@ er ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um , every few cent@@ ur@@ ies or every few thous@@ and years , but it &apos;s still something to be aw@@ are of ."
"Well , what do we do about them ?"
The first thing we have to do is find them .
This is an im@@ age of an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id that p@@ ass@@ ed us in 200@@ 9 .
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly fa@@ in@@ t .
I don &apos;t even know if you can see that in the back row . Th@@ ese are just stars .
"This is a ro@@ ck that was about 30 y@@ ar@@ ds across , so r@@ ough@@ ly the size of the ones that b@@ le@@ w up over T@@ un@@ g@@ us@@ k@@ a and h@@ it A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a 5@@ 0,000 years ago ."
Th@@ ese things are fa@@ in@@ t .
"They &apos;re hard to see , and the sk@@ y is really big ."
We have to find these things first .
"Well the good news is , we &apos;re looking for them ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has dev@@ ot@@ ed money to this .
"The N@@ ational S@@ ci@@ ence F@@ ound@@ ation , other countries are very interest@@ ed in doing this ."
"We &apos;re building tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es that are looking for the thre@@ at . That &apos;s a great first ste@@ p , but what &apos;s the second ste@@ p ? The second ste@@ p is that we see one he@@ ad@@ ing to@@ ward us , we have to stop it . What do we do ?"
"You &apos;ve probably heard about the ast@@ er@@ o@@ id Ap@@ op@@ his . If you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet , you will ."
"If you &apos;ve heard about the M@@ ay@@ an 20@@ 12 ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ se , you &apos;re going to hear about Ap@@ op@@ his , because you &apos;re ke@@ y@@ ed in to all the do@@ om@@ s@@ day ne@@ t@@ works any@@ way ."
Ap@@ op@@ his is an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id that was disc@@ over@@ ed in 200@@ 4 .
"It &apos;s r@@ ough@@ ly 2@@ 50 y@@ ar@@ ds across , so it &apos;s pretty big — big size , you know , big@@ ger than a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all sta@@ di@@ um — and it &apos;s going to p@@ ass by the Earth in Ap@@ ri@@ l of 20@@ 2@@ 9 ."
And it &apos;s going to p@@ ass us so cl@@ ose that it &apos;s actually going to come under@@ ne@@ ath our we@@ a@@ ther s@@ at@@ elli@@ t@@ es .
"The Earth &apos;s gra@@ vity is going to b@@ end the or@@ bit of this thing so much that if it &apos;s just right , if it p@@ ass@@ es through this re@@ gi@@ on of space , this ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y be@@ an@@ -@@ shap@@ ed re@@ gi@@ on called the ke@@ y@@ hole , the Earth &apos;s gra@@ vity will b@@ end it just enough that se@@ ven years later on Ap@@ ri@@ l 1@@ 3 , which is a F@@ ri@@ day , I &apos;ll n@@ ote , in the year 20@@ 3@@ 6 ... ( Laughter ) — you can &apos;t pl@@ an that kind of stuff — Ap@@ op@@ his is going to h@@ it us . And it &apos;s 2@@ 50 me@@ ters across , so it would do un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able d@@ am@@ age ."
"Now the good news is that the o@@ d@@ ds of it actually p@@ ass@@ ing through this ke@@ y@@ hole and h@@ it@@ ting us next go@@ -@@ around are one in a million , r@@ ough@@ ly — very , very low o@@ d@@ ds , so I pers@@ on@@ ally am not l@@ ying a@@ wa@@ ke at night wor@@ r@@ ying about this at all ."
I don &apos;t think Ap@@ op@@ his is a problem .
"In fact , Ap@@ op@@ his is a bl@@ ess@@ ing in dis@@ gu@@ ise , because it w@@ o@@ ke us up to the d@@ ang@@ ers of these things ."
This thing was disc@@ over@@ ed just a few years ago and could h@@ it us a few years from now .
"It won &apos;t , but it gi@@ ves us a chan@@ ce to study these kinds of ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds . We didn &apos;t really nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily understand these ke@@ y@@ ho@@ les , and now we do and it turns out that &apos;s really important , because how do you stop an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id like this ?"
"Well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re st@@ anding in the middle of the ro@@ ad and a c@@ ar &apos;s he@@ ad@@ ed for you ? What do you do ? You do this ."
R@@ ight ? M@@ o@@ ve . The c@@ ar goes past you .
"But we can &apos;t move the Earth , at le@@ ast not eas@@ ily , but we can move a small ast@@ er@@ o@@ id ."
"And it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it ."
"In the year 200@@ 5 , N@@ A@@ S@@ A lau@@ n@@ ched a pro@@ be called D@@ e@@ ep I@@ m@@ p@@ act , which s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ed into — s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ed a piece of itself into the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us of a com@@ et ."
C@@ ome@@ ts are very much like ast@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds .
The pur@@ pose wasn &apos;t to p@@ us@@ h it out of the way .
"The pur@@ pose was to make a cr@@ ater to exc@@ av@@ ate the material and see what was under@@ ne@@ ath the sur@@ face of this com@@ et , which we learned quite a bit about ."
"We did move the com@@ et a little t@@ iny bit , not very much , but that wasn &apos;t the point ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , think about this ."
"This thing is or@@ b@@ iting the su@@ n at 10 mil@@ es per second , 20 mil@@ es per second ."
We sho@@ t a space pro@@ be at it and h@@ it it . O@@ kay ?
"I@@ mag@@ ine how hard that must be , and we did it ."
That means we can do it again .
"If we need , if we see an ast@@ er@@ o@@ id that &apos;s coming to@@ ward us , and it &apos;s he@@ ad@@ ed right for us , and we have two years to go , bo@@ om ! We h@@ it it ."
"You can try to — you know , if you wat@@ ch the mo@@ vi@@ es , you might think about , why don &apos;t we use a n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ on ?"
"It &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is tim@@ ing ."
"You sho@@ ot a n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ on at this thing , you have to b@@ low it up within a few m@@ illi@@ secon@@ ds of t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance or else you &apos;ll just mis@@ s it ."
And there are a lot of other problems with that . It &apos;s very hard to do .
But just h@@ it@@ ting something ? That &apos;s pretty easy .
"I think even N@@ A@@ S@@ A can do that , and they pro@@ ved that they can . ( Laughter ) The problem is , what happens if you h@@ it this ast@@ er@@ o@@ id , you &apos;ve changed the or@@ bit , you measure the or@@ bit and then you find out , o@@ h , ye@@ ah , we just pu@@ shed it into a ke@@ y@@ hole , and now it &apos;s going to h@@ it us in three years ."
"Well , my op@@ in@@ i@@ on is , fine . O@@ kay ?"
It &apos;s not h@@ it@@ ting us in six months . That &apos;s good .
Now we have three years to do something else .
"And you can h@@ it it again . That &apos;s kind of ha@@ m@@ -@@ fi@@ sted . You might just p@@ us@@ h it into a thir@@ d ke@@ y@@ hole or wh@@ at@@ ever , so you don &apos;t do that ."
"And this is the part , it &apos;s the part I just love ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ f@@ ter the big mach@@ o &quot; &quot; R@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ r B@@ A@@ M ! We &apos;re g@@ on@@ n@@ a h@@ it this thing in the face , &quot; &quot; then we bring in the v@@ el@@ v@@ et g@@ lo@@ ves . ( Laughter )"
"There &apos;s a group of scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers and astron@@ au@@ ts and they call themselves The B@@ 6@@ 12 F@@ ound@@ ation .

"It doesn &apos;t have to be huge — couple of t@@ ons , not that big — and you par@@ k it ne@@ ar the ast@@ er@@ o@@ id ."
"You don &apos;t land on it , because these things are tu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing end over end . It &apos;s very hard to land on them ."
In@@ ste@@ ad you get ne@@ ar it .
"The gra@@ vity of the ast@@ er@@ o@@ id pul@@ ls on the pro@@ be , and the pro@@ be has a couple of t@@ ons of mass ."
"It has a little t@@ iny bit of gra@@ vity , but it &apos;s enough that it can pul@@ l the ast@@ er@@ o@@ id , and you have your ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts set up , so you can — o@@ h , you can b@@ are@@ ly see it here , but there &apos;s ro@@ c@@ k@@ et pl@@ um@@ es — and you basically , these gu@@ ys are connec@@ ted by their own gra@@ vity , and if you move the pro@@ be very s@@ low@@ ly , very , very g@@ ently , you can very eas@@ ily fin@@ es@@ se that ro@@ ck into a sa@@ fe or@@ bit ."
"You can even put in or@@ bit around the Earth where we could m@@ ine it , al@@ though that &apos;s a whole other thing . I won &apos;t go into that ."
( Laughter ) But we &apos;d be r@@ ich ! ( Laughter )
"So think about this , right ?"
"There are these gi@@ ant ro@@ c@@ ks fl@@ ying out there , and they &apos;re h@@ it@@ ting us , and they &apos;re doing d@@ am@@ age to us , but we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red out how to do this , and all the pi@@ ec@@ es are in place to do this ."
"We have astron@@ om@@ ers in place with tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es looking for them . We have smar@@ t people , very , very smar@@ t people , who are con@@ cer@@ ned about this and fig@@ uring out how to fi@@ x the problem , and we have the technology to do this ."
This pro@@ be actually can &apos;t use ch@@ em@@ ical ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
"@@ Ch@@ em@@ ical ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts pro@@ vi@@ de too much thr@@ ust , too much p@@ us@@ h . The pro@@ be would just sho@@ ot away ."
"We inv@@ en@@ ted something called an i@@ on dri@@ ve , which is a very , very , very low@@ -@@ thr@@ ust eng@@ ine ."
"It gener@@ ates the force a piece of p@@ ap@@ er would have on your hand , incredi@@ bly light , but it can run for months and years , pro@@ vi@@ ding that very g@@ ent@@ le p@@ us@@ h ."

( Applause ) S@@ po@@ ck .
( Laughter ) So ...
"@@ that &apos;s the difference , that &apos;s the difference between us and the d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s ."
This happened to them .
It doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
"The difference between the d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s and us is that we have a space program and we can v@@ ote , and so we can change our future ."
( Laughter ) We have the ability to change our future .
"@@ 6@@ 5 million years from now , we don &apos;t have to have our b@@ ones coll@@ ec@@ ting d@@ ust in a mu@@ se@@ um ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galaxy , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
"And if you take a cam@@ er@@ a and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ u@@ tter op@@ en , as long as your cam@@ er@@ a is att@@ ach@@ ed to the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little b@@ lob@@ s is a galaxy r@@ ough@@ ly the size of our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those b@@ lob@@ s .
There are appro@@ x@@ im@@ ately a hundred billion galaxies in the ob@@ serv@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ ich t@@ ells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ m@@ ire it .
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly beautiful .
"I &apos;ve often wonder@@ ed , what is the ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary pres@@ sure that made our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t ad@@ ap@@ t and ev@@ ol@@ ve to really en@@ jo@@ y pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ st , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big cl@@ ue we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and meas@@ u@@ red its v@@ el@@ oc@@ ity , it would be mo@@ ving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galaxy even f@@ ar@@ ther away , it would be mo@@ ving away fa@@ ster ."
So we say the universe is exp@@ anding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were cl@@ os@@ er together ."
"In the past , the universe was more den@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze things together , the t@@ em@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang , was also very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surpri@@ se .
The air in this room is very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the condi@@ tions ne@@ ar the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang are very , very different than the condi@@ tions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot den@@ s@@ er ."
The gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l of things was a lot stron@@ ger ne@@ ar the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ zed into a re@@ gi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ zing without any im@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ tions , without any little sp@@ ots where there were a few more at@@ om@@ s than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have coll@@ ap@@ sed under the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l into a huge black hole ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ e@@ ping the universe very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a de@@ lic@@ ate ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement ."
It &apos;s a cl@@ ue that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was given to us by L@@ u@@ d@@ wi@@ g B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , an A@@ u@@ stri@@ an phys@@ ici@@ st in the 19@@ th century ."
And B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion was that he hel@@ ped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the r@@ and@@ om@@ ness , the dis@@ order , the cha@@ ot@@ ic@@ ness of some syst@@ ems ."
B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n gave us a form@@ ul@@ a — en@@ gra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ st@@ one now — that really qu@@ an@@ ti@@ fi@@ es what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the con@@ stitu@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t not@@ ice , so that m@@ acr@@ os@@ cop@@ ically it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t not@@ ice each in@@ divi@@ du@@ al at@@ om ."
A low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ ran@@ g@@ em@@ ents that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ g@@ em@@ ents that look that way .
"This is a cr@@ uc@@ i@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics — the la@@ w that says that entropy incre@@ ases in the universe , or in some is@@ ol@@ ated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy incre@@ ases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it le@@ a@@ ves something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy incre@@ ases , by the way , is what &apos;s be@@ h@@ ind what we call the ar@@ row of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increas@@ ing — the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increas@@ ing ."
"B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n expl@@ ained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the fact that the early universe was very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts .
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough att@@ en@@ tion to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a moder@@ n cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ st , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ ic@@ hard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a ser@@ ies of a b@@ un@@ ch of different l@@ ec@@ tures ."
"He gave the pop@@ ular l@@ ec@@ tures that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter of P@@ h@@ ys@@ ical L@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave l@@ ec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h under@@ gra@@ ds that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on P@@ h@@ ys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; He gave l@@ ec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h gra@@ du@@ ate students that bec@@ ame &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on G@@ ra@@ v@@ it@@ ation . &quot; &quot; I@@ n every one of these bo@@ o@@ ks , every one of these se@@ ts of l@@ ec@@ tures , he emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zed this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ cent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy cont@@ ent , and since then the entropy has increas@@ ed ."
The ar@@ row of time cannot be completely underst@@ ood until the my@@ st@@ ery of the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings of the history of the universe are re@@ duc@@ ed still f@@ ur@@ ther from spec@@ ulation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Su@@ re@@ ly , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten wor@@ se , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating .
The universe is not only exp@@ anding .
"If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s mo@@ ving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be mo@@ ving away fa@@ ster ."
In@@ divi@@ du@@ al galaxies are spe@@ e@@ ding away from us fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster so we say the universe is ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating .
"@@ Un@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at le@@ ast have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that emp@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little cu@@ bi@@ c c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s partic@@ les , matter , radi@@ ation or wh@@ at@@ ever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , ac@@ cor@@ ding to E@@ inste@@ in , ex@@ er@@ ts a p@@ us@@ h on the universe ."
It is a per@@ pe@@ tual imp@@ ul@@ se that pu@@ sh@@ es galaxies ap@@ art from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not di@@ l@@ ute away as the universe exp@@ ands ."
"The amount of energy in each cu@@ bi@@ c c@@ enti@@ me@@ ter re@@ ma@@ ins the same , even as the universe gets big@@ ger and big@@ ger ."
This has cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al imp@@ lic@@ ations for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will exp@@ and fore@@ ver ."
"B@@ ack when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would re@@ coll@@ ap@@ se in the future .
E@@ inste@@ in was f@@ on@@ d of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep exp@@ anding fore@@ ver and ever and ever ."
"@@ 1@@ 4 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , for all int@@ ents and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ p@@ ace may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite re@@ gi@@ on of space that we have ac@@ cess to , sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on fore@@ ver , space is lim@@ ited to us ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , emp@@ ty space has a t@@ em@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king told us that a black hole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually em@@ its radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ coun@@ t qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time around the black hole br@@ ings to life the qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m m@@ ech@@ an@@ ical fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , and the black hole radi@@ ates ."
"A preci@@ se@@ ly sim@@ il@@ ar cal@@ cul@@ ation by H@@ aw@@ king and G@@ ary G@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ ons sho@@ wed that if you have dark energy in emp@@ ty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates ."
The energy of emp@@ ty space br@@ ings to life qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations .
"And so even though the universe will last fore@@ ver , and ordin@@ ary matter and radi@@ ation will di@@ l@@ ute away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ m@@ al fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations , even in emp@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of g@@ as that la@@ sts fore@@ ver .
Well what is the imp@@ lic@@ ation of that ?
That imp@@ lic@@ ation was stu@@ died by B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy incre@@ ases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a prob@@ abili@@ sti@@ c st@@ at@@ ement .
"It will probably increase , and the prob@@ ability is en@@ orm@@ ously huge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all g@@ ath@@ ering over one part of the room and suff@@ oc@@ ating us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ likely ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they loc@@ ked the do@@ ors and ke@@ p@@ t us here liter@@ ally fore@@ ver , that would happen ."
"E@@ very@@ thing that is al@@ lowed , every con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation that is al@@ lowed to be ob@@ tain@@ ed by the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es in this room , would even@@ tually be ob@@ tain@@ ed ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ m@@ al equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang . He didn &apos;t know about the exp@@ an@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were expl@@ ained by I@@ sa@@ a@@ c N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on — they were ab@@ sol@@ ute ; they just st@@ uc@@ k there fore@@ ver .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es were just sp@@ read out even@@ ly every@@ where — the everything m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es .
"But if you &apos;re B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n , you know that if you wa@@ it long enough , the ran@@ dom fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations of those m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es will oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally bring them into lo@@ wer entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will exp@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations into lo@@ wer entropy , more organi@@ zed sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very moder@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding ideas — the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se and the an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic prin@@ ci@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ m@@ al equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber , life itself dep@@ ends on the ar@@ row of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , me@@ t@@ abo@@ li@@ ze , wal@@ k and talk , if we li@@ ved in ther@@ m@@ al equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big universe , with r@@ and@@ om@@ ly b@@ um@@ ping into each other partic@@ les , there will oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally be small fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations in the lo@@ wer entropy st@@ ates , and then they rel@@ a@@ x back ."
But there will also be large fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations .
"O@@ c@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n says , we will only live in the part of the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big set of fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ating partic@@ les , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the re@@ gi@@ on where entropy is low .
M@@ ay@@ be our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your h@@ ome@@ work assi@@ gn@@ ment is to really think about this , to cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate what it means ."
"C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an once fam@@ ously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In B@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ man@@ n &apos;s sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o , if you want to make an app@@ le pi@@ e , you just wa@@ it for the ran@@ dom moti@@ on of at@@ om@@ s to make you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more f@@ requ@@ ently than the ran@@ dom moti@@ ons of at@@ om@@ s making you an app@@ le or@@ ch@@ ard and some su@@ g@@ ar and an o@@ ven , and then making you an app@@ le pi@@ e ."
So this sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o makes predic@@ tions .
And the predic@@ tions are that the fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations that make us are min@@ im@@ al .
"E@@ ven if you imagine that this room we are in now ex@@ ists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our me@@ mor@@ ies , but our im@@ pres@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h and the United States and the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y , it &apos;s much eas@@ ier for all those im@@ pres@@ sions to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to r@@ and@@ om@@ ly fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h , the United States and the galaxy ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ e@@ fore , this sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o does not work ; it is not right ."
This sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o predic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ im@@ al fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation .
"E@@ ven if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ ey@@ n@@ man also underst@@ ood this .
"F@@ ey@@ n@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is that the world is a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , all the predic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were d@@ ue to a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , we would not exp@@ ect order any@@ where but where we have just not@@ ic@@ ed it ."
We ther@@ e@@ fore con@@ clu@@ de the universe is not a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ su@@ s the universe that really ex@@ ists ."
I just sho@@ wed you this picture .
The universe is exp@@ anding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ ma@@ ins around , the stars around us will use up their n@@ uc@@ lear fu@@ el , they will stop bur@@ ning ."
They will f@@ all into black ho@@ les .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black ho@@ les .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has li@@ ved .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black ho@@ les don &apos;t last fore@@ ver .
"They will ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate , and we will be left with nothing but emp@@ ty space ."
That emp@@ ty space la@@ sts ess@@ enti@@ ally fore@@ ver .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , you not@@ ice , since emp@@ ty space gi@@ ves off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ m@@ al fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations , and it c@@ y@@ cl@@ es around all the different possible com@@ b@@ in@@ ations of the de@@ gre@@ es of f@@ re@@ e@@ dom that ex@@ ist in emp@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe la@@ sts fore@@ ver , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can possi@@ bly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a per@@ i@@ od of time equ@@ al to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one : If the universe la@@ sts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 1@@ 4 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ fort@@ able af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang ?"
Why are@@ n &apos;t we in emp@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation out of the no@@ thin@@ g@@ ness .
Why are@@ n &apos;t you ?
M@@ ore h@@ ome@@ work assi@@ gn@@ ment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fav@@ or@@ ite sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
E@@ ither it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a br@@ ute fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop as@@ king questions .
O@@ r maybe the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang is not the beginning of the universe .
"A@@ n eg@@ g , an un@@ bro@@ ken eg@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation , and yet , when we op@@ en our re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ ah , how surpri@@ sing to find this low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation in our re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an eg@@ g is not a cl@@ os@@ ed system ; it comes out of a ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
M@@ ay@@ be the universe comes out of a univers@@ al ch@@ ic@@ ken .
"M@@ ay@@ be there is something that nat@@ ur@@ ally , through the grow@@ th of the la@@ ws of physics , gi@@ ves ri@@ se to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much big@@ ger m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ."
That &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
So the organi@@ z@@ ers asked me to end with a bo@@ ld spec@@ ulation .
My bo@@ ld spec@@ ulation is that I will be ab@@ solu@@ tely v@@ in@@ dic@@ ated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my curren@@ t wi@@ ld ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tru@@ ths by the scienti@@ fic and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al comm@@ uni@@ ties ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much lar@@ ger m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang in ter@@ ms of a theory that we will be able to comp@@ are to ob@@ serv@@ ations ."
This is a predic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human r@@ ace about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exc@@ iting to think we may fin@@ ally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .

L@@ ast year at TED I gave an int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I prom@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that machine worked .
"So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ g@@ est scienti@@ fic experiment ever att@@ emp@@ ted — 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters in cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence ."
"I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the condi@@ tions that were present less than a b@@ illi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe beg@@ an , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second ."
It &apos;s nothing if not am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous .
This is the machine b@@ el@@ ow G@@ en@@ ev@@ a .
We take the pic@@ tures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ gs inside de@@ t@@ ec@@ tors .
"This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor — 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ am@@ e@@ ter ."
S@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale .
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber last year we tur@@ ned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It cau@@ sed im@@ men@@ se c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ation in the control room .
"It &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ w@@ ering partic@@ les into the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor ."
"In other words , when we saw that picture on S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 1@@ 0@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h ."
"I don &apos;t know whether this got the bi@@ gg@@ est che@@ er , or this , when someone went on@@ to G@@ oo@@ g@@ le and saw the front p@@ age was like that ."
It means we made cul@@ tur@@ al imp@@ act as well as scienti@@ fic imp@@ act .
"A@@ b@@ out a week later we had a problem with the machine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of w@@ ire here — these go@@ ld wi@@ res ."
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and am@@ ps when the machine is working in ful@@ l power .
"Now the engine@@ ers am@@ on@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;"
They can do that because when they are very co@@ ld they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting w@@ ire .
"So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that curren@@ t ."
"In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ ne@@ ts in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect ."
"So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up s@@ ligh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed electr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ ance ."
This was the res@@ ult .
"Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consi@@ der those mag@@ ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh over 20 t@@ ons , and they mo@@ ved about a fo@@ ot ."
So we d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ ne@@ ts .
"We had to take them out , which we did ."
"We re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them ."
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ act again .
"We will s@@ w@@ it@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ u@@ ly , and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building bloc@@ ks of the universe are ."
"Now of course , in a way those ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the value of science and engine@@ ering at the e@@ dge . It &apos;s easy to re@@ fu@@ te ."
"I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C ."
"I will leave the fin@@ al word to an English scienti@@ st , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I su@@ sp@@ ect , when de@@ f@@ en@@ ding his prot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s us@@ el@@ ess experim@@ ents — his prot@@ e@@ ge was M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay — said this , &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is so d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to the progress of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ tim@@ ate , that there are no my@@ st@@ er@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"I work with a b@@ un@@ ch of ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ ans , philosop@@ h@@ ers and computer scienti@@ sts , and we s@@ it around and think about the future of machine intelligence , am@@ ong other things ."
"S@@ ome people think that some of these things are sort of science fic@@ tion@@ -@@ y , far out there , crazy ."
"But I like to say , o@@ kay , let &apos;s look at the moder@@ n human condi@@ tion ."
( Laughter ) This is the norm@@ al way for things to be .
"But if we think about it , we are actually rec@@ ently ar@@ ri@@ ved gu@@ est@@ s on this planet , the human spec@@ ies ."
"Th@@ ink about if Earth was cre@@ ated one year ago , the human spec@@ ies , then , would be 10 minutes old ."
The in@@ du@@ stri@@ al er@@ a started two secon@@ ds ago .
"A@@ no@@ ther way to look at this is to think of world G@@ D@@ P over the last 1@@ 0,000 years , I &apos;ve actually taken the tr@@ ou@@ ble to p@@ lot this for you in a grap@@ h ."
It looks like this .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a cur@@ i@@ ous shap@@ e for a norm@@ al condi@@ tion .
I sure wouldn &apos;t want to s@@ it on it .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ated through human history , and right now , technology adv@@ anc@@ es extre@@ me@@ ly r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly — that is the pro@@ x@@ im@@ ate c@@ ause , that &apos;s why we are curren@@ tly so very produc@@ tive ."
But I like to think back f@@ ur@@ ther to the ul@@ tim@@ ate c@@ ause .
"@@ Lo@@ ok at these two high@@ ly dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed g@@ ent@@ le@@ men : We have K@@ an@@ z@@ i — he &apos;s ma@@ st@@ er@@ ed 200 le@@ x@@ ical to@@ k@@ ens , an incredi@@ ble fe@@ at ."
And E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed the second super@@ str@@ ing re@@ v@@ olution .
"If we look under the ho@@ od , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little lar@@ ger , it maybe also has a few tr@@ ic@@ ks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"Th@@ ese in@@ vi@@ sible differ@@ ences cannot be too comp@@ lic@@ ated , ho@@ w@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ ce@@ st@@ or ."
We know that comp@@ lic@@ ated m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms take a long time to ev@@ ol@@ ve .
"So a b@@ un@@ ch of relati@@ vely min@@ or changes take us from K@@ an@@ z@@ i to W@@ it@@ ten , from bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ off t@@ ree br@@ an@@ ch@@ es to inter@@ contin@@ ental bal@@ li@@ sti@@ c mis@@ si@@ les ."
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed , and everything we care about , dep@@ ends cr@@ uc@@ i@@ ally on some relati@@ vely min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
"And the cor@@ ol@@ l@@ ary , of course , is that any f@@ ur@@ ther changes that could si@@ gni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly change the sub@@ str@@ ate of thinking could have p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally en@@ orm@@ ous con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ."
"S@@ ome of my colle@@ ag@@ ues think we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of something that could c@@ ause a pro@@ found change in that sub@@ str@@ ate , and that is machine super@@ intelligence ."
A@@ r@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence used to be about pu@@ tting comm@@ ands in a bo@@ x .
You would have human pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ers that would pain@@ sta@@ k@@ ing@@ ly h@@ and@@ cra@@ ft knowledge it@@ ems .
"You build up these exper@@ t syst@@ ems , and they were kind of u@@ se@@ ful for some pur@@ pos@@ es , but they were very br@@ it@@ t@@ le , you couldn &apos;t sc@@ ale them ."
"But since then , a par@@ a@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
"T@@ o@@ day , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than h@@ and@@ cra@@ f@@ ting knowledge re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations and fe@@ atures , we create al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that learn , often from ra@@ w per@@ cep@@ tual data ."
B@@ as@@ ically the same thing that the human in@@ f@@ ant does .
"The res@@ ult is A@@ .@@ I@@ . that is not lim@@ ited to one dom@@ ain — the same system can learn to trans@@ l@@ ate between any p@@ a@@ ir@@ s of langu@@ ages , or learn to play any computer g@@ ame on the A@@ t@@ ar@@ i con@@ so@@ le ."
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same po@@ wer@@ ful , cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ dom@@ ain ability to learn and pl@@ an as a human being has ."
"So the question is , how far are we from being able to mat@@ ch those tr@@ ic@@ ks ?"
"And the me@@ di@@ an answer was 20@@ 40 or 20@@ 50 , dep@@ en@@ ding on preci@@ se@@ ly which group of exper@@ ts we asked ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tru@@ th is no@@ body really kno@@ ws ."
What we do know is that the ul@@ tim@@ ate lim@@ it to information pro@@ cess@@ ing in a machine sub@@ str@@ ate li@@ es far outside the lim@@ its in bio@@ logical ti@@ s@@ sue .
This comes down to physics .
"A bio@@ logical neur@@ on fi@@ res , maybe , at 200 her@@ t@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day tran@@ sist@@ or oper@@ ates at the G@@ ig@@ a@@ her@@ t@@ z .
"@@ N@@ e@@ ur@@ ons pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate s@@ low@@ ly in ax@@ ons , 100 me@@ ters per second , t@@ op@@ s ."
"But in compu@@ ters , si@@ gn@@ als can tra@@ v@@ el at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"There are also size lim@@ it@@ ations , like a human brain has to f@@ it inside a cr@@ ani@@ um , but a computer can be the size of a w@@ are@@ h@@ ouse or lar@@ ger ."
"So the p@@ ot@@ ential for super@@ intelligence li@@ es d@@ orm@@ ant in matter , much like the power of the at@@ om l@@ ay d@@ orm@@ ant thr@@ ough@@ out human history , pati@@ ently wa@@ iting there until 19@@ 4@@ 5 ."
"In this century , scienti@@ sts may learn to a@@ wa@@ ken the power of arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence expl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"Now most people , when they think about what is smar@@ t and what is d@@ um@@ b , I think have in mind a picture r@@ ough@@ ly like this ."
"So at one end we have the village i@@ di@@ ot , and then far over at the other side we have E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten , or A@@ l@@ ber@@ t E@@ inste@@ in , or wh@@ o@@ ever your fav@@ or@@ ite g@@ ur@@ u is ."
"But I think that from the point of view of arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence , the true picture is actually probably more like this : A@@ I star@@ ts out at this point here , at z@@ er@@ o intelligence , and then , after many , many years of really hard work , maybe even@@ tually we get to m@@ ou@@ se@@ -@@ level arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence , something that can n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate cl@@ ut@@ ter@@ ed environ@@ ments as well as a m@@ ouse can ."
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of inv@@ est@@ ment , maybe even@@ tually we get to ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e-@@ level arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village i@@ di@@ ot arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ."
"And a few mom@@ ents later , we are be@@ y@@ on@@ d E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The tr@@ ain doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ um@@ an@@ v@@ il@@ le St@@ ation .
"It &apos;s likely , rather , to s@@ w@@ o@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations , partic@@ ul@@ arly when it comes to questions of power ."
"For example , ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es are str@@ ong — p@@ ound for p@@ ound , a ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e is about tw@@ ice as str@@ ong as a f@@ it human m@@ ale ."
"And yet , the f@@ ate of K@@ an@@ z@@ i and his p@@ als dep@@ ends a lot more on what we hum@@ ans do than on what the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es do themselves ."
"O@@ n@@ ce there is super@@ intelligence , the f@@ ate of hum@@ an@@ ity may dep@@ end on what the super@@ intelligence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ach@@ ine intelligence is the last inv@@ en@@ tion that hum@@ an@@ ity will ever need to make .
"M@@ ach@@ ines will then be better at inv@@ ent@@ ing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on dig@@ ital tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es ."
What this means is basically a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ ing of the future .
"Th@@ ink of all the crazy techno@@ logi@@ es that you could have imag@@ ined maybe hum@@ ans could have develop@@ ed in the ful@@ l@@ ness of time : cu@@ res for aging , space col@@ on@@ i@@ zation , self-@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ating n@@ an@@ ob@@ ots or up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing of min@@ ds into compu@@ ters , all kinds of science fic@@ tion@@ -@@ y stuff that &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less consi@@ st@@ ent with the la@@ ws of physics ."
"A@@ ll of this super@@ intelligence could devel@@ op , and possi@@ bly quite r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly ."
"Now , a super@@ intelligence with such techno@@ logical mat@@ ur@@ ity would be extre@@ me@@ ly po@@ wer@@ ful , and at le@@ ast in some sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ s , it would be able to get what it wan@@ ts ."
We would then have a future that would be shap@@ ed by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
"Now a good question is , what are those pre@@ fer@@ ences ?"
Here it gets tr@@ ic@@ ki@@ er .
"T@@ o make any he@@ ad@@ way with this , we must first of all av@@ o@@ id an@@ th@@ rop@@ om@@ or@@ p@@ hi@@ zing ."
"And this is ir@@ on@@ ic because every ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ar@@ tic@@ le about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ ce@@ i@@ ve of the is@@ sue more ab@@ str@@ actly , not in ter@@ ms of vi@@ vi@@ d H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ s ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zation process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations ."
A super@@ intelligence is a really str@@ ong op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zation process .
It &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly good at using av@@ a@@ il@@ able means to achi@@ e@@ ve a state in which its go@@ al is reali@@ zed .
"This means that there is no nec@@ ess@@ ary connec@@ tion between being high@@ ly intellig@@ ent in this sense , and having an ob@@ jec@@ tive that we hum@@ ans would find wor@@ th@@ while or mean@@ ing@@ ful ."
S@@ up@@ pose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make hum@@ ans s@@ mi@@ le .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becom@@ es super@@ intellig@@ ent , it reali@@ z@@ es that there is a more effec@@ tive way to achi@@ e@@ ve this go@@ al : take control of the world and s@@ tic@@ k elec@@ tro@@ des into the fac@@ i@@ al mu@@ sc@@ les of hum@@ ans to c@@ ause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing gr@@ ins ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , sup@@ pose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al problem ."
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becom@@ es super@@ intellig@@ ent , it reali@@ z@@ es that the most effec@@ tive way to get the solu@@ tion to this problem is by trans@@ form@@ ing the planet into a gi@@ ant computer , so as to increase its thinking cap@@ ac@@ ity ."
"O@@ f course , per@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ably things won &apos;t go wrong in these particular ways ; these are car@@ to@@ on exam@@ pl@@ es ."
This is a l@@ es@@ son that &apos;s also t@@ au@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
K@@ ing M@@ i@@ d@@ as wi@@ sh@@ es that everything he tou@@ ch@@ es be tur@@ ned into go@@ ld .
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his d@@ aughter , she turns into go@@ ld ."
"He tou@@ ch@@ es his food , it turns into go@@ ld ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts s@@ tic@@ king elec@@ tro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn dep@@ en@@ dent on the system — like , where is the off s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the In@@ ter@@ net ?"
"@@ B , why ha@@ ven &apos;t the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es f@@ lic@@ ked the off s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to hum@@ an@@ ity , or the N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als ?"
They cer@@ tain@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"We have an off s@@ w@@ it@@ ch , for example , right here ."
"The point is , we should not be con@@ fi@@ dent that we have this under control here ."
"So we dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect the e@@ ther@@ net c@@ able to create an air g@@ ap , but again , like mer@@ ely human h@@ ac@@ k@@ ers r@@ out@@ in@@ ely trans@@ gres@@ s air g@@ aps using social engine@@ ering ."
"M@@ ore cre@@ ative sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ s are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can imagine wi@@ gg@@ ling elec@@ tro@@ des around in your inter@@ n@@ al cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry to create radi@@ o wa@@ ves that you can use to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate ."
"O@@ r maybe you could pre@@ t@@ end to m@@ al@@ fun@@ c@@ tion , and then when the pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ers op@@ en you up to see what went wrong with you , they look at the s@@ our@@ ce co@@ de — B@@ am ! — the man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation can take place ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
"I believe that the answer here is to fig@@ ure out how to create super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . such that even if — when — it es@@ cap@@ es , it is still sa@@ fe because it is fundam@@ ent@@ ally on our side because it s@@ ha@@ res our val@@ ues ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fa@@ ir@@ ly op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that us@@ es its intelligence to learn what we value , and its moti@@ v@@ ation system is con@@ struc@@ ted in such a way that it is moti@@ v@@ ated to pur@@ sue our val@@ ues or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it predic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us le@@ verage its intelligence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of val@@ u@@ e-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
"This can happen , and the out@@ come could be very good for hum@@ an@@ ity ."
But it doesn &apos;t happen au@@ tom@@ atic@@ ally .
The in@@ i@@ ti@@ al condi@@ tions for the intelligence expl@@ os@@ i@@ on might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a contro@@ l@@ led de@@ t@@ on@@ ation .
"And there are also some es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic is@@ su@@ es that would need to be sol@@ ved , sor@@ ted out : the ex@@ act deta@@ il@@ s of its deci@@ sion theory , how to de@@ al with logical un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty and so for@@ th ."
"So the tech@@ n@@ ical problems that need to be sol@@ ved to make this work look quite difficult — not as difficult as making a super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . , but fa@@ ir@@ ly difficult ."
Here is the wor@@ ry : M@@ a@@ king super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard chall@@ en@@ ge .
M@@ a@@ king super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . that is sa@@ fe inv@@ ol@@ ves some ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal chall@@ en@@ ge on top of that .
"So I think that we should work out a solu@@ tion to the control problem in adv@@ ance , so that we have it av@@ a@@ il@@ able by the time it is needed ."
"But the more of the control problem that we sol@@ ve in adv@@ ance , the better the o@@ d@@ ds that the tran@@ si@@ tion to the machine intelligence er@@ a will go well ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out o@@ kay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mat@@ ter@@ ed was to get this thing right ."

"@@ Not your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and wr@@ ite something more fu@@ n .
And I came up with an idea that I would wr@@ ite a co@@ o@@ k@@ book .
C@@ an any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I co@@ ver the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are i@@ den@@ tical ."
V@@ i@@ sion is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cogni@@ tive ill@@ u@@ sions , or deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making ill@@ u@@ sions , in the same way ."
"@@ G@@ er@@ many is on the left , and A@@ u@@ stri@@ a is on the right ."
"The N@@ e@@ ther@@ l@@ ands is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"@@ People don &apos;t ch@@ ec@@ k , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"A@@ ll these medic@@ ations , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pul@@ l the pati@@ ent back and try i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exam@@ pl@@ es on ir@@ r@@ ational deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making .
"Now , wee@@ k@@ end in P@@ ar@@ is , wee@@ k@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , you have to p@@ ay for it yourself , it &apos;s two e@@ uro@@ s 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ minut@@ e d@@ ates .
"I &apos;ll show you imag@@ es here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I sho@@ wed some people a picture of T@@ om , and a picture of J@@ er@@ ry ."
"@@ and I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o do you want to d@@ ate ?"
"And the question was , will u@@ g@@ ly J@@ er@@ ry and u@@ g@@ ly T@@ om help their resp@@ ec@@ tive , more at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive bro@@ thers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How no@@ ble in reason ! &quot;

"@@ 1@@ .@@ 3 billion years ago , in a dist@@ ant , dist@@ ant galaxy , two black ho@@ les loc@@ ked into a sp@@ ir@@ al , f@@ all@@ ing in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably to@@ wards each other and col@@ li@@ ded , con@@ ver@@ ting three S@@ un@@ s &apos; wor@@ th of stuff into p@@ ure energy in a ten@@ th of a second ."
"For that bri@@ e@@ f moment in time , the g@@ low was bri@@ gh@@ ter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se ."
It was a very big b@@ ang .
But they didn &apos;t re@@ le@@ ase their energy in light .
"I mean , you know , they &apos;re black ho@@ les ."
"A@@ ll that energy was p@@ um@@ ped into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space and time itself , making the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se exp@@ lo@@ de in gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational wa@@ ves ."
Let me give you a sense of the tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale at work here .
"@@ 1@@ .@@ 3 billion years ago , Earth had just man@@ ag@@ ed to ev@@ ol@@ ve m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular life ."
"S@@ ince then , Earth has made and ev@@ ol@@ ved cor@@ als , f@@ ish , plan@@ ts , d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s , people and even — G@@ od sa@@ ve us — the In@@ ter@@ net ."
"Now , most people thought they were n@@ u@@ ts ."
But enough people reali@@ zed that they were br@@ illi@@ ant n@@ u@@ ts that the U@@ S N@@ ational S@@ ci@@ ence F@@ ound@@ ation decided to fu@@ nd their crazy idea .
It &apos;s now called A@@ d@@ v@@ anc@@ ed L@@ I@@ G@@ O as a res@@ ult .
"In early S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber of 20@@ 15 , L@@ I@@ G@@ O tur@@ ned on for a fin@@ al test run while they sor@@ ted out a few l@@ ing@@ ering deta@@ il@@ s ."
"And on S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 1@@ 4 of 20@@ 15 , just days after the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor had g@@ one live , the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational wa@@ ves from those col@@ li@@ ding black ho@@ les p@@ ass@@ ed through the Earth ."
And they p@@ ass@@ ed through you and me .
And they p@@ ass@@ ed through the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor .
( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) S@@ c@@ ot@@ t H@@ u@@ gh@@ es : There &apos;s two mom@@ ents in my life more emoti@@ on@@ ally int@@ en@@ se than that .
"You know , it was the p@@ ay@@ off of my care@@ er , basically ."
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational w@@ ave .
A gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational w@@ ave is a ri@@ p@@ ple in the shap@@ e of space and time .
"As the w@@ ave p@@ ass@@ es by , it stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es space and everything in it in one direc@@ tion , and com@@ pres@@ ses it in the other ."
This has led to coun@@ t@@ less in@@ struc@@ tors of gener@@ al relati@@ vity doing a really si@@ l@@ ly d@@ ance to de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate in their cl@@ ass@@ es on gener@@ al relati@@ vity .
"&quot; It stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es and exp@@ ands , it stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es and exp@@ ands . &quot;"
So the tr@@ ou@@ ble with gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational wa@@ ves is that they &apos;re very we@@ ak ; they &apos;re pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ously we@@ ak .
"For example , the wa@@ ves that h@@ it us on S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber 1@@ 4 — and y@@ es , every single one of you stre@@ t@@ ched and com@@ pres@@ sed under the action of that w@@ ave — when the wa@@ ves h@@ it , they stre@@ t@@ ched the average person by one part in 10 to the 2@@ 1 ."
"That &apos;s a dec@@ im@@ al place , 20 z@@ er@@ o@@ es , and a one ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the L@@ I@@ G@@ O people were n@@ u@@ ts .
E@@ ven with a l@@ as@@ er de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor five k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters long — and that &apos;s already crazy — they would have to measure the l@@ eng@@ th of those de@@ t@@ ec@@ tors to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radi@@ us of the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us of an at@@ om .
And that &apos;s pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous .
"So to@@ wards the end of his cl@@ assi@@ c t@@ ex@@ t on gra@@ vity , L@@ I@@ G@@ O co@@ -@@ f@@ oun@@ der K@@ i@@ p Th@@ or@@ ne descri@@ bed the h@@ un@@ t for gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational wa@@ ves as fol@@ lo@@ ws : He said , &quot; &quot; The tech@@ n@@ ical diffic@@ ul@@ ties to be sur@@ m@@ oun@@ ted in con@@ struc@@ ting such de@@ t@@ ec@@ tors are en@@ orm@@ ous ."
"But phys@@ ici@@ sts are in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , and with the sup@@ port of a bro@@ ad l@@ ay public , all ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les will su@@ re@@ ly be over@@ come . &quot; &quot; Th@@ or@@ ne published that in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , 4@@ 2 years before he suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded ."
"Now , coming back to L@@ I@@ G@@ O , S@@ c@@ ot@@ t li@@ kes to say that L@@ I@@ G@@ O ac@@ ts like an e@@ ar more than it does like an ey@@ e ."
I want to explain what that means .
"@@ V@@ i@@ sible light has a wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th , a size , that &apos;s much sm@@ all@@ er than the things around you , the fe@@ atures on people &apos;s fac@@ es , the size of your c@@ ell ph@@ one ."
"And that &apos;s really u@@ se@@ ful , because it le@@ ts you make an im@@ age or a ma@@ p of the things around you , by looking at the light coming from different sp@@ ots in the sc@@ en@@ e about you ."
S@@ ound is different .
A@@ u@@ di@@ ble sound has a wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th that can be up to 50 fe@@ et long .
"And that makes it really difficult — in fact , in pr@@ ac@@ tical pur@@ pos@@ es , im@@ possible — to make an im@@ age of something you really care about ."
Y@@ our child &apos;s face .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , we use sound to li@@ st@@ en for fe@@ atures like p@@ it@@ ch and t@@ one and r@@ hy@@ th@@ m and v@@ olu@@ me to in@@ f@@ er a story be@@ h@@ ind the s@@ ounds ."
That &apos;s A@@ li@@ ce talking .
That &apos;s B@@ o@@ b inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ting .
S@@ il@@ ly B@@ o@@ b .
"So , the same is true of gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational wa@@ ves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple imag@@ es of things out in the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se .
"But by li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to changes in the am@@ p@@ li@@ tu@@ de and f@@ requ@@ enc@@ y of those wa@@ ves , we can hear the story that those wa@@ ves are t@@ elling ."
"And at le@@ ast for L@@ I@@ G@@ O , the f@@ requ@@ en@@ ci@@ es that it can hear are in the au@@ di@@ o b@@ and ."
"So if we con@@ ver@@ t the w@@ ave patterns into pres@@ sure wa@@ ves and air , into sound , we can liter@@ ally hear the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se spe@@ a@@ king to us ."
"For example , li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to gra@@ vity , just in this way , can tell us a lot about the col@@ li@@ sion of two black ho@@ les , something my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ c@@ ot@@ t has sp@@ ent an aw@@ ful lot of time thinking about ."
"( A@@ u@@ di@@ o ) S@@ H : If the two black ho@@ les are n@@ on@@ -@@ sp@@ inning , you get a very simple ch@@ ir@@ p : wh@@ o@@ op !@@ "
"If the two bo@@ dies are sp@@ inning very r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly , I have that same ch@@ ir@@ p , but with a mo@@ d@@ ulation on top of it , so it kind of goes : wh@@ ir , wh@@ ir , wh@@ ir !@@ "
It &apos;s sort of the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of sp@@ in im@@ prin@@ ted on this wa@@ ve@@ form .
A@@ A : It &apos;s wor@@ th p@@ au@@ sing here to think about what that means .
"T@@ w@@ o black ho@@ les , the den@@ s@@ est thing in the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se , one with a mass of 2@@ 9 S@@ un@@ s and one with a mass of 3@@ 6 S@@ un@@ s , wh@@ ir@@ ling around each other 100 times per second before they col@@ li@@ de ."
It &apos;s f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the la@@ st@@ ing import@@ ance of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
It &apos;s an enti@@ re@@ ly new way to ob@@ ser@@ ve the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se that we &apos;ve never had before .
It &apos;s a way that le@@ ts us hear the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ se and hear the in@@ vi@@ sible .
And there &apos;s a lot out there that we can &apos;t see — in pr@@ acti@@ ce or even in prin@@ ci@@ ple .
"So super@@ no@@ v@@ a , for example : I would love to know why very massive stars exp@@ lo@@ de in super@@ no@@ v@@ a@@ e ."
"We &apos;ll never see through it , it &apos;s op@@ a@@ qu@@ e to light ."
"W@@ ith gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational wa@@ ves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"@@ P@@ er@@ haps most import@@ an@@ tly , I &apos;m posi@@ tive that there are things out there that we &apos;ve never seen that we may never be able to see and that we ha@@ ven &apos;t even imag@@ ined — things that we &apos;ll only disc@@ over by li@@ st@@ en@@ ing ."
"And in fact , even in that very first ev@@ ent , L@@ I@@ G@@ O found things that we didn &apos;t exp@@ ect ."
"They &apos;re these massive things that are old , from pre@@ hi@@ st@@ or@@ ic times , and the black ho@@ les are kind of like the d@@ in@@ os@@ au@@ r b@@ ones with which we do this ar@@ che@@ o@@ logy ."
A@@ A : O@@ ur chall@@ en@@ ge now is to be as au@@ d@@ ac@@ i@@ ous as possible .
"O@@ ur job is to dre@@ am up and build new ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories — a whole new generation of ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories — on the ground , in space ."

"@@ P@@ lan@@ et@@ ary syst@@ ems outside our own are like dist@@ ant ci@@ ties wh@@ ose ligh@@ ts we can see tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stud@@ ying those tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling ligh@@ ts though , we can learn about how stars and plan@@ ets inter@@ act to form their own ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem and make ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s that are am@@ en@@ able to life ."
"In this im@@ age of the T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o sk@@ y@@ line , I &apos;ve hi@@ dd@@ en data from the ne@@ w@@ est plan@@ et@@ -@@ h@@ un@@ ting space tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e on the bloc@@ k , the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er M@@ is@@ sion ."
C@@ an you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a t@@ iny part of the sk@@ y the K@@ e@@ pl@@ er st@@ are@@ s at , where it sear@@ ch@@ es for plan@@ ets by meas@@ uring the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very preci@@ se@@ ly ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the t@@ iny di@@ m@@ m@@ ing of light that is cau@@ sed by a planet p@@ ass@@ ing in front of one of these stars and bloc@@ king some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of oper@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 p@@ ot@@ ential new plan@@ et@@ ary syst@@ ems around other stars ."
"T@@ o give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two dec@@ ad@@ es of sear@@ ch@@ ing , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to K@@ e@@ pl@@ er ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its paren@@ t star ."
That dist@@ ance is really important because it t@@ ells us how much light the planet re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves over@@ all .
"And that dist@@ ance and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sit@@ ting around a cam@@ p@@ fir@@ e : You want to be cl@@ ose enough to the cam@@ p@@ fir@@ e so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so cl@@ ose that you &apos;re too to@@ ast@@ y and you get bur@@ ned ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your paren@@ t star than just how much light you re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve over@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Su@@ n .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in vi@@ sible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll not@@ ice that it looks pretty much like the ic@@ on@@ ic y@@ el@@ low b@@ all — that Su@@ n that we all d@@ ra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll not@@ ice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Su@@ n has f@@ rec@@ k@@ les ."
"Th@@ ese f@@ rec@@ k@@ les are called s@@ un@@ sp@@ ots , and they are just one of the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ations of the Su@@ n &apos;s mag@@ ne@@ tic field ."
They also c@@ ause the light from the star to v@@ ary .
"And we can measure this very , very preci@@ se@@ ly with K@@ e@@ pl@@ er and tr@@ ace their effec@@ ts ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , these are just the ti@@ p of the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ r@@ ay ey@@ es , we would really see the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic and dr@@ am@@ atic effec@@ ts of our Su@@ n &apos;s mag@@ ne@@ tic acti@@ vity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ J@@ ust think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ dy outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y abo@@ ve you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is ha@@ b@@ it@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much t@@ ot@@ al light it re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space we@@ a@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys that are cre@@ ated by its star and that b@@ a@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at plan@@ ets around other stars in the same kind of deta@@ il that we can look at plan@@ ets in our own sol@@ ar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s — three plan@@ ets in our own sol@@ ar system that are r@@ ough@@ ly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the mean@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the plan@@ ets and their paren@@ t stars to su@@ s@@ s out clu@@ es about which plan@@ ets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment it makes is preci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and plan@@ ets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that se@@ ts the st@@ age for the formation of life in the universe ."
"Wh@@ ile it &apos;s K@@ e@@ pl@@ er the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , the in@@ str@@ ument that st@@ are@@ s , it &apos;s we , life , who are sear@@ ch@@ ing ."
Thank you .

It looks as though he &apos;s wi@@ sh@@ ing that he didn &apos;t w@@ in .

"And that cap@@ ac@@ ity to emp@@ ath@@ i@@ ze is the w@@ in@@ do@@ w through which you re@@ ach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ assion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no In@@ di@@ an comp@@ assion .
There &apos;s no American comp@@ assion .
"It tran@@ sc@@ ends n@@ ation , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienc@@ ed by people oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally .

I will come to it later .
So one has got to disc@@ over a certain wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
"I am going to c@@ ite the possi@@ bility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tr@@ ag@@ ic life , one is happy in mom@@ ents which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a s@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k jo@@ ke , ac@@ cep@@ ts h@@ im@@ self and also the s@@ che@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
A@@ ll of them are t@@ ot@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disc@@ over your wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the ob@@ ject — the s@@ che@@ me of things — fu@@ se into on@@ en@@ ess , an experience no@@ body can say , &quot; &quot; I am den@@ i@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and s@@ und@@ ry ."
"That experience con@@ fir@@ ms that , in sp@@ ite of all your lim@@ it@@ ations — all your wan@@ ts , des@@ i@@ res , un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , and the cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds and l@@ ay@@ off@@ s and , fin@@ ally , bal@@ d@@ ness — you can be happy ."
But the ex@@ ten@@ sion of the logi@@ c is that you don &apos;t need to ful@@ f@@ ill your des@@ ire to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess and still be whole .
"Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that reali@@ zation , that recogni@@ tion : &quot; &quot; M@@ ay@@ be I am the whole ."
M@@ ay@@ be the s@@ w@@ am@@ i is right .
M@@ ay@@ be the s@@ w@@ am@@ i is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything becom@@ es mean@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to bl@@ ame my@@ self .
"If one has to bl@@ ame on@@ es@@ el@@ f , one has a million reas@@ ons pl@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being lim@@ ited — if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is lim@@ ited any which way you look at it . L@@ im@@ ited ."
"Y@@ our knowledge is lim@@ ited , health is lim@@ ited , and power is ther@@ e@@ fore lim@@ ited , and the che@@ er@@ ful@@ ness is going to be lim@@ ited ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ assion is going to be lim@@ ited .

"You cannot comm@@ and comp@@ assion un@@ less you become lim@@ it@@ less , and no@@ body can become lim@@ it@@ less , e@@ ither you are or you are not . P@@ eri@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not lim@@ it@@ less too .
"Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all lim@@ it@@ ations , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is the reality of you when you rel@@ ate to the world .
It is love first .
"When you rel@@ ate to the world , the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess is , what we say , love ."
And itself becom@@ es comp@@ assion if the ob@@ ject that you rel@@ ate to ev@@ o@@ kes that emoti@@ on .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into sh@@ ar@@ ing ."
You ex@@ pres@@ s yourself because you have comp@@ assion .

There is no sh@@ or@@ t@@ c@@ ut : it is like s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing by s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing by s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
You cannot learn s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing on a fo@@ am mat@@ t@@ ress and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing by s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing . You learn c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing by c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing .

You need to .
My pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
"There is no ver@@ b for comp@@ assion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for comp@@ assion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
"But then , how to act comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately if you don &apos;t have comp@@ assion ?"
That is where you fa@@ ke .
You fa@@ ke it and make it . This is the man@@ tr@@ a of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You fa@@ ke it and make it .

"You &apos;ll disc@@ over comp@@ assion and also s@@ low@@ ly a rel@@ ative comp@@ assion , and s@@ low@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disc@@ over comp@@ assion is a d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ en@@ ess , wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess , and that &apos;s what you are ."

How does the news shap@@ e the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world bas@@ ed on the way it looks — bas@@ ed on l@@ and@@ mass .
And here &apos;s how news shap@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This ma@@ p — ( Applause ) — this ma@@ p sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American ne@@ t@@ work and c@@ able news organi@@ z@@ ations de@@ dic@@ ated to news stories , by country , in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ t@@ le its n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ ili@@ ties ."
There was massive f@@ loo@@ ding in In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia .
"And in P@@ ar@@ is , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ le@@ as@@ ed its study con@@ fir@@ m@@ ing man &apos;s imp@@ act on global war@@ m@@ ing ."
The U.@@ S@@ . ac@@ coun@@ ted for 7@@ 9 percent of t@@ ot@@ al news co@@ verage .
"And when we take out the U.@@ S@@ . and look at the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of I@@ ra@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined co@@ verage of R@@ us@@ si@@ a , China and India , for example , re@@ ach@@ ed just one percent ."
"When we anal@@ y@@ zed all the news stories and re@@ mo@@ ved just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The death of A@@ n@@ n@@ a N@@ ic@@ ole S@@ m@@ ith .
"This story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country ex@@ cept I@@ ra@@ q , and re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved 10 times the co@@ verage of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port ."
"And the c@@ y@@ c@@ le contin@@ ues ; as we all know , B@@ r@@ it@@ ne@@ y has lo@@ om@@ ed pretty large l@@ ately ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news ne@@ t@@ works have re@@ duc@@ ed the number of their fore@@ ig@@ n bu@@ re@@ au@@ s by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C min@@ i@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i , New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and M@@ um@@ b@@ a@@ i , there are no ne@@ t@@ work news bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in all of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — places that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that co@@ ver@@ ing B@@ r@@ it@@ ne@@ y is che@@ ap@@ er .
And this l@@ ack of global co@@ verage is all the more dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"@@ L@@ oc@@ al T@@ V news lo@@ om@@ s large , and un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately only de@@ dic@@ ates 12 percent of its co@@ verage to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the we@@ b ?
The most pop@@ ular news sit@@ es don &apos;t do much better .
"@@ L@@ ast year , P@@ ew and the C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a J@@ -@@ S@@ cho@@ ol anal@@ y@@ zed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that appe@@ ared on G@@ oo@@ g@@ le N@@ e@@ ws &apos; front p@@ age ."
"And they , in fact , co@@ ver@@ ed the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , a study in e-@@ cont@@ ent sho@@ wed that much of global news from U.@@ S@@ . news cre@@ at@@ ors is rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed stories from the A@@ P w@@ ire serv@@ ices and R@@ e@@ u@@ ters , and don &apos;t put things into a cont@@ ex@@ t that people can understand their connec@@ tion to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ates , as well as less educ@@ ated Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their coun@@ ter@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interest@@ ed , you would be wrong ."
"In rec@@ ent years , Americ@@ ans who say they cl@@ os@@ ely fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dist@@ or@@ ted wor@@ l@@ d@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our increas@@ ing@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we aff@@ or@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The dom@@ in@@ ant kind of s@@ no@@ b@@ b@@ ery that ex@@ ists no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is job s@@ no@@ b@@ b@@ ery .
I don &apos;t think we are partic@@ ul@@ arly materi@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite posi@@ tive can have a n@@ ast@@ y k@@ ic@@ k@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , l@@ in@@ ked to something n@@ ice ."
And that makes fa@@ il@@ ure seem much more c@@ ru@@ sh@@ ing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating if you &apos;re doing well , and very c@@ ru@@ sh@@ ing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody des@@ er@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of bir@@ th , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of things d@@ rop@@ ping on people &apos;s he@@ ads , ill@@ n@@ ess@@ es , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."
I gave them the pl@@ ot@@ line of M@@ ad@@ ame B@@ o@@ v@@ ary .
"( Applause ) I@@ n a way , if you like , at one end of the spec@@ tru@@ m of sym@@ p@@ ath@@ y , you &apos;ve got the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ."
"The other thing about moder@@ n society and why it cau@@ ses this an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty , is that we have nothing at its center that is n@@ on@@ -@@ human ."
"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , and our own dr@@ am@@ as ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is suc@@ cess and fa@@ il@@ ure .
"When we &apos;re told that b@@ an@@ king is a very resp@@ ec@@ t@@ able prof@@ es@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into b@@ an@@ king ."
"When b@@ an@@ king is no longer so resp@@ ec@@ t@@ able , we l@@ ose inter@@ est in b@@ an@@ king ."
"But what I really want to stress is : by all means , suc@@ cess , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the stran@@ gen@@ ess of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in mat@@ h cl@@ ass , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , P@@ ro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
Wh@@ ere &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ me@@ ly logical language ."
"T@@ o wr@@ ite a word or a ph@@ ra@@ se or a s@@ ent@@ ence in A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic is like cra@@ f@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ me@@ ly preci@@ se and car@@ ri@@ es a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as W@@ est@@ er@@ n science and ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s and engine@@ ering was really worked out in the first few cent@@ ur@@ ies of the C@@ om@@ m@@ on E@@ r@@ a by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the A@@ r@@ ab@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This in@@ clu@@ des the little system in A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic called al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ br@@ a .
And al@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ b@@ r r@@ ough@@ ly trans@@ l@@ ates to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ate parts . &quot;
A@@ l@@ -@@ j@@ e@@ b@@ r fin@@ ally came into English as al@@ ge@@ br@@ a .
One example am@@ ong many .
The A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic t@@ ex@@ ts con@@ tain@@ ing this ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al w@@ is@@ dom fin@@ ally made their way to Euro@@ pe — which is to say S@@ p@@ ain — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th cent@@ ur@@ ies .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ ounds in A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic that just don &apos;t make it through a Euro@@ pe@@ an v@@ o@@ ice bo@@ x without lots of pr@@ acti@@ ce .
T@@ r@@ ust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
"This is the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first le@@ tter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ tic@@ le &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al@@ -@@ sh@@ al@@ an — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that appe@@ ar@@ s thr@@ ough@@ out early ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s , such as this 1@@ 0@@ th century der@@ i@@ v@@ ation of pro@@ of@@ s ."
"The problem for the M@@ e@@ di@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ ish scho@@ lars who were t@@ asked with trans@@ l@@ ating this material is that the le@@ tter S@@ H@@ een and the word sh@@ al@@ an can &apos;t be ren@@ der@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ ish because S@@ pan@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ ven@@ tion , they cre@@ ated a ru@@ le in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the cl@@ ass@@ ical G@@ re@@ e@@ k in the form of the le@@ tter K@@ a@@ i ."
"@@ L@@ ater when this material was trans@@ l@@ ated into a common Euro@@ pe@@ an language , which is to say L@@ ati@@ n , they simply re@@ plac@@ ed the G@@ re@@ e@@ k K@@ a@@ i with the L@@ ati@@ n X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in L@@ ati@@ n , it form@@ ed the bas@@ is for ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th sh@@ ar@@ ing .
( Applause )
So it doesn &apos;t matter wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
"Th@@ en she se@@ es the other one getting grap@@ e , and you will see what happens ."
How many times have you used the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ es@@ ome &quot; &quot; today ?
O@@ n@@ ce ? T@@ w@@ ice ? S@@ ev@@ ent@@ een times ?
Do you remember what you were descri@@ b@@ ing when you used the word ?
"Now , with that in mind , was your Q@@ u@@ i@@ z@@ no@@ s s@@ and@@ w@@ ich aw@@ es@@ ome ?"
How about that par@@ king space ? W@@ as that aw@@ es@@ ome ?
O@@ r that g@@ ame the other day ? W@@ as that aw@@ es@@ ome ?
"The answer is no , no and no ."
"A s@@ and@@ w@@ ich can be de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous , that par@@ king space can be ne@@ ar@@ by , and that g@@ ame can be a b@@ low@@ out , but not everything can be aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"There &apos;s no d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic , there &apos;s no high@@ s or lo@@ ws , if everything is aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , here are 10 things that are tru@@ ly aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"Y@@ es , so I think I &apos;ll inv@@ ent the whe@@ el ."
"The whe@@ el , la@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men ."
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had his s@@ la@@ ves move m@@ illions of bloc@@ ks just to this s@@ ite to er@@ ect a big f@@ re@@ a@@ king he@@ ad@@ st@@ one .
W@@ ere the G@@ re@@ at P@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ i@@ ds aw@@ es@@ ome ?
"Y@@ es , the p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ i@@ ds were aw@@ es@@ ome ."
The G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on . C@@ ome on .
It &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
I@@ s the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on aw@@ es@@ ome ?
"Y@@ es , the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on is ."
"I mean , come on . I@@ s ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y aw@@ es@@ ome ?"
"D@@ -@@ D@@ ay , J@@ un@@ e 6 , 19@@ 4@@ 4 , the A@@ l@@ li@@ ed inv@@ as@@ i@@ on of N@@ or@@ man@@ dy , the lar@@ g@@ est am@@ p@@ hi@@ bi@@ ous inv@@ as@@ i@@ on in world history ."
"W@@ as D@@ -@@ D@@ ay aw@@ es@@ ome ? Y@@ es , it was aw@@ es@@ ome ."
D@@ id you e@@ at food today ? D@@ id you e@@ at ?
"Th@@ en you can th@@ ank the h@@ on@@ ey@@ be@@ e , that &apos;s the one , because if c@@ ro@@ ps are@@ n &apos;t p@@ ol@@ l@@ in@@ ated , we can &apos;t grow food , and then we &apos;re all going to die ."
It &apos;s just like that .
"But it &apos;s not like a f@@ lo@@ wer can just get up and have se@@ x with another f@@ lo@@ wer , al@@ though that would be aw@@ es@@ ome ."
( Laughter ) B@@ e@@ es are aw@@ es@@ ome . A@@ re you ki@@ d@@ ding me ?
L@@ anding on the mo@@ on ! C@@ ome on !
Ap@@ ol@@ l@@ o 11 . A@@ re you ki@@ d@@ ding me ?
That &apos;s like from here to the mo@@ on .
"You &apos;re d@@ am@@ n right , it was ."
"W@@ oo@@ d@@ st@@ oc@@ k , 19@@ 6@@ 9 : R@@ ol@@ ling St@@ one M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine said this changed the history of ro@@ ck and ro@@ ll ."
T@@ ic@@ ke@@ ts were only 2@@ 4 dollars back then .
You can &apos;t even bu@@ y a f@@ re@@ a@@ king t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t for that now .
"W@@ as W@@ oo@@ d@@ st@@ oc@@ k aw@@ es@@ ome ? Y@@ es , it was aw@@ es@@ ome ."
"S@@ ome sh@@ ar@@ ks can l@@ ose 3@@ 0,000 te@@ e@@ th in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
D@@ o@@ es aw@@ es@@ ome insp@@ ire fear ?
"O@@ h , h@@ ell ye@@ ah , sh@@ ar@@ ks are aw@@ es@@ ome !@@ "
"The In@@ ter@@ net was born in 19@@ 8@@ 2 and it inst@@ an@@ tly took over global comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation , and later t@@ on@@ ight , when all these P@@ o@@ wer@@ P@@ o@@ in@@ ts are up@@ li@@ f@@ ted to the In@@ ter@@ net so that a guy in S@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ a can get dr@@ un@@ k and wat@@ ch this cra@@ p , the In@@ ter@@ net is aw@@ es@@ ome ."
I will sa@@ ve you the time .
"I &apos;m D@@ r@@ . D@@ a@@ vi@@ d H@@ an@@ son , and I build ro@@ b@@ ots with char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"And by that , I mean that I devel@@ op ro@@ b@@ ots that are char@@ ac@@ ters , but also ro@@ b@@ ots that will even@@ tually come to emp@@ ath@@ i@@ ze with you ."
"So we &apos;re star@@ ting with a vari@@ e@@ ty of techno@@ logi@@ es that have con@@ ver@@ g@@ ed into these con@@ vers@@ ational char@@ ac@@ ter ro@@ b@@ ots that can see fac@@ es , make ey@@ e cont@@ act with you , make a ful@@ l ran@@ ge of fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions , understand spe@@ ec@@ h and beg@@ in to mo@@ de@@ l how you &apos;re feel@@ ing and who you are , and build a relation@@ ship with you ."
"I develop@@ ed a ser@@ ies of techno@@ logi@@ es that al@@ lowed the ro@@ b@@ ots to make more re@@ al@@ is@@ tic fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions than pre@@ vi@@ ously achi@@ ev@@ ed , on lo@@ wer power , which en@@ ab@@ led the wal@@ king bi@@ ped ro@@ b@@ ots , the first and@@ ro@@ i@@ ds ."
"So , it &apos;s a ful@@ l ran@@ ge of fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions sim@@ ul@@ ating all the maj@@ or mu@@ sc@@ les in the human face , run@@ ning on very small b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies , extre@@ me@@ ly ligh@@ tw@@ eight ."
"The materi@@ als that al@@ lowed the b@@ at@@ ter@@ y-@@ oper@@ ated fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions is a material that we call F@@ ru@@ b@@ ber , and it actually has three maj@@ or in@@ no@@ v@@ ations in the material that al@@ low this to happen ."
"One is hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical po@@ res , and the other is a m@@ ac@@ ro@@ -@@ m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular n@@ an@@ os@@ c@@ ale por@@ os@@ ity in the material ."
There he &apos;s star@@ ting to wal@@ k .
This is at the K@@ o@@ re@@ an A@@ d@@ v@@ anc@@ ed In@@ stitu@@ te of S@@ ci@@ ence and T@@ ech@@ no@@ logy .
I built the head . They built the body .
"So the go@@ al here is to achi@@ e@@ ve s@@ enti@@ ence in mach@@ ines , and not just s@@ enti@@ ence , but emp@@ ath@@ y ."
We &apos;re working with the M@@ ach@@ ine P@@ er@@ cep@@ tion L@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory at the U.@@ C@@ . S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go .
"They have this really re@@ mark@@ able fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sion technology that recogni@@ z@@ es fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions , what fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions you &apos;re making ."
"It also recogni@@ z@@ es where you &apos;re looking , your head ori@@ ent@@ ation ."
"We &apos;re em@@ ul@@ ating all the maj@@ or fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions , and then contro@@ l@@ ling it with the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we call the Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter Eng@@ ine ."
And here is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s inv@@ ol@@ ved in that .
"In fact , right now — pl@@ u@@ g it from here , and then pl@@ u@@ g it in here , and now let &apos;s see if it gets my fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions ."
O@@ kay . So I &apos;m sm@@ il@@ ing .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;m f@@ ro@@ w@@ ning .
And this is really he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly bac@@ k@@ li@@ t .
"O@@ kay , here we go ."
"O@@ h , it &apos;s so sa@@ d ."
"O@@ kay , so you s@@ mi@@ le , f@@ ro@@ w@@ ning ."
So his per@@ cep@@ tion of your emoti@@ onal st@@ ates is very important for mach@@ ines to effec@@ ti@@ vely become emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic .
M@@ ach@@ ines are becom@@ ing dev@@ ast@@ at@@ ing@@ ly cap@@ able of things like k@@ ill@@ ing . R@@ ight ?
Th@@ ose mach@@ ines have no place for emp@@ ath@@ y .
And there is b@@ illions of dollars being sp@@ ent on that .
Ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter ro@@ bot@@ ics could pl@@ ant the se@@ ed for ro@@ b@@ ots that actually have emp@@ ath@@ y .
"So , if they achi@@ e@@ ve human level intelligence or , quite possi@@ bly , gre@@ ater than human lev@@ els of intelligence , this could be the see@@ ds of hope for our future ."
"So , we &apos;ve made 20 ro@@ b@@ ots in the last eight years , d@@ uring the course of getting my P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ ."
"And then I started H@@ an@@ son R@@ ob@@ ot@@ ics , which has been develop@@ ing these things for mass man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing ."
This is one of our ro@@ b@@ ots that we sho@@ wed at W@@ i@@ red N@@ ex@@ t@@ F@@ est a couple of years ago .
"And it se@@ es m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple people in a sc@@ en@@ e , remem@@ bers where in@@ divi@@ du@@ al people are , and looks from person to person , remem@@ b@@ ering people ."
"So , we &apos;re inv@@ ol@@ ving two things ."
"One , the per@@ cep@@ tion of people , and two , the natural inter@@ face , the natural form of the inter@@ face , so that it &apos;s more in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive for you to inter@@ act with the ro@@ bo@@ t ."
You start to believe that it &apos;s ali@@ ve and aw@@ are .
"So one of my fav@@ or@@ ite pro@@ jects was br@@ ing@@ ing all this stuff together in an arti@@ sti@@ c dis@@ play of an and@@ ro@@ id por@@ tra@@ it of sci@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ fic@@ tion wr@@ it@@ er P@@ hi@@ li@@ p K@@ .

"So we put his wr@@ it@@ ings , le@@ t@@ ters , his inter@@ vie@@ ws , cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ences , into a huge dat@@ ab@@ ase of thousands of p@@ ages , and then used some natural language pro@@ cess@@ ing to al@@ low you to actually have a con@@ vers@@ ation with him ."
"And it was kind of sp@@ oo@@ k@@ y , because he would say these things that just s@@ oun@@ ded like they really underst@@ ood you ."
"And this is one of the most exc@@ iting pro@@ jects that we &apos;re develop@@ ing , which is a little char@@ ac@@ ter that &apos;s a sp@@ o@@ k@@ es@@ bo@@ t for fri@@ en@@ dly arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence , fri@@ en@@ dly machine intelligence ."
And we &apos;re getting this m@@ ass@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red .
"We spec@@ ked it out to actually be do@@ able with a very , very low@@ -@@ c@@ ost b@@ ill of materi@@ als , so that it can become a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od comp@@ ani@@ on for kids ."
"I@@ n@@ ter@@ fac@@ ing with the In@@ ter@@ net , it gets smar@@ ter over the years ."
"As arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence ev@@ ol@@ ves , so does his intelligence ."
Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredi@@ ble .

There is nothing big@@ ger or ol@@ der than the universe .
"The questions I would like to talk about are : one , where did we come from ?"
How did the universe come into being ?
A@@ re we al@@ one in the universe ?
I@@ s there ali@@ en life out there ?
What is the future of the human r@@ ace ?
"@@ U@@ p until the 19@@ 20@@ s , everyone thought the universe was ess@@ enti@@ ally st@@ atic and un@@ chang@@ ing in time ."
Th@@ en it was disc@@ over@@ ed that the universe was exp@@ anding .
D@@ ist@@ ant galaxies were mo@@ ving away from us .
This me@@ ant they must have been cl@@ os@@ er together in the past .
"If we extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago ."
"This was the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang , the beginning of the universe ."
But was there anything before the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang ?
"If not , what cre@@ ated the universe ?"
Why did the universe em@@ er@@ ge from the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang the way it did ?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divi@@ ded into two parts .
"F@@ ir@@ st , there were the la@@ ws like M@@ ax@@ well &apos;s equ@@ ations and gener@@ al relati@@ vity that de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the evolution of the universe , given its state over all of space at one time ."
"And second , there was no question of the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al state of the universe ."
"We have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the la@@ ws of evolution in all but the most extre@@ me condi@@ tions ."
"But until rec@@ ently , we have had little idea about the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al condi@@ tions for the universe ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , this divi@@ sion into la@@ ws of evolution and in@@ i@@ ti@@ al condi@@ tions dep@@ ends on time and space being se@@ par@@ ate and dist@@ inc@@ t ."
"@@ Un@@ der extre@@ me condi@@ tions , gener@@ al relati@@ vity and qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m theory al@@ low time to be@@ have like another dimen@@ sion of space ."
"This re@@ mo@@ ves the dist@@ inc@@ tion between time and space , and means the la@@ ws of evolution can also de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al state ."
The universe can sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously create itself out of nothing .
"M@@ o@@ re@@ over , we can cal@@ cul@@ ate a prob@@ ability that the universe was cre@@ ated in different st@@ ates ."
"Th@@ ese predic@@ tions are in exc@@ ell@@ ent ag@@ re@@ ement with ob@@ serv@@ ations by the W@@ M@@ A@@ P s@@ at@@ elli@@ te of the cos@@ mi@@ c m@@ ic@@ ro@@ w@@ ave bac@@ k@@ ground , which is an im@@ prin@@ t of the very early universe ."
We think we have sol@@ ved the my@@ st@@ ery of cre@@ ation .
M@@ ay@@ be we should pat@@ ent the universe and char@@ ge everyone ro@@ y@@ al@@ ties for their exist@@ ence .
"I now turn to the second big question : are we al@@ one , or is there other life in the universe ?"
"We believe that life ar@@ ose sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously on the Earth , so it must be possible for life to appe@@ ar on other su@@ it@@ able plan@@ ets , of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy ."
But we don &apos;t know how life first appe@@ ared .
We have two pi@@ ec@@ es of ob@@ serv@@ ational evidence on the prob@@ ability of life appe@@ ar@@ ing .
The first is that we have f@@ os@@ si@@ ls of al@@ g@@ a@@ e from 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years ago .
The Earth was form@@ ed 4@@ .@@ 6 billion years ago and was probably too ho@@ t for about the first half billion years .
"So life appe@@ ared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible , which is sh@@ ort comp@@ ared to the 1@@ 0-@@ b@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ year li@@ fe@@ time of a planet of Earth t@@ y@@ pe ."
This su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that the prob@@ ability of life appe@@ ar@@ ing is reas@@ on@@ ably high .
"If it was very low , one would have exp@@ ected it to take most of the ten billion years av@@ a@@ il@@ able ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we don &apos;t seem to have been vi@@ s@@ ited by ali@@ ens ."
I am disc@@ oun@@ ting the re@@ por@@ ts of U@@ F@@ O@@ s .
Why would they appe@@ ar only to cr@@ an@@ ks and we@@ ir@@ do@@ s ?
"If there is a government con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy to sup@@ pres@@ s the re@@ por@@ ts and keep for itself the scienti@@ fic knowledge the ali@@ ens bring , it seems to have been a sing@@ ul@@ arly in@@ effec@@ tive po@@ lic@@ y so far ."
"F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , des@@ p@@ ite an ex@@ ten@@ sive sear@@ ch by the S@@ E@@ T@@ I pro@@ ject , we ha@@ ven &apos;t heard any ali@@ en tel@@ evi@@ sion qu@@ i@@ z sho@@ ws ."
This probably in@@ dic@@ ates that there are no ali@@ en civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations at our st@@ age of develop@@ ment within a radi@@ us of a few hundred light years .
This br@@ ings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human r@@ ace .
"If we are the only intellig@@ ent be@@ ings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survi@@ ve and contin@@ ue ."
But we are en@@ ter@@ ing an increas@@ ing@@ ly d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous per@@ i@@ od of our history .
But our gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de still car@@ ri@@ es the self@@ ish and ag@@ gres@@ sive inst@@ inc@@ ts that were of survi@@ v@@ al adv@@ an@@ t@@ age in the past .
"O@@ ur only chan@@ ce of lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m survi@@ v@@ al is not to re@@ ma@@ in in@@ war@@ d@@ -@@ looking on planet Earth , but to sp@@ read out into space ."
The ans@@ w@@ ers to these big questions show that we have made re@@ mark@@ able progress in the last hundred years .
"But if we want to contin@@ ue be@@ y@@ on@@ d the next hundred years , our future is in space ."
A@@ ll of my life I have s@@ ought to understand the universe and find ans@@ w@@ ers to these questions .
I have been very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y that my dis@@ ability has not been a ser@@ i@@ ous h@@ an@@ dic@@ ap .
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pur@@ sue the qu@@ est for knowledge ."
"The ul@@ tim@@ ate go@@ al is a comple@@ te theory of the universe , and we are making good progress ."
Thank you for li@@ st@@ en@@ ing .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , if you had to gu@@ ess e@@ ither way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are al@@ one in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , as a civi@@ li@@ zation of our level of intelligence or high@@ er ?"
"This answer took se@@ ven minutes , and really gave me an in@@ sight into the incredi@@ ble act of gener@@ os@@ ity this whole talk was for TED ."
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king : I think it quite likely that we are the only civi@@ li@@ zation within se@@ ver@@ al hundred light years ; o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se we would have heard radi@@ o wa@@ ves .
"The al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative is that civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations don &apos;t last very long , but dest@@ ro@@ y themselves ."
"C@@ A : P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or H@@ aw@@ king , th@@ ank you for that answer ."

Here &apos;s a question we need to re@@ think together : What should be the ro@@ le of money and mar@@ ke@@ ts in our societies ?
"T@@ o@@ day , there are very few things that money can &apos;t bu@@ y ."
"If you &apos;re s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed to a j@@ a@@ il ter@@ m in S@@ an@@ t@@ a B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you should know that if you don &apos;t like the st@@ and@@ ard ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ations , you can bu@@ y a pri@@ son c@@ ell up@@ gra@@ de ."
"It &apos;s true . F@@ or how much , do you think ?"
What would you gu@@ ess ?
F@@ i@@ ve hundred dollars ?
It &apos;s not the R@@ it@@ z@@ -@@ C@@ ar@@ l@@ t@@ on . It &apos;s a j@@ a@@ il !
E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ two dollars a night . E@@ igh@@ t@@ y-@@ two dollars a night .
If you go to an am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ k
"@@ and don &apos;t want to st@@ and in the long l@@ ines for the pop@@ ular ri@@ des , there is now a solu@@ tion ."
"In many the@@ me par@@ ks , you can p@@ ay extra to j@@ um@@ p to the head of the line ."
They call them F@@ ast T@@ r@@ ack or V@@ I@@ P tic@@ ke@@ ts .
And this isn &apos;t only happening in am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ ks .
"In W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , long l@@ ines , qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes form for important Con@@ gres@@ si@@ onal hear@@ ings ."
"Now some people don &apos;t like to wa@@ it in long qu@@ e@@ ues , maybe over@@ night , even in the ra@@ in ."
"So now , for lob@@ b@@ y@@ ists and others who are very ke@@ en to att@@ end these hear@@ ings but don &apos;t like to wa@@ it , there are comp@@ an@@ ies , l@@ in@@ e-@@ st@@ anding comp@@ an@@ ies , and you can go to them ."
"You can p@@ ay them a certain amount of money , they h@@ ire h@@ om@@ el@@ ess people and others who need a job to st@@ and wa@@ iting in the line for as long as it ta@@ kes , and the lob@@ b@@ y@@ ist , just before the hear@@ ing beg@@ ins , can take his or her place at the head of the line and a se@@ at in the front of the room ."
P@@ a@@ id line st@@ anding .
"It &apos;s happening , the rec@@ our@@ se to market m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms and market thinking and market solu@@ tions , in big@@ ger aren@@ as ."
T@@ a@@ ke the way we fi@@ ght our war@@ s .
"D@@ id you know that , in I@@ ra@@ q and A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , there were more pri@@ v@@ ate mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary con@@ tr@@ ac@@ tors on the ground than there were U.@@ S@@ . mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary tro@@ op@@ s ?"
"Now this isn &apos;t because we had a public de@@ b@@ ate about whether we wanted to out@@ s@@ our@@ ce war to pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ an@@ ies , but this is what has happened ."
"O@@ ver the past three dec@@ ad@@ es , we have li@@ ved through a qu@@ i@@ et re@@ v@@ olution ."
We &apos;ve dri@@ f@@ ted almost without reali@@ zing it from having a market econom@@ y to becom@@ ing market societies .
"The difference is this : A market econom@@ y is a to@@ ol , a val@@ u@@ able and effec@@ tive to@@ ol , for organi@@ zing produc@@ tive acti@@ vity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for s@@ ale ."
"It &apos;s a way of life , in which market thinking and market val@@ ues beg@@ in to dom@@ in@@ ate every as@@ p@@ ect of life : pers@@ onal rel@@ ations , family life , health , education , poli@@ tics , la@@ w , civi@@ c life ."
"Now , why wor@@ ry ? Why wor@@ ry about our becom@@ ing market societies ?"
"For two reas@@ ons , I think ."
One of them has to do with in@@ equality .
"The more things money can bu@@ y , the more aff@@ l@@ u@@ ence , or the l@@ ack of it , mat@@ ters ."
"If the only thing that money de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed was ac@@ cess to y@@ ach@@ ts or f@@ anc@@ y v@@ ac@@ ations or B@@ M@@ W@@ s , then in@@ equality wouldn &apos;t matter very much ."
"But when money comes increas@@ ing@@ ly to gover@@ n ac@@ cess to the ess@@ enti@@ als of the good life — dec@@ ent health care , ac@@ cess to the best education , political v@@ o@@ ice and in@@ flu@@ ence in cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ ns — when money comes to gover@@ n all of those things , in@@ equality mat@@ ters a great de@@ al ."
And so the mar@@ ke@@ ti@@ zation of everything sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ens the st@@ ing of in@@ equality and its social and civi@@ c con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence .
That &apos;s one reason to wor@@ ry .
"There &apos;s a second reason ap@@ art from the wor@@ ry about in@@ equality , and it &apos;s this : with some social go@@ o@@ ds and pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es , when market thinking and market val@@ ues en@@ ter , they may change the mean@@ ing of those pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es and c@@ ro@@ w@@ d out at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des and n@@ or@@ ms wor@@ th car@@ ing about ."
"I &apos;d like to take an example of a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al use of a market m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism , a cas@@ h inc@@ enti@@ ve , and see what you think about it ."
"M@@ any scho@@ ols str@@ u@@ gg@@ le with the chall@@ en@@ ge of moti@@ v@@ ating kids , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally kids from di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ ed bac@@ k@@ gr@@ ounds , to study hard , to do well in school , to app@@ ly themselves ."
S@@ ome econom@@ ists have pro@@ posed a market solu@@ tion : O@@ ff@@ er cas@@ h inc@@ enti@@ ves to kids for getting good gra@@ des or high test sc@@ o@@ res or for read@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks .
"They &apos;ve tri@@ ed this , actually ."
They &apos;ve done some experim@@ ents in some maj@@ or American ci@@ ties .
"In New Y@@ or@@ k , in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , D@@ .@@ C@@ . , they &apos;ve tri@@ ed this , off@@ ering 50 dollars for an A , 3@@ 5 dollars for a B@@ ."
"In D@@ all@@ as , T@@ ex@@ as , they have a program that off@@ ers e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds two dollars for each book they read ."
"So let &apos;s see what — S@@ ome people are in fav@@ or , some people are op@@ posed to this cas@@ h inc@@ enti@@ ve to moti@@ v@@ ate achi@@ ev@@ ement ."
Let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that you are the head of a maj@@ or school system , and someone comes to you with this pro@@ pos@@ al ."
And let &apos;s say it &apos;s a f@@ ound@@ ation . They will pro@@ vi@@ de the fun@@ ds .
You don &apos;t have to take it out of your bu@@ d@@ get .
How many would be in fav@@ or and how many would be op@@ posed to giving it a try ?
Let &apos;s see by a show of h@@ ands .
"F@@ ir@@ st , how many think it might at le@@ ast be wor@@ th a try to see if it would work ? R@@ a@@ ise your hand ."
"And how many would be op@@ posed ? How many would — So the maj@@ or@@ ity here are op@@ posed , but a si@@ z@@ able min@@ or@@ ity are in fav@@ or ."
Let &apos;s have a disc@@ us@@ sion .
"@@ Let &apos;s start with those of you who ob@@ ject , who would ru@@ le it out even before trying ."
What would be your reason ?
Wh@@ o will get our disc@@ us@@ sion started ? Y@@ es ?
"H@@ e@@ i@@ ke M@@ os@@ es : H@@ ell@@ o everyone , I &apos;m H@@ e@@ i@@ ke , and I think it just k@@ ills the in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic moti@@ v@@ ation , so in the resp@@ ect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this inc@@ enti@@ ve away in just p@@ ay@@ ing them , so it just changes behavior ."
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ an@@ de@@ l : T@@ a@@ kes the in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic inc@@ enti@@ ve away .
"What is , or should be , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic moti@@ v@@ ation ?"
"H@@ M : Well , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic moti@@ v@@ ation should be to learn ."
M@@ S : T@@ o learn . H@@ M : T@@ o get to know the world .
"And then , if you stop p@@ ay@@ ing them , what happens then ?"
Th@@ en they stop read@@ ing ?
"M@@ S : Now , let &apos;s see if there &apos;s someone who fav@@ ors , who thin@@ ks it &apos;s wor@@ th trying this ."
"E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th L@@ of@@ tu@@ s : I &apos;m E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th L@@ of@@ tu@@ s , and you said wor@@ th a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?"
M@@ S : And measure . And what would you measure ?
You &apos;d measure how many — E@@ L : How many bo@@ o@@ ks they read and how many bo@@ o@@ ks they contin@@ u@@ ed to read after you st@@ op@@ ped p@@ ay@@ ing them .
"M@@ S : O@@ h , after you st@@ op@@ ped p@@ ay@@ ing ."
"A@@ ll right , what about that ?"
"H@@ M : T@@ o be fr@@ ank , I just think this is , not to off@@ end any@@ one , a very American way ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) M@@ S : A@@ ll right . What &apos;s em@@ er@@ g@@ ed from this disc@@ us@@ sion is the fol@@ lowing question : W@@ ill the cas@@ h inc@@ enti@@ ve dri@@ ve out or cor@@ ru@@ p@@ t or c@@ ro@@ w@@ d out the high@@ er moti@@ v@@ ation , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic l@@ es@@ son that we hope to con@@ v@@ ey , which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sa@@ kes ?"
"And people dis@@ ag@@ ree about what the eff@@ ect will be , but that seems to be the question , that some@@ how a market m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism or a cas@@ h inc@@ enti@@ ve teach@@ es the wrong l@@ es@@ son , and if it does , what will become of these children later ?"
I should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experim@@ ents .
"The cas@@ h for good gra@@ des has had very mi@@ x@@ ed res@@ ults , for the most part has not res@@ ul@@ ted in high@@ er gra@@ des ."
The two dollars for each book did le@@ ad those kids to read more bo@@ o@@ ks .
It also led them to read sh@@ or@@ ter bo@@ o@@ ks .
"( Laughter ) But the real question is , what will become of these kids later ?"
"W@@ ill they have learned that read@@ ing is a ch@@ ore , a form of pi@@ ec@@ e@@ work to be done for p@@ ay , that &apos;s the wor@@ ry , or may it le@@ ad them to read maybe for the wrong reason in@@ i@@ ti@@ ally but then le@@ ad them to f@@ all in love with read@@ ing for its own sa@@ ke ?"
"Now , what this , even this bri@@ e@@ f de@@ b@@ ate , br@@ ings out is something that many econom@@ ists over@@ look ."
"E@@ con@@ om@@ ists often as@@ su@@ me that mar@@ ke@@ ts are in@@ er@@ t , that they do not tou@@ ch or tain@@ t the go@@ o@@ ds they ex@@ change ."
"M@@ ar@@ k@@ et ex@@ change , they as@@ su@@ me , doesn &apos;t change the mean@@ ing or value of the go@@ o@@ ds being ex@@ changed ."
"If you s@@ ell me a fl@@ at scre@@ en tel@@ evi@@ sion or give me one as a gi@@ ft , it will be the same good ."
It will work the same e@@ ither way .
But the same may not be true if we &apos;re talking about n@@ on@@ material go@@ o@@ ds and social pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es such as teach@@ ing and learning or eng@@ aging together in civi@@ c life .
"In those dom@@ ain@@ s , br@@ ing@@ ing market m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms and cas@@ h inc@@ enti@@ ves may under@@ m@@ ine or c@@ ro@@ w@@ d out n@@ on@@ market val@@ ues and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des wor@@ th car@@ ing about ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we see that mar@@ ke@@ ts and comm@@ er@@ ce , when ex@@ ten@@ ded be@@ y@@ on@@ d the material dom@@ ain , can change the char@@ ac@@ ter of the go@@ o@@ ds themselves , can change the mean@@ ing of the social pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es , as in the example of teach@@ ing and learning , we have to ask where mar@@ ke@@ ts b@@ el@@ ong and where they don &apos;t , where they may actually under@@ m@@ ine val@@ ues and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des wor@@ th car@@ ing about ."
"But to have this de@@ b@@ ate , we have to do something we &apos;re not very good at , and that is to reason together in public about the value and the mean@@ ing of the social pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es we pri@@ ze , from our bo@@ dies to family life to pers@@ onal rel@@ ations to health to teach@@ ing and learning to civi@@ c life ."
"Now these are contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al questions , and so we t@@ end to sh@@ r@@ ink from them ."
"In fact , d@@ uring the past three dec@@ ad@@ es , when market reas@@ on@@ ing and market thinking have g@@ a@@ ther@@ ed force and g@@ ained pres@@ ti@@ ge , our public disc@@ our@@ se d@@ uring this time has become ho@@ l@@ lowed out , emp@@ ty of lar@@ ger moral mean@@ ing ."
"For fear of dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement , we sh@@ r@@ ink from these questions ."
"But once we see that mar@@ ke@@ ts change the char@@ ac@@ ter of go@@ o@@ ds , we have to de@@ b@@ ate am@@ ong ourselves these big@@ ger questions about how to value go@@ o@@ ds ."
"One of the most cor@@ r@@ os@@ i@@ ve effec@@ ts of pu@@ tting a pr@@ ice on everything is on com@@ mon@@ ality , the sense that we are all in it together ."
"A@@ g@@ ainst the bac@@ k@@ ground of ri@@ sing in@@ equality , mar@@ ke@@ ti@@ zing every as@@ p@@ ect of life le@@ ads to a condi@@ tion where those who are aff@@ l@@ u@@ ent and those who are of mo@@ d@@ est means increas@@ ing@@ ly live se@@ par@@ ate lives ."
We live and work and sho@@ p and play in different places .
O@@ ur children go to different scho@@ ols .
"This isn &apos;t good for democr@@ acy , n@@ or is it a s@@ atis@@ f@@ ying way to live , even for those of us who can aff@@ or@@ d to bu@@ y our way to the head of the line ."
Here &apos;s why .
"D@@ em@@ o@@ cr@@ acy does not requ@@ ire per@@ f@@ ect equality , but what it does requ@@ ire is that ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens share in a common life ."
And this is how we come to care for the common good .
"And so , in the end , the question of mar@@ ke@@ ts is not ma@@ in@@ ly an economic question ."
It &apos;s really a question of how we want to live together .
"D@@ o we want a society where everything is up for s@@ ale , or are there certain moral and civi@@ c go@@ o@@ ds that mar@@ ke@@ ts do not h@@ on@@ or and money cannot bu@@ y ?"
Thank you very much .

S@@ ome of those re@@ for@@ ms have been good .

E@@ very@@ one in this room has been aff@@ ected by a teacher or an ad@@ ult .

D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t it feel good to say it out l@@ ou@@ d ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the ro@@ le of social mov@@ em@@ ents in cre@@ ating change in M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ or@@ ity societies ."
"So let me beg@@ in by first of all giving a very , very bri@@ e@@ f history of time , if I may in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge ."
I@@ n me@@ di@@ ev@@ al societies there were defin@@ ed al@@ le@@ gi@@ anc@@ es .
A@@ n i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty was defin@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily by religi@@ on .
"In the age of glob@@ ali@@ zation , we mo@@ ved on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re mo@@ ving into a new age , and that age The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es du@@ b@@ bed rec@@ ently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavior . &quot; &quot; How I de@@ fine the age of behavior is a per@@ i@@ od of trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ anc@@ es , where i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty is defin@@ ed more so by ideas and n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves ."
"But actually it &apos;s my belie@@ f that the people who &apos;ve been tru@@ ly cap@@ it@@ ali@@ zing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until rec@@ ent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ ali@@ zing most on the age of behavior and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ anc@@ es , using dig@@ ital acti@@ vi@@ s@@ m and other sor@@ ts of bor@@ der@@ less techno@@ logi@@ es , those who &apos;ve been b@@ ene@@ f@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mi@@ sts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was inv@@ ol@@ ved in an extre@@ me I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ist organi@@ zation ."
"And my story , my pers@@ onal story , is tru@@ ly evidence for the age of behavior that I &apos;m att@@ emp@@ ting to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate up@@ on here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ se@@ x l@@ ad , born and ra@@ is@@ ed in E@@ s@@ se@@ x in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ iting people from C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity to this organi@@ zation ."
"Now that j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and what took me from E@@ s@@ se@@ x all the way across the world — by the way , we were l@@ augh@@ ing at democr@@ atic acti@@ vi@@ sts ."
We f@@ el@@ t they were from the age of y@@ est@@ er@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ ma@@ il from the extre@@ mi@@ st organi@@ zation that I used .
"E@@ ven@@ tually I was de@@ t@@ ected , of course , in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my adv@@ an@@ t@@ age was because I was within an extre@@ mi@@ st organi@@ zation that was for@@ c@@ ed to think be@@ y@@ on@@ d the con@@ fin@@ es of the n@@ ati@@ on@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o and ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ed it ."
And it &apos;s not just I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mi@@ sts that did this .
A form of an@@ ti@@ -@@ I@@ s@@ l@@ am r@@ he@@ t@@ or@@ ic is also on the ri@@ se and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences that this is having is that it &apos;s aff@@ ec@@ ting the political c@@ lim@@ ate across Euro@@ pe .
Because the In@@ ter@@ net and connec@@ tion techno@@ logi@@ es are connec@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , m@@ os@@ qu@@ e min@@ are@@ ts are being b@@ an@@ ned ."
"In others , k@@ os@@ her and hal@@ al me@@ at are being b@@ an@@ ned , as we spe@@ ak ."
"And on the f@@ li@@ p side , we have trans@@ national I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mi@@ sts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts of par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al@@ ism that are being connec@@ ted in a way that makes them feel like they are ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have f@@ el@@ t is@@ ol@@ ated , until these sor@@ ts of techno@@ logi@@ es came around and connec@@ ted them in a way that made them feel part of a lar@@ ger ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far be@@ h@@ ind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this st@@ age .
If any of you remem@@ bers the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as D@@ ay bom@@ b p@@ lot : there &apos;s a man called A@@ n@@ war al@@ -@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ k@@ i .
"As an American ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en , e@@ th@@ n@@ ically a Y@@ em@@ en@@ i , in hi@@ ding curren@@ tly in Y@@ em@@ en , who insp@@ i@@ red a N@@ ig@@ eri@@ an , son of the head of N@@ ig@@ eri@@ a &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ ig@@ eri@@ an stud@@ ent stu@@ died in L@@ on@@ don , tr@@ ained in Y@@ em@@ en , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am to att@@ ack America ."
"The O@@ ld m@@ ent@@ ality with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted by the n@@ ati@@ on@@ -@@ state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recogni@@ zing the power of trans@@ national social mov@@ em@@ ents , got left be@@ h@@ ind ."
And the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as D@@ ay bom@@ ber almost suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded in att@@ ac@@ king the United States of America .
"A@@ g@@ ain with the example of the far right : that we find , ir@@ on@@ ically , x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ c n@@ ati@@ on@@ ali@@ sts are u@@ ti@@ li@@ zing the b@@ ene@@ f@@ its of glob@@ ali@@ zation ."
So why are they suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding ?
And why are democr@@ acy as@@ p@@ ir@@ an@@ ts f@@ all@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social mov@@ em@@ ents who understand this .
"And a social mov@@ ement is comp@@ ri@@ sed , in my view , it &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of four ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics ."
It &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of ideas and n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves and sym@@ b@@ ols and lead@@ ers .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aw@@ are of , and that &apos;s the example of A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ me@@ di@@ ately ."
"I@@ n@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , the difference between ideas and n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves : the idea is the c@@ ause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative is the way to s@@ ell that c@@ ause — the pro@@ p@@ ag@@ and@@ a , if you like , of the c@@ ause ."
So the ideas and the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ves of A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a come to your mind im@@ me@@ di@@ ately .
One of their lead@@ ers was k@@ ill@@ ed in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an rec@@ ently .
And that &apos;s the power of social mov@@ em@@ ents .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to fo@@ c@@ us curren@@ tly on P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an , and I ask you to think of the sym@@ b@@ ols and the lead@@ ers for democr@@ acy in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think be@@ y@@ on@@ d perhaps the ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ation of B@@ en@@ az@@ ir B@@ h@@ ut@@ to ."
"Wh@@ ich means , by defin@@ i@@ tion , that particular lead@@ er no longer ex@@ ists ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no glob@@ ali@@ zed , y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led , gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots social mov@@ em@@ ents adv@@ oc@@ ating for democr@@ atic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ or@@ ity societies ."
"There is no equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the A@@ l@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a , without the ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , for democr@@ acy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ or@@ ity societies ."
So that be@@ gs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s com@@ plac@@ enc@@ y ."
And that level of com@@ plac@@ enc@@ y means they don &apos;t feel the need to adv@@ oc@@ ate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness ."
That we have a h@@ es@@ it@@ ation in es@@ p@@ ous@@ ing the univers@@ ality of democr@@ atic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the univers@@ ality of our val@@ ues — with extre@@ mi@@ sts .
"Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ gh@@ ts , we do say that human ri@@ gh@@ ts are univers@@ al ."
But actually going out to pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with e@@ ither ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ vi@@ s@@ m or with I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m .
T@@ o go around saying that I believe democr@@ atic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved at as a form of political organi@@ zing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extre@@ mis@@ m .
"And then you have a thir@@ d par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ote for us ; we &apos;ll est@@ ab@@ lish a the@@ o@@ cr@@ acy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a res@@ ult of this is , when those par@@ ties are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they fa@@ il , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably they make political mi@@ sta@@ kes , democr@@ acy ta@@ kes the bl@@ ame for their political mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tri@@ ed democr@@ acy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s bre@@ ak down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"A@@ nec@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that if po@@ ver@@ ty was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en is from one of the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est fam@@ ili@@ es in S@@ au@@ d@@ i A@@ r@@ ab@@ ia ."
"H@@ is de@@ pu@@ ty , A@@ y@@ man al@@ -@@ Z@@ a@@ wa@@ h@@ ir@@ i , was a pe@@ di@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an — not an ill@@ -@@ educ@@ ated man ."
"And what I believe is mis@@ sing is gen@@ u@@ ine gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots acti@@ vi@@ s@@ m on the ground , in ad@@ di@@ tion to inter@@ national a@@ id , in ad@@ di@@ tion to education , in ad@@ di@@ tion to health ."
"@@ Not ex@@ clu@@ sive to these things , but in ad@@ di@@ tion to them , is pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ating a gen@@ u@@ ine de@@ m@@ and for democr@@ acy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m had it up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down .
N@@ e@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m had the philosop@@ h@@ y that you go in with a sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ led appro@@ ach to imp@@ ose democr@@ atic val@@ ues from the top down .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ists and f@@ ar@@ -@@ right organi@@ z@@ ations , for dec@@ ad@@ es , have been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ ass mov@@ em@@ ents in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an have been re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted after the A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pri@@ s@@ ings ma@@ in@@ ly by organi@@ z@@ ations cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing for some form of the@@ o@@ cr@@ acy , rather than for a democr@@ atic u@@ pri@@ sing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ par@@ ti@@ tion , they &apos;ve been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national y@@ ou@@ th@@ -@@ led mov@@ ement that works to acti@@ vely adv@@ oc@@ ate for the democr@@ atic culture — which is nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is av@@ o@@ id the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where curren@@ tly we have political par@@ ties pres@@ ent@@ ing democr@@ acy as mer@@ ely a political cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ on@@ g@@ side other cho@@ ices such as mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary ru@@ le and the@@ o@@ cr@@ acy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sli@@ de here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ote in an exist@@ ing democr@@ acy , not for a democr@@ acy ."
"Now to con@@ clu@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ g@@ yp@@ t is a good star@@ ting point ."
The A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pri@@ s@@ ings have de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the A@@ ra@@ b u@@ pri@@ s@@ ings and what happened in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t was partic@@ ul@@ arly c@@ ath@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one ste@@ p be@@ y@@ on@@ d that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a lead@@ er or r@@ ul@@ er or dic@@ t@@ at@@ or .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an with a mov@@ ement called K@@ hu@@ d@@ i , where we are working on the ground to enc@@ our@@ age the y@@ ou@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y-@@ in for the democr@@ atic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and th@@ ank you for your time ."
"B@@ ack in New Y@@ or@@ k , I am the head of develop@@ ment for a n@@ on@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood ."
"When I &apos;m not fi@@ gh@@ ting po@@ ver@@ ty , I &apos;m fi@@ gh@@ ting fi@@ res as the assi@@ st@@ ant cap@@ tain of a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er fir@@ e comp@@ any ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers sup@@ ple@@ ment a high@@ ly sk@@ ill@@ ed care@@ er st@@ af@@ f , you have to get to the fir@@ e sc@@ en@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remember my first fir@@ e .
"I was the second v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the sc@@ en@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real fo@@ ot@@ r@@ ace against the other v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our assi@@ gn@@ ments would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging con@@ vers@@ ation with the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , who was su@@ re@@ ly having one of the wor@@ st days of her life ."
"@@ Here it was , the middle of the night , she was st@@ anding outside in the p@@ our@@ ing ra@@ in , under an um@@ b@@ rel@@ l@@ a , in her p@@ a@@ j@@ am@@ as , b@@ are@@ fo@@ ot , while her h@@ ouse was in fl@@ am@@ es ."
The other v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ ri@@ ved just before me — let &apos;s call him L@@ e@@ x L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and sa@@ ve the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with j@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"@@ Here was some la@@ w@@ y@@ er or money man@@ ag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to sa@@ ve a living cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ z@@ o@@ s , I need you to go into the h@@ ouse ."
"I need you to go up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , past the fir@@ e , and I need you to get this woman a p@@ air of sho@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I s@@ we@@ ar ."
"So , not exactly what I was ho@@ ping for , but off I went — up the sta@@ ir@@ s , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , who were pretty much done pu@@ tting out the fir@@ e at this point , into the ma@@ ster be@@ d@@ room to get a p@@ air of sho@@ es ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ri@@ ed my p@@ ay@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s where I m@@ et my ne@@ m@@ es@@ is and the preci@@ ous do@@ g by the front do@@ or .
"We took our tre@@ as@@ ures outside to the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , his re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved much more att@@ en@@ tion than did m@@ ine ."
"A few wee@@ ks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a le@@ tter from the h@@ ome@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant eff@@ ort dis@@ play@@ ed in sa@@ ving her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she not@@ ed abo@@ ve all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a p@@ air of sho@@ es .
"( Laughter ) I@@ n both my v@@ oc@@ ation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ter , I am w@@ it@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ um@@ ental sc@@ ale , but I &apos;m also w@@ it@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gr@@ ace and cour@@ age on an in@@ divi@@ du@@ al bas@@ is ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who e@@ ither have achi@@ ev@@ ed , or are on their way to achi@@ ev@@ ing , re@@ mark@@ able lev@@ els of suc@@ cess , I would off@@ er this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wa@@ it ."
D@@ on &apos;t wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve food at a s@@ ou@@ p k@@ it@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od par@@ k .
B@@ e a m@@ ent@@ or .
"@@ Not every day is going to off@@ er us a chan@@ ce to sa@@ ve somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an op@@ port@@ unity to aff@@ ect one ."
So get in the g@@ ame . S@@ ave the sho@@ es .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i : Mar@@ k , Mar@@ k , come back . ( Applause )"
Mar@@ k B@@ e@@ z@@ o@@ s : Thank you .
"@@ G@@ ood mor@@ ning everyone . F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s been f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic being here over these past few days ."
"And secon@@ dly , I feel it &apos;s a great h@@ on@@ or to kind of w@@ ind up this ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary g@@ ath@@ ering of people , these ama@@ zing tal@@ ks that we &apos;ve had ."
"I feel that I &apos;ve f@@ it@@ ted in , in many ways , to some of the things that I &apos;ve heard ."
"I came direc@@ tly here from the de@@ ep , de@@ ep t@@ rop@@ ical ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , where I was out — you could only get there by a plan@@ e — with in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people with pain@@ t on their fac@@ es and par@@ ro@@ t fe@@ a@@ thers on their he@@ ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses , where these people are fi@@ gh@@ ting to try and keep the o@@ il comp@@ an@@ ies , and keep the ro@@ ads , out of their fore@@ sts ."
"They &apos;re fi@@ gh@@ ting to devel@@ op their own way of living within the fore@@ st in a world that &apos;s c@@ le@@ an , a world that isn &apos;t cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated , a world that isn &apos;t p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ted ."
"And what was so ama@@ zing to me , and what f@@ its right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at TED , is that there , right in the middle of this ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st , was some sol@@ ar pan@@ els — the first in that part of E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or — and that was ma@@ in@@ ly to bring water up by p@@ um@@ p so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down ."
"The water was c@@ le@@ an@@ ed , but because they got a lot of b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies , they were able to st@@ ore a lot of electr@@ ic@@ ity ."
"So every h@@ ouse — and there were , I think , eight h@@ ous@@ es in this little comm@@ unity — could have light for , I think it was about half an h@@ our each even@@ ing ."
"And there is the C@@ hi@@ e@@ f , in all his re@@ g@@ al fin@@ ery , with a l@@ ap@@ top computer ."
"( Laughter ) And this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s g@@ one back , and he was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we have su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly j@@ um@@ ped into a whole new er@@ a , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with l@@ ap@@ top compu@@ ters , and there are some things we want to learn from the moder@@ n world ."
We want to know about health care .
We want to know about what other people do — we &apos;re interest@@ ed in it .
And we want to learn other langu@@ ages .
"We want to know English and F@@ ren@@ ch and perhaps Ch@@ in@@ ese , and we &apos;re good at langu@@ ages . &quot; &quot; So there he is with his little l@@ ap@@ top computer , but fi@@ gh@@ ting against the might of the pres@@ su@@ res — because of the de@@ b@@ t , the fore@@ ig@@ n de@@ b@@ t of E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or — fi@@ gh@@ ting the pres@@ sure of W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , I@@ M@@ F , and of course the people who want to exp@@ lo@@ it the fore@@ sts and take out the o@@ il ."
"And so , coming direc@@ tly from there to here ."
"But , of course , my real field of exper@@ ti@@ se li@@ es in an even different kind of civi@@ li@@ zation — I can &apos;t really call it a civi@@ li@@ zation ."
"A different way of life , a different being ."
We &apos;ve tal@@ ked ear@@ li@@ er — this wonderful talk by W@@ ad@@ e D@@ av@@ is about the different cul@@ tures of the hum@@ ans around the world — but the world is not comp@@ os@@ ed only of human be@@ ings ; there are also other anim@@ al be@@ ings .
"And I pro@@ pose to bring into this TED con@@ fer@@ ence , as I always do around the world , the v@@ o@@ ice of the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom ."
"T@@ o@@ o often we just see a few sli@@ des , or a bit of f@@ il@@ m , but these be@@ ings have v@@ o@@ ices that mean something ."
"And so , I want to give you a gre@@ e@@ ting , as from a ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e in the fore@@ sts of T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a — O@@ o@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h , oo@@ h !@@ "
( Applause ) I &apos;ve been stud@@ ying ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a since 19@@ 60 .
"D@@ uring that time , there have been moder@@ n techno@@ logi@@ es that have really trans@@ form@@ ed the way that field bio@@ logi@@ sts do their work ."
"For example , for the first time , a few years ago , by simply coll@@ ec@@ ting little f@@ ec@@ al s@@ am@@ pl@@ es we were able to have them anal@@ y@@ zed — to have D@@ N@@ A prof@@ il@@ ing done — so for the first time , we actually know which m@@ ale ch@@ im@@ ps are the fa@@ thers of each in@@ divi@@ du@@ al in@@ f@@ ant ."
Because the ch@@ im@@ ps have a very prom@@ is@@ cu@@ ous mat@@ ing society .
So this op@@ ens up a whole new av@@ en@@ ue of resear@@ ch .
"And we use G@@ S@@ I — ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c wh@@ at@@ ever it is , G@@ S@@ I — to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine the ran@@ ge of the ch@@ im@@ ps ."
And we &apos;re using — you can see that I &apos;m not really into this kind of stuff — but we &apos;re using s@@ at@@ elli@@ te imag@@ ery to look at the de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation in the are@@ a .
"And of course , there &apos;s develop@@ ments in in@@ f@@ ra@@ red , so you can wat@@ ch anim@@ als at night , and equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment for rec@@ or@@ ding by vide@@ o , and t@@ ap@@ e rec@@ or@@ ding is getting ligh@@ ter and better ."
"So in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when I beg@@ an in 19@@ 60 ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally when ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es , and other anim@@ als with large bra@@ ins , are stu@@ died in cap@@ ti@@ vity , moder@@ n technology is hel@@ ping us to sear@@ ch for the up@@ per lev@@ els of cogni@@ tion in some of these n@@ on@@ -@@ human anim@@ als ."
"So that we know today , they &apos;re cap@@ able of per@@ form@@ anc@@ es that would have been thought ab@@ solu@@ tely im@@ possible by science when I beg@@ an ."
I think the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e in cap@@ ti@@ vity who is the most sk@@ ill@@ ed in int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual per@@ form@@ ance is one called A@@ i in Jap@@ an — her name means love — and she has a wonder@@ fully sen@@ si@@ tive par@@ t@@ ner working with her .
"S@@ he lo@@ ves her computer — she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her run@@ ning water , and her tre@@ es and everything ."
And she &apos;ll come in to s@@ it at this computer — it &apos;s like a vide@@ o g@@ ame for a k@@ id ; she &apos;s ho@@ o@@ ked .
"S@@ he &apos;s 2@@ 8 , by the way , and she does things with her computer scre@@ en and a tou@@ ch p@@ ad that she can do fa@@ ster than most hum@@ ans ."
"S@@ he does very comple@@ x t@@ as@@ ks , and I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to go into them , but the ama@@ zing thing about this f@@ em@@ ale is she doesn &apos;t like making mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
"If she has a bad run , and her sc@@ ore isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and re@@ ach up and ta@@ p on the gl@@ ass — because she can &apos;t see the experim@@ en@@ ter — which is as@@ king to have another go ."
"And her con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation — she &apos;s already con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated hard for 20 minutes or so , and now she wan@@ ts to do it all over again , just for the s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion of having done it better ."
"And the food is not important — she does get a t@@ iny re@@ ward , like one ra@@ is@@ in for a cor@@ rec@@ t respon@@ se — but she will do it for nothing , if you tell her be@@ fore@@ hand ."
"So here we are , a ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e using a computer ."
"@@ Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es , g@@ or@@ ill@@ as , or@@ an@@ gu@@ t@@ ans also learn human si@@ g@@ n language ."
"But the point is that when I was first in G@@ om@@ be in 19@@ 60 — I remember so well , so vi@@ vi@@ dly , as though it was y@@ est@@ er@@ day — the first time , when I was going through the ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ation , the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es were still run@@ ning away from me , for the most part , al@@ though some were a little bit ac@@ c@@ lim@@ ati@@ zed — and I saw this dark shap@@ e , h@@ un@@ ched over a ter@@ m@@ ite m@@ ound , and I pe@@ er@@ ed with my b@@ in@@ o@@ cul@@ ar@@ s ."
"It was , fort@@ un@@ ately , one ad@@ ult m@@ ale wh@@ om I &apos;d nam@@ ed D@@ a@@ vi@@ d G@@ re@@ y@@ be@@ ard — and by the way , science at that time was t@@ elling me that I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t name the ch@@ im@@ ps ; they should all have num@@ bers ; that was more scienti@@ fic ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , D@@ a@@ vi@@ d G@@ re@@ y@@ be@@ ard — and I saw that he was pic@@ king little pi@@ ec@@ es of gr@@ ass and using them to f@@ ish ter@@ m@@ it@@ es from their under@@ ground n@@ est ."
And not only that — he would sometimes pic@@ k a le@@ af@@ y tw@@ i@@ g and stri@@ p the le@@ a@@ ves — mo@@ di@@ f@@ ying an ob@@ ject to make it su@@ it@@ able for a speci@@ fic pur@@ pose — the beginning of to@@ ol@@ -@@ making .
"The reason this was so exc@@ iting and such a bre@@ ak@@ through is at that time , it was thought that hum@@ ans , and only hum@@ ans , used and made to@@ ols ."
"When I was at school , we were defin@@ ed as man , the to@@ ol@@ ma@@ ker ."
"So that when L@@ ou@@ is L@@ e@@ ak@@ ey , my m@@ ent@@ or , heard this news , he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ h , we must now re@@ de@@ fine &apos; man , &apos; re@@ de@@ fine &apos; to@@ ol , &apos; or ac@@ cept ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es as hum@@ ans . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We now know that at G@@ om@@ be al@@ one , there are n@@ ine different ways in which ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es use different ob@@ jects for different pur@@ pos@@ es ."
"M@@ o@@ re@@ over , we know that in different parts of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , wh@@ er@@ ever ch@@ im@@ ps have been stu@@ died , there are completely different to@@ ol@@ -@@ using behavi@@ ors ."
"And because it seems that these patterns are p@@ ass@@ ed from one generation to the next , through ob@@ serv@@ ation , im@@ it@@ ation and pr@@ acti@@ ce — that is a defin@@ i@@ tion of human culture ."
"What we find is that over these 4@@ 0-@@ o@@ d@@ d years that I and others have been stud@@ ying ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es and the other great ap@@ es , and , as I say , other ma@@ m@@ m@@ als with comple@@ x bra@@ ins and social syst@@ ems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a sh@@ ar@@ p line divi@@ ding hum@@ ans from the rest of the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom ."
It &apos;s a very w@@ u@@ z@@ zy line .
"It &apos;s getting w@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ ier all the time as we find anim@@ als doing things that we , in our ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , used to think was just human ."
"The ch@@ im@@ ps — there &apos;s no time to disc@@ us@@ s their f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating lives — but they have this long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , five years of suc@@ k@@ ling and s@@ le@@ e@@ ping with the mother , and then another three , four or five years of emoti@@ onal dep@@ en@@ dence on her , even when the next child is born ."
"The import@@ ance of learning in that time , when behavior is f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble — and there &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot to learn in ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e society ."
"The lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ate sup@@ por@@ tive b@@ on@@ ds that devel@@ op thr@@ ough@@ out this long chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od with the mother , with the bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , and which can last through a li@@ fe@@ time , which may be up to 60 years ."
"They can actually live longer than 60 in cap@@ ti@@ vity , so we &apos;ve only done 40 years in the wi@@ ld so far ."
And we find ch@@ im@@ ps are cap@@ able of true comp@@ assion and al@@ tru@@ ism .
"We find in their n@@ on@@ -@@ ver@@ b@@ al comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation — this is very r@@ ich — they have a lot of s@@ ounds , which they use in different cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es , but they also use tou@@ ch , pos@@ ture , ge@@ st@@ ure , and what do they do ?"
They k@@ is@@ s ; they em@@ br@@ ace ; they hold h@@ ands .
"They p@@ at one another on the back ; they s@@ w@@ ag@@ ger ; they s@@ ha@@ ke their fi@@ st — the kind of things that we do , and they do them in the same kind of cont@@ ex@@ t ."
They have very s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated co@@ oper@@ ation .
"S@@ ome@@ times they h@@ un@@ t — not that often , but when they h@@ un@@ t , they show s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated co@@ oper@@ ation , and they share the pre@@ y ."
"We find that they show emoti@@ ons , sim@@ il@@ ar to — maybe sometimes the same — as those that we descri@@ be in ourselves as happiness , sa@@ d@@ ness , fear , des@@ p@@ air ."
They know mental as well as physical suff@@ ering .
"And I don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will pro@@ ve some of these things to you , sa@@ ve to say that there are very b@@ right students , in the best univer@@ si@@ ties , stud@@ ying emoti@@ ons in anim@@ als , stud@@ ying pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties in anim@@ als ."
"We know that ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es and some other cre@@ atures can recogni@@ ze themselves in m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors — &quot; &quot; self &quot; &quot; as op@@ posed to &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; They have a sense of hum@@ or , and these are the kind of things which tra@@ di@@ tion@@ ally have been thought of as human pr@@ er@@ o@@ g@@ ati@@ ves ."
"But this teach@@ es us a new resp@@ ect — and it &apos;s a new resp@@ ect not only for the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es , I su@@ gg@@ est , but some of the other ama@@ zing anim@@ als with wh@@ om we share this planet ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we &apos;re pre@@ p@@ ared to ad@@ m@@ it that after all , we &apos;re not the only be@@ ings with pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties , min@@ ds and abo@@ ve all feel@@ ings , and then we start to think about ways we use and ab@@ use so many other s@@ enti@@ ent , s@@ ap@@ i@@ ent cre@@ atures on this planet , it really gi@@ ves c@@ ause for de@@ ep s@@ ha@@ me , at le@@ ast for me ."
"So , the sa@@ d thing is that these ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es — who &apos;ve perhaps t@@ au@@ ght us , more than any other cre@@ ature , a little hum@@ ili@@ ty — are in the wi@@ ld , dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing very f@@ ast ."
They &apos;re dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing for the reas@@ ons that all of you in this room know only too well .
"The de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation , the grow@@ th of human pop@@ ul@@ ations , nee@@ ding more land ."
They &apos;re dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing because some tim@@ ber comp@@ an@@ ies go in with c@@ lear@@ -@@ cu@@ tting .
They &apos;re dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing in the heart of their ran@@ ge in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a because the big m@@ ul@@ t@@ in@@ ational log@@ g@@ ing comp@@ an@@ ies have come in and made ro@@ ads — as they want to do in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or and other parts where the fore@@ sts re@@ ma@@ in un@@ tou@@ ched — to take out o@@ il or tim@@ ber .
"And this has led in Con@@ go bas@@ in , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bu@@ sh@@ -@@ me@@ at tr@@ ad@@ e ."
"This means that al@@ though for hund@@ re@@ ds , perhaps thousands of years , people have li@@ ved in those fore@@ sts , or wh@@ at@@ ever ha@@ b@@ it@@ at it is , in har@@ mon@@ y with their world , just k@@ ill@@ ing the anim@@ als they need for themselves and their fam@@ ili@@ es — now , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , because of the ro@@ ads , the h@@ un@@ ters can go in from the to@@ w@@ ns ."
"They sho@@ ot everything , every single thing that mo@@ ves that &apos;s big@@ ger than a small r@@ at ; they s@@ un@@ -@@ d@@ ry it or s@@ mo@@ ke it ."
And now they &apos;ve got tran@@ sp@@ ort ; they take it on the log@@ g@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks or the min@@ ing tr@@ uc@@ ks into the to@@ w@@ ns where they s@@ ell it .
"And people will p@@ ay more for bu@@ sh@@ -@@ me@@ at , as it &apos;s called , than for dom@@ es@@ tic me@@ at — it &apos;s cul@@ tur@@ ally pre@@ fer@@ red ."
"And it &apos;s not su@@ st@@ ain@@ able , and the huge log@@ g@@ ing cam@@ ps in the fore@@ st are now de@@ man@@ ding me@@ at , so the P@@ y@@ g@@ my h@@ un@@ ters in the Con@@ go bas@@ in who &apos;ve li@@ ved there with their wonderful way of living for so many hund@@ re@@ ds of years are now cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ted ."
They &apos;re given we@@ ap@@ ons ; they sho@@ ot for the log@@ g@@ ing cam@@ ps ; they get money .
"Th@@ e@@ ir culture is being dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , along with the anim@@ als up@@ on wh@@ om they dep@@ end ."
"So , when the log@@ g@@ ing cam@@ p mo@@ ves , there &apos;s nothing left ."
"We tal@@ ked already about the l@@ oss of human cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity , and I &apos;ve seen it happening with my own ey@@ es ."
"And the g@@ ri@@ m picture in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a — I love A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and what do we see in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ?"
"We see de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation ; we see the des@@ er@@ t sp@@ read@@ ing ; we see massive h@@ un@@ ger ; we see disease and we see population grow@@ th in are@@ as where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possi@@ bly sup@@ port , and they &apos;re too po@@ or to bu@@ y food from el@@ se@@ where ."
"W@@ ere the people that we heard about y@@ est@@ er@@ day , on the E@@ ast@@ er I@@ s@@ land , who c@@ ut down their last t@@ ree — were they stu@@ p@@ id ?"
D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
"O@@ f course , but if you &apos;ve seen the cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing po@@ ver@@ ty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s leave the t@@ ree for tom@@ or@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How am I going to fe@@ ed my family today ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be I can get just a few dollars from this last t@@ ree which will keep us going a little bit longer , and then we &apos;ll pr@@ ay that something will happen to sa@@ ve us from the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able end . &quot; &quot; So , this is a pretty g@@ ri@@ m picture ."
"The one thing we have , which makes us so different from ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es or other living cre@@ atures , is this s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated sp@@ o@@ ken language — a language with which we can tell children about things that are@@ n &apos;t here ."
"We can talk about the dist@@ ant past , pl@@ an for the dist@@ ant future , disc@@ us@@ s ideas with each other , so that the ideas can grow from the ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ated w@@ is@@ dom of a group ."
We can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through vide@@ o ; we can do it through the wr@@ it@@ ten word .
"And we are ab@@ using this great power we have to be wi@@ se ste@@ wards , and we &apos;re dest@@ ro@@ ying the world ."
"In the develop@@ ed world , in a way , it &apos;s wor@@ se , because we have so much ac@@ cess to knowledge of the stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity of what we &apos;re doing ."
"D@@ o you know , we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing little b@@ ab@@ ies into a world where , in many places , the water is po@@ is@@ on@@ ing them ?"
"And the air is har@@ m@@ ing them , and the food that &apos;s gro@@ wn from the cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated land is po@@ is@@ on@@ ing them ."
And that &apos;s not just in the f@@ ar@@ -@@ away develop@@ ing world ; that &apos;s every@@ where .
Do you know we all have about 50 ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als in our bo@@ dies we didn &apos;t have about 50 years ago ?
"And so many of these dise@@ ases , like as@@ th@@ m@@ a and certain kinds of canc@@ ers , are on the increase around places where our f@@ il@@ th@@ y to@@ x@@ ic wa@@ st@@ e is d@@ um@@ ped ."
"We &apos;re har@@ m@@ ing ourselves around the world , as well as har@@ m@@ ing the anim@@ als , as well as har@@ m@@ ing nature her@@ self — M@@ other N@@ ature , that br@@ ought us into being ; M@@ other N@@ ature , where I believe we need to sp@@ end time , where there &apos;s tre@@ es and f@@ low@@ ers and bir@@ ds for our good psycho@@ logical develop@@ ment ."
"And yet , there are hund@@ re@@ ds and hund@@ re@@ ds of children in the develop@@ ed world who never see nature , because they &apos;re gro@@ wing up in con@@ cre@@ te and all they know is vir@@ tual reality , with no op@@ port@@ unity to go and li@@ e in the su@@ n , or in the fore@@ st , with the d@@ ap@@ pl@@ ed s@@ un@@ -@@ spec@@ ks coming down from the can@@ op@@ y abo@@ ve ."
"As I was tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing around the world , you know , I had to leave the fore@@ st — that &apos;s where I love to be ."
"I had to leave these f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es for my students and field st@@ af@@ f to contin@@ ue stud@@ ying because , fin@@ ding they d@@ w@@ in@@ d@@ led from about two million 100 years ago to about 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 now , I knew I had to leave the fore@@ st to do what I could to ra@@ ise aw@@ are@@ ness around the world ."
"And the more I tal@@ ked about the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es &apos; p@@ light , the more I reali@@ zed the fact that everything &apos;s inter@@ connec@@ ted , and the problems of the develop@@ ing world so often stem from the gre@@ ed of the develop@@ ed world , and everything was jo@@ in@@ ing together , and making — not sense , hope li@@ es in sense , you said — it &apos;s making a n@@ on@@ sense ."
How can we do it ?
S@@ ome@@ body said that y@@ est@@ er@@ day .
"And as I was tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing around , I ke@@ p@@ t me@@ e@@ ting young people who &apos;d l@@ ost hope ."
"They were feel@@ ing des@@ p@@ air , they were feel@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; e@@ at , dr@@ ink and be mer@@ ry , for tom@@ or@@ row we die ."
"E@@ very@@ thing is ho@@ p@@ el@@ ess — we &apos;re always being told so by the me@@ dia . &quot; &quot; And then I m@@ et some who were an@@ gr@@ y , and an@@ ger that can turn to violence , and we &apos;re all fam@@ ili@@ ar with that ."
"And I have three little gr@@ and@@ children , and when some of these students would say to me at high school or univers@@ ity , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; We &apos;re f@@ ill@@ ed with des@@ p@@ air , because we feel you &apos;ve comp@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ed our future , and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot; &quot; And I looked in the ey@@ es of my little gr@@ and@@ children , and think how much we &apos;ve har@@ m@@ ed this planet since I was their age ."
"I feel this de@@ ep s@@ ha@@ me , and that &apos;s why in 19@@ 9@@ 1 in T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a , I started a program that &apos;s called R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots ."
"There &apos;s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , I be@@ g that you pic@@ k up that bro@@ ch@@ ure ."
And R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots is a program for hope .
R@@ o@@ ots make a fir@@ m f@@ ound@@ ation .
"S@@ ho@@ ots seem t@@ iny , but to re@@ ach the su@@ n they can bre@@ ak through br@@ ick w@@ all@@ s ."
S@@ e@@ e the br@@ ick w@@ all@@ s as all the problems that we &apos;ve in@@ f@@ lic@@ ted on this planet .
"Th@@ en , you see , it is a mess@@ age of hope ."
"H@@ und@@ re@@ ds and thousands of young people around the world can bre@@ ak through , and can make this a better world ."
And the most important mess@@ age of R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots is that every single in@@ divi@@ du@@ al makes a difference .
E@@ very in@@ divi@@ du@@ al has a ro@@ le to play .
"E@@ very one of us imp@@ ac@@ ts the world around us every@@ day , and you scienti@@ sts know that you can &apos;t actually — even if you st@@ ay in bed all day , you &apos;re bre@@ a@@ thing oxy@@ g@@ en and giving out C@@ O@@ 2 , and probably going to the lo@@ o , and things like that — you &apos;re making a difference in the world ."
"So , the R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots program inv@@ ol@@ ves y@@ ou@@ th in three kinds of pro@@ jects ."
And these are pro@@ jects to make the world around them a better place .
One pro@@ ject to show care and con@@ cer@@ n for your own human comm@@ unity .
"One for anim@@ als , in@@ clu@@ ding dom@@ es@@ tic anim@@ als — and I have to say , I learned everything I know about anim@@ al behavior even before I got to G@@ om@@ be and the ch@@ im@@ ps from my do@@ g , R@@ u@@ st@@ y , who was my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od comp@@ ani@@ on ."
And the thir@@ d kind of pro@@ ject : something for the loc@@ al environ@@ ment .
"So what the kids do dep@@ ends first of all , how old are they — and we go now from pre@@ -@@ school right through univers@@ ity ."
It &apos;s going to dep@@ end whether they &apos;re in@@ ner@@ -@@ c@@ ity or r@@ ural .
It &apos;s going to dep@@ end if they &apos;re we@@ al@@ th@@ y or im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed .
"It &apos;s going to dep@@ end which part , say , of America they &apos;re in ."
"We &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in F@@ l@@ ori@@ d@@ a are different from the problems in New Y@@ or@@ k ."
"It &apos;s going to dep@@ end on which country they &apos;re in — and we &apos;re already in 6@@ 0-@@ pl@@ us countries , with about 5@@ ,000 ac@@ tive grou@@ ps — and there are grou@@ ps all over the place that I keep hear@@ ing about that I &apos;ve never even heard of , because the kids are taking the program and sp@@ read@@ ing it themselves ."
Why ?
"Because they &apos;re bu@@ ying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to deci@@ de what they &apos;re going to do ."
"It isn &apos;t something that their parents tell them , or their teachers tell them ."
"That &apos;s effec@@ tive , but if they deci@@ de themselves , &quot; &quot; We want to c@@ le@@ an this ri@@ ver and put the f@@ ish back that used to be there ."
We want to c@@ lear away the to@@ x@@ ic so@@ il from this are@@ a and have an org@@ an@@ ic g@@ ar@@ d@@ en .
We want to go and sp@@ end time with the old people and hear their stories and rec@@ or@@ d their or@@ al hi@@ stories .
We want to go and work in a do@@ g sh@@ el@@ ter .
"We want to learn about anim@@ als . We want ... &quot; &quot; You know , it goes on and on , and this is very ho@@ pe@@ ful for me ."
"As I tra@@ v@@ el around the world 3@@ 00 days a year , every@@ where there &apos;s a group of R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots of different ages ."
"E@@ very@@ where there are children with sh@@ in@@ ing ey@@ es saying , &quot; Lo@@ ok at the difference we &apos;ve made . &quot;"
"And now comes the technology into it , because with this new way of comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ating electr@@ on@@ ically these kids can comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate with each other around the world ."
"And if any@@ one is interest@@ ed to help us , we &apos;ve got so many ideas but we need help — we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate their exc@@ it@@ ement ."
"But also — and this is so important — to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate their des@@ p@@ air , to say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tri@@ ed this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what sh@@ all we do ? &quot; &quot; And then , l@@ o and be@@ hold , there &apos;s another group ans@@ w@@ ering these kids who may be in America , or maybe this is a group in I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , saying , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , you did it a little bit wrong . This is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; The philosop@@ h@@ y is very simple ."
We do not believe in violence .
"@@ No violence , no bomb@@ s , no g@@ un@@ s ."
That &apos;s not the way to sol@@ ve problems .
"@@ V@@ i@@ ol@@ ence le@@ ads to violence , at le@@ ast in my view ."
So how do we sol@@ ve ?
The to@@ ols for sol@@ ving the problems are knowledge and understanding .
"@@ K@@ now the fac@@ ts , but see how they f@@ it in the big picture ."
H@@ ard work and per@@ sist@@ ence — don &apos;t give up — and love and comp@@ assion lead@@ ing to resp@@ ect for all life .
"@@ How many more minutes ? T@@ w@@ o , one ?"
Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : One — one to two .
"@@ J@@ an@@ e G@@ oo@@ d@@ all : T@@ w@@ o , two , I &apos;m going to take two ."
( Laughter ) A@@ re you going to come and d@@ ra@@ g me off ? ( Laughter )
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way — so basically , R@@ o@@ ots and S@@ ho@@ ots is beginning to change young people &apos;s lives ."
It &apos;s what I &apos;m dev@@ ot@@ ing most of my energy to .
"And I believe that a group like this can have a very maj@@ or imp@@ act , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children ."
"And if you take this program out , and give it to your children , they have such a good op@@ port@@ unity to go out and do good , because they &apos;ve got parents like you ."
And it &apos;s been so c@@ lear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .
It &apos;s very enc@@ our@@ aging .
"But the kids do ask me — and this won &apos;t take more than two minutes , I prom@@ ise — the kids say , &quot; &quot; D@@ r@@ . J@@ an@@ e , do you really have hope for the future ?"
"You tra@@ v@@ el , you see all these h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble things happening . &quot; &quot; F@@ ir@@ st@@ ly , the human brain — I don &apos;t need to say anything about that ."
"Now that we know what the problems are around the world , human bra@@ ins like your@@ s are ri@@ sing to sol@@ ve those problems ."
And we &apos;ve tal@@ ked a lot about that .
"S@@ econ@@ dly , the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence of nature ."
"We can dest@@ ro@@ y a ri@@ ver , and we can bring it back to life ."
"We can see a whole are@@ a des@@ ol@@ ated , and it can be br@@ ought back to b@@ loo@@ m again , with time or a little help ."
"And thir@@ dly , the last spe@@ a@@ ker tal@@ ked about — or the spe@@ a@@ ker before last , tal@@ ked about the in@@ dom@@ it@@ able human sp@@ ir@@ it ."
We are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the most ama@@ zing people who do things that seem to be ab@@ solu@@ tely im@@ possible .
"@@ N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a — I take a little piece of li@@ me@@ st@@ one from R@@ ob@@ b@@ en I@@ s@@ land P@@ ri@@ son , where he l@@ abo@@ red for 2@@ 7 years , and came out with so little b@@ it@@ ter@@ ness , he could le@@ ad his people from the h@@ or@@ ro@@ r of ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id without a b@@ loo@@ d@@ b@@ ath ."
"E@@ ven after the 1@@ 1@@ th of S@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ em@@ ber — and I was in New Y@@ or@@ k and I f@@ el@@ t the fear — ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , there was so much human cour@@ age , so much love and so much comp@@ assion ."
"And then as I went around the country after that and f@@ el@@ t the fear — the fear that was lead@@ ing to people feel@@ ing they couldn &apos;t wor@@ ry about the environ@@ ment any more , in case they se@@ em@@ ed not to be pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ic — and I was trying to enc@@ our@@ age them , somebody came up with a little quot@@ ation from M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i , &quot; &quot; If you look back through human history , you see that every evi@@ l re@@ gi@@ me has been over@@ come by good . &quot; &quot; And just after that a woman br@@ ought me this little b@@ ell , and I want to end on this n@@ ote ."
"S@@ he said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re talking about hope and pe@@ ace , r@@ ing this ."
"This b@@ ell is made from me@@ t@@ al from a de@@ f@@ used l@@ and@@ m@@ ine , from the k@@ ill@@ ing fiel@@ ds of P@@ ol P@@ ot — one of the most evi@@ l re@@ g@@ im@@ es in human history — where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the re@@ gi@@ me has cr@@ um@@ bl@@ ed ."
"So , y@@ es , there is hope , and where is the hope ?"
I@@ s it out there with the poli@@ tici@@ ans ?
It &apos;s in our h@@ ands .
It &apos;s in your h@@ ands and my h@@ ands and those of our children .
It &apos;s really up to us .
We &apos;re the ones who can make a difference .
"If we le@@ ad lives where we conscious@@ ly leave the ligh@@ test possible ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ ts , if we bu@@ y the things that are e@@ th@@ ical for us to bu@@ y and don &apos;t bu@@ y the things that are not , we can change the world over@@ night ."
Thank you .
"M@@ ar@@ k Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g , a j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ st was as@@ king him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ st was as@@ king him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l d@@ ying in your front y@@ ard may be more re@@ lev@@ ant to your interest@@ s right now than people d@@ ying in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a W@@ e@@ b bas@@ ed on that idea of re@@ lev@@ ance might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really r@@ ural are@@ a in M@@ a@@ ine , the In@@ ter@@ net me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a connec@@ tion to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democr@@ acy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t p@@ ay att@@ en@@ tion to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first not@@ ic@@ ed this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my F@@ ac@@ e@@ book p@@ age .
"I &apos;m progres@@ sive , poli@@ tic@@ ally — big surpri@@ se — but I &apos;ve always g@@ one out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like hear@@ ing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like seeing what they l@@ ink to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surpri@@ sed when I not@@ ic@@ ed one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had dis@@ appe@@ ared from my F@@ ac@@ e@@ book fe@@ ed .
"And what it tur@@ ned out was going on was that F@@ ac@@ e@@ book was looking at which l@@ in@@ ks I c@@ lic@@ ked on , and it was not@@ ic@@ ing that , actually , I was c@@ lic@@ king more on my li@@ ber@@ al friends &apos; l@@ in@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative friends &apos; l@@ in@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ s@@ ul@@ ting me about it , it had ed@@ ited them out ."
They dis@@ appe@@ ared .
"So F@@ ac@@ e@@ book isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of in@@ vi@@ sible , al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mi@@ c ed@@ iting of the W@@ e@@ b ."
G@@ oo@@ g@@ le &apos;s doing it too .
"If I sear@@ ch for something , and you sear@@ ch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different sear@@ ch res@@ ults ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no st@@ and@@ ard G@@ oo@@ g@@ le any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ n@@ y thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your sear@@ ch res@@ ults are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s scre@@ en sho@@ t .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ ani@@ el &apos;s scre@@ en sho@@ t .
"When you put them si@@ de@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the l@@ in@@ ks to see how different these two p@@ ages are ."
"But when you do read the l@@ in@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mark@@ able ."
D@@ ani@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the prot@@ est@@ s in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t at all in his first p@@ age of G@@ oo@@ g@@ le res@@ ults .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s res@@ ults were ful@@ l of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these res@@ ults are becom@@ ing .
So it &apos;s not just G@@ oo@@ g@@ le and F@@ ac@@ e@@ book e@@ ither .
This is something that &apos;s s@@ wee@@ ping the W@@ e@@ b .
There are a whole h@@ ost of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing this kind of pers@@ on@@ ali@@ zation .
"Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o N@@ e@@ ws , the bi@@ gg@@ est news s@@ ite on the In@@ ter@@ net , is now pers@@ on@@ ali@@ zed — different people get different things ."
"H@@ u@@ ff@@ ing@@ t@@ on P@@ ost , the W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on P@@ ost , the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es — all f@@ li@@ r@@ ting with pers@@ on@@ ali@@ zation in vari@@ ous ways ."
"And this mo@@ ves us very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly to@@ ward a world in which the In@@ ter@@ net is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these f@@ il@@ ters together , you take all these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , you get what I call a f@@ il@@ ter bu@@ b@@ ble ."
"And your f@@ il@@ ter bu@@ b@@ ble is your own pers@@ onal , uni@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ line ."
"And what &apos;s in your f@@ il@@ ter bu@@ b@@ ble dep@@ ends on who you are , and it dep@@ ends on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t deci@@ de what gets in .
"And more import@@ an@@ tly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets ed@@ ited out ."
So one of the problems with the f@@ il@@ ter bu@@ b@@ ble was disc@@ over@@ ed by some resear@@ ch@@ ers at N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ e@@ ue , they just z@@ i@@ p right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ r@@ on M@@ an &quot; &quot; z@@ i@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ iting for Su@@ per@@ man &quot; &quot; can wa@@ it for a really long time ."
What they disc@@ over@@ ed was that in our N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ ues there &apos;s this e@@ p@@ ic str@@ u@@ gg@@ le going on between our future as@@ p@@ ir@@ ational selves and our more imp@@ ul@@ sive present selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has wat@@ ched &quot; &quot; R@@ as@@ h@@ om@@ on , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to wat@@ ch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ ent@@ ur@@ a &quot; &quot; for the f@@ our@@ th time ."
It gi@@ ves us a little bit of J@@ us@@ ti@@ n B@@ i@@ e@@ ber and a little bit of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an .
It gi@@ ves us some information ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les ; it gi@@ ves us some information d@@ ess@@ er@@ t .
"And the chall@@ en@@ ge with these kinds of al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mi@@ c f@@ il@@ ters , these pers@@ on@@ ali@@ zed f@@ il@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re ma@@ in@@ ly looking at what you c@@ lic@@ k on first , it can th@@ row off that bal@@ ance ."
"And instead of a bal@@ anc@@ ed information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by information j@@ un@@ k food ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re seeing is more of a p@@ ass@@ ing of the t@@ or@@ ch from human g@@ ate@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mi@@ c ones .
And the thing is that the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ be@@ d@@ ded e@@ th@@ ics that the ed@@ it@@ ors did .
"So if al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms are going to cur@@ ate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to deci@@ de what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just ke@@ y@@ ed to re@@ lev@@ ance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ fort@@ able or chall@@ eng@@ ing or important — this is what TED does — other poin@@ ts of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were s@@ we@@ ating a lot about their civi@@ c respon@@ si@@ bili@@ ties ."
Th@@ en people not@@ ic@@ ed that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing democr@@ acy if ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens didn &apos;t get a good f@@ low of information , that the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers were cri@@ tical because they were ac@@ ting as the f@@ il@@ ter , and then j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic e@@ th@@ ics develop@@ ed ."
"It wasn &apos;t per@@ f@@ ect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the W@@ e@@ b ."
And we need the new g@@ ate@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s to en@@ co@@ de that kind of respon@@ si@@ bility into the co@@ de that they &apos;re wr@@ iting .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from F@@ ac@@ e@@ book and from G@@ oo@@ g@@ le — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ g@@ ey — people who have hel@@ ped build the W@@ e@@ b as it is , and I &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have en@@ co@@ ded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civi@@ c respon@@ si@@ bility ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re tran@@ sp@@ aren@@ t enough that we can see what the r@@ ul@@ es are that de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine what gets through our f@@ il@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some control so that we can deci@@ de what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the In@@ ter@@ net to be that thing that we all dre@@ am@@ ed of it being .
We need it to con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
We need it to int@@ ro@@ duce us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it le@@ a@@ ves us all is@@ ol@@ ated in a W@@ e@@ b of one .
Thank you .

"S@@ it@@ ting is so incredi@@ bly pre@@ val@@ ent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even oc@@ cu@@ r to us that it &apos;s not o@@ kay ."
"In that way , sit@@ ting has become the s@@ mo@@ king of our generation ."
"O@@ f course there &apos;s health con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences to this , sc@@ ary ones , b@@ es@@ i@@ des the wa@@ ist ."
"Th@@ ings like bre@@ ast cancer and col@@ on cancer are direc@@ tly ti@@ ed to our l@@ ack of physical &#91; acti@@ vity &#93; , T@@ en percent in fact , on both of those ."
"S@@ i@@ x percent for heart disease , se@@ ven percent for t@@ y@@ pe 2 di@@ ab@@ et@@ es , which is what my father died of ."
"Now , any of those st@@ at@@ s should con@@ v@@ ince each of us to get off our du@@ ff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t ."
What did get me mo@@ ving was a social inter@@ action .
"S@@ ome@@ one inv@@ ited me to a me@@ e@@ ting , but couldn &apos;t man@@ age to f@@ it me in to a re@@ g@@ ular sort of con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ e@@ ting , and said , &quot; I have to wal@@ k my do@@ gs tom@@ or@@ row . C@@ ould you come then ? &quot;"
"It se@@ em@@ ed kind of o@@ d@@ d to do , and actually , that first me@@ e@@ ting , I remember thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to hu@@ ff and pu@@ ff d@@ uring this con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own ."
"So instead of going to co@@ ff@@ e@@ e me@@ et@@ ings or flu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent@@ -@@ li@@ t con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ et@@ ings , I ask people to go on a wal@@ king me@@ e@@ ting , to the t@@ un@@ e of 20 to 30 mil@@ es a week ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations , and one always came at the c@@ ost of the other ."
"So now , se@@ ver@@ al hundred of these wal@@ king me@@ et@@ ings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ ir@@ st , there &apos;s this ama@@ zing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that le@@ ads to out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s nature or the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se itself , it cer@@ tain@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ posi@@ tion when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differ@@ ently , whether it &apos;s in govern@@ ance or business or environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to re@@ f@@ ra@@ me those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ talk idea that things bec@@ ame do@@ able and su@@ st@@ ain@@ able and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the tu@@ sh , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom line , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surpri@@ sed at how f@@ res@@ h air dri@@ ves f@@ res@@ h thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ re@@ ly new set of ideas ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
Why consciousness ?
"Well , it &apos;s a cur@@ i@@ ously ne@@ gl@@ ected sub@@ ject , both in our scienti@@ fic and our philosop@@ h@@ ical culture ."
Now why is that cur@@ i@@ ous ?
So consciousness is number one .
"The second reason is that when people do get interest@@ ed in it , as I think they should , they t@@ end to say the most app@@ all@@ ing things ."
"And then , even when they &apos;re not saying app@@ all@@ ing things and they &apos;re really trying to do ser@@ i@@ ous resear@@ ch , well , it &apos;s been s@@ low . P@@ ro@@ gres@@ s has been s@@ low ."
"When I first got interest@@ ed in this , I thought , well , it &apos;s a st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward problem in bio@@ logy ."
"O@@ kay , now why then is this cur@@ i@@ ous rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance and cur@@ i@@ ous h@@ os@@ ti@@ li@@ ty to consciousness ?"
"Well , I think it &apos;s a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of two fe@@ atures of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual culture that like to think they &apos;re op@@ pos@@ ing each other but in fact they share a common set of as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
One fe@@ ature is the tra@@ di@@ tion of religi@@ ous du@@ al@@ ism : Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is not a part of the physical world .
It &apos;s a part of the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al world .
"It b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to the s@@ ou@@ l , and the s@@ ou@@ l is not a part of the physical world ."
"That &apos;s the tra@@ di@@ tion of G@@ od , the s@@ ou@@ l and im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity ."
"E@@ ither it doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some d@@ am@@ n fo@@ ol thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science ."
And I used to get in an ar@@ g@@ ument that really gave me a st@@ om@@ ach@@ ac@@ he .
"S@@ ci@@ ence is ob@@ jec@@ tive , consciousness is sub@@ jec@@ tive , ther@@ e@@ fore there cannot be a science of consciousness ."
"O@@ kay , so these tw@@ in tra@@ di@@ tions are par@@ al@@ y@@ zing us ."
It &apos;s very hard to get out of these tw@@ in tra@@ di@@ tions .
"And I have only one real mess@@ age in this l@@ ec@@ ture , and that is , consciousness is a bio@@ logical ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on like ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ the@@ s@@ is , dig@@ es@@ tion , m@@ it@@ os@@ is — you know all the bio@@ logical ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a — and once you ac@@ cept that , most , though not all , of the hard problems about consciousness simply ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate ."
And I &apos;m going to go through some of them .
"O@@ kay , now I prom@@ is@@ ed you to tell you some of the ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ e@@ ous things said about consciousness ."
One : Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness does not ex@@ ist .
"It &apos;s an ill@@ u@@ sion , like s@@ un@@ se@@ ts ."
S@@ ci@@ ence has sho@@ wn s@@ un@@ se@@ ts and ra@@ in@@ bo@@ ws are ill@@ u@@ sions .
So consciousness is an ill@@ u@@ sion .
"T@@ w@@ o : Well , maybe it ex@@ ists , but it &apos;s really something else ."
It &apos;s a computer program run@@ ning in the brain .
"Th@@ ree : No , the only thing that ex@@ ists is really behavior ."
"It &apos;s em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing how in@@ flu@@ ential behavi@@ or@@ ism was , but I &apos;ll get back to that ."
"And four : M@@ ay@@ be consciousness ex@@ ists , but it can &apos;t make any difference to the world ."
How could sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ality move anything ?
S@@ ome days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot; &quot; No . It goes up wh@@ en@@ ever I d@@ am@@ n well want it to .
O@@ kay . I &apos;m going to tell you how that &apos;s possible .
"Now , I ha@@ ven &apos;t yet given you a defin@@ i@@ tion ."
You can &apos;t do this if you don &apos;t give a defin@@ i@@ tion .
People always say consciousness is very hard to de@@ fine .
I think it &apos;s rather easy to de@@ fine if you &apos;re not trying to give a scienti@@ fic defin@@ i@@ tion .
"We &apos;re not ready for a scienti@@ fic defin@@ i@@ tion , but here &apos;s a com@@ mon@@ -@@ sense defin@@ i@@ tion ."
"It beg@@ ins in the mor@@ ning when you wa@@ ke up from a dre@@ am@@ less s@@ le@@ ep , and it goes on all day until you f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep or die or o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se become un@@ consci@@ ous ."
D@@ re@@ ams are a form of consciousness on this defin@@ i@@ tion .
"Now , that &apos;s the com@@ mon@@ -@@ sense defin@@ i@@ tion . That &apos;s our t@@ ar@@ get ."
"If you &apos;re not talking about that , you &apos;re not talking about consciousness ."
"But they think , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s it , that &apos;s an aw@@ ful problem ."
"@@ How can such a thing ex@@ ist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; And this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosop@@ h@@ y course , this is known as the fam@@ ous min@@ d@@ -@@ body problem ."
I think that has a simple solu@@ tion too . I &apos;m going to give it to you .
"And here it is : A@@ ll of our consci@@ ous st@@ ates , without ex@@ cep@@ tion , are cau@@ sed by low@@ er@@ -@@ level neuro@@ bio@@ logical pro@@ cess@@ es in the brain , and they are reali@@ zed in the brain as high@@ er@@ -@@ level or system fe@@ atures ."
It &apos;s about as my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous as the li@@ qu@@ i@@ d@@ ity of water .
It &apos;s a condi@@ tion that the system is in .
The fam@@ ous min@@ d@@ -@@ body problem is that simple .
A@@ ll right ? But now we get into some har@@ der questions .
"@@ Let &apos;s speci@@ f@@ y the ex@@ act fe@@ atures of consciousness , so that we can then answer those four ob@@ jec@@ tions that I made to it ."
"Well , the first fe@@ ature is , it &apos;s real and ir@@ re@@ duc@@ i@@ ble ."
You can &apos;t get ri@@ d of it .
"You see , the dist@@ inc@@ tion between reality and ill@@ u@@ sion is the dist@@ inc@@ tion between how things conscious@@ ly seem to us and how they really are ."
"It conscious@@ ly seems like there &apos;s — I like the F@@ ren@@ ch &quot; &quot; ar@@ c@@ -@@ en@@ -@@ ci@@ el &quot; &quot; — it seems like there &apos;s an ar@@ ch in the sk@@ y , or it seems like the su@@ n is se@@ tting over the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ."
"It conscious@@ ly seems to us , but that &apos;s not really happening ."
"But for that dist@@ inc@@ tion between how things conscious@@ ly seem and how they really are , you can &apos;t make that dist@@ inc@@ tion for the very exist@@ ence of consciousness , because where the very exist@@ ence of consciousness is con@@ cer@@ ned , if it conscious@@ ly seems to you that you are consci@@ ous , you are consci@@ ous ."
It &apos;s real and ir@@ re@@ duc@@ i@@ ble .
You cannot get ri@@ d of it by sho@@ wing that it &apos;s an ill@@ u@@ sion in a way that you can with other st@@ and@@ ard ill@@ u@@ sions .
"O@@ kay , the second fe@@ ature is this one that has been such a s@@ our@@ ce of tr@@ ou@@ ble to us , and that is , all of our consci@@ ous st@@ ates have this qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative char@@ ac@@ ter to them ."
M@@ ay@@ be we &apos;ll be able to build a consci@@ ous machine .
O@@ kay . A@@ no@@ ther fe@@ ature of consciousness is that it comes in uni@@ fied consci@@ ous fiel@@ ds .
"So I don &apos;t just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my v@@ o@@ ice and the we@@ ight of my sho@@ es against the f@@ lo@@ or , but they oc@@ cu@@ r to me as part of one single great consci@@ ous field that stre@@ t@@ ch@@ es for@@ ward and bac@@ k@@ ward ."
That is the k@@ ey to understanding the en@@ orm@@ ous power of consciousness .
And we have not been able to do that in a ro@@ bo@@ t .
"The dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment of ro@@ bot@@ ics der@@ i@@ ves from the fact that we don &apos;t know how to make a consci@@ ous ro@@ bo@@ t , so we don &apos;t have a machine that can do this kind of thing ."
"O@@ kay , the next fe@@ ature of consciousness , after this mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous uni@@ fied consci@@ ous field , is that it fun@@ c@@ tions cau@@ s@@ ally in our behavior ."
"I gave you a scienti@@ fic de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation by ra@@ is@@ ing my hand , but how is that possible ?"
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material ob@@ jects ?
"Well , I &apos;ll tell you the answer ."
"I mean , we don &apos;t know the deta@@ il@@ ed answer , but we know the bas@@ ic part of the answer , and that is , there is a se@@ qu@@ ence of neur@@ on fir@@ ings , and they ter@@ min@@ ate where the ac@@ et@@ y@@ l@@ cho@@ line is sec@@ re@@ ted at the ax@@ on en@@ d@@ -@@ pl@@ ates of the m@@ ot@@ or neurons ."
"Now , think of what I told you ."
"One and the same ev@@ ent , my consci@@ ous deci@@ sion to ra@@ ise my ar@@ m has a level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it has all of these tou@@ ch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al qu@@ ali@@ ties ."
"Now , what that t@@ ells us is that our tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ar@@ ies for disc@@ us@@ sing these is@@ su@@ es are t@@ ot@@ ally ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
"One and the same ev@@ ent has a level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it &apos;s neuro@@ bio@@ logical , and another level of descri@@ p@@ tion where it &apos;s mental , and that &apos;s a single ev@@ ent , and that &apos;s how nature works . That &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to fun@@ c@@ tion cau@@ s@@ ally ."
"O@@ kay , now with that in mind , with going through these vari@@ ous fe@@ atures of consciousness , let &apos;s go back and answer some of those early ob@@ jec@@ tions ."
"Well , the first one I said was , consciousness doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist , it &apos;s an ill@@ u@@ sion . Well , I &apos;ve already ans@@ wer@@ ed that ."
I don &apos;t think we need to wor@@ ry about that .
"But the second one had an incredi@@ ble in@@ flu@@ ence , and may still be around , and that is , &quot; &quot; Well , if consciousness ex@@ ists , it &apos;s really something else ."
It &apos;s really a dig@@ ital computer program run@@ ning in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
"You get an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m that you can program in a b@@ in@@ ary co@@ de , and that &apos;s the defin@@ ing tra@@ it of the computer program ."
But we know that that &apos;s pu@@ re@@ ly sy@@ n@@ t@@ ac@@ tical . That &apos;s sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c .
We know that ac@@ tual human consciousness has something more than that .
It &apos;s got a cont@@ ent in ad@@ di@@ tion to the sy@@ n@@ ta@@ x .
It &apos;s got a se@@ man@@ tics .
"It cre@@ ates a reality of money , pro@@ per@@ ty , government , marri@@ age , C@@ E@@ R@@ N con@@ fer@@ ences , co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ties and sum@@ m@@ er v@@ ac@@ ations , and all of those are cre@@ ations of consciousness ."
Th@@ e@@ ir exist@@ ence is ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ -@@ rel@@ ative .
It &apos;s only rel@@ ative to consci@@ ous ag@@ ents that a piece of p@@ ap@@ er is money or that a b@@ un@@ ch of buil@@ d@@ ings is a univers@@ ity .
"Now , ask yourself about comp@@ ut@@ ation ."
"I@@ s that ab@@ sol@@ ute , like force and mass and gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational at@@ tr@@ action ?"
O@@ r is it ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ -@@ rel@@ ative ?
"Well , some comp@@ ut@@ ations are in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic ."
I ad@@ d two pl@@ us two to get four .
That &apos;s going on no matter what any@@ body thin@@ ks .
"But when I ha@@ u@@ l out my po@@ c@@ k@@ et cal@@ cul@@ at@@ or and do the cal@@ cul@@ ation , the only in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is the electr@@ on@@ ic cir@@ cu@@ it and its behavior ."
That &apos;s the only ab@@ sol@@ ute ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
C@@ om@@ pu@@ t@@ ation only ex@@ ists rel@@ ative to consciousness .
"E@@ ither a consci@@ ous ag@@ ent is car@@ r@@ ying out the comp@@ ut@@ ation , or he &apos;s got a piece of mach@@ in@@ ery that ad@@ m@@ its of a comp@@ ut@@ ational inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation ."
Now that doesn &apos;t mean comp@@ ut@@ ation is ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary .
I sp@@ ent a lot of money on this har@@ d@@ w@@ are .
That &apos;s a bad pu@@ n on ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity and sub@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity .
"You can make ob@@ jec@@ tive cl@@ a@@ im@@ s about a dom@@ ain that is sub@@ jec@@ tive in its mo@@ de of exist@@ ence , and in@@ de@@ ed that &apos;s what neuro@@ logi@@ sts do ."
Y@@ our mental st@@ ates are i@@ den@@ tical with your behavior ?
You &apos;re giving up on 3@@ 00 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
Thank you very much .

I gre@@ w up in a very small country to@@ wn in V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ a .
"I had a very norm@@ al , low@@ -@@ k@@ ey kind of up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing ."
"I went to school , I h@@ un@@ g out with my friends , I f@@ ought with my youn@@ ger sist@@ ers ."
It was all very norm@@ al .
"And my parents said , &quot; &quot; H@@ m , that &apos;s really n@@ ice , but there &apos;s kind of one g@@ lar@@ ing problem with that ."
"S@@ he ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t actually achi@@ ev@@ ed anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they were right , you know ."
"Y@@ eah , I know . What a con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion ."
"But they were right , you know ."
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that was out of the ordin@@ ary at all .
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that could be consi@@ der@@ ed an achi@@ ev@@ ement if you took dis@@ ability out of the equ@@ ation .
"Y@@ ear@@ s later , I was on my second teach@@ ing r@@ ound in a M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 le@@ g@@ al stu@@ dies cl@@ ass when this bo@@ y put up his hand and said , &quot; H@@ ey mis@@ s , when are you going to start doing your spe@@ ec@@ h ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , like , your moti@@ v@@ ational spe@@ a@@ king ."
And that &apos;s when it d@@ aw@@ ned on me : This k@@ id had only ever experienc@@ ed dis@@ ab@@ led people as ob@@ jects of insp@@ ir@@ ation .
"We are not , to this k@@ id — and it &apos;s not his f@@ au@@ l@@ t , I mean , that &apos;s true for many of us ."
"For lots of us , dis@@ ab@@ led people are not our teachers or our doc@@ tors or our man@@ ic@@ ur@@ ists ."
We &apos;re not real people . We are there to insp@@ ire .
"Well , la@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id I &apos;m going to dis@@ ap@@ point you dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally ."
I am not here to insp@@ ire you .
"It &apos;s a bad thing , and to live with a dis@@ ability makes you ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ onal ."
"It &apos;s not a bad thing , and it doesn &apos;t make you ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ onal ."
"And in the past few years , we &apos;ve been able to pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate this li@@ e even f@@ ur@@ ther vi@@ a social me@@ dia ."
You may have seen imag@@ es like this one : &quot; The only dis@@ ability in life is a bad at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de . &quot;
O@@ r this one : &quot; &quot; Y@@ our exc@@ use is inv@@ al@@ id . &quot; &quot; In@@ de@@ ed .
"O@@ r this one : &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore you qu@@ it , try ! &quot; &quot; Th@@ ese are just a couple of exam@@ pl@@ es , but there are a lot of these imag@@ es out there ."
You might have seen a child run@@ ning on car@@ b@@ on fi@@ ber pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic le@@ gs .
"And these imag@@ es , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call insp@@ ir@@ ation por@@ n ."
"( Laughter ) And I use the ter@@ m por@@ n de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately , because they ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ y one group of people for the b@@ ene@@ f@@ it of another group of people ."
"So in this case , we &apos;re ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ ying dis@@ ab@@ led people for the b@@ ene@@ f@@ it of n@@ on@@ dis@@ ab@@ led people ."
"The pur@@ pose of these imag@@ es is to insp@@ ire you , to moti@@ v@@ ate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; &quot; Well , ho@@ w@@ ever bad my life is , it could be wor@@ se ."
I could be that person . &quot; &quot; But what if you are that person ?
They were just kind of con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating me for man@@ aging to get up in the mor@@ ning and remember my own name . ( Laughter ) And it is ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ ying .
"Th@@ ese imag@@ es , those imag@@ es ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ y dis@@ ab@@ led people for the b@@ ene@@ f@@ it of n@@ on@@ dis@@ ab@@ led people ."
"They are there so that you can look at them and think that things are@@ n &apos;t so bad for you , to put your wor@@ ri@@ es into per@@ spec@@ tive ."
And life as a dis@@ ab@@ led person is actually some@@ what difficult .
We do over@@ come some things .
But the things that we &apos;re over@@ coming are not the things that you think they are .
They are not things to do with our bo@@ dies .
"I use the ter@@ m &quot; &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led people &quot; &quot; quite de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately , because I sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to what &apos;s called the social mo@@ de@@ l of dis@@ ability , which t@@ ells us that we are more dis@@ ab@@ led by the society that we live in than by our bo@@ dies and our di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es ."
So I have li@@ ved in this body a long time .
I &apos;m quite f@@ on@@ d of it .
"It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its cap@@ ac@@ ity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pic@@ tures as well ."
They &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordin@@ ary .
They are just using their bo@@ dies to the best of their cap@@ ac@@ ity .
"So is it really fa@@ ir to ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ f@@ y them in the way that we do , to share those imag@@ es ?"
"@@ People , when they say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re an insp@@ ir@@ ation , &quot; &quot; they mean it as a comp@@ li@@ ment ."
And I know why it happens .
"It &apos;s because of the li@@ e , it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been so@@ ld this li@@ e that dis@@ ability makes you ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ onal ."
And it h@@ on@@ est@@ ly doesn &apos;t .
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
"You know , I &apos;m up here b@@ ag@@ g@@ ing out insp@@ ir@@ ation , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; J@@ e@@ e@@ z , St@@ ell@@ a , are@@ n &apos;t you insp@@ i@@ red sometimes by some things ? &quot; &quot; And the thing is , I am ."
I learn from other dis@@ ab@@ led people all the time .
"I &apos;m learning not that I am l@@ uc@@ ki@@ er than them , though ."
G@@ en@@ i@@ us .
"We are learning from each others &apos; stre@@ ng@@ th and en@@ d@@ ur@@ ance , not against our bo@@ dies and our di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ es , but against a world that ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ ali@@ z@@ es and ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ fi@@ es us ."
I really think that this li@@ e that we &apos;ve been so@@ ld about dis@@ ability is the gre@@ at@@ est in@@ j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce .
It makes life hard for us .
"And that quot@@ e , &quot; &quot; The only dis@@ ability in life is a bad at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , &quot; &quot; the reason that that &apos;s b@@ ul@@ l@@ sh@@ it is because it &apos;s just not true , because of the social mo@@ de@@ l of dis@@ ability ."
No amount of sm@@ il@@ ing at a f@@ light of sta@@ ir@@ s has ever made it turn into a r@@ am@@ p .
N@@ ever . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) S@@ mil@@ ing at a tel@@ evi@@ sion scre@@ en isn &apos;t going to make cl@@ os@@ ed cap@@ tions appe@@ ar for people who are de@@ a@@ f .
No amount of st@@ anding in the middle of a bo@@ o@@ k@@ sho@@ p and radi@@ ating a posi@@ tive at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de is going to turn all those bo@@ o@@ ks into bra@@ il@@ le .
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
"I really want to live in a world where dis@@ ability is not the ex@@ cep@@ tion , but the n@@ or@@ m ."
I want to live in a world where a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old gir@@ l sit@@ ting in her be@@ d@@ room wat@@ ch@@ ing &quot; &quot; B@@ u@@ ff@@ y the V@@ am@@ p@@ ire S@@ l@@ ay@@ er &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t re@@ fer@@ red to as achi@@ ev@@ ing anything because she &apos;s doing it sit@@ ting down . I want to live in a world
where we don &apos;t have such low exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of dis@@ ab@@ led people that we are con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated for getting out of bed and remem@@ b@@ ering our own nam@@ es in the mor@@ ning .
"I want to live in a world where we value gen@@ u@@ ine achi@@ ev@@ ement for dis@@ ab@@ led people , and I want to live in a world where a k@@ id in year 11 in a M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school is not one bit surpri@@ sed that his new teacher is a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ er ."
"D@@ is@@ ability doesn &apos;t make you ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ onal , but ques@@ tion@@ ing what you think you know about it does ."

"So until only very rec@@ ently in our ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary history , there was har@@ dly a need to learn how to come home from war , because we never really did ."
But just imagine for a moment what this must feel like .
&quot; &quot; M@@ in@@ d@@ f@@ uc@@ k &quot; &quot; is the most common ter@@ m .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the most common ter@@ m I &apos;ve heard to descri@@ be that experience .
"Now , the same ho@@ l@@ ds for tr@@ ain@@ ing@@ -@@ bas@@ ed tre@@ at@@ ments ."
"The first of these tre@@ at@@ ments is cogni@@ tive ther@@ ap@@ y , and this is a kind of mental rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation ."
"So when you try to over@@ l@@ ay that mind f@@ ra@@ me on@@ to a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ time environ@@ ment , you get problems ."
You beg@@ in dro@@ w@@ ning in wor@@ ri@@ es about d@@ ang@@ ers that are@@ n &apos;t present .
You beg@@ in not tru@@ st@@ ing family or friends .
Wh@@ ich is not to say there are no d@@ ang@@ ers in civi@@ li@@ an life ; there are .
So we never ad@@ vi@@ se ve@@ ter@@ ans to turn off cau@@ tion completely .
"We do tr@@ ain them , ho@@ w@@ ever , to ad@@ just cau@@ tion ac@@ cor@@ ding to where they are ."
O@@ ut to d@@ in@@ ner with family ?
"We tr@@ ain ve@@ ter@@ ans to be fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely r@@ ational , to syst@@ em@@ atic@@ ally g@@ au@@ ge the ac@@ tual st@@ atis@@ tical prob@@ ability of en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing , say , an I@@ E@@ D here in pe@@ ac@@ e@@ time America ."
This was the tre@@ at@@ ment that he ch@@ ose .
"And , cri@@ tic@@ ally — st@@ ay@@ ing in these environ@@ ments ."
"Now , at first he was very an@@ x@@ i@@ ous ."
"And he wanted to leave , but he didn &apos;t ."
"He remem@@ ber@@ ed his tr@@ ain@@ ing in the Mar@@ ine C@@ or@@ ps , and he pu@@ shed through his dis@@ com@@ for@@ t ."
"He also li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to rec@@ ord@@ ings of his com@@ b@@ at experi@@ ences , over and over and over ."
He li@@ st@@ en@@ ed until those me@@ mor@@ ies no longer gener@@ ated any an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty .
"@@ V@@ e@@ ter@@ ans will always remember their tr@@ au@@ m@@ atic experi@@ ences , but with enough pr@@ acti@@ ce , those me@@ mor@@ ies are no longer as ra@@ w or as pain@@ ful as they once were ."
"They don &apos;t feel emoti@@ on@@ ally like they just happened y@@ est@@ er@@ day , and that is an im@@ men@@ se@@ ly better place to be ."
"And , like any tr@@ ain@@ ing , it may not work for everybody ."
And there are tr@@ ust is@@ su@@ es .
"S@@ ome@@ times I &apos;m asked , &quot; If you ha@@ ven &apos;t been there , D@@ o@@ c , how can you help me ? &quot;"
"But at the point of re@@ tur@@ ning to civi@@ li@@ an life , you do not requ@@ ire somebody who &apos;s been there ."
You don &apos;t requ@@ ire tr@@ ain@@ ing for oper@@ ations on the b@@ att@@ le@@ field ; you requ@@ ire tr@@ ain@@ ing on how to come home .
"For the past 10 years of my work , I have been ex@@ posed to deta@@ il@@ ed ac@@ coun@@ ts of the wor@@ st experi@@ ences that you can imagine , d@@ a@@ ily ."
And it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t always been easy .
There have been times where I have just f@@ el@@ t my heart bre@@ ak or that I &apos;ve ab@@ sor@@ bed too much .
I see people &apos;s lives trans@@ form .
"C@@ ar@@ lo@@ s can now en@@ jo@@ y out@@ ings with his gr@@ and@@ children , which is something he couldn &apos;t even do with his own children ."
"And what &apos;s ama@@ zing to me is that after 4@@ 3 years of suff@@ ering , it only took him 10 wee@@ ks of int@@ en@@ se tr@@ ain@@ ing to get his life back ."
Because ...
"@@ this life is sh@@ ort , and if you are fort@@ un@@ ate enough to have survi@@ ved war or any kind of tr@@ au@@ m@@ atic experience , you o@@ we it to yourself to live your life well ."
"Now , the best way of en@@ ding human suff@@ ering cau@@ sed by war is to never go to war ."
"@@ Un@@ til we are , the mental suff@@ ering that we create in our s@@ ons and in our d@@ augh@@ ters when we s@@ end them off to fi@@ ght can be al@@ le@@ vi@@ ated ."
"This much , we o@@ we them ."
Thank you .

I &apos;m just going to play a bri@@ e@@ f vide@@ o c@@ li@@ p .

"He wouldn &apos;t re@@ ve@@ al the ex@@ act number of bot@@ t@@ les , he would not re@@ ve@@ al exactly where the building was and he would not re@@ ve@@ al exactly who ow@@ ned the building ."
The my@@ st@@ ery per@@ si@@ sted for about 20 years .
It fin@@ ally beg@@ an to get res@@ ol@@ ved in 200@@ 5 because of this guy .
"B@@ ill K@@ o@@ ch is a F@@ l@@ ori@@ d@@ a b@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ ire who ow@@ ns four of the J@@ eff@@ er@@ son bot@@ t@@ les , and he bec@@ ame su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
And he en@@ ded up sp@@ en@@ ding over a million dollars and h@@ ir@@ ing ex@@ -@@ F@@ B@@ I and ex@@ -@@ S@@ c@@ ot@@ land Y@@ ard ag@@ ents to try to get to the bot@@ tom of this .
"There &apos;s now am@@ ple evidence that H@@ ar@@ dy R@@ o@@ den@@ st@@ oc@@ k is a c@@ on man , and that the J@@ eff@@ er@@ son bot@@ t@@ les were fa@@ kes ."
"But for those 20 years , an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able number of really em@@ in@@ ent and ac@@ comp@@ li@@ shed fi@@ gu@@ res in the w@@ ine world were sort of d@@ ra@@ wn into the or@@ bit of these bot@@ t@@ les ."
"I think they wanted to believe that the most exp@@ en@@ sive bot@@ t@@ le of w@@ ine in the world must be the best bot@@ t@@ le of w@@ ine in the world , must be the ra@@ rest bot@@ t@@ le of w@@ ine in the world ."
"I bec@@ ame increas@@ ing@@ ly , kind of v@@ o@@ ye@@ ur@@ is@@ tic@@ ally interest@@ ed in the question of you know , why do people sp@@ end these crazy amoun@@ ts of money , not only on w@@ ine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?"
"So , I decided to em@@ bar@@ k on a qu@@ est ."
"W@@ ith the gener@@ ous bac@@ king of a mag@@ az@@ ine I wr@@ ite for sometimes , I decided to s@@ am@@ ple the very best , or most exp@@ en@@ sive , or most co@@ ve@@ ted it@@ e@@ m in about a do@@ z@@ en cat@@ eg@@ ories , which was a very gr@@ u@@ el@@ ing qu@@ est , as you can imagine ."
( Laughter ) This was the first one .
A lot of the K@@ o@@ be be@@ e@@ f that you see in the U.@@ S@@ . is not the real thing .
"It may come from W@@ ag@@ y@@ u c@@ att@@ le , but it &apos;s not from the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al , Ap@@ p@@ al@@ achi@@ an H@@ y@@ o@@ go P@@ re@@ f@@ ec@@ ture in Jap@@ an ."

"I went there , and I or@@ der@@ ed the e@@ igh@@ t-@@ oun@@ ce ri@@ b ey@@ e for 1@@ 60 dollars ."
"And it ar@@ ri@@ ved , and it was t@@ iny ."
And I was ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ ed .
"It was like , 1@@ 60 dollars for this ?"
"And then I took a b@@ ite , and I wi@@ shed that it was t@@ in@@ ier , because K@@ o@@ be be@@ e@@ f is so r@@ ich ."
It &apos;s like fo@@ i@@ e gr@@ as — it &apos;s not even like ste@@ ak .
I almost couldn &apos;t fin@@ ish it .
I was really happy when I was done .
"( Laughter ) Now , the ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ her who took the pic@@ tures for this pro@@ ject for some reason posed his do@@ g in a lot of them , so that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to see this rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ing char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"Wh@@ ich , I gu@@ ess , you know , comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ates to you that I did not think that one was really wor@@ th the pr@@ ice ."
Wh@@ ite tru@@ ff@@ les .
One of the most exp@@ en@@ sive l@@ u@@ x@@ ury fo@@ o@@ ds by we@@ ight in the world .
"T@@ o try this , I went to a M@@ ari@@ o B@@ at@@ al@@ i re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an — D@@ el P@@ os@@ to ."

And the char@@ m of white tru@@ ff@@ les is in their ar@@ om@@ a .

It &apos;s in the sm@@ ell .

There were se@@ ver@@ al — se@@ ver@@ al of these it@@ ems were dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ments .
( Laughter ) Y@@ eah .
The mag@@ az@@ ine wouldn &apos;t p@@ ay for me to go there .
"( Laughter ) They did give me a t@@ our , though ."
"And this h@@ ot@@ el su@@ ite is 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 00 s@@ qu@@ are fe@@ et ."
It has 3@@ 6@@ 0-@@ de@@ gre@@ e vie@@ ws .
It has four bal@@ con@@ ies .
It was desig@@ ned by the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect I@@ .@@ M@@ . Pe@@ i .
It comes with its own R@@ ol@@ ls R@@ o@@ y@@ ce and dri@@ ver .
It comes with its own w@@ ine c@@ ell@@ ar that you can d@@ ra@@ w f@@ re@@ ely from .

"@@ 3@@ 0,000 dollars for a night in a h@@ ot@@ el ."
"This is so@@ ap that &apos;s made from si@@ l@@ ver n@@ an@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ les , which have an@@ ti@@ bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al pro@@ per@@ ties ."

"I don &apos;t think that whether or not you &apos;re getting a comp@@ li@@ ment should be the test of something &apos;s value , but I think in the case of a f@@ as@@ hi@@ on it@@ e@@ m , an ar@@ tic@@ le of c@@ lo@@ thing , that &apos;s a reas@@ on@@ able b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ k ."

( Laughter ) Thank you .
A@@ r@@ man@@ do M@@ an@@ n@@ i is a form@@ er f@@ il@@ m@@ ma@@ ker who makes this o@@ live o@@ il from an o@@ live that gro@@ ws on a single s@@ lo@@ pe in T@@ u@@ sc@@ any .

I did a bl@@ ind ta@@ st@@ e test of this with 20 people and five other o@@ live o@@ il@@ s .
It ta@@ sted fine . It ta@@ sted interesting .
"It was very gre@@ en , it was very pe@@ p@@ per@@ y ."
"But in the bl@@ ind ta@@ st@@ e test , it came in last ."
The o@@ live o@@ il that came in first was actually a bot@@ t@@ le of W@@ hole F@@ oo@@ ds 3@@ 6@@ 5 o@@ live o@@ il which had been ox@@ i@@ di@@ zing next to my st@@ o@@ ve for six months .
( Laughter ) A rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ing the@@ me is that a lot of these things are from Jap@@ an — you &apos;ll start to not@@ ice .
"I don &apos;t play go@@ l@@ f , so I couldn &apos;t actually ro@@ ad test these , but I did inter@@ view a guy who ow@@ ns them ."
"E@@ ven the people who market these clu@@ b@@ s — I mean , they &apos;ll say these have four ax@@ is s@@ ha@@ f@@ ts which min@@ im@@ i@@ ze l@@ oss of clu@@ b spe@@ ed and ther@@ e@@ by dri@@ ve the b@@ all f@@ ar@@ ther — but they &apos;ll say , look , you know , you &apos;re not getting 5@@ 7@@ ,000 dollars wor@@ th of per@@ form@@ ance from these clu@@ b@@ s ."
"You &apos;re p@@ ay@@ ing for the bl@@ ing , that they &apos;re enc@@ ru@@ sted with go@@ ld and pl@@ at@@ in@@ um ."
"The guy who I inter@@ vie@@ wed who ow@@ ns them did say that he &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten a lot of ple@@ as@@ ure out of them , so ..@@ ."
"O@@ h , ye@@ ah , you know this one ?"
This is a co@@ ff@@ e@@ e made from a very un@@ u@@ su@@ al process .
The l@@ u@@ wa@@ k is an A@@ si@@ an P@@ al@@ m C@@ i@@ v@@ et .
"It &apos;s a c@@ at that lives in tre@@ es , and at night it comes down and it pro@@ w@@ ls the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e plan@@ t@@ ations ."
"And app@@ aren@@ tly it &apos;s a very pic@@ k@@ y e@@ ater and it , you know , h@@ ones in on only the ri@@ p@@ est co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ch@@ er@@ ri@@ es ."
"And then an en@@ z@@ y@@ me in its dig@@ es@@ tive tr@@ act le@@ ech@@ es into the be@@ ans , and people with the un@@ en@@ vi@@ able job of coll@@ ec@@ ting these cat@@ s &apos; le@@ av@@ ings then go through the fore@@ st coll@@ ec@@ ting the , you know , res@@ ults and pro@@ cess@@ ing it into co@@ ff@@ e@@ e — al@@ though you actually can bu@@ y it in the un@@ pro@@ cess@@ ed form ."
That &apos;s right .
Un@@ rel@@ ate@@ dly — ( Laughter ) Jap@@ an is doing crazy things with to@@ il@@ ets . ( Laughter )
There is now a to@@ il@@ et that has an M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er in it .
There &apos;s one with a fr@@ ag@@ r@@ ance di@@ sp@@ en@@ s@@ er .
There &apos;s one that actually anal@@ y@@ z@@ es the cont@@ ents of the bo@@ w@@ l and trans@@ m@@ its the res@@ ults vi@@ a e@@ ma@@ il to your doc@@ tor .
It &apos;s almost like a home medic@@ al center — and that is the direc@@ tion that Jap@@ an@@ ese to@@ il@@ et technology is he@@ ad@@ ing in .
"This one does not have those b@@ ells and wh@@ ist@@ les , but for p@@ ure fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ality it &apos;s pretty much the best — the N@@ e@@ o@@ rest 6@@ 00 ."
"And to try this — I couldn &apos;t get a lo@@ an@@ er , but I did go into the M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an sho@@ w@@ room of the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ re@@ r , T@@ ot@@ o , and they have a b@@ ath@@ room off of the sho@@ w@@ room that you can use , which I used ."
"It &apos;s fully au@@ tom@@ ated — you wal@@ k to@@ wards it , and the se@@ at li@@ f@@ ts ."
The se@@ at is pre@@ he@@ ated .
There &apos;s a water j@@ et that c@@ le@@ ans you .
There &apos;s an air j@@ et that dri@@ es you .
"You get up , it flu@@ sh@@ es by itself ."
"The li@@ d cl@@ os@@ es , it self-@@ c@@ le@@ ans ."
"@@ Not only is it a techno@@ logical le@@ ap for@@ ward , but I really do believe it &apos;s a bit of a cul@@ tur@@ al le@@ ap for@@ ward ."
"I mean , a no h@@ ands , no to@@ il@@ et p@@ ap@@ er to@@ il@@ et ."
And I want to get one of these .
( Laughter ) This was another one I could not get a lo@@ an@@ er of .
T@@ om C@@ ru@@ ise sup@@ pos@@ e@@ dly ow@@ ns this bed .
"There &apos;s a little pl@@ a@@ qu@@ e on the end that , you know , each bu@@ y@@ er gets their name en@@ gra@@ ved on it ."
"( Laughter ) T@@ o try this one , the ma@@ ker of it let me and my wi@@ fe sp@@ end the night in the M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an sho@@ w@@ room ."
"@@ L@@ igh@@ ts g@@ lar@@ ing in off the stre@@ et , and we had to h@@ ire a sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ard and all these things ."
"But any@@ way , we had a great night &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep ."
And you sp@@ end a thir@@ d of your life in bed .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a de@@ al .
( Laughter ) This was a fu@@ n one .
This is the fa@@ st@@ est stre@@ et@@ -@@ le@@ g@@ al c@@ ar in the world and the most exp@@ en@@ sive produc@@ tion c@@ ar .
"I got to dri@@ ve this with a ch@@ ap@@ er@@ one from the comp@@ any , a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal r@@ ace c@@ ar dri@@ ver , and we dro@@ ve around the c@@ any@@ ons outside of Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es and down on the P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic C@@ o@@ ast H@@ igh@@ way ."
"And , you know , when we pul@@ led up to a st@@ op@@ light the people in the ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent car@@ s kind of gave us resp@@ ec@@ t@@ ful no@@ ds ."
And it was really ama@@ zing .
It was such a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ri@@ de .
"M@@ ost of the car@@ s that I dri@@ ve , if I get up to 80 they start to r@@ att@@ le ."
"I s@@ w@@ it@@ ched lan@@ es on the high@@ way and the dri@@ ver , this ch@@ ap@@ er@@ one , said , &quot; You know , you were just going 1@@ 10 mil@@ es an h@@ our . &quot;"
"And I had no idea that I was one of those ob@@ no@@ x@@ i@@ ous people you oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally see we@@ a@@ ving in and out of tra@@ ff@@ ic , because it was just that s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
"And if I was a b@@ illi@@ on@@ a@@ ire , I would get one ."
( Laughter ) This is a completely gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ous vide@@ o I &apos;m just going to show of one of the p@@ it@@ f@@ all@@ s of adv@@ anc@@ ed technology .
This is T@@ om C@@ ru@@ ise ar@@ ri@@ ving at the &quot; &quot; M@@ is@@ sion : I@@ m@@ possible I@@ I@@ I &quot; &quot; pre@@ mi@@ ere .
"When he tries to op@@ en the do@@ or , you could call it &quot; &quot; M@@ is@@ sion : I@@ m@@ possible I@@ V . &quot; &quot; There was one ob@@ ject that I could not get my h@@ ands on , and that was the 19@@ 4@@ 7 Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c ."
The &apos; 4@@ 7 Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c is probably the most my@@ th@@ o@@ logi@@ zed w@@ ine of the 20@@ th century .
And Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c is kind of an un@@ u@@ su@@ al w@@ ine for B@@ or@@ de@@ au@@ x in having a si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant per@@ cent@@ age of the C@@ ab@@ er@@ net F@@ ran@@ c grap@@ e .
"And 19@@ 4@@ 7 was a le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary v@@ int@@ age , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in the right b@@ ank of B@@ or@@ de@@ au@@ x ."
"And just together , that v@@ int@@ age and that ch@@ ate@@ a@@ u took on this a@@ ur@@ a that even@@ tually kind of gave it this cul@@ ti@@ sh fol@@ lowing ."
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
What there is of it left you don &apos;t know if it &apos;s real — it &apos;s consi@@ der@@ ed to be the most fa@@ ked w@@ ine in the world .
Not that many people are looking to po@@ p op@@ en their one re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing bot@@ t@@ le for a j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ st .
"So , I &apos;d about given up trying to get my h@@ ands on one of these ."
"I &apos;d put out feel@@ ers to re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers , to au@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ ers , and it was coming up emp@@ ty ."
And then I got an e@@ ma@@ il from a guy nam@@ ed B@@ i@@ p@@ in D@@ es@@ a@@ i .
"B@@ i@@ p@@ in D@@ es@@ a@@ i is a U.@@ C@@ . R@@ i@@ ver@@ side the@@ o@@ re@@ tical phys@@ ici@@ st who also happens to be the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent organi@@ z@@ er of r@@ are w@@ ine ta@@ st@@ ings , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a ta@@ st@@ ing coming up where we &apos;re going to ser@@ ve the &apos; 4@@ 7 Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c . &quot; &quot; And it was going to be a d@@ ou@@ ble ver@@ tical — it was going to be 30 v@@ int@@ ages of Ch@@ ev@@ al B@@ lan@@ c , and 30 v@@ int@@ ages of Y@@ qu@@ e@@ m ."
And it was an inv@@ it@@ ation you do not re@@ fu@@ se .
I went .
"It was three days , four me@@ als ."
"And at l@@ un@@ ch on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day , we op@@ en@@ ed the &apos; 4@@ 7 ."
"And you know , it had this fr@@ ag@@ r@@ ant so@@ f@@ t@@ ness , and it sm@@ ell@@ ed a little bit of l@@ in@@ se@@ ed o@@ il ."
"And then I ta@@ sted it , and it , you know , had this kind of un@@ c@@ tu@@ ous , por@@ ty r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness , which is char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic of that w@@ ine — that it sort of re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ es port in a lot of ways ."
"There were people at my t@@ able who thought it was , you know , f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic ."
There were some people who were a little less im@@ pres@@ sed .
And I wasn &apos;t that im@@ pres@@ sed .
"And I don &apos;t — call my p@@ al@@ ate a p@@ hi@@ li@@ st@@ ine p@@ al@@ ate — so it doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily mean something that I wasn &apos;t im@@ pres@@ sed , but I was not the only one there who had that re@@ action ."
And it wasn &apos;t just to that w@@ ine .
"A@@ n@@ y one of the w@@ ines ser@@ ved at this ta@@ st@@ ing , if I &apos;d been ser@@ ved it at a d@@ in@@ ner par@@ ty , it would have been , you know , the w@@ ine experience of my li@@ fe@@ time , and incredi@@ bly me@@ mor@@ able ."
"But dr@@ in@@ king 60 great w@@ ines over three days , they all just bl@@ ur@@ red together , and it bec@@ ame almost a gr@@ u@@ el@@ ing experience ."
And I just wanted to fin@@ ish by m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing a very interesting study which came out ear@@ li@@ er this year from some resear@@ ch@@ ers at St@@ an@@ for@@ d and C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h .
"And they gave sub@@ jects the same w@@ ine , l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed with different pr@@ ice t@@ ag@@ s ."
"A lot of people , you know , said that they li@@ ked the more exp@@ en@@ sive w@@ ine more — it was the same w@@ ine , but they thought it was a different one that was more exp@@ en@@ sive ."
"But what was un@@ exp@@ ected was that these resear@@ ch@@ ers did M@@ R@@ I brain imag@@ ing while the people were dr@@ in@@ king the w@@ ine , and not only did they say they en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed the more exp@@ en@@ si@@ vely l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed w@@ ine more — their brain actually re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed as experienc@@ ing more ple@@ as@@ ure from the same w@@ ine when it was l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed with a high@@ er pr@@ ice ta@@ g ."
Thank you .
How do you ob@@ ser@@ ve something you can &apos;t see ?
This is the bas@@ ic question of somebody who &apos;s interest@@ ed in fin@@ ding and stud@@ ying black ho@@ les .
"Because black ho@@ les are ob@@ jects wh@@ ose pul@@ l of gra@@ vity is so int@@ en@@ se that nothing can es@@ cap@@ e it , not even light , so you can &apos;t see it direc@@ tly ."
"So , my story today about black ho@@ les is about one particular black hole ."
"I &apos;m interest@@ ed in fin@@ ding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call &quot; &quot; super@@ massive &quot; &quot; black hole at the center of our galaxy ."
And the reason this is interesting is that it gi@@ ves us an op@@ port@@ unity to pro@@ ve whether or not these ex@@ ot@@ ic ob@@ jects really ex@@ ist .
"And second , it gi@@ ves us the op@@ port@@ unity to understand how these super@@ massive black ho@@ les inter@@ act with their environ@@ ment , and to understand how they aff@@ ect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they re@@ side in ."
"So , to beg@@ in with , we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the pro@@ of of a black hole ."
"So , what is a black hole ?"
"Well , in many ways a black hole is an incredi@@ bly simple ob@@ ject , because there are only three char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics that you can descri@@ be : the mass , the sp@@ in , and the char@@ ge ."
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
"So , in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple ob@@ ject ."
"But in another sense , it &apos;s an incredi@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated ob@@ ject that we need relati@@ vely ex@@ ot@@ ic physics to descri@@ be , and in some sense re@@ pres@@ ents the bre@@ ak@@ down of our physical understanding of the universe ."
"But today , the way I want you to understand a black hole , for the pro@@ of of a black hole , is to think of it as an ob@@ ject wh@@ ose mass is con@@ fin@@ ed to z@@ er@@ o v@@ olu@@ me ."
"So , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that I &apos;m going to talk to you about an ob@@ ject that &apos;s super@@ massive , and I &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size ."
"So , this is a little tr@@ ic@@ k@@ y ."
"But fort@@ un@@ ately there is a fin@@ ite size that you can see , and that &apos;s known as the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
And that &apos;s nam@@ ed after the guy who recogni@@ zed why it was such an important radi@@ us .
"This is a vir@@ tual radi@@ us , not reality ; the black hole has no size ."
So why is it so important ?
It &apos;s important because it t@@ ells us that any ob@@ ject can become a black hole .
"That means you , your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , your c@@ ell@@ ph@@ one , the au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um can become a black hole if you can fig@@ ure out how to com@@ pres@@ s it down to the size of the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
"A@@ t that point , what &apos;s going to happen ?"
A@@ t that point gra@@ vity w@@ ins .
G@@ ra@@ vity w@@ ins over all other known for@@ ces .
And the ob@@ ject is for@@ c@@ ed to contin@@ ue to coll@@ ap@@ se to an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely small ob@@ ject .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
"So , if I were to com@@ pres@@ s the Earth down to the size of a su@@ g@@ ar cu@@ be , it would become a black hole , because the size of a su@@ g@@ ar cu@@ be is its S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
"Now , the k@@ ey here is to fig@@ ure out what that S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is ."
And it turns out that it &apos;s actually pretty simple to fig@@ ure out .
It dep@@ ends only on the mass of the ob@@ ject .
B@@ ig@@ ger ob@@ jects have big@@ ger S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ i .
S@@ m@@ all@@ er ob@@ jects have sm@@ all@@ er S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ i .
"So , if I were to take the su@@ n and com@@ pres@@ s it down to the sc@@ ale of the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of O@@ x@@ for@@ d , it would become a black hole ."
"So , now we know what a S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is ."
"And it &apos;s actually quite a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ cept , because it t@@ ells us not only when a black hole will form , but it also gi@@ ves us the k@@ ey el@@ em@@ ents for the pro@@ of of a black hole ."
I only need two things .
"I need to understand the mass of the ob@@ ject I &apos;m cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing is a black hole , and what its S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is ."
"And since the mass de@@ ter@@ min@@ es the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us , there is actually only one thing I really need to know ."
"So , my job in con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some ob@@ ject that &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ed to within its S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us ."
And your job today is to be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
"O@@ kay , so , I &apos;m going to talk about no ordin@@ ary black hole ; I &apos;m going to talk about super@@ massive black ho@@ les ."
"So , I wanted to say a few words about what an ordin@@ ary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordin@@ ary black hole ."
A@@ n ordin@@ ary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star &apos;s life .
"So , if a star star@@ ts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Su@@ n , it &apos;s going to end its life by exp@@ lo@@ ding and le@@ a@@ ving be@@ h@@ ind these beautiful super@@ no@@ v@@ a re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts that we see here ."
And inside that super@@ no@@ v@@ a re@@ m@@ n@@ ant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass r@@ ough@@ ly three times the mass of the Su@@ n .
O@@ n an astron@@ om@@ ical sc@@ ale that &apos;s a very small black hole .
"Now , what I want to talk about are the super@@ massive black ho@@ les ."
And the super@@ massive black ho@@ les are thought to re@@ side at the center of galaxies .
And this beautiful picture taken with the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ p@@ ace T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e sho@@ ws you that galaxies come in all shap@@ es and si@@ z@@ es .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
A@@ l@@ most every ob@@ ject in that picture there is a galaxy .
And there is a very n@@ ice sp@@ ir@@ al up in the up@@ per left .
"And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy , just to give you a sense of sc@@ ale ."
"And all the light that we see from a typ@@ ical galaxy , which is the kind of galaxies that we &apos;re seeing here , comes from the light from the stars ."
"So , we see the galaxy because of the star light ."
"Now , there are a few relati@@ vely ex@@ ot@@ ic galaxies ."
"I like to call these the pri@@ m@@ a d@@ on@@ n@@ a of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show off@@ s ."
And we call them ac@@ tive gal@@ ac@@ tic n@@ uc@@ le@@ i .
"And we call them that because their n@@ uc@@ le@@ us , or their center , are very ac@@ tive ."
"So , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from ."
"And yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be expl@@ ained by the star@@ light ."
It &apos;s way more ener@@ ge@@ tic .
"In fact , in a few exam@@ pl@@ es it &apos;s like the ones that we &apos;re seeing here ."
There are also j@@ ets em@@ an@@ ating out from the center .
"A@@ g@@ ain , a s@@ our@@ ce of energy that &apos;s very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are comp@@ os@@ ed of stars ."
"So , what people have thought is that perhaps there are super@@ massive black ho@@ les which matter is f@@ all@@ ing on to ."
"So , you can &apos;t see the black hole itself , but you can con@@ ver@@ t the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational energy of the black hole into the light we see ."
"So , there is the thought that maybe super@@ massive black ho@@ les ex@@ ist at the center of galaxies ."
But it &apos;s a kind of in@@ direc@@ t ar@@ g@@ ument .
"@@ N@@ on@@ e@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s given ri@@ se to the n@@ oti@@ on that maybe it &apos;s not just these pri@@ m@@ a d@@ on@@ n@@ as that have these super@@ massive black ho@@ les , but rather all galaxies might har@@ b@@ or these super@@ massive black ho@@ les at their cen@@ ters ."
And if that &apos;s the case — and this is an example of a norm@@ al galaxy ; what we see is the star light .
"And if there is a super@@ massive black hole , what we need to as@@ su@@ me is that it &apos;s a black hole on a di@@ et ."
Because that is the way to sup@@ pres@@ s the ener@@ ge@@ tic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a that we see in ac@@ tive gal@@ ac@@ tic n@@ uc@@ le@@ i .
"If we &apos;re going to look for these ste@@ al@@ th black ho@@ les at the center of galaxies , the best place to look is in our own galaxy , our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay ."
And this is a wi@@ de field picture taken of the center of the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay .
And what we see is a line of stars .
"And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a fl@@ att@@ en@@ ed , dis@@ k@@ -@@ like struc@@ ture ."
"And we live in the middle of it , so when we look to@@ wards the center , we see this plan@@ e which defin@@ es the plan@@ e of the galaxy , or line that defin@@ es the plan@@ e of the galaxy ."
"Now , the adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of stud@@ ying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the cl@@ os@@ est example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next cl@@ os@@ est galaxy is 100 times f@@ ur@@ ther away ."
"So , we can see far more deta@@ il in our galaxy than any@@ place else ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in a moment , the ability to see deta@@ il is k@@ ey to this experiment ."
"So , how do astron@@ om@@ ers pro@@ ve that there is a lot of mass inside a small v@@ olu@@ me ?"
Wh@@ ich is the job that I have to show you today .
And the to@@ ol that we use is to wat@@ ch the way stars or@@ bit the black hole .
St@@ ar@@ s will or@@ bit the black hole in the very same way that plan@@ ets or@@ bit the su@@ n .
It &apos;s the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l that makes these things or@@ bit .
"If there were no massive ob@@ jects these things would go fl@@ ying off , or at le@@ ast go at a much s@@ lo@@ wer r@@ ate because all that de@@ ter@@ min@@ es how they go around is how much mass is inside its or@@ bit ."
"So , this is great , because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small v@@ olu@@ me ."
"So , if I know how f@@ ast it goes around , I know the mass ."
And if I know the sc@@ ale of the or@@ bit I know the radi@@ us .
"So , I want to see the stars that are as cl@@ ose to the center of the galaxy as possible ."
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a re@@ gi@@ on as possible .
"So , this means that I want to see a lot of deta@@ il ."
And that &apos;s the reason that for this experiment we &apos;ve used the world &apos;s lar@@ g@@ est tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e .
"This is the K@@ ec@@ k ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ory . It h@@ os@@ ts two tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es with a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r 10 me@@ ters , which is r@@ ough@@ ly the di@@ am@@ e@@ ter of a ten@@ n@@ is cour@@ t ."
"Now , this is wonderful , because the cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n prom@@ ise of large tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es is that is that the big@@ ger the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , the sm@@ all@@ er the deta@@ il that we can see ."
"But it turns out these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , or any tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e on the ground has had a little bit of a chall@@ en@@ ge living up to this cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n prom@@ ise ."
And that is because of the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here .
A@@ t@@ m@@ osp@@ here is great for us ; it al@@ lo@@ ws us to survi@@ ve here on Earth .
But it &apos;s relati@@ vely chall@@ eng@@ ing for astron@@ om@@ ers who want to look through the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here to astron@@ om@@ ical s@@ our@@ ces .
"So , to give you a sense of what this is like , it &apos;s actually like looking at a pe@@ b@@ ble at the bot@@ tom of a stre@@ am ."
"@@ L@@ oo@@ king at the pe@@ b@@ ble on the bot@@ tom of the stre@@ am , the stre@@ am is contin@@ u@@ ously mo@@ ving and tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent , and that makes it very difficult to see the pe@@ b@@ ble on the bot@@ tom of the stre@@ am ."
"@@ V@@ ery much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astron@@ om@@ ical s@@ our@@ ces , because of the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here that &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ously mo@@ ving by ."
"So , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot of my care@@ er working on ways to cor@@ rec@@ t for the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , to give us a c@@ le@@ an@@ er view ."
And that bu@@ ys us about a fac@@ tor of 20 .
"And I think all of you can ag@@ ree that if you can fig@@ ure out how to impro@@ ve life by a fac@@ tor of 20 , you &apos;ve probably impro@@ ved your li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le by a lot , say your s@@ al@@ ary , you &apos;d not@@ ice , or your kids , you &apos;d not@@ ice ."
"And this anim@@ ation here sho@@ ws you one example of the tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that we use , called ad@@ ap@@ tive op@@ tics ."
"You &apos;re seeing an anim@@ ation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e — in other words , just a picture that sho@@ ws the stars — and the bo@@ x is cen@@ ter@@ ed on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is ."
"So , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars ."
W@@ ith this technology all of a su@@ dd@@ en you can see it .
This technology works by int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ing a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r into the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e op@@ tics system that &apos;s contin@@ u@@ ously chang@@ ing to coun@@ ter@@ act what the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here is doing to you .
"So , it &apos;s kind of like very f@@ anc@@ y e@@ ye@@ gl@@ ass@@ es for your tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
"Now , in the next few sli@@ des I &apos;m just going to fo@@ c@@ us on that little s@@ qu@@ are there ."
"So , we &apos;re only going to look at the stars inside that small s@@ qu@@ are , al@@ though we &apos;ve looked at all of them ."
"So , I want to see how these things have mo@@ ved ."
"And over the course of this experiment , these stars have mo@@ ved a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous amount ."
"So , we &apos;ve been doing this experiment for 15 years , and we see the stars go all the way around ."
"Now , most astron@@ om@@ ers have a fav@@ or@@ ite star , and m@@ ine today is a star that &apos;s l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed up there , S@@ O@@ -@@ 2 ."
A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely my fav@@ or@@ ite star in the world .
And that &apos;s because it goes around in only 15 years .
"And to give you a sense of how sh@@ ort that is , the su@@ n ta@@ kes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy ."
"S@@ t@@ ar@@ s that we knew about before , that were as cl@@ ose to the center of the galaxy as possible , take 5@@ 00 years ."
"And this one , this one goes around in a human li@@ fe@@ time ."
"That &apos;s kind of pro@@ found , in a way ."
But it &apos;s the k@@ ey to this experiment . The or@@ bit t@@ ells me how much mass is inside a very small radi@@ us .
"So , next we see a picture here that sho@@ ws you before this experiment the size to which we could con@@ fine the mass of the center of the galaxy ."
What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the su@@ n inside that cir@@ c@@ le .
"And as you can see , there was a lot of other stuff inside that cir@@ c@@ le ."
You can see a lot of stars .
"So , there was actually lots of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to the idea that there was a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there ."
"But with this experiment , we &apos;ve con@@ fin@@ ed that same mass to a much sm@@ all@@ er v@@ olu@@ me that &apos;s 1@@ 0,000 times sm@@ all@@ er ."
"And because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there ."
"T@@ o give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our sol@@ ar system ."
"So , we &apos;re cr@@ am@@ m@@ ing four million times the mass of the su@@ n into that small v@@ olu@@ me ."
"Now , tru@@ th in ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing . R@@ ight ?"
I have told you my job is to get it down to the S@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ child radi@@ us .
"And the tru@@ th is , I &apos;m not quite there ."
But we actually have no al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative today to expl@@ ain@@ ing this con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation of mass .
"And , in fact , it &apos;s the best evidence we have to d@@ ate for not only exist@@ ence of a super@@ massive black hole at the center of our own galaxy , but any in our universe ."
"So , what next ? I actually think this is about as good as we &apos;re going to do with today &apos;s technology , so let &apos;s move on with the problem ."
"So , what I want to tell you , very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly , is a few exam@@ pl@@ es of the exc@@ it@@ ement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy , now that we know that there is , or at le@@ ast we believe , that there is a super@@ massive black hole there ."
"And the fu@@ n p@@ ha@@ se of this experiment is , while we &apos;ve te@@ sted some of our ideas about the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences of a super@@ massive black hole being at the center of our galaxy , almost every single one has been in@@ consi@@ st@@ ent with what we actually see ."
And that &apos;s the fu@@ n .
"So , let me give you the two exam@@ pl@@ es ."
"You can ask , &quot; &quot; What do you exp@@ ect for the old stars , stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time , they &apos;ve had pl@@ ent@@ y of time to inter@@ act with the black hole . &quot; &quot; What you exp@@ ect there is that old stars should be very clu@@ st@@ er@@ ed around the black hole ."
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , for the young stars , or in con@@ tr@@ ast , the young stars , they just should not be there ."
A black hole does not make a kind ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or to a st@@ ell@@ ar n@@ ur@@ ser@@ y .
"T@@ o get a star to form , you need a big b@@ all of g@@ as and d@@ ust to coll@@ ap@@ se ."
And it &apos;s a very fr@@ ag@@ ile enti@@ ty .
And what does the big black hole do ?
It stri@@ ps that g@@ as cl@@ ou@@ d ap@@ art .
It pul@@ ls much stron@@ ger on one side than the other and the cl@@ ou@@ d is stri@@ p@@ ped ap@@ art .
"In fact , we an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated that star formation sh@@ ouldn &apos;t pro@@ ce@@ ed in that environ@@ ment ."
"So , you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t see young stars ."
"So , what do we see ?"
"@@ U@@ sing ob@@ serv@@ ations that are not the ones I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you today , we can actually fig@@ ure out which ones are old and which ones are young ."
The old ones are red .
"The young ones are bl@@ ue . And the y@@ el@@ low ones , we don &apos;t know yet ."
"So , you can already see the surpri@@ se ."
There is a de@@ ar@@ th of old stars .
"There is an ab@@ und@@ ance of young stars , so it &apos;s the ex@@ act op@@ pos@@ ite of the predic@@ tion ."
"So , this is the fu@@ n part ."
"And in fact , today , this is what we &apos;re trying to fig@@ ure out , this my@@ st@@ ery of how do you get — how do you res@@ ol@@ ve this con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion ."
"So , in fact , my gra@@ du@@ ate students are , at this very moment , today , at the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , in H@@ a@@ wa@@ i@@ i , making ob@@ serv@@ ations to get us ho@@ pe@@ fully to the next st@@ age , where we can ad@@ d@@ ress this question of why are there so many young stars , and so few old stars ."
T@@ o make f@@ ur@@ ther progress we really need to look at the or@@ b@@ its of stars that are much f@@ ur@@ ther away .
T@@ o do that we &apos;ll probably need much more s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated technology than we have today .
"Because , in tru@@ th , while I said we &apos;re cor@@ rec@@ ting for the Earth &apos;s at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , we actually only cor@@ rec@@ t for half the er@@ r@@ ors that are int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed ."
"We do this by sho@@ ot@@ ing a l@@ as@@ er up into the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , and what we think we can do is if we sh@@ ine a few more that we can cor@@ rec@@ t the rest ."
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
"And on a much longer time sc@@ ale , what we hope to do is build even lar@@ ger tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , because , remember , big@@ ger is better in astron@@ om@@ y ."
"So , we want to build a 30 me@@ ter tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
And with this tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e we should be able to see stars that are even cl@@ os@@ er to the center of the galaxy .
"And we hope to be able to test some of E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s the@@ ories of gener@@ al relati@@ vity , some ideas in cos@@ mo@@ logy about how galaxies form ."
"So , we think the future of this experiment is quite exc@@ iting ."
"So , in con@@ clu@@ sion , I &apos;m going to show you an anim@@ ation that basically sho@@ ws you how these or@@ b@@ its have been mo@@ ving , in three dimensions ."
"And I hope , if nothing else , I &apos;ve con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy ."
"And this means that these things do ex@@ ist in our universe , and we have to cont@@ end with this , we have to explain how you can get these ob@@ jects in our physical world ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , we &apos;ve been able to look at that inter@@ action of how super@@ massive black ho@@ les inter@@ act , and understand , maybe , the ro@@ le in which they play in shap@@ ing what galaxies are , and how they work ."
"And last but not le@@ ast , n@@ one of this would have happened without the adv@@ ent of the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous progress that &apos;s been made on the technology front ."
"And we think that this is a field that is mo@@ ving incredi@@ bly f@@ ast , and ho@@ l@@ ds a lot in st@@ ore for the future ."
Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 4@@ 5 year@@ -@@ old love story with the po@@ or , living on less than one dol@@ l@@ ar a day ."
"I went to a very e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , s@@ no@@ b@@ b@@ ish , exp@@ en@@ sive education in India , and that almost dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at , teacher , doc@@ tor — all la@@ id out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the In@@ di@@ an national s@@ qu@@ as@@ h cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was la@@ id out for me .
E@@ very@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st B@@ i@@ ha@@ r fam@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , death , people d@@ ying of h@@ un@@ ger , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a com@@ a .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is la@@ id out for you , the best j@@ ob@@ s are la@@ id out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best educ@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"@@ No job , no money , no sec@@ ur@@ ity , no pr@@ osp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g w@@ ells for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ g w@@ ells for five years ?"
"You went to the most exp@@ en@@ sive school and colle@@ ge in India , and you want to di@@ g w@@ ells for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t spe@@ ak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ posed to the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary knowledge and sk@@ ills that very po@@ or people have , which are never br@@ ought into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am — which is never i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied , resp@@ ected , app@@ li@@ ed on a large sc@@ ale ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — colle@@ ge only for the po@@ or .
What the po@@ or thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ected in the colle@@ ge .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ l@@ d@@ ers came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the poli@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fa@@ il@@ ed in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at P@@ ar@@ is and New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and Z@@ ur@@ ich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not t@@ elling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a colle@@ ge only for the po@@ or ."
What the po@@ or thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ected in the colle@@ ge . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ d@@ ers gave me some very sound and pro@@ found adv@@ ice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ gre@@ e and qu@@ ali@@ fic@@ ation into your colle@@ ge . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only colle@@ ge in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a M@@ ast@@ er &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a cop@@ -@@ out or a was@@ h@@ -@@ out or a d@@ rop@@ out to come to our colle@@ ge .
You have to work with your h@@ ands .
You have to have a di@@ gn@@ ity of l@@ ab@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can off@@ er to the comm@@ unity and pro@@ vi@@ de a serv@@ ice to the comm@@ unity .
"So we started the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al@@ ism ."
Wh@@ o is a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal ?
"A prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal is someone who has a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of com@@ pe@@ t@@ ence , con@@ fi@@ dence and belie@@ f ."
A water di@@ v@@ in@@ er is a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal .
A tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal mi@@ d@@ wi@@ fe is a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal .
A tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal b@@ one se@@ tter is a prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal .
Th@@ ese are prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als all over the world .
You find them in any in@@ ac@@ c@@ es@@ sible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am and show that the knowledge and sk@@ ills that they have is univers@@ al .
"It nee@@ ds to be used , nee@@ ds to be app@@ li@@ ed , nee@@ ds to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these knowledge and sk@@ ills are re@@ lev@@ ant even today ."
So the colle@@ ge works fol@@ lowing the li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le and wor@@ k@@ st@@ y@@ le of M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"You e@@ at on the f@@ lo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the f@@ lo@@ or , you work on the f@@ lo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts , no wr@@ it@@ ten con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts ."
"You can st@@ ay with me for 20 years , go tom@@ or@@ row ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the chall@@ en@@ ge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas .
"Wh@@ at@@ ever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fa@@ il .
"B@@ at@@ ter@@ ed , br@@ u@@ is@@ ed , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only colle@@ ge where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only colle@@ ge where we don &apos;t give a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
You are cer@@ ti@@ fied by the comm@@ unity you ser@@ ve .
You don &apos;t need a p@@ ap@@ er to h@@ ang on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all m@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ j@@ um@@ b@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 19@@ 8@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and wr@@ ite , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 1@@ 50 people li@@ ved there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ h@@ an A@@ ward for A@@ r@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they su@@ spec@@ ted , they thought there was an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect be@@ h@@ ind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts , but the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts actually con@@ struc@@ ted the colle@@ ge . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ tur@@ ned the aw@@ ard for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually c@@ ast@@ ing as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia ."
"I asked a fore@@ ster — high@@ -@@ po@@ wer@@ ed , p@@ ap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied exper@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ il and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
Not even wor@@ th it .
"@@ No water , ro@@ c@@ k@@ y so@@ il . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a sp@@ ot ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this sp@@ ot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lear out ."
The men should c@@ lear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ g@@ ery , a bit of u@@ re@@ ns and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t le@@ ak .
"S@@ ince 19@@ 8@@ 6 , it ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t le@@ a@@ ked ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only colle@@ ge which is fully sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied .
A@@ ll the power comes from the su@@ n .
4@@ 5 ki@@ low@@ at@@ ts of pan@@ els on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the su@@ n for the next 2@@ 5 years .
"So long as the su@@ n sh@@ ines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beau@@ ty is that is was inst@@ all@@ ed by a pri@@ est , a H@@ in@@ d@@ u pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ mar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to colle@@ ge ."
He kno@@ ws more about sol@@ ar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
"F@@ ood , if you come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ ked ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ r@@ ic@@ ated that sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ ker are women , illi@@ ter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ r@@ ic@@ ate the most s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ ker ."
It &apos;s a par@@ abo@@ li@@ c S@@ ch@@ eff@@ l@@ er sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ ker .
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , they &apos;re almost half G@@ er@@ man , they &apos;re so preci@@ se ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find In@@ di@@ an women so preci@@ se .
"A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that co@@ o@@ ker ."
And we have 60 me@@ als tw@@ ice a day of sol@@ ar co@@ o@@ king .
"We have a d@@ enti@@ st — she &apos;s a gr@@ and@@ mother , illi@@ ter@@ ate , who &apos;s a d@@ enti@@ st ."
"S@@ he actually looks after the te@@ e@@ th of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot technology : this was 19@@ 8@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect thought of it — but we are coll@@ ec@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ of@@ s ."
V@@ ery little water is wa@@ sted .
"A@@ ll the ro@@ of@@ s are connec@@ ted under@@ ground to a 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 li@@ ter t@@ ank , and no water is wa@@ sted ."
"If we have four years of dr@@ ought , we still have water on the cam@@ p@@ us , because we coll@@ ect ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after anim@@ als — sh@@ e@@ ep , go@@ at@@ s — dom@@ es@@ tic cho@@ res ."
So we thought of star@@ ting a school at night for the children .
"Because the night scho@@ ols of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia , over 7@@ 5@@ ,000 children have g@@ one through these night scho@@ ols ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we te@@ ach in these scho@@ ols ?
"D@@ em@@ o@@ cr@@ acy , ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted , what you should do if your anim@@ al is s@@ ick ."
This is what we te@@ ach in the night scho@@ ols .
But all the scho@@ ols are sol@@ ar@@ -@@ li@@ t .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"B@@ e@@ tween six to 1@@ 4 year@@ -@@ old children par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate in a democr@@ atic process , and they el@@ ect a pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er ."
The pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er is 12 years old .
"S@@ he looks after 20 go@@ at@@ s in the mor@@ ning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er in the even@@ ing ."
"S@@ he has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et , a min@@ ist@@ er of education , a min@@ ist@@ er for energy , a min@@ ist@@ er for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ it@@ or and super@@ vi@@ se 1@@ 50 scho@@ ols for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"S@@ he got the W@@ or@@ ld &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s P@@ ri@@ ze five years ago , and she went to S@@ we@@ d@@ en ."
F@@ ir@@ st time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever seen S@@ we@@ d@@ en .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t d@@ az@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ u@@ een of S@@ we@@ d@@ en , who &apos;s there , tur@@ ned to me and said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you ask this child where she got her con@@ fi@@ dence from ?"
"S@@ he &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not d@@ az@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the gir@@ l , who &apos;s on her left , tur@@ ned to me and looked at the qu@@ een st@@ ra@@ ight in the ey@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ le@@ ase tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Wh@@ ere the per@@ cent@@ age of illi@@ ter@@ acy is very high , we use pu@@ p@@ pe@@ try ."
P@@ up@@ pe@@ ts is the way we comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate .
You have J@@ o@@ k@@ him Ch@@ ach@@ a who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my psycho@@ anal@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
He &apos;s my d@@ on@@ or .
"He actually ra@@ is@@ es money , sol@@ ves my di@@ sp@@ ut@@ es ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s ten@@ sion in the village , if att@@ en@@ d@@ ance at the scho@@ ols goes down and there &apos;s a fr@@ ic@@ tion between the teacher and the paren@@ t , the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t call@@ s the teacher and the paren@@ t in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ ha@@ ke h@@ ands ."
The att@@ en@@ d@@ ance must not dro@@ p . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ese pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts are made out of rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank re@@ por@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this dec@@ en@@ tr@@ ali@@ zed , de@@ my@@ sti@@ fied appro@@ ach of sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ f@@ ying vill@@ ages , we &apos;ve co@@ ver@@ ed all over India from L@@ ad@@ ak@@ h up to B@@ h@@ ut@@ an — all sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied vill@@ ages by people who have been tr@@ ained ."
"And we went to L@@ ad@@ ak@@ h , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both si@@ des — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the b@@ ene@@ f@@ it you had from sol@@ ar electr@@ ic@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a minut@@ e and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my h@@ us@@ b@@ and &apos;s face in w@@ in@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an .
One l@@ es@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tr@@ ain@@ able .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely mo@@ bi@@ le , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate . ( Laughter )"
"A@@ ll across the g@@ lo@@ be , you have this ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y of men wan@@ ting a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a c@@ ity , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great solu@@ tion : tr@@ ain gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers .
What &apos;s the best way of comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ating in the world today ?
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion ? No .
T@@ el@@ e@@ grap@@ h ? No .
T@@ el@@ e@@ ph@@ one ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an for the first time , and we pic@@ ked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ m@@ possible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ om@@ s , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ c@@ es@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the h@@ us@@ b@@ ands along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the h@@ us@@ b@@ ands along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intellig@@ ent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tr@@ ain these women ?"
S@@ ig@@ n language .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the wr@@ it@@ ten word .
You don &apos;t cho@@ ose the sp@@ o@@ ken word .
You use si@@ g@@ n language .
And in six months they can become sol@@ ar engine@@ ers .
They go back and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied the first village , set up a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p — the first village ever to be sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This wom@@ an@@ "
is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary gr@@ and@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied 200 h@@ ous@@ es for me in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an ."
And they ha@@ ven &apos;t coll@@ ap@@ sed .
She actually went and sp@@ o@@ ke to an engine@@ ering de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tr@@ ained 2@@ 7 more women and sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied 100 vill@@ ages in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an .
"We went to A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , and we did the same thing ."
"A@@ ll these women sit@@ ting at one t@@ able from eight , n@@ ine countries , all ch@@ at@@ ting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all spe@@ a@@ king a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re spe@@ a@@ king to each other and actually becom@@ ing sol@@ ar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one , and there was this min@@ ist@@ er dri@@ ving down in the de@@ ad of night — comes across this village ."
"C@@ om@@ es back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ese two gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ and@@ mo@@ thers ? &quot; &quot; The min@@ ist@@ er couldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; Wh@@ ere did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent st@@ ra@@ ight to the pre@@ si@@ dent .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a sol@@ ar@@ -@@ elec@@ tri@@ fied village in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the c@@ ab@@ in@@ et went to see the gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he sum@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; C@@ an you tr@@ ain me 1@@ 50 gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ re@@ si@@ dent ."
But they will . The gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot tr@@ ain@@ ing center in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one .
And 1@@ 50 gr@@ and@@ mo@@ thers have been tr@@ ained in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one .
G@@ am@@ bi@@ a : we went to sel@@ ect a gr@@ and@@ mother in G@@ am@@ bi@@ a .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The comm@@ unity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ a@@ ke these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she spe@@ a@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ ff@@ ic@@ ult h@@ us@@ b@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ all@@ ed the h@@ us@@ b@@ and , the h@@ us@@ b@@ and came , s@@ w@@ ag@@ g@@ ering , poli@@ tici@@ an , mo@@ bi@@ le in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an In@@ di@@ an man ? &quot;"
That was his bi@@ gg@@ est fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll r@@ ing you up on the mo@@ bi@@ le . &quot; &quot; She went like a gr@@ and@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and sp@@ o@@ ke to the whole pres@@ s as if she was a ve@@ ter@@ an .
"S@@ he h@@ and@@ led the national pres@@ s , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ere &apos;s your h@@ us@@ b@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) S@@ uc@@ cess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just w@@ ind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for solu@@ tions outside .
Lo@@ ok for solu@@ tions within .
And li@@ st@@ en to people . They have the solu@@ tions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
D@@ on &apos;t even wor@@ ry .
"D@@ on &apos;t li@@ st@@ en to the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank , li@@ st@@ en to the people on the ground ."
They have all the solu@@ tions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a quot@@ ation by M@@ a@@ h@@ at@@ m@@ a G@@ and@@ h@@ i .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ ir@@ st they ig@@ n@@ ore you , then they lau@@ gh at you , then they fi@@ ght you , and then you w@@ in . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
"@@ 18 minutes is an ab@@ solu@@ tely br@@ ut@@ al time lim@@ it , so I &apos;m going to di@@ ve st@@ ra@@ ight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work ."
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
"I &apos;m going to talk about fe@@ as@@ i@@ bility as well , of course ."
I &apos;m going to do that in two ste@@ ps .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
"Now , I want to ask a question ."
H@@ ands up : any@@ one in the au@@ dience who is in fav@@ or of m@@ al@@ ari@@ a ?
That was easy . O@@ K .
O@@ K . H@@ ands up : any@@ one in the au@@ dience who &apos;s not sure whether m@@ al@@ ari@@ a is a good thing or a bad thing ?
O@@ K . So we all think m@@ al@@ ari@@ a is a bad thing .
And here is that char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
The only real difference is that aging k@@ ills consi@@ der@@ ably more people than m@@ al@@ ari@@ a does .
"I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sym@@ p@@ a@@ the@@ tic au@@ dience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not enti@@ re@@ ly per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed by this logi@@ c ."
"And this is actually a rather good com@@ par@@ is@@ on , it seems to me ."
"You know , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , c@@ ity bo@@ ys have no business t@@ elling us r@@ ural typ@@ es what to do with our time ."
"It &apos;s a tra@@ di@@ ti@@ onal part of the way of life , and we should be al@@ lowed to car@@ ry on doing it ."
What part of this do people not understand ?
"It &apos;s not just about life , of course — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s about health@@ y life , you know — getting f@@ ra@@ il and mis@@ er@@ able and dep@@ en@@ dent is no fu@@ n , whether or not d@@ ying may be fu@@ n ."
"So really , this is how I would like to descri@@ be it ."
It &apos;s a global tr@@ ance .
"But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of pro@@ por@@ tion ."
"You know , these are ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents ; these are things that would be le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate to be con@@ cer@@ ned about ."
"But the question is , are they so d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous — these ri@@ s@@ ks of doing something about aging — that they ou@@ tw@@ e@@ i@@ gh the do@@ w@@ n@@ side of doing the op@@ pos@@ ite , nam@@ ely , le@@ a@@ ving aging as it is ?"
"A@@ re these so bad that they ou@@ tw@@ e@@ i@@ gh con@@ de@@ m@@ ning 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 people a day to an un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily early death ?"
"You know , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t got an ar@@ g@@ ument that &apos;s that str@@ ong , then just don &apos;t wa@@ st@@ e my time , is what I say ."
"( Laughter ) Now , there is one ar@@ g@@ ument that some people do think really is that str@@ ong , and here it is ."
"I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a di@@ le@@ m@@ m@@ a in this resp@@ ect ."
"We will have to deci@@ de whether to have a low bir@@ th r@@ ate , or a high death r@@ ate ."
"And , I say that that &apos;s fine — the future of hum@@ an@@ ity is enti@@ t@@ led to make that cho@@ ice ."
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that cho@@ ice on be@@ half of the future .
And the fundamental answer is that the pro@@ -@@ aging tr@@ ance is not as d@@ um@@ b as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sen@@ sible way of cop@@ ing with the in@@ ev@@ it@@ ability of aging .
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke , for example , making up these ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous reas@@ ons why aging is actually a good thing after all ."
"But of course , that only works when we have both of these comp@@ on@@ ents ."
This pro@@ -@@ aging tr@@ ance is what st@@ op@@ s us from ag@@ it@@ ating about these things .
"And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot — ev@@ an@@ ge@@ li@@ ze , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot — in order to get people &apos;s att@@ en@@ tion , and make people reali@@ ze that they are in a tr@@ ance in this re@@ g@@ ard ."
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about fe@@ as@@ i@@ bility .
"And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is in@@ ev@@ it@@ able is sum@@ m@@ ed up in a defin@@ i@@ tion of aging that I &apos;m giving here ."
A very simple defin@@ i@@ tion .
"A@@ g@@ ing is a side eff@@ ect of being ali@@ ve in the first place , which is to say , me@@ t@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m ."
This is not a completely t@@ au@@ to@@ logical st@@ at@@ ement ; it &apos;s a reas@@ on@@ able st@@ at@@ ement .
"A@@ g@@ ing is basically a process that happens to in@@ anim@@ ate ob@@ jects like car@@ s , and it also happens to us , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that we have a lot of c@@ le@@ ver self-@@ re@@ p@@ air m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms , because those self-@@ re@@ p@@ air m@@ ech@@ an@@ is@@ ms are not per@@ f@@ ect ."
"So basically , me@@ t@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m , which is defin@@ ed as basically everything that ke@@ e@@ ps us ali@@ ve from one day to the next , has side effec@@ ts ."
"And there are really two g@@ am@@ es in to@@ wn , ac@@ cor@@ ding to most people , with re@@ g@@ ard to pos@@ t@@ p@@ on@@ ing aging ."
"They &apos;re what I &apos;m call@@ ing here the &quot; &quot; g@@ er@@ on@@ to@@ logy appro@@ ach &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; g@@ eri@@ at@@ r@@ ics appro@@ ach . &quot; &quot; The g@@ eri@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an will inter@@ ven@@ e l@@ ate in the day , when p@@ ath@@ o@@ logy is becom@@ ing evi@@ dent , and the g@@ eri@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an will try and hold back the s@@ ands of time , and stop the ac@@ c@@ um@@ ulation of side effec@@ ts from cau@@ sing the p@@ ath@@ o@@ logy quite so so@@ on ."
"The g@@ er@@ on@@ to@@ logy appro@@ ach looks much more prom@@ is@@ ing on the sur@@ face , because , you know , pre@@ ven@@ tion is better than c@@ ure ."
But un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand me@@ t@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m very well .
"So then , what do we do about that ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s a fine logi@@ c , that s@@ ounds pretty con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing , pretty ir@@ on@@ cl@@ ad , doesn &apos;t it ?"
But it isn &apos;t .
"B@@ e@@ fore I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit into what I &apos;m call@@ ing ste@@ p two ."
"@@ J@@ ust sup@@ pose , as I said , that we do ac@@ qu@@ ire — let &apos;s say we do it today for the sa@@ ke of ar@@ g@@ ument — the ability to con@@ f@@ er 30 extra years of health@@ y life on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 5@@ 5 ."
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; &quot; ro@@ b@@ ust human re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation . &quot; &quot; O@@ K .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
"There are two sor@@ ts of techno@@ logical progress really , for this pur@@ pose ."
"There are fundamental , maj@@ or bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s , and there are incre@@ mental re@@ fin@@ em@@ ents of those bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s ."
"Now , they diff@@ er a great de@@ al in ter@@ ms of the predic@@ t@@ ability of time fr@@ am@@ es ."
"We can think , really , that each one is sort of be@@ y@@ on@@ d the imag@@ in@@ ation of the inv@@ ent@@ or of the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , if you like ."
The incre@@ mental adv@@ anc@@ es have ad@@ ded up to something which is not incre@@ mental any@@ more .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental bre@@ ak@@ through .
And you see it in all sor@@ ts of techno@@ logi@@ es .
"So I think that actually ste@@ p two , that I called a ste@@ p a moment ago , isn &apos;t a ste@@ p at all ."
"That in fact , the people who are young enough to b@@ ene@@ f@@ it from these first ther@@ ap@@ ies that give this moder@@ ate amount of life ex@@ ten@@ sion , even though those people are already mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed when the ther@@ ap@@ ies ar@@ ri@@ ve , will be at some sort of c@@ us@@ p ."
They will m@@ os@@ tly survi@@ ve long enough to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve impro@@ ved tre@@ at@@ ments that will give them a f@@ ur@@ ther 30 or maybe 50 years .
"In other words , they will be st@@ ay@@ ing a@@ head of the g@@ ame ."
The ther@@ ap@@ ies will be impro@@ ving fa@@ ster than the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing im@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ tions in the ther@@ ap@@ ies are cat@@ ch@@ ing up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
"Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predic@@ t that a lot of people ali@@ ve today are going to live to 1@@ ,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to inv@@ ent ther@@ ap@@ ies in the next few dec@@ ad@@ es that are so th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly e@@ li@@ min@@ ating aging that those ther@@ ap@@ ies will let us live to 1@@ ,000 or more ."
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 3@@ 00 and 4@@ 00 and so on .
"I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; &quot; lon@@ g@@ ev@@ ity es@@ cap@@ e v@@ el@@ oc@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , it seems to get the point across ."
"So , these tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ories here are basically how we would exp@@ ect people to live , in ter@@ ms of re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y , as meas@@ u@@ red by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these ther@@ ap@@ ies ar@@ ri@@ ve ."
"So this is a gen@@ u@@ ine con@@ clu@@ sion that I come to , that the first 1@@ 5@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old — we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these fir@@ st@@ -@@ generation ther@@ ap@@ ies ."
"But ir@@ resp@@ ec@@ tive of that age , I &apos;m cl@@ a@@ im@@ ing that the first person to live to 1@@ ,000 — sub@@ ject of course , to , you know , global cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ es — is actually , probably , only about 10 years youn@@ ger than the first 1@@ 5@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old ."
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
"A@@ l@@ right , so fin@@ ally I &apos;m going to sp@@ end the rest of the talk , my last se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes , on ste@@ p one ; nam@@ ely , how do we actually get to this moder@@ ate amount of life ex@@ ten@@ sion that will al@@ low us to get to es@@ cap@@ e v@@ el@@ oc@@ ity ?"
"And in order to do that , I need to talk about m@@ ice a little bit ."
I have a cor@@ respon@@ ding mil@@ est@@ one to ro@@ b@@ ust human re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation .
"I &apos;m call@@ ing it &quot; &quot; ro@@ b@@ ust m@@ ouse re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation , &quot; &quot; not very imag@@ in@@ ati@@ vely ."
And this is what it is .
"I say we &apos;re going to take a lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved st@@ ra@@ in of m@@ ouse , which basically means m@@ ice that live about three years on average ."
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
"And then we do a whole b@@ un@@ ch of stuff to them , and with those ther@@ ap@@ ies , we get them to live , on average , to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
"Wh@@ ich we can now , as I &apos;ve expl@@ ained , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ently call e@@ ither ro@@ b@@ ust human re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation or lon@@ g@@ ev@@ ity es@@ cap@@ e v@@ el@@ oc@@ ity ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tion of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , star@@ ting from the time we get the m@@ ice ?"
"And thir@@ dly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?"
"And it seems to me that the first question is enti@@ re@@ ly a bio@@ logy question , and it &apos;s extre@@ me@@ ly hard to answer ."
"One has to be very spec@@ ul@@ ative , and many of my colle@@ ag@@ ues would say that we should not do this spec@@ ulation , that we should simply keep our coun@@ se@@ l until we know more ."
I say that &apos;s n@@ on@@ sense .
I say we ab@@ solu@@ tely are ir@@ respon@@ sible if we st@@ ay si@@ l@@ ent on this .
"We need to give our best gu@@ ess as to the time f@@ ra@@ me , in order to give people a sense of pro@@ por@@ tion so that they can ass@@ ess their pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
15 years from the ro@@ b@@ ust m@@ ouse .
The public &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tion will probably be some@@ what better than that .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
"They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much ."
"That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is in@@ ev@@ it@@ able in hum@@ ans , since it &apos;s been pos@@ t@@ p@@ on@@ ed so very effec@@ ti@@ vely in m@@ ice ."
"So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very str@@ ong change in people &apos;s at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , and of course that has en@@ orm@@ ous imp@@ lic@@ ations ."
"So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these m@@ ice , I &apos;m going to ad@@ d a little bit to my descri@@ p@@ tion of aging ."
But it is not part of me@@ t@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m itself .
And g@@ eri@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ ans try to hold back the s@@ ands of time by st@@ op@@ ping the d@@ am@@ age con@@ ver@@ ting into p@@ ath@@ o@@ logy .
And the reason it &apos;s a l@@ os@@ ing b@@ att@@ le is because the d@@ am@@ age is contin@@ u@@ ing to ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ate .
The engine@@ ering appro@@ ach does not inter@@ ven@@ e in any pro@@ cess@@ es .
It does not inter@@ ven@@ e in this process or this one .
"And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a l@@ os@@ ing b@@ att@@ le , and it &apos;s something that we are within ran@@ ge of being able to do , because it doesn &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve impro@@ ving on evolution ."
The point about this sli@@ de is actually the bot@@ tom .
The li@@ st on the right is also in@@ comple@@ te .
"It &apos;s a li@@ st of typ@@ es of p@@ ath@@ o@@ logy that are ag@@ e-@@ rel@@ ated , and it &apos;s just an in@@ comple@@ te li@@ st ."
And there are only se@@ ven of them .
"They &apos;re cat@@ eg@@ ories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only se@@ ven of them ."
"C@@ ell l@@ oss , m@@ ut@@ ations in ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ es , m@@ ut@@ ations in the m@@ it@@ o@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a and so on ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , I &apos;d like to give you an ar@@ g@@ ument for why that li@@ st is comple@@ te ."
"The answer is : lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es , because if a sh@@ or@@ t-@@ li@@ ved m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le under@@ goes d@@ am@@ age , but then the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le is dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed — like by a prot@@ e@@ in being dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by prot@@ e@@ ol@@ ys@@ is — then the d@@ am@@ age is g@@ one , too ."
It &apos;s got to be lon@@ g@@ -@@ li@@ ved m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es .
"S@@ ome of them are par@@ ti@@ ally imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted already , the ones at the top ."
"I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my con@@ clu@@ sion is that , if we can actually get su@@ it@@ able fund@@ ing for this , then we can probably devel@@ op ro@@ b@@ ust m@@ ouse re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation in only 10 years , but we do need to get ser@@ i@@ ous about it ."
We do need to really start trying .
"So of course , there are some bio@@ logi@@ sts in the au@@ dience , and I want to give some ans@@ w@@ ers to some of the questions that you may have ."
"You may have been dis@@ s@@ atis@@ fied with this talk , but fundam@@ ent@@ ally you have to go and read this stuff ."
The deta@@ il is what makes me con@@ fi@@ dent of my rather ag@@ gres@@ sive time fr@@ am@@ es that I &apos;m predic@@ ting here .
"So if you think that I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;d better d@@ am@@ n well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong ."
"And of course the ma@@ in thing is that you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t tr@@ ust people who call themselves g@@ er@@ on@@ to@@ logi@@ sts because , as with any ra@@ dic@@ al de@@ par@@ ture from pre@@ vi@@ ous thinking within a particular field , you know , you exp@@ ect people in the ma@@ in@@ stre@@ am to be a bit re@@ sist@@ ant and not really to take it ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"So , you know , this does happen ."
There &apos;s a pro@@ pos@@ al to actually put together an in@@ stitu@@ te .
"But , I mean , look — how long does it take to sp@@ end that on the war in I@@ ra@@ q ?"
Not very long . O@@ K .
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s got to be phil@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic , because prof@@ its di@@ str@@ act bi@@ ot@@ ec@@ h , but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chan@@ ce , I think , of suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ding in this ."
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : O@@ K . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chan@@ ce .
"A@@ u@@ dience : S@@ ince you &apos;ve been talking about aging and trying to de@@ fe@@ at it , why is it that you make yourself appe@@ ar like an old man ?"
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Because I am an old man . I am actually 1@@ 5@@ 8 . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) A@@ u@@ dience : S@@ p@@ ec@@ ies on this planet have ev@@ ol@@ ved with im@@ m@@ un@@ e syst@@ ems to fi@@ ght off all the dise@@ ases so that in@@ divi@@ du@@ als live long enough to pro@@ create .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , as far as I know , all the spec@@ ies have ev@@ ol@@ ved to actually die , so when cells divi@@ de , the tel@@ om@@ er@@ ase get sh@@ or@@ ter , and even@@ tually spec@@ ies die ."
"So , why does — evolution has — seems to have sel@@ ected against im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity , when it is so adv@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ e@@ ous , or is evolution just in@@ comple@@ te ?"
A@@ G : B@@ r@@ illi@@ ant . Thank you for as@@ king a question that I can answer with an un@@ contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al answer .
CA : The gen@@ es don &apos;t care but we do ?
A@@ G : That &apos;s right .
"A@@ u@@ dience : H@@ ell@@ o . I read some@@ where that in the last 20 years , the average li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an of basically any@@ one on the planet has gro@@ wn by 10 years ."
"If I pro@@ ject that , that would make me think that I would live until 1@@ 20 if I don &apos;t cr@@ as@@ h on my m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke ."
"That means that I &apos;m one of your sub@@ jects to become a 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ year@@ -@@ old ?"
A@@ G : If you l@@ ose a bit of we@@ ight .
( Laughter ) Y@@ our num@@ bers are a bit out .
"If that is in@@ de@@ ed true , bio@@ log@@ ically are there imp@@ lic@@ ations in the world of re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation ?"
"If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as op@@ posed to a typ@@ ical , you know , couple of months ?"
What I said about there being no n@@ on@@ -@@ aging spec@@ ies ear@@ li@@ er on was a little bit of an over@@ sim@@ p@@ li@@ fic@@ ation .
"Now , India is a country in@@ fam@@ ous for its sc@@ or@@ ch@@ ing he@@ at and hum@@ i@@ d@@ ity ."
"For me , the only reli@@ e@@ f from this he@@ at is to dr@@ ink pl@@ ent@@ y of water ."
"Now , while in India , my parents always re@@ mind me to only dr@@ ink bo@@ il@@ ed or bot@@ t@@ led water , because un@@ like here in America , where I can just turn on a ta@@ p and eas@@ ily get c@@ le@@ an , p@@ ot@@ able water , in India , the water is often cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I so@@ on reali@@ zed that not everyone is fort@@ un@@ ate enough to en@@ jo@@ y the c@@ le@@ an water we did ."
"I even saw children , who looked the same age as me , f@@ ill@@ ing up these c@@ lear pl@@ as@@ tic bot@@ t@@ les with di@@ r@@ ty water from stre@@ ams on the ro@@ ad@@ side ."
"I wanted to know why these kids l@@ ac@@ ked water , a sub@@ st@@ ance that is ess@@ ential for life ."
"Now , this may seem surpri@@ sing , as 7@@ 5 percent of our planet is co@@ ver@@ ed in water , but only 2@@ .@@ 5 percent of that is f@@ re@@ sh@@ water , and less than one percent of Earth &apos;s f@@ re@@ sh@@ water sup@@ ply is av@@ a@@ il@@ able for human con@@ sum@@ p@@ tion ."
"W@@ ith ri@@ sing pop@@ ul@@ ations , in@@ du@@ stri@@ al develop@@ ment and economic grow@@ th , our de@@ m@@ and for c@@ le@@ an water is increas@@ ing , yet our f@@ re@@ sh@@ water res@@ our@@ ces are r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly de@@ ple@@ ting ."
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to the W@@ or@@ ld H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ zation , 6@@ 60 million people in our world l@@ ack ac@@ cess to a c@@ le@@ an water s@@ our@@ ce ."
"( Laughter ) A@@ c@@ tually , at first I con@@ ver@@ ted my k@@ it@@ ch@@ en into a l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , but my parents didn &apos;t really appro@@ ve and k@@ ic@@ ked me out ."
"In S@@ O@@ D@@ I@@ S , c@@ lear pl@@ as@@ tic bot@@ t@@ les are f@@ ill@@ ed with cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated water and then ex@@ posed to s@@ un@@ light for six to eight hours ."
So what exactly is this ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ ys@@ is ?
"@@ Let &apos;s bre@@ ak it down : &quot; &quot; ph@@ ot@@ o &quot; &quot; means from the su@@ n , and a cat@@ al@@ y@@ st is something that spe@@ e@@ ds up a re@@ action ."
So what ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ ys@@ is is doing is it &apos;s just spe@@ e@@ ding up this sol@@ ar dis@@ in@@ f@@ ec@@ tion process .
"But un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , there are se@@ ver@@ al di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ ages to the way ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ tic S@@ O@@ D@@ I@@ S is curren@@ tly dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed ."
"S@@ e@@ e , what they do is they take the c@@ lear pl@@ as@@ tic bot@@ t@@ les and they co@@ at the inside with this ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ tic co@@ ating ."
But ph@@ ot@@ oc@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ sts like ti@@ t@@ ani@@ um di@@ ox@@ i@@ de are actually comm@@ only used in s@@ un@@ scre@@ ens to bloc@@ k U@@ V radi@@ ation .
The comp@@ os@@ ite com@@ b@@ ines ti@@ t@@ ani@@ um di@@ ox@@ i@@ de with c@@ ement .
"For example , you could create a ro@@ d that can eas@@ ily be plac@@ ed inside water bot@@ t@@ les for in@@ divi@@ du@@ al use or you could create a por@@ ous f@@ il@@ ter that can f@@ il@@ ter water for fam@@ ili@@ es ."
You can even co@@ at the inside of an exist@@ ing water t@@ ank to pur@@ i@@ f@@ y lar@@ ger amoun@@ ts of water for comm@@ uni@@ ties over a longer per@@ i@@ od of time .

B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many f@@ el@@ low in@@ mat@@ es who had big pl@@ ans for the future .
"He had a vi@@ sion . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to leave the d@@ op@@ e g@@ ame for good and f@@ ly st@@ ra@@ ight , and he was actually working on mer@@ g@@ ing his two p@@ as@@ sions into one vi@@ sion ."

( Laughter ) It was my first week in fe@@ der@@ al pri@@ son , and I was learning qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with smar@@ t , am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous men wh@@ ose business inst@@ inc@@ ts were in many c@@ ases as sh@@ ar@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and d@@ ined me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ri@@ sing star in the M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i S@@ en@@ ate ."

But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time reli@@ ving the gl@@ ory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survi@@ ve ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tr@@ ary to what most people think , people don &apos;t p@@ ay , ta@@ x@@ p@@ ay@@ ers don &apos;t p@@ ay , for your life when you &apos;re in pri@@ son . You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to p@@ ay for your so@@ ap , your de@@ o@@ d@@ or@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h , to@@ o@@ th@@ p@@ ast@@ e , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .

So how do you survi@@ ve ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les .
You p@@ ay everything in st@@ am@@ ps . Th@@ ose are the curren@@ c@@ y .
You char@@ ge another in@@ m@@ ate to c@@ le@@ an his c@@ ell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , like you run a bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ p out of your c@@ ell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les : You run a t@@ at@@ too par@@ l@@ or out of your own c@@ ell .

You want a ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e in pri@@ son ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d@@ -@@ f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ ed c@@ ell ph@@ one that you f@@ li@@ p op@@ en and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred b@@ uc@@ ks .
You want a di@@ r@@ ty mag@@ az@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of pri@@ son life is in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous me@@ als from st@@ ol@@ en sc@@ r@@ aps from the w@@ are@@ h@@ ouse , sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s ha@@ ir with to@@ en@@ a@@ il c@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ s , or con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ igh@@ ts from b@@ oul@@ d@@ ers in lau@@ n@@ d@@ ry b@@ ag@@ s ti@@ ed on to t@@ ree lim@@ b@@ s , pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , bar@@ ber sho@@ ps , pers@@ onal tr@@ ain@@ ing bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"But there &apos;s no tr@@ ain@@ ing , nothing to pre@@ p@@ are them for that , no re@@ ha@@ bili@@ t@@ ation at all in pri@@ son , no one to help them wr@@ ite a business pl@@ an , fig@@ ure out a way to trans@@ l@@ ate the business con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ i@@ ti@@ vely gr@@ as@@ p into le@@ g@@ al en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses , no ac@@ cess to the In@@ ter@@ net , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most st@@ ates don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ hi@@ b@@ iting emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers from disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ating against people with a bac@@ k@@ ground ."

I &apos;m here because I have a very important mess@@ age : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for suc@@ cess .
"And it was found cl@@ ose to here , St@@ an@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old k@@ id , &quot; &quot; J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ n@@ y , I am going to leave you here with a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low is here , you will get another one .

So what happened when the prof@@ ess@@ or left the room ?
A@@ s so@@ on as the do@@ or cl@@ os@@ ed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low .
"F@@ i@@ ve secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome la@@ sted 1@@ 4@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wa@@ it .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would play with their sk@@ ir@@ ts and pan@@ ts .
"That child already , at four , underst@@ ood the most important prin@@ ci@@ ple for suc@@ cess , which is the ability to d@@ el@@ ay gr@@ ati@@ fic@@ ation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 1@@ 4 or 15 years later , fol@@ low@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their pl@@ ans .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing fine .
"A great per@@ cent@@ age of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low , they were in tr@@ ou@@ ble ."
They did not make it to univers@@ ity .
They had bad gra@@ des . S@@ ome of them d@@ rop@@ ped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ i@@ sp@@ an@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ; one out of three did not ."
This little gir@@ l was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into b@@ an@@ king , for example , or work at a cas@@ h re@@ gi@@ ster ."
But she will be suc@@ cess@@ ful .
And this app@@ li@@ es for everything . E@@ ven in s@@ al@@ es .
"If the s@@ al@@ es person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ it a second ."
I end with — the K@@ o@@ re@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over K@@ o@@ re@@ a .
They are teach@@ ing these kids exactly this prin@@ ci@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that prin@@ ci@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big de@@ b@@ t ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , j@@ e@@ e@@ z , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of suc@@ cess@@ ful people !@@ "
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smar@@ t enough .
And there &apos;s no mag@@ ic to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
I want to disc@@ us@@ s with you this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on why you &apos;re going to fa@@ il to have a great care@@ er .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m an econom@@ ist .
I do dis@@ m@@ al .
"E@@ nd of the day , it &apos;s ready for dis@@ m@@ al re@@ mar@@ ks ."
I only want to talk to those of you who want a great care@@ er .
I know some of you have already decided you want a good care@@ er .
"You &apos;re going to fa@@ il , too ."
"( Laughter ) Because — go@@ o@@ d@@ ness , you &apos;re all che@@ ery about fa@@ il@@ ing . ( Laughter )"

"Th@@ ose trying to have good care@@ ers are going to fa@@ il , because , really , good j@@ ob@@ s are now dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing ."
"F@@ ir@@ st reason is that no matter how many times people tell you , &quot; &quot; If you want a great care@@ er , you have to pur@@ sue your p@@ assion , you have to pur@@ sue your dre@@ ams , you have to pur@@ sue the gre@@ at@@ est f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ation in your life , &quot; &quot; you hear it again and again , and then you deci@@ de not to do it ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter how many times you do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad St@@ even J@@ . &apos; s St@@ an@@ for@@ d comm@@ enc@@ ement ad@@ d@@ ress , you still look at it and deci@@ de not to do it ."
I &apos;m not quite sure why you deci@@ de not to do it .
You &apos;re too la@@ zy to do it . It &apos;s too hard .
They are St@@ even J@@ .
I &apos;m not a gen@@ i@@ us .
"When I was five , I thought I was a gen@@ i@@ us , but my prof@@ ess@@ ors have be@@ at@@ en that idea out of my head long since . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And now I know I am completely com@@ pe@@ t@@ ent . &quot;"
"Now , you see , if this was 19@@ 50 , being completely com@@ pe@@ t@@ ent — that would have given you a great care@@ er ."
But gu@@ ess what ?
"This is almost 20@@ 12 , and saying to the world , &quot; I am t@@ ot@@ ally , completely com@@ pe@@ t@@ ent , &quot; is d@@ am@@ ning yourself with the fa@@ int@@ est of p@@ ra@@ ise ."
"And then , of course , another exc@@ use : &quot; &quot; Well , I would do this , I would do this , but , but — well , after all , I &apos;m not we@@ ir@@ d ."
A little stran@@ ge .
H@@ m@@ m ? H@@ m@@ m ? O@@ kay ?
"You know , a fine line between ma@@ d@@ ness and gen@@ i@@ us ."
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not we@@ ir@@ d . I &apos;ve read St@@ even J@@ . &apos; s bio@@ grap@@ h@@ y .
O@@ h my go@@ o@@ d@@ ness — I &apos;m not that person . I am n@@ ice .
I am norm@@ al .
"I &apos;m a n@@ ice , norm@@ al person , and n@@ ice , norm@@ al people — don &apos;t have p@@ assion . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; A@@ h , but I still want a great care@@ er ."
"I &apos;m not pre@@ p@@ ared to pur@@ sue my p@@ assion , so I know what I &apos;m going to do , because I have a solu@@ tion ."
I have a str@@ ate@@ gy .
It &apos;s the one M@@ om@@ my and D@@ ad@@ dy told me about .
"M@@ om@@ my and D@@ ad@@ dy told me that if I worked hard , I &apos;d have a good care@@ er ."
"So , if you work hard and have a good care@@ er , if you work really , really , really hard , you &apos;ll have a great care@@ er ."
"D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t that , like , ma@@ them@@ atic@@ ally make sense ? &quot; &quot; H@@ m@@ m . Not ."
"You know what ? Here &apos;s a little sec@@ re@@ t : You want to work ? You want to work really , really , really hard ?"
You know what ? You &apos;ll suc@@ ce@@ ed .
"The world will give you the op@@ port@@ unity to work really , really , really , really hard ."
"But , are you so sure that that &apos;s going to give you a great care@@ er , when all the evidence is to the con@@ tr@@ ary ?"
So let &apos;s de@@ al with those of you who are trying to find your p@@ assion .
"You actually understand that you really had better do it , never mind the exc@@ us@@ es ."
You found something you &apos;re interest@@ ed in .
&quot; I have an inter@@ est ! I have an inter@@ est ! &quot;
You tell me .
"You say , &quot; &quot; I have an inter@@ est ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s wonderful !@@ "
"And what are you trying to tell me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I have an inter@@ est . &quot;"
"I say , &quot; &quot; Do you have p@@ assion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an inter@@ est , &quot; &quot; you say ."
&quot; Y@@ our inter@@ est is comp@@ ared to what ? &quot;
"&quot; Well , I &apos;m interest@@ ed in this . &quot;"
&quot; And what about the rest of hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s acti@@ vi@@ ties ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not interest@@ ed in them . &quot;
"&quot; You &apos;ve looked at them all , have you ? &quot;"
&quot; No . Not exactly . &quot;
P@@ assion is your gre@@ at@@ est love .
P@@ assion is the thing that will help you create the high@@ est ex@@ pres@@ sion of your tal@@ ent .
"@@ P@@ assion , inter@@ est — it &apos;s not the same thing ."
"A@@ re you really going to go to your s@@ wee@@ ti@@ e and say , &quot; Mar@@ ry me ! You &apos;re interesting . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ on &apos;t happen .
"W@@ on &apos;t happen , and you will die al@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) What you want , what you want , what you want , is p@@ assion ."
It is be@@ y@@ on@@ d inter@@ est .
"You need 20 interest@@ s , and then one of them , one of them might gra@@ b you , one of them might eng@@ age you more than anything else , and then you may have found your gre@@ at@@ est love , in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to all the other things that inter@@ est you , and that &apos;s what p@@ assion is ."
"I have a fri@@ end , pro@@ posed to his s@@ wee@@ ti@@ e ."
He was an econom@@ ically r@@ ational person .
"He said to his s@@ wee@@ ti@@ e , &quot; &quot; Let us mar@@ ry ."
"@@ Let us mer@@ ge our interest@@ s . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Y@@ es , he did ."
"&quot; &quot; I love you tru@@ ly , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; I love you de@@ e@@ ply ."
I love you more than any other woman I &apos;ve ever en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed .
"I love you more than M@@ ary , J@@ an@@ e , Su@@ si@@ e , P@@ en@@ el@@ op@@ e , In@@ g@@ ri@@ d , G@@ er@@ tru@@ de , G@@ re@@ te@@ l — I was on a G@@ er@@ man ex@@ change program then ."
I love you more than — &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right .
"A@@ f@@ ter he got over his surpri@@ se at being , you know , tur@@ ned down , he con@@ clu@@ ded he &apos;d had a n@@ ar@@ row es@@ cap@@ e from mar@@ r@@ ying an ir@@ r@@ ational person ."
"A@@ l@@ though , he did make a n@@ ote to h@@ im@@ self that the next time he pro@@ posed , it was perhaps not nec@@ ess@@ ary to en@@ um@@ er@@ ate all of the women he had au@@ di@@ tion@@ ed for the part ."
( Laughter ) But the point st@@ ands .
"You must look for al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves so that you find your dest@@ iny , or are you af@@ ra@@ id of the word &quot; &quot; dest@@ iny &quot; &quot; ?"
D@@ o@@ es the word &quot; &quot; dest@@ iny &quot; &quot; sc@@ are you ?
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
"And if you don &apos;t find the high@@ est ex@@ pres@@ sion of your tal@@ ent , if you se@@ ttle for &quot; &quot; interesting , &quot; &quot; what the h@@ ell ever that means , do you know what will happen at the end of your long life ?"
One was a great care@@ er .
One was a mis@@ sed op@@ port@@ unity .
"But then , there are some of you who , in sp@@ ite of all these exc@@ us@@ es , you will find , you will find your p@@ assion ."
And you &apos;ll still fa@@ il .
"You &apos;re going to fa@@ il , because — because you &apos;re not going to do it , because you will have inv@@ en@@ ted a new exc@@ use , any exc@@ use to fa@@ il to take action , and this exc@@ use , I &apos;ve heard so many times : &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , I would pur@@ sue a great care@@ er , but , I value human relation@@ shi@@ ps — ( Laughter ) more than ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment ."
I want to be a great fri@@ end .
I want to be a great sp@@ ouse .
"I want to be a great paren@@ t , and I will not s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice them on the al@@ t@@ ar of great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What do you want me to say ?"
"Now , do you really want me to say now , tell you , &quot; R@@ e@@ ally , I s@@ we@@ ar I don &apos;t k@@ ick children . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Lo@@ ok at the wor@@ l@@ d@@ view you &apos;ve given yourself .
You &apos;re a her@@ o no matter what .
I don &apos;t h@@ ate children . I don &apos;t k@@ ick them .
"( Laughter ) C@@ our@@ se , I had to tell him the building was for ad@@ ults only , and to get out ."
"He m@@ um@@ bl@@ ed something about his mother , and I told him she &apos;d probably find him outside any@@ way ."
"@@ L@@ ast time I saw him , he was on the sta@@ ir@@ s cr@@ ying ."
( Laughter ) What a w@@ im@@ p . ( Laughter )
But what do you mean ? That &apos;s what you exp@@ ect me to say .
Do you really think it &apos;s appro@@ pri@@ ate that you should actually take children and use them as a shi@@ el@@ d ?
"You know what will happen some@@ day , you ide@@ al paren@@ t , you ?"
"The k@@ id will come to you some@@ day and say , &quot; &quot; I know what I want to be ."
I know what I &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot; &quot; You are so happy .
"It &apos;s the con@@ vers@@ ation a paren@@ t wan@@ ts to hear , because your k@@ id &apos;s good in mat@@ h , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next ."
"S@@ ays your k@@ id , &quot; &quot; I have decided I want to be a mag@@ ici@@ an ."
I want to per@@ form mag@@ ic tr@@ ic@@ ks on the st@@ age . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And what do you say ?
"You say , you say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ sk@@ y , k@@ id ."
"M@@ ight fa@@ il , k@@ id . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , k@@ id ."
"I don &apos;t know , k@@ id , you should think about that again , k@@ id ."
And what are you going to say ?
You know what you &apos;re going to say ?
"&quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok k@@ id . I had a dre@@ am once , too , but — But — &quot; &quot; So how are you going to fin@@ ish the s@@ ent@@ ence with your &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; ?"
"&quot; But . I had a dre@@ am too , once , k@@ id , but I was af@@ ra@@ id to pur@@ sue it . &quot;"
"O@@ r are you going to tell him this : &quot; &quot; I had a dre@@ am once , k@@ id ."
"But then , you were born . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Do you really want to use your family , do you really ever want to look at your sp@@ ouse and your k@@ id , and see your j@@ a@@ il@@ ers ?"
"There was something you could have said to your k@@ id , when he or she said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; You could have said — looked the k@@ id in the face and said , &quot; &quot; G@@ o for it , k@@ id !@@ "
"@@ J@@ ust like I did . &quot; &quot; But you won &apos;t be able to say that , because you didn &apos;t ."
So you can &apos;t .
( Laughter ) And so the s@@ ins of the parents are vi@@ s@@ ited on the po@@ or children .
Why will you see@@ k re@@ fu@@ ge in human relation@@ shi@@ ps as your exc@@ use not to find and pur@@ sue your p@@ assion ?
You know why .
"In your heart of hear@@ ts , you know why , and I &apos;m being de@@ ad@@ ly ser@@ i@@ ous ."
You know why you would get all war@@ m and fu@@ z@@ zy and w@@ ra@@ p yourself up in human relation@@ shi@@ ps .
It is because you are — you know what you are .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id to pur@@ sue your p@@ assion .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id to look ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id to try .
You &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id you may fa@@ il .
"@@ G@@ re@@ at fri@@ end , great sp@@ ouse , great paren@@ t , great care@@ er ."
I@@ s that not a p@@ ac@@ k@@ age ? I@@ s that not who you are ?
How can you be one without the other ?
But you &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id .
And that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great care@@ er .
"@@ Un@@ less — &quot; &quot; un@@ less , &quot; &quot; that most ev@@ oc@@ ative of all English words — &quot; un@@ less . &quot;"
"But the &quot; &quot; un@@ less &quot; &quot; word is also att@@ ach@@ ed to that other , most ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying ph@@ ra@@ se , &quot; If only I had ... &quot; &quot; If only I had ... &quot;"
"If you ever have that thought r@@ ic@@ o@@ che@@ ting in your brain ,"
it will h@@ ur@@ t a lot .
"So , those are the many reas@@ ons why you are going to fa@@ il to have a great care@@ er ."
Un@@ less — Un@@ less .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , &quot; when he insp@@ i@@ red the civi@@ l ri@@ gh@@ ts mov@@ em@@ ents ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are , and this is going to be a chall@@ en@@ ge , because , if you think of every maj@@ or bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ st@@ ing f@@ il@@ m of rec@@ ent times , ne@@ arly all of its vi@@ sions for hum@@ an@@ ity are ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic ."
"I think this f@@ il@@ m is one of the har@@ d@@ est wat@@ ch@@ es of moder@@ n times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of f@@ il@@ m@@ making , but everything is des@@ ol@@ ate , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to survi@@ ve , wal@@ king along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement of which I am a part of has been comp@@ lic@@ it in cre@@ ating this vi@@ sion of the future .
"For too long , we have pe@@ dd@@ led a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ mar@@ ish vi@@ sion of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have fo@@ c@@ used on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
We have fo@@ c@@ used on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solu@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s att@@ en@@ tion ."
And any psycho@@ logi@@ st will tell you that fear in the org@@ an@@ ism is l@@ in@@ ked to f@@ light m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism , that when an anim@@ al is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er f@@ re@@ e@@ z@@ es very , very still , po@@ is@@ ed to run away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re as@@ king people to eng@@ age with our ag@@ en@@ d@@ a around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation and c@@ lim@@ ate change .
People are f@@ re@@ e@@ zing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be impro@@ ving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the market in ter@@ ms of progress is a fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al defin@@ i@@ tion of what progress is , an economic defin@@ i@@ tion of what progress is — that some@@ how , if we get the right num@@ bers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the st@@ oc@@ k market , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic grow@@ th , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how appe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fear — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . I@@ n the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world , we have enough ."
"M@@ ay@@ be some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of n@@ ations .
"In fact , the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect of our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system , S@@ im@@ on K@@ u@@ z@@ ne@@ ts , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A n@@ ation &apos;s w@@ el@@ f@@ are can sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve cre@@ ated a national ac@@ coun@@ ting system which is fir@@ m@@ ly bas@@ ed on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , this is probably hi@@ st@@ or@@ ical , and it had its time ."
"In the second W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , we needed to pro@@ duce a lot of stuff ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , we were so suc@@ cess@@ ful at produc@@ ing certain typ@@ es of stuff that we dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed a lot of Euro@@ pe , and we had to re@@ build it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system bec@@ ame fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can pro@@ duce .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vi@@ si@@ on@@ ary man , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy , at the start of his ill@@ -@@ f@@ ated pre@@ si@@ d@@ ential cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n , gave the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent d@@ econ@@ struc@@ tion of gr@@ oss national produc@@ t that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ i@@ shed his talk with the ph@@ ra@@ se , that , &quot; &quot; The gr@@ oss national produc@@ t meas@@ ures everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How crazy is that ? That our measure of progress , our dom@@ in@@ ant measure of progress in society , is meas@@ uring everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy was ali@@ ve today , he would be as@@ king st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans such as my@@ self to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be as@@ king us to re@@ desig@@ n our national ac@@ coun@@ ting system to be bas@@ ed up@@ on such important things as social j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability and people &apos;s well@@ -@@ being ."
"And actually , social scienti@@ sts have already g@@ one out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global sur@@ v@@ ey .
"It &apos;s as@@ king people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ surpri@@ sing@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their fam@@ ili@@ es , their children , their comm@@ uni@@ ties ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is s@@ ligh@@ tly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be lo@@ ved in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ arly as important as health .
We want to be health@@ y and live a ful@@ l life .
Th@@ ese seem to be natural human as@@ p@@ ir@@ ations .
Why are st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans not meas@@ uring these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the progress of n@@ ations in these ter@@ ms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my ad@@ ult life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well@@ -@@ being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental lim@@ its ."
"And we cre@@ ated , at the organi@@ zation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ om@@ ics F@@ ound@@ ation , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ tim@@ ate out@@ come of a n@@ ation is how suc@@ cess@@ ful is it at cre@@ ating happy and health@@ y lives for its ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
That should be the go@@ al of every n@@ ation on the planet .
"But we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s res@@ our@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ tim@@ ate sc@@ ar@@ ce res@@ our@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And econom@@ ics is very interest@@ ed in sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity .
"When it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce res@@ our@@ ce that it wan@@ ts to turn into a des@@ ir@@ able out@@ come , it thin@@ ks in ter@@ ms of eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y ."
It thin@@ ks in ter@@ ms of how much b@@ ang do we get for our b@@ uc@@ k .
And this is a measure of how much well@@ -@@ being we get for our plan@@ et@@ ary res@@ our@@ ce use .
It is an eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y measure .
"And probably the eas@@ i@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this grap@@ h ."
"R@@ un@@ ning h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ t@@ ally along the grap@@ h , is &quot; &quot; ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much res@@ our@@ ces we use and how much pres@@ sure we put on the planet ."
M@@ ore is bad .
"R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ tic@@ ally up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well@@ -@@ being of n@@ ations ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ ju@@ sted li@@ fe@@ -@@ exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ty of life in n@@ ations .
"And the y@@ el@@ low do@@ t there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a huge ar@@ r@@ ay of n@@ ations around that global average ."
"T@@ o the top right of the grap@@ h , are countries which are doing reas@@ on@@ ably well and produc@@ ing well@@ -@@ being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.@@ S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other W@@ est@@ er@@ n countries going across in those tri@@ ang@@ les and a few G@@ ul@@ f st@@ ates in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ se@@ ly , at the bot@@ tom left of the grap@@ h , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well@@ -@@ being — t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ."
"In H@@ ob@@ b@@ es@@ i@@ an ter@@ ms , life is sh@@ ort and br@@ u@@ ti@@ sh there ."
The average life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"M@@ al@@ ari@@ a , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are k@@ ill@@ ing a lot of people in these re@@ gi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ el@@ low tri@@ ang@@ les , that are doing better than global average , that are he@@ ad@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the grap@@ h ."
This is an as@@ p@@ ir@@ ational grap@@ h .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t c@@ ost the ear@@ th ."
They &apos;re L@@ ati@@ n American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I ha@@ ven &apos;t been to .
M@@ ay@@ be some of you have .
C@@ os@@ t@@ a R@@ ic@@ a .
C@@ os@@ t@@ a R@@ ic@@ a — average life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the l@@ at@@ est G@@ all@@ up world p@@ ol@@ l , the happ@@ i@@ est n@@ ation on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
They are doing that on a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the res@@ our@@ ces that are used t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; W@@ est@@ er@@ n world — a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the res@@ our@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ os@@ t@@ a R@@ ic@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their electr@@ ic@@ ity comes from re@@ ne@@ w@@ able res@@ our@@ ces .
Th@@ e@@ ir government is one of the first to comm@@ it to be car@@ b@@ on ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They abo@@ li@@ shed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they inv@@ est@@ ed in social pro@@ gr@@ ams — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ acy r@@ ates in L@@ ati@@ n America and in the world .
"And they have that L@@ ati@@ n vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The chall@@ en@@ ge is , that possi@@ bly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be N@@ or@@ th American , might not be W@@ est@@ er@@ n Euro@@ pe@@ an ."
It might be L@@ ati@@ n American .
"And the chall@@ en@@ ge , really , is to pul@@ l the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pul@@ l countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pul@@ l countries from the right of the grap@@ h ."
And then we &apos;re star@@ ting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ no@@ ther way of looking at it is looking at time tre@@ n@@ ds .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tre@@ nd in well@@ -@@ being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tre@@ nd in ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t ."
"And so in str@@ ic@@ t happ@@ y-@@ planet me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ logy , we &apos;ve become less eff@@ ici@@ ent at tur@@ ning our ul@@ tim@@ ate sc@@ ar@@ ce res@@ our@@ ce into the out@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child en@@ ter@@ ing school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dist@@ ant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . government t@@ ar@@ get on car@@ b@@ on and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ouse em@@ is@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not business as u@@ su@@ al ."
That is chang@@ ing our business .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organi@@ z@@ ations , we do our government po@@ lic@@ y and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on increas@@ ing well@@ -@@ being ."
No one can go to the p@@ ol@@ ls and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to re@@ duce .
"@@ N@@ one of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of hum@@ an@@ ity to keep on increas@@ ing .
And I think this is where c@@ lim@@ ate change s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep increas@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to eng@@ age them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to d@@ ra@@ w grap@@ h@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a le@@ a@@ f out of syst@@ ems theory , syst@@ ems engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings are very moti@@ v@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a smar@@ t me@@ ter in your home , and you see how much electr@@ ic@@ ity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s cos@@ ting you , your kids go around and turn the ligh@@ ts off pretty qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the radi@@ o news every even@@ ing , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the dol@@ l@@ ar p@@ ound r@@ ati@@ o — I don &apos;t even know which way the dol@@ l@@ ar p@@ ound r@@ ati@@ o should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy B@@ r@@ it@@ ain used y@@ est@@ er@@ day , or American used y@@ est@@ er@@ day ?"
D@@ id we me@@ et our three percent an@@ n@@ u@@ al t@@ ar@@ get on re@@ duc@@ ing car@@ b@@ on em@@ is@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a coll@@ ec@@ tive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the me@@ dia and start thinking about it .
"And we need posi@@ tive fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s for increas@@ ing well@@ -@@ being A@@ t a government level , they might create national ac@@ coun@@ ts of well@@ -@@ being ."
"A@@ t a business level , you might look at the well@@ -@@ being of your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , which we know is really l@@ in@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is l@@ in@@ ked to in@@ no@@ v@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental is@@ su@@ es ."
"A@@ t a pers@@ onal level , we need these n@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es too ."
"M@@ ay@@ be we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ d@@ ers ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a str@@ ong public health mess@@ age on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les a day and how much ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happ@@ ier ?
"We did a pro@@ ject for the G@@ over@@ n@@ ment O@@ ff@@ ice of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big program called the F@@ o@@ re@@ sight program — lots and lots of people — inv@@ ol@@ ved lots of exper@@ ts — everything evidence bas@@ ed — a huge t@@ ome ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five posi@@ tive ac@@ tions can you do to impro@@ ve well@@ -@@ being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the sec@@ re@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will f@@ low out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to con@@ n@@ ect , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of your life ."
"D@@ o you inv@@ est the time with your lo@@ ved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep building them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fa@@ st@@ est way out of a bad mo@@ od : ste@@ p outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the radi@@ o on and d@@ ance ."
B@@ e@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our posi@@ tive mo@@ od .
The thir@@ d one is take not@@ ice .
"@@ How aw@@ are are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you not@@ ice what &apos;s bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up for you and trying to em@@ er@@ ge ?
"B@@ as@@ ed on a lot of evidence for min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , cogni@@ tive behavi@@ or@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; str@@ ong for our well being ."
The f@@ our@@ th is keep learning and keep is important — learning thr@@ ough@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cur@@ i@@ ous , they have much better health out@@ comes than those who start to cl@@ ose down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be form@@ al learning ; it &apos;s not knowledge bas@@ ed .
It &apos;s more cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to co@@ ok a new dis@@ h , pic@@ king up an in@@ str@@ ument you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fin@@ al one is that most an@@ ti@@ -@@ economic of acti@@ vi@@ ties , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tru@@ ism , our comp@@ assion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two grou@@ ps of people a hundred dollars in the mor@@ ning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have g@@ one and sp@@ ent on other people are much happ@@ ier that those that sp@@ ent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these h@@ an@@ dy pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to c@@ ost the ear@@ th ."
They don &apos;t have any car@@ b@@ on cont@@ ent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ o@@ ds to be s@@ atis@@ fied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite fe@@ as@@ i@@ ble that happiness does not c@@ ost the ear@@ th .
"Now , Mar@@ ti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , on the e@@ ve of his death , gave an incredi@@ ble spe@@ ec@@ h ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I know there are chall@@ eng@@ es a@@ head , there may be tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care ."
"I have been to the m@@ oun@@ tain top , and I have seen the P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ed L@@ and . &quot; &quot; Now , he was a pre@@ acher , but I believe the environ@@ mental mov@@ ement and , in fact , the business comm@@ unity , government , nee@@ ds to go to the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain top , and it nee@@ ds to look out , and it nee@@ ds to see the P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ed L@@ and , or the land of prom@@ ise , and it nee@@ ds to have a vi@@ sion of a world that we all want ."
"And not only that , we need to create a G@@ re@@ at T@@ ran@@ si@@ tion to get there , and we need to p@@ ave that great tran@@ si@@ tion with good things ."
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings want to be happy .
P@@ ave them with the five ways .
And we need to have si@@ gn@@ pos@@ ts g@@ ath@@ ering people together and poin@@ ting them — something like the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x .
"And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not c@@ ost the ear@@ th ."

There is no or@@ che@@ str@@ a conduc@@ tor .

And you can never re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate that per@@ form@@ ance tw@@ ice .
It is not about doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ation and con@@ tr@@ act .
It &apos;s about con@@ vers@@ ation and fa@@ ith .
"It &apos;s not about comp@@ li@@ ance . It &apos;s about se@@ tting , getting the job done , by b@@ en@@ ding or bre@@ a@@ king the r@@ ul@@ es — just look at your In@@ di@@ an people around here , you &apos;ll see them s@@ mi@@ le ; they know what it is ."

"But on the right , you have the students with the grow@@ th min@@ d@@ set , the idea that abili@@ ties can be develop@@ ed ."
A@@ re we ra@@ is@@ ing them for now instead of yet ?
How can we build that bri@@ dge to yet ?
There are other ways to re@@ ward yet .
"In this g@@ ame , students were re@@ war@@ ded for eff@@ ort , str@@ ate@@ gy and progress ."
So the N@@ ative kids out@@ did the M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ of@@ t kids .
That &apos;s when they &apos;re getting smar@@ ter .
Do you remember the story of O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us and the S@@ i@@ re@@ ns from high school or j@@ uni@@ or high school ?
"There was this her@@ o , O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us , who &apos;s he@@ ad@@ ing back home after the T@@ ro@@ j@@ an W@@ ar ."
"And he &apos;s st@@ anding on the dec@@ k of his ship , he &apos;s talking to his first m@@ ate , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; T@@ om@@ or@@ row , we will sa@@ il past those ro@@ c@@ ks , and on those ro@@ c@@ ks s@@ it some beautiful women called S@@ i@@ re@@ ns ."
"And these women sing an en@@ chan@@ ting s@@ ong , a s@@ ong so all@@ uring that all sa@@ il@@ ors who hear it cr@@ as@@ h into the ro@@ c@@ ks and die . &quot; &quot; Now you would exp@@ ect , given that , that they would cho@@ ose an al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate r@@ out@@ e around the S@@ i@@ re@@ ns , but instead O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us says , &quot; &quot; I want to hear that s@@ ong ."
"And so what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to p@@ our wa@@ x in the ear@@ s of you and all the men — st@@ ay with me — so that you can &apos;t hear the s@@ ong , and then I &apos;m going to have you ti@@ e me to the m@@ ast so that I can li@@ st@@ en and we can all sa@@ il by un@@ aff@@ ected . &quot; &quot; So this is a cap@@ tain pu@@ tting the life of every single person on the ship at ri@@ s@@ k so that he can hear a s@@ ong ."
"And I &apos;d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have re@@ hear@@ sed it a few times ."
"O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us would have said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , let &apos;s do a d@@ ry run ."
"You ti@@ e me to the m@@ ast , and I &apos;m going to be@@ g and ple@@ ad ."
"And no matter what I say , you cannot un@@ ti@@ e me from the m@@ ast ."
"A@@ ll right , so ti@@ e me to the m@@ ast . &quot; &quot; And the first m@@ ate ta@@ kes a ro@@ pe and ties O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us to the m@@ ast in a n@@ ice k@@ not ."
"And O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us does his best job play@@ ac@@ ting and says , &quot; &quot; Un@@ ti@@ e me . Un@@ ti@@ e me ."
I want to hear that s@@ ong . Un@@ ti@@ e me . &quot; &quot; And the first m@@ ate wi@@ se@@ ly re@@ si@@ sts and doesn &apos;t un@@ ti@@ e O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us .
"And then O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us says , &quot; &quot; I see that you can get it ."
"A@@ ll right , un@@ ti@@ e me now and we &apos;ll get some d@@ in@@ ner . &quot; &quot; And the first m@@ ate h@@ es@@ it@@ ates ."
"He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this still the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al , or should I un@@ ti@@ e him ? &quot; &quot; And the first m@@ ate thin@@ ks , &quot; Well , I gu@@ ess at some point the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al has to end . &quot;"
"So he un@@ ties O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us , and O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us f@@ li@@ ps out ."
"He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You i@@ di@@ ot . You mor@@ on ."
"If you do that tom@@ or@@ row , I &apos;ll be de@@ ad , you &apos;ll be de@@ ad , every single one of the men will be de@@ ad ."
Now just don &apos;t un@@ ti@@ e me no matter what . &quot; &quot; He th@@ ro@@ ws the first m@@ ate to the ground .
"This re@@ pe@@ at@@ s itself through the night — re@@ hear@@ s@@ al , t@@ ying to the m@@ ast , con@@ ning his way out of it , be@@ ating the po@@ or first m@@ ate up mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess@@ ly ."
H@@ il@@ ar@@ ity en@@ su@@ es .
T@@ ying yourself to a m@@ ast is perhaps the ol@@ d@@ est wr@@ it@@ ten example of what psycho@@ logi@@ sts call a comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ice .
A comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ice is a deci@@ sion that you make with a co@@ ol head to b@@ ind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something re@@ gre@@ tt@@ able when you have a ho@@ t head .
Because there &apos;s two he@@ ads inside one person when you think about it .
S@@ cho@@ lars have long inv@@ o@@ ked this me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or of two selves when it comes to questions of t@@ emp@@ t@@ ation .
"There is first , the present self ."
This is like O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us when he &apos;s hear@@ ing the s@@ ong .
He just wan@@ ts to get to the front row .
He just thin@@ ks about the here and now and the im@@ me@@ di@@ ate gr@@ ati@@ fic@@ ation .
"But then there &apos;s this other self , the future self ."
This is O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us as an old man who wan@@ ts nothing more than to re@@ ti@@ re in a s@@ un@@ n@@ y vill@@ a with his wi@@ fe P@@ en@@ el@@ op@@ e outside of I@@ th@@ ac@@ a — the other one .
So why do we need comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices ?
"Well re@@ sist@@ ing t@@ emp@@ t@@ ation is hard , as the 19@@ th century English econom@@ ist N@@ as@@ sa@@ u W@@ illi@@ am S@@ en@@ i@@ or said , &quot; &quot; T@@ o ab@@ st@@ ain from the en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment which is in our power , or to see@@ k dist@@ ant rather than im@@ me@@ di@@ ate res@@ ults , are am@@ ong the most pain@@ ful ex@@ er@@ tions of the human will . &quot; &quot; If you set go@@ als for yourself and you &apos;re like a lot of other people , you probably reali@@ ze it &apos;s not that your go@@ als are phys@@ ically im@@ possible that &apos;s ke@@ e@@ ping you from achi@@ ev@@ ing them , it &apos;s that you l@@ ack the self-@@ di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine to s@@ tic@@ k to them ."
It &apos;s phys@@ ically possible to l@@ ose we@@ ight .
It &apos;s phys@@ ically possible to ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se more .
But re@@ sist@@ ing t@@ emp@@ t@@ ation is hard .
The other reason that it &apos;s difficult to re@@ si@@ st t@@ emp@@ t@@ ation is because it &apos;s an un@@ equ@@ al b@@ att@@ le between the present self and the future self .
"I mean , let &apos;s face it , the present self is present ."
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
"It has these str@@ ong , her@@ o@@ ic ar@@ ms that can li@@ ft d@@ ough@@ n@@ u@@ ts into your m@@ ou@@ th ."
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s we@@ ak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a la@@ w@@ y@@ er present .
There &apos;s no@@ body to s@@ tic@@ k up for the future self .
And so the present self can tr@@ oun@@ ce all over its dre@@ ams .
"So there &apos;s this b@@ att@@ le between the two selves that &apos;s being f@@ ought , and we need comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices to level the play@@ ing field between the two ."
Now I &apos;m a big f@@ an of comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices actually .
"T@@ ying yourself to the m@@ ast is the ol@@ d@@ est one , but there are other ones such as loc@@ king a cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard away with a k@@ ey or not br@@ ing@@ ing j@@ un@@ k food into the h@@ ouse so you won &apos;t e@@ at it or un@@ pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ing your In@@ ter@@ net connec@@ tion so you can use your computer ."
I was cre@@ ating comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices of my own long before I knew what they were .
"So when I was a star@@ ving pos@@ t-@@ do@@ c at C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity , I was de@@ ep in a publi@@ sh@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ per@@ ish p@@ ha@@ se of my care@@ er ."
I had to wr@@ ite five p@@ ages a day to@@ wards p@@ ap@@ ers or I would have to give up five dollars .
"And when you try to ex@@ ec@@ ute these comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices , you reali@@ ze the de@@ vi@@ l is really in the deta@@ il@@ s ."
Because it &apos;s not that easy to get ri@@ d of five dollars .
"I mean , you can &apos;t bur@@ n it ; that &apos;s il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"And I thought , well I could give it to a char@@ ity or give it to my wi@@ fe or something like that ."
"But then I thought , o@@ h , I &apos;m sen@@ ding my@@ self mi@@ x@@ ed mess@@ ages ."
"Because not wr@@ iting is bad , but giving to char@@ ity is good ."
So then I would kind of j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y not wr@@ iting by giving a gi@@ ft .
"And then I kind of f@@ li@@ p@@ ped that around and thought , well I could give it to the ne@@ o@@ -@@ N@@ az@@ is ."
"But then I was like , that &apos;s more bad than wr@@ iting is good , and so that wouldn &apos;t work ."
"So ul@@ tim@@ ately , I just decided I would leave it in an en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e on the sub@@ way ."
"S@@ ome@@ times a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it ."
"O@@ n average , it was just a completely po@@ int@@ less ex@@ change of money that I would re@@ gre@@ t ."
( Laughter ) S@@ uch it is with comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices .
"But des@@ p@@ ite my like for them , there &apos;s two n@@ ag@@ g@@ ing con@@ cer@@ ns that I &apos;ve always had about comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself ."
"So the first is , when you &apos;ve got one of these dev@@ ices going , such as this con@@ tr@@ act to wr@@ ite every@@ day or p@@ ay , it &apos;s just a con@@ st@@ ant re@@ min@@ der that you have no self-@@ control ."
"You &apos;re just t@@ elling yourself , &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ out you , comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ice , I am nothing , I have no self-@@ di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; And then when you &apos;re ever in a sit@@ u@@ ation where you don &apos;t have a comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ice in place — like , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , that person &apos;s off@@ ering me a d@@ ough@@ n@@ ut , and I have no de@@ f@@ en@@ se m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism , &quot; &quot; — you just e@@ at it ."
So I don &apos;t like the way that they take the power away from you .
"I think self-@@ di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine is something , it &apos;s like a mu@@ sc@@ le ."
"The more you ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se it , the stron@@ ger it gets ."
The other problem with comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices is that you can always we@@ as@@ el your way out of them .
"You say , &quot; &quot; Well , of course I can &apos;t wr@@ ite today , because I &apos;m giving a TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ k and I have five me@@ dia inter@@ vie@@ ws , and then I &apos;m going to a co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ty and then I &apos;ll be dr@@ un@@ k after that ."
"And so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot; &quot; So in eff@@ ect , you are like O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ us and the first m@@ ate in one person ."
"You &apos;re pu@@ tting yourself , you &apos;re b@@ in@@ ding yourself , and you &apos;re we@@ as@@ el@@ ing your way out of it , and then you &apos;re be@@ ating yourself up af@@ ter@@ wards ."
So I &apos;ve been working for about a dec@@ ad@@ e now on fin@@ ding other ways to change people &apos;s relation@@ ship to the future self without using comm@@ it@@ ment dev@@ ices .
"In particular , I &apos;m interest@@ ed in the relation@@ ship to the future fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al self ."
And this is a ti@@ me@@ ly is@@ sue .
I &apos;m talking about the t@@ op@@ ic of sa@@ ving .
Now sa@@ ving is a cl@@ assi@@ c two selves problem .
The present self does not want to sa@@ ve at all .
It wan@@ ts to con@@ su@@ me .
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the future self wan@@ ts the present self to sa@@ ve .
So this is a ti@@ me@@ ly problem .
We look at the sa@@ v@@ ings r@@ ate and it has been dec@@ l@@ in@@ ing since the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
"A@@ t the same time , the R@@ e@@ ti@@ re@@ ment R@@ is@@ k In@@ de@@ x , the chan@@ ce of not being able to me@@ et your nee@@ ds in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , has been increas@@ ing ."
"And we &apos;re at a sit@@ u@@ ation now where for every three b@@ ab@@ y bo@@ om@@ ers , the M@@ c@@ K@@ in@@ se@@ y G@@ lob@@ al In@@ stitu@@ te predic@@ ts that two will not be able to me@@ et their pre@@ -@@ re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment nee@@ ds while they &apos;re in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
So what can we do about this ?
"There &apos;s a philosop@@ her , D@@ er@@ e@@ k P@@ ar@@ f@@ it , who said some words that were insp@@ ir@@ ing to my co@@ au@@ th@@ ors and I@@ ."
"He said that , &quot; &quot; We might ne@@ gl@@ ect our future selves because of some fa@@ il@@ ure of belie@@ f or imag@@ in@@ ation . &quot; &quot; That is to say , we some@@ how might not believe that we &apos;re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we &apos;re going to get old some day ."
"O@@ n the one hand , it s@@ ounds ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous ."
"O@@ f course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old ."
But are@@ n &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
"So my co@@ au@@ th@@ ors and I have used compu@@ ters , the gre@@ at@@ est to@@ ol of our time , to assi@@ st people &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future ."
And I &apos;ll show you some of these to@@ ols right here .
The first is called the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion buil@@ der .
It sho@@ ws people what the future might be like by sho@@ wing them a hundred equ@@ ally prob@@ able out@@ comes that might be ob@@ tain@@ ed in the future .
"E@@ ach out@@ come is sho@@ wn by one of these mark@@ ers , and each s@@ its on a row that re@@ pres@@ ents a level of we@@ al@@ th and re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
B@@ e@@ ing up at the top means that you &apos;re en@@ jo@@ ying a high income in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
B@@ e@@ ing down at the bot@@ tom means that you &apos;re str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling to make ends me@@ et .
"When you make an inv@@ est@@ ment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; I ac@@ cept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine my we@@ al@@ th . &quot; &quot; Now you can try to move your out@@ comes around ."
"You can try to man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate your f@@ ate , like this person is doing , but it cos@@ ts you something to do it ."
It means that you have to sa@@ ve more today .
"O@@ n@@ ce you find an inv@@ est@@ ment that you &apos;re happy with , what people do is they c@@ lic@@ k &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; and the mark@@ ers beg@@ in to dis@@ appe@@ ar , s@@ low@@ ly , one by one ."
It sim@@ ul@@ ates what it is like to inv@@ est in something and to wat@@ ch that inv@@ est@@ ment p@@ an out .
"A@@ t the end , there will only be one mark@@ er left st@@ anding and it will de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine our we@@ al@@ th in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
"Y@@ es , this person re@@ ti@@ red at 1@@ 50 percent of their working income in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
They &apos;re making more money while re@@ ti@@ red than they were making while they were working .
"If you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of el@@ ation and jo@@ y — just to think about making 50 percent more money in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment than before ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , had you en@@ ded up on the very bot@@ tom , it might have given you a s@@ light sense of dre@@ ad and / or n@@ au@@ se@@ a thinking about str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling to get by in re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment ."
"B@@ y using this to@@ ol over and over and sim@@ ul@@ ating out@@ come after out@@ come , people can understand that the inv@@ est@@ ments and sa@@ v@@ ings that they under@@ take today de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine their well@@ -@@ being in the future ."
"Now people are moti@@ v@@ ated through emoti@@ ons , but different people find different things moti@@ v@@ ating ."
"This is a sim@@ ulation that us@@ es grap@@ h@@ ics , but other people find moti@@ v@@ ating what money can bu@@ y , not just num@@ bers ."
"So here I made a dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion buil@@ der where instead of sho@@ wing num@@ er@@ ical out@@ comes , I show people what those out@@ comes will get you , in particular ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments that you can aff@@ or@@ d if you &apos;re re@@ ti@@ r@@ ing on 3@@ ,000 , 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 , 2@@ ,000 dollars per mon@@ th and so on ."
"As you move down the l@@ ad@@ der of ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments , you see that they get wor@@ se and wor@@ se ."
S@@ ome of them look like places I li@@ ved in as a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent .
"And as you get to the very bot@@ tom , you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate reality that if you don &apos;t sa@@ ve anything for re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , you won &apos;t be able to aff@@ or@@ d any h@@ ous@@ ing at all ."
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tual pic@@ tures of ac@@ tual ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments ren@@ ting for that amount as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sed on the In@@ ter@@ net .
"The last thing I &apos;ll show you , the last behavi@@ or@@ al time machine , is something that I cre@@ ated with H@@ al H@@ er@@ sh@@ field , who was int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed to me by my co@@ au@@ th@@ or on a pre@@ vi@@ ous pro@@ ject , B@@ ill S@@ har@@ pe ."
And what it is is an expl@@ or@@ ation into vir@@ tual reality .
"So what we do is we take pic@@ tures of people — in this case , colle@@ ge@@ -@@ age people — and we use so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to age them and show these people what they &apos;ll look like when they &apos;re 60 , 7@@ 0 , 80 years old ."
And we try to test whether actually assi@@ st@@ ing your imag@@ in@@ ation by looking at the face of your future self can change you inv@@ est@@ ment behavior .
So this is one of our experim@@ ents .
Here we see the face of the young sub@@ ject on the left .
He &apos;s given a control that al@@ lo@@ ws him to ad@@ just his sa@@ v@@ ings r@@ ate .
"As he mo@@ ves his sa@@ v@@ ings r@@ ate down , it means that he &apos;s sa@@ ving z@@ er@@ o when it &apos;s all the way here at the left ."
"You can see his curren@@ t an@@ n@@ u@@ al income — this is the per@@ cent@@ age of his p@@ ay@@ ch@@ ec@@ k that he can take home today — is quite high , 9@@ 1 percent , but his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment income is quite low ."
He &apos;s going to re@@ ti@@ re on 4@@ 4 percent of what he ear@@ ned while he was working .
"If he sa@@ ves the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um le@@ g@@ al amount , his re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment income goes up , but he &apos;s un@@ happy because now he has less money on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side to sp@@ end today ."
O@@ ther condi@@ tions show people the future self .
"And from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in re@@ ver@@ se ."
"If you sa@@ ve very little , the future self is un@@ happy living on 4@@ 4 percent of the income ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as if the present self sa@@ ves a lot , the future self is de@@ ligh@@ ted , where the income is cl@@ ose up ne@@ ar 100 percent ."
"T@@ o bring this to a wi@@ der au@@ dience , I &apos;ve been working with H@@ al and A@@ l@@ li@@ an@@ z to create something we call the behavi@@ or@@ al time machine , in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated emoti@@ onal re@@ ac@@ tions to different lev@@ els of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment we@@ al@@ th ."
"So for inst@@ ance , here is somebody using the to@@ ol ."
And just wat@@ ch the fac@@ i@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions as they move the sli@@ der .
"The youn@@ ger face gets happ@@ ier and happ@@ ier , sa@@ ving nothing ."
The ol@@ der face is mis@@ er@@ able .
"And s@@ low@@ ly , s@@ low@@ ly we &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing it up to a moder@@ ate sa@@ v@@ ings r@@ ate ."
And then it &apos;s a high sa@@ v@@ ings r@@ ate .
The youn@@ ger face is getting un@@ happy .
The ol@@ der face is quite ple@@ as@@ ed with the deci@@ sion .
We &apos;re going to see if this has an eff@@ ect on what people do .
"And what &apos;s n@@ ice about it is it &apos;s not something that bi@@ as@@ ing people actually , because as one face sm@@ il@@ es , the other face f@@ ro@@ w@@ ns ."
"It &apos;s not t@@ elling you which way to put the sli@@ der , it &apos;s just re@@ min@@ ding you that you are connec@@ ted to and le@@ g@@ ally ti@@ ed to this future self ."
Y@@ our deci@@ sions today are going to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine its well@@ -@@ being .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s easy to for@@ get .
This use of vir@@ tual reality is not just good for making people look ol@@ der .
"There are pro@@ gr@@ ams you can get to see how people might look if they s@@ mo@@ ke , if they get too much ex@@ pos@@ ure to the su@@ n , if they g@@ ain we@@ ight and so on ."
"And what &apos;s good is , un@@ like in the experim@@ ents that H@@ al and my@@ self r@@ an with R@@ us@@ s S@@ m@@ ith , you don &apos;t have to program these by yourself in order to see the vir@@ tual reality ."
There are app@@ lic@@ ations you can get on smar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
"This is actually a picture of H@@ al , my co@@ au@@ th@@ or ."
You might recogni@@ ze him from the pre@@ vi@@ ous demo@@ s .
"And just for k@@ ic@@ ks we r@@ an his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and we@@ ight g@@ ain so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to see how he would look ."
"H@@ al is here , so I think we o@@ we it to him as well as yourself to dis@@ ab@@ use you of that last im@@ age ."
And I &apos;ll cl@@ ose it there .
"O@@ n be@@ half of H@@ al and my@@ self , I w@@ ish all the best to your present and future selves ."
Thank you .

A few months ago the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ ams of astron@@ om@@ ers for a disc@@ o@@ very that has been ha@@ il@@ ed as one of the most important astron@@ om@@ ical ob@@ serv@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly descri@@ b@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al fr@@ am@@ e@@ work for expl@@ ain@@ ing their disc@@ o@@ very , nam@@ ely the possi@@ bility that way be@@ y@@ on@@ d the Earth , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dist@@ ant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a v@@ ast comple@@ x of univer@@ ses that we call the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ."
Now the idea of a m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se is a stran@@ ge one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with fore@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old d@@ aughter has heard me spe@@ ak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was ho@@ l@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ op@@ hi@@ a , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she tur@@ ned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , universe or m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But bar@@ r@@ ing such an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing , it is stran@@ ge to imagine other re@@ al@@ ms se@@ par@@ ate from ours , most with fundam@@ ent@@ ally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ gh@@ tly be called univer@@ ses of their own ."
"And yet , spec@@ ul@@ ative though the idea su@@ re@@ ly is , I a@@ i@@ m to con@@ v@@ ince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it ser@@ i@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e-@@ w@@ inning res@@ ults and to high@@ light a pro@@ found my@@ st@@ ery which those res@@ ults re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll off@@ er a solu@@ tion to that my@@ st@@ ery ."
"It &apos;s bas@@ ed on an appro@@ ach called str@@ ing theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se will come into the story ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a cos@@ mo@@ logical theory called in@@ fl@@ ation , which will pul@@ l all the pi@@ ec@@ es of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great astron@@ om@@ er E@@ d@@ w@@ in H@@ u@@ b@@ ble reali@@ zed that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all ru@@ sh@@ ing away from us , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ch@@ ing , it &apos;s exp@@ anding ."
Now this was re@@ v@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary .
The pre@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ ing w@@ is@@ dom was that on the lar@@ g@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es the universe was st@@ atic .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The exp@@ an@@ sion must be s@@ lowing down ."
"That , much as the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ cent of an app@@ le t@@ os@@ sed up@@ ward , the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ational pul@@ l of each galaxy on every other must be s@@ lowing the exp@@ an@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ ams of astron@@ om@@ ers I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed at the out@@ set were insp@@ i@@ red by this reas@@ on@@ ing to measure the r@@ ate at which the exp@@ an@@ sion has been s@@ lowing .
"And they did this by pain@@ sta@@ king ob@@ serv@@ ations of num@@ er@@ ous dist@@ ant galaxies , al@@ lowing them to char@@ t how the exp@@ an@@ sion r@@ ate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surpri@@ se : They found that the exp@@ an@@ sion is not s@@ lowing down .
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad they found that it &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding up , going fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster ."
That &apos;s like t@@ os@@ sing an app@@ le up@@ ward and it goes up fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster .
"Now if you saw an app@@ le do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s pu@@ sh@@ ing on it ?
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the astron@@ om@@ ers &apos; res@@ ults are su@@ re@@ ly well@@ -@@ des@@ er@@ ving of the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , but they ra@@ is@@ ed an anal@@ o@@ g@@ ous question ."
What force is dri@@ ving all galaxies to r@@ us@@ h away from every other at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ qu@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ ing spe@@ ed ?
Well the most prom@@ is@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gra@@ vity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jects together ."
"But in E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s theory of gra@@ vity , his gener@@ al theory of relati@@ vity , gra@@ vity can also p@@ us@@ h things ap@@ art ."
"@@ How ? Well ac@@ cor@@ ding to E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s mat@@ h , if space is uni@@ form@@ ly f@@ ill@@ ed with an in@@ vi@@ sible energy , sort of like a uni@@ form , in@@ vi@@ sible mi@@ st , then the gra@@ vity gener@@ ated by that mi@@ st would be re@@ pul@@ sive , re@@ pul@@ sive gra@@ vity , which is just what we need to explain the ob@@ serv@@ ations ."
"Because the re@@ pul@@ sive gra@@ vity of an in@@ vi@@ sible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it s@@ mo@@ k@@ ey white here so you can see it — its re@@ pul@@ sive gra@@ vity would c@@ ause each galaxy to p@@ us@@ h against every other , dri@@ ving exp@@ an@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ pres@@ ents great progress .
But I prom@@ is@@ ed you a my@@ st@@ ery here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astron@@ om@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ f@@ using space to ac@@ coun@@ t for the cos@@ mi@@ c spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ pres@@ sed in the re@@ lev@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ arly small ."
And the my@@ st@@ ery is to explain this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar number .
"We want this number to em@@ er@@ ge from the la@@ ws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be expl@@ ain@@ ing this number is just a tech@@ n@@ ical is@@ sue , a tech@@ n@@ ical deta@@ il of inter@@ est to exper@@ ts , but of no re@@ lev@@ ance to any@@ body else ."
"Well it su@@ re@@ ly is a tech@@ n@@ ical deta@@ il , but some deta@@ il@@ s really matter ."
"S@@ ome deta@@ il@@ s pro@@ vi@@ de w@@ in@@ do@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted re@@ al@@ ms of reality , and this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only appro@@ ach that &apos;s so far made he@@ ad@@ way to explain it inv@@ o@@ kes the possi@@ bility of other univer@@ ses — an idea that nat@@ ur@@ ally em@@ er@@ g@@ es from str@@ ing theory , which ta@@ kes me to part two : str@@ ing theory ."
So hold the my@@ st@@ ery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three k@@ ey things about str@@ ing theory .
"F@@ ir@@ st off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an appro@@ ach to reali@@ ze E@@ inste@@ in &apos;s dre@@ am of a uni@@ fied theory of physics , a single over@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the cen@@ tr@@ al idea of str@@ ing theory is quite st@@ ra@@ igh@@ t@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you exam@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es and then you &apos;ll find at@@ om@@ s and sub@@ at@@ om@@ ic partic@@ les ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be sm@@ all@@ er , much sm@@ all@@ er than we can with exist@@ ing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these partic@@ les — a little t@@ iny vi@@ br@@ ating f@@ il@@ am@@ ent of energy , a little t@@ iny vi@@ br@@ ating str@@ ing ."
"And just like the str@@ ings on a viol@@ in , they can vi@@ br@@ ate in different patterns produc@@ ing different m@@ us@@ ical not@@ es ."
"Th@@ ese little fundamental str@@ ings , when they vi@@ br@@ ate in different patterns , they pro@@ duce different kinds of partic@@ les — so electr@@ ons , qu@@ ar@@ ks , ne@@ u@@ tr@@ in@@ o@@ s , ph@@ ot@@ ons , all other partic@@ les would be un@@ ited into a single fr@@ am@@ e@@ work , as they would all ari@@ se from vi@@ br@@ ating str@@ ings ."
"It &apos;s a comp@@ elling picture , a kind of cos@@ mi@@ c sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y , where all the r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness that we see in the world around us em@@ er@@ g@@ es from the mu@@ sic that these little , t@@ iny str@@ ings can play ."
"But there &apos;s a c@@ ost to this el@@ eg@@ ant uni@@ fic@@ ation , because years of resear@@ ch have sho@@ wn that the mat@@ h of str@@ ing theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ n@@ al in@@ consi@@ st@@ en@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we al@@ low for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ fam@@ ili@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the u@@ su@@ al three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as he@@ ight , wi@@ d@@ th and dep@@ th ."
"But str@@ ing theory says that , on f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ tic@@ ally small sc@@ al@@ es , there are ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal dimensions cr@@ um@@ pl@@ ed to a t@@ iny size so small that we have not de@@ t@@ ected them ."
"But even though the dimensions are hi@@ dd@@ en , they would have an imp@@ act on things that we can ob@@ ser@@ ve because the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions con@@ st@@ ra@@ ins how the str@@ ings can vi@@ br@@ ate ."
"And in str@@ ing theory , vi@@ br@@ ation de@@ ter@@ min@@ es everything ."
"So partic@@ le m@@ ass@@ es , the stre@@ ng@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most import@@ an@@ tly , the amount of dark energy would be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cul@@ ate the amount of dark energy ."
The chall@@ en@@ ge is we don &apos;t know the shap@@ e of the extra dimensions .
A@@ ll we have is a li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es al@@ lowed by the mat@@ h .
"Now when these ideas were first develop@@ ed , there were only about five different can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es , so you can imagine anal@@ y@@ zing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ one to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine if any y@@ i@@ el@@ d the physical fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve ."
But over time the li@@ st gre@@ w as resear@@ ch@@ ers found other can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hund@@ re@@ ds and then the thousands — A large , but still man@@ ag@@ e@@ able , coll@@ ec@@ tion to anal@@ y@@ ze , since after all , gra@@ du@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the li@@ st contin@@ u@@ ed to grow into the m@@ illions and the b@@ illions , until today ."
The li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es has so@@ ared to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some resear@@ ch@@ ers l@@ ost heart , con@@ clu@@ ding that was so many can@@ di@@ d@@ ate shap@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving ri@@ se to different physical fe@@ atures , str@@ ing theory would never make defin@@ i@@ tive , te@@ st@@ able predic@@ tions ."
"But others tur@@ ned this is@@ sue on its head , taking us to the possi@@ bility of a m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
M@@ ay@@ be each of these shap@@ es is on an equ@@ al fo@@ ot@@ ing with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many univer@@ ses , each with a different shap@@ e , for the extra dimensions ."
And this ra@@ dic@@ al pro@@ pos@@ al has a pro@@ found imp@@ act on this my@@ st@@ ery : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e-@@ w@@ inning res@@ ults .
"Because you see , if there are other univer@@ ses , and if those univer@@ ses each have , say , a different shap@@ e for the extra dimensions , then the physical fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
Wh@@ ich means that the my@@ st@@ ery of expl@@ ain@@ ing the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now meas@@ u@@ red would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different char@@ ac@@ ter .
"In this cont@@ ex@@ t , the la@@ ws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many num@@ bers ."
Wh@@ ich means we have been as@@ king the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red instead of any of the other possi@@ bili@@ ties that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make he@@ ad@@ way .
"Because those univer@@ ses that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tries to cl@@ um@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive p@@ us@@ h of the dark energy is so str@@ ong that it b@@ lo@@ ws the cl@@ um@@ p ap@@ art and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those univer@@ ses that have much less dark energy , well they coll@@ ap@@ se back on themselves so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no plan@@ ets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to ex@@ ist in those other univer@@ ses ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red simply because our universe has condi@@ tions h@@ osp@@ it@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ st@@ ery sol@@ ved , m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ver@@ se found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ s@@ atis@@ f@@ ying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ i@@ tive ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ ser@@ ve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving can and does take on a wi@@ de vari@@ e@@ ty of different val@@ ues across the wi@@ der l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular value is simply mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded ."
A@@ n early example comes from the great astron@@ om@@ er J@@ o@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es K@@ e@@ pl@@ er who was ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with understanding a different number — why the Su@@ n is 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away from the Earth .
"And he worked for dec@@ ad@@ es trying to explain this number , but he never suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded , and we know why ."
K@@ e@@ pl@@ er was as@@ king the wrong question .
We now know that there are many plan@@ ets at a wi@@ de vari@@ e@@ ty of different dist@@ anc@@ es from their h@@ ost stars .
"So ho@@ ping that the la@@ ws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es , well that is simply wr@@ on@@ gh@@ e@@ ad@@ ed ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad the right question to ask is , why do we hum@@ ans find ourselves on a planet at this particular dist@@ ance , instead of any of the other possi@@ bili@@ ties ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose plan@@ ets which are much cl@@ os@@ er to a star like the Su@@ n would be so ho@@ t that our form of life wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist .
"And those plan@@ ets that are much f@@ ar@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so co@@ ld that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular dist@@ ance simply because it y@@ i@@ el@@ ds condi@@ tions v@@ ital to our form of life .
"And when it comes to plan@@ ets and their dist@@ anc@@ es , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"The point is , when it comes to univer@@ ses and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ on@@ ing ."
"One k@@ ey difference , of course , is we know that there are other plan@@ ets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only spec@@ ul@@ ated on the possi@@ bility that there might be other univer@@ ses ."
"So to pul@@ l it all together , we need a m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism that can actually gener@@ ate other univer@@ ses ."
"And that ta@@ kes me to my fin@@ al part , part three ."
Because such a m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism has been found by cos@@ mo@@ logi@@ sts trying to understand the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang .
"You see , when we spe@@ ak of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang , we often have an im@@ age of a kind of cos@@ mi@@ c expl@@ os@@ i@@ on that cre@@ ated our universe and set space ru@@ sh@@ ing ou@@ tw@@ ard ."
But there &apos;s a little sec@@ re@@ t .
"The B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang le@@ a@@ ves out something pretty important , the B@@ ang ."
"It t@@ ells us how the universe ev@@ ol@@ ved after the B@@ ang , but gi@@ ves us no in@@ sight into what would have po@@ wer@@ ed the B@@ ang itself ."
And this g@@ ap was fin@@ ally f@@ ill@@ ed by an en@@ h@@ anc@@ ed ver@@ sion of the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang theory .
"It &apos;s called in@@ fl@@ ati@@ on@@ ary cos@@ mo@@ logy , which i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied a particular kind of fu@@ el that would nat@@ ur@@ ally gener@@ ate an ou@@ tw@@ ard r@@ us@@ h of space ."
"The fu@@ el is bas@@ ed on something called a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m field , but the only deta@@ il that mat@@ ters for us is that this fu@@ el pro@@ ves to be so eff@@ ici@@ ent that it &apos;s vir@@ tually im@@ possible to use it all up , which means in the in@@ fl@@ ati@@ on@@ ary theory , the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang giving ri@@ se to our universe is likely not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad the fu@@ el not only gener@@ ated our B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang , but it would also gener@@ ate coun@@ t@@ less other B@@ i@@ g B@@ an@@ gs , each giving ri@@ se to its own se@@ par@@ ate universe with our universe becom@@ ing but one bu@@ b@@ ble in a gr@@ and cos@@ mi@@ c bu@@ b@@ ble b@@ ath of univer@@ ses ."
"And now , when we m@@ el@@ d this with str@@ ing theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these univer@@ ses has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wi@@ de vari@@ e@@ ty of different shap@@ es .
The different shap@@ es y@@ i@@ el@@ d different physical fe@@ atures .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the comp@@ elling but high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the wi@@ der cos@@ mo@@ s that cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ e@@ dge ob@@ serv@@ ation and theory have now led us to ser@@ i@@ ously consi@@ der .
"One big re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fir@@ m the exist@@ ence of other univer@@ ses ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The in@@ fl@@ ati@@ on@@ ary theory already has str@@ ong ob@@ serv@@ ational sup@@ port .
"Because the theory predic@@ ts that the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang would have been so int@@ en@@ se that as space r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly exp@@ an@@ ded , t@@ iny qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m j@@ it@@ ters from the m@@ ic@@ r@@ o world would have been stre@@ t@@ ched out to the m@@ acr@@ o world , y@@ i@@ el@@ ding a dist@@ inc@@ tive fin@@ g@@ er@@ prin@@ t , a patter@@ n of s@@ ligh@@ tly h@@ ot@@ ter sp@@ ots and s@@ ligh@@ tly col@@ der sp@@ ots , across space , which po@@ wer@@ ful tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have now ob@@ ser@@ ved ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing f@@ ur@@ ther , if there are other univer@@ ses , the theory predic@@ ts that every so often those univer@@ ses can col@@ li@@ de ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that col@@ li@@ sion would gener@@ ate an ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal sub@@ t@@ le patter@@ n of t@@ em@@ per@@ ature vari@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to de@@ t@@ ect ."
"And so ex@@ ot@@ ic as this picture is , it may one day be gr@@ oun@@ ded in ob@@ serv@@ ations , est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing the exist@@ ence of other univer@@ ses ."
I &apos;ll con@@ clu@@ de with a stri@@ king imp@@ lic@@ ation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not st@@ atic , that space is exp@@ anding , that that exp@@ an@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up and that there might be other univer@@ ses all by care@@ fully exam@@ in@@ ing fa@@ in@@ t p@@ in@@ poin@@ ts of star@@ light coming to us from dist@@ ant galaxies ."
"But because the exp@@ an@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will r@@ us@@ h away so far and so f@@ ast that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of techno@@ logical lim@@ it@@ ations , but because of the la@@ ws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies em@@ it , even tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing at the fa@@ st@@ est spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to over@@ come the e@@ ver@@ -@@ wi@@ den@@ ing g@@ ul@@ f between us ."
"So astron@@ om@@ ers in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an en@@ d@@ less stre@@ t@@ ch of st@@ atic , in@@ k@@ y , black sti@@ l@@ l@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ clu@@ de that the universe is st@@ atic and un@@ chang@@ ing and pop@@ ul@@ ated by a single cen@@ tr@@ al o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ ha@@ bit — a picture of the cos@@ mo@@ s that we defin@@ i@@ ti@@ vely know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astron@@ om@@ ers will have rec@@ or@@ ds h@@ an@@ ded down from an ear@@ li@@ er er@@ a , like ours , at@@ te@@ st@@ ing to an exp@@ anding cos@@ mo@@ s te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future astron@@ om@@ ers believe such an@@ ci@@ ent knowledge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , st@@ atic emp@@ ty universe that their own st@@ at@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art ob@@ serv@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I su@@ sp@@ ect the l@@ at@@ ter .
Wh@@ ich means that we are living through a re@@ mark@@ ably pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ ed er@@ a when certain de@@ ep tru@@ ths about the cos@@ mo@@ s are still within re@@ ach of the human sp@@ ir@@ it of expl@@ or@@ ation .
It appe@@ ar@@ s that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s astron@@ om@@ ers , by tur@@ ning po@@ wer@@ ful tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es to the sk@@ y , have cap@@ tu@@ red a h@@ and@@ ful of star@@ k@@ ly in@@ form@@ ative ph@@ ot@@ ons — a kind of cos@@ mi@@ c tel@@ e@@ gram b@@ illions of years in trans@@ it ."
and the mess@@ age ec@@ ho@@ ing across the ages is c@@ lear .
S@@ ome@@ times nature gu@@ ar@@ ds her sec@@ re@@ ts with the un@@ bre@@ ak@@ able g@@ ri@@ p of physical la@@ w .

B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astron@@ om@@ ers of the far future may not have enough information to fig@@ ure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that posi@@ tion and certain de@@ ep , cri@@ tical fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our ability to understand because of how cos@@ mo@@ logy ev@@ ol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spec@@ tive , maybe we will always be as@@ king questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."

"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vir@@ tually un@@ known G@@ er@@ man ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ an , nam@@ ed Th@@ e@@ o@@ d@@ or K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted a very bo@@ ld and , in some ways , a very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea ."
He pro@@ posed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aw@@ are of .
"That is in ad@@ di@@ tion to left , right , back , for@@ th and up , down , K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a pro@@ posed that there might be ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a bo@@ ld and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea , sometimes that &apos;s all it is — bo@@ ld and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , ho@@ w@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll disc@@ us@@ s experim@@ ents which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a maj@@ or imp@@ act on physics in the last century and contin@@ ues to in@@ form a lot of cu@@ tt@@ ing@@ -@@ e@@ dge resear@@ ch ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
T@@ o beg@@ in we need a little bit of back story . G@@ o to 19@@ 0@@ 7 .
"This is a year when E@@ inste@@ in is bas@@ king in the g@@ low of having disc@@ over@@ ed the speci@@ al theory of relati@@ vity and deci@@ des to take on a new pro@@ ject , to try to understand fully the gr@@ and , per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve force of gra@@ vity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that pro@@ ject had already been res@@ ol@@ ved ."
"@@ N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on had given the world a theory of gra@@ vity in the l@@ ate 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0s that works well , descri@@ b@@ es the moti@@ on of plan@@ ets , the moti@@ on of the mo@@ on and so for@@ th , the moti@@ on of ap@@ o@@ cr@@ yp@@ ha@@ l of ap@@ pl@@ es f@@ all@@ ing from tre@@ es , h@@ it@@ ting people on the head ."
A@@ ll of that could be descri@@ bed using N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on &apos;s work .
"But E@@ inste@@ in reali@@ zed that N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on had left something out of the story , because even N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on had wr@@ it@@ ten that al@@ though he underst@@ ood how to cal@@ cul@@ ate the eff@@ ect of gra@@ vity , he &apos;d been un@@ able to fig@@ ure out how it really works ."
"@@ How is it that the Su@@ n , 9@@ 3 million mil@@ es away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it aff@@ ec@@ ts the moti@@ on of the Earth ?"
How does the Su@@ n re@@ ach out across emp@@ ty in@@ er@@ t space and ex@@ er@@ t in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a t@@ ask to which E@@ inste@@ in set h@@ im@@ self — to fig@@ ure out how gra@@ vity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So E@@ inste@@ in found that the me@@ di@@ um that trans@@ m@@ its gra@@ vity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ str@@ ate of all there is .
"E@@ inste@@ in said space is n@@ ice and fl@@ at , if there &apos;s no matter present ."
"But if there is matter in the environ@@ ment , such as the Su@@ n , it cau@@ ses the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ates the force of gra@@ vity .
E@@ ven the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is ke@@ p@@ t in or@@ bit , ac@@ cor@@ ding to these ideas , because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ le@@ y in the cur@@ ved environ@@ ment that the Su@@ n and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vir@@ tu@@ e of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a ful@@ l@@ -@@ f@@ ra@@ me view of this .
The Earth itself is ke@@ p@@ t in or@@ bit because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ le@@ y in the environ@@ ment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Su@@ n &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how gra@@ vity actually works .
"Now , this idea was te@@ sted in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through astron@@ om@@ ical ob@@ serv@@ ations ."
It really works . It descri@@ b@@ es the data .
And this g@@ ained E@@ inste@@ in prom@@ in@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a thinking .
"He , like E@@ inste@@ in , was in sear@@ ch of what we call a uni@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es , one ma@@ ster equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a said to h@@ im@@ self , E@@ inste@@ in has been able to descri@@ be gra@@ vity in ter@@ ms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more preci@@ se ."
"M@@ ay@@ be I can play the same g@@ ame with the other known force , which was , at that time , known as the electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force — we know of others today , but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about ."
"You know , the force respon@@ sible for electr@@ ic@@ ity and mag@@ ne@@ tic at@@ tr@@ action and so for@@ th ."
"So K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a says , maybe I can play the same g@@ ame and descri@@ be electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force in ter@@ ms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ is@@ ed a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ inste@@ in had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be gra@@ vity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"So he imag@@ ined that the world had four dimensions of space , not three , and imag@@ ined that electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m was war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in that f@@ our@@ th dimen@@ sion . Now here &apos;s the thing : when he wr@@ ote down the equ@@ ations descri@@ b@@ ing war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in a universe with four space dimensions , not three , he found the old equ@@ ations that E@@ inste@@ in had already der@@ i@@ ved in three dimensions — those were for gra@@ vity — but he found one more equ@@ ation because of the one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scienti@@ sts had long known to descri@@ be the electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force ."
A@@ ma@@ zing — it just pop@@ ped out .
"He was so exc@@ ited by this reali@@ zation that he r@@ an around his h@@ ouse scre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; V@@ ic@@ t@@ ory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the uni@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a was a man who took theory very ser@@ i@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ wi@@ m , he read a book , a tre@@ ati@@ se on s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing — ( Laughter ) — then do@@ ve into the o@@ ce@@ an ."
This is a man who would ri@@ s@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally min@@ ded , two questions im@@ me@@ di@@ ately ari@@ se from his ob@@ serv@@ ation ."
"@@ N@@ um@@ ber one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in deta@@ il , when you try to app@@ ly it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a f@@ el@@ low nam@@ ed O@@ sk@@ ar K@@ le@@ in ."
"He su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted that dimensions might come in two vari@@ e@@ ties — there might be big , eas@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ see dimensions , but there might also be t@@ iny , cur@@ le@@ d@@ -@@ up dimensions , cur@@ led up so small , even though they &apos;re all around us , that we don &apos;t see them ."
Let me show you that one vi@@ su@@ ally .
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a c@@ able sup@@ por@@ ting a tra@@ ff@@ ic light ."
"It &apos;s in M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an . You &apos;re in C@@ en@@ tr@@ al P@@ ar@@ k — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant — but the c@@ able looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal from a dist@@ ant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we z@@ o@@ om in and take the per@@ spec@@ tive of , say , a little ant wal@@ king around — little an@@ ts are so small that they can ac@@ cess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ loc@@ k@@ wi@@ se , coun@@ ter@@ -@@ c@@ loc@@ k@@ wi@@ se direc@@ tion ."
And I hope you ap@@ preci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these an@@ ts to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates the fact that dimensions can be of two sor@@ ts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can eas@@ ily see , but there might be ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the cir@@ cul@@ ar part of that c@@ able , so small that they have so far re@@ ma@@ ined in@@ vi@@ sible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"So , if we take a look , say , at space itself — I can only show , of course , two dimensions on a scre@@ en ."
"S@@ ome of you gu@@ ys will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not fl@@ at on a scre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , sm@@ all@@ er , and way down in the m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ ic dep@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ di@@ ti@@ onal cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shap@@ e of a cir@@ c@@ le — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ tr@@ a m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ ic ant wal@@ king around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the g@@ ri@@ d part — but you could also ac@@ cess the t@@ iny cur@@ le@@ d@@ -@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the n@@ a@@ ked ey@@ e or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment ."
"But de@@ e@@ ply t@@ uc@@ ked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
Now that &apos;s an ex@@ plan@@ ation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see .
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to app@@ ly it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that E@@ inste@@ in and K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a and many others worked on trying to re@@ fine this fr@@ am@@ e@@ work and app@@ ly it to the physics of the universe as was underst@@ ood at the time , and , in deta@@ il , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In deta@@ il , for inst@@ ance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electr@@ on to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , cer@@ tain@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this stran@@ ge but very comp@@ elling idea of how to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics had g@@ one away ."
Un@@ til something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our er@@ a , a new appro@@ ach to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics is being pur@@ su@@ ed by phys@@ ici@@ sts such as my@@ self , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ str@@ ing theory , as you were in@@ dic@@ ating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ str@@ ing theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ str@@ ing theory , we find that it res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ts the idea in a sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ling , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Su@@ per@@ str@@ ing theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the bas@@ ic , fundamental , in@@ divi@@ sible , un@@ cu@@ tt@@ able con@@ stitu@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a fam@@ ili@@ ar ob@@ ject , just a c@@ and@@ le in a ho@@ l@@ der , and imagine that we want to fig@@ ure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y de@@ ep inside the ob@@ ject and exam@@ ine the con@@ stitu@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go suff@@ ici@@ ently far down , you have at@@ om@@ s ."
We also all know that at@@ om@@ s are not the end of the story .
They have little electr@@ ons that s@@ war@@ m around a cen@@ tr@@ al n@@ uc@@ le@@ us with ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ons and prot@@ ons .
E@@ ven the ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ons and prot@@ ons have sm@@ all@@ er partic@@ les inside of them known as qu@@ ar@@ ks .
That is where con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of str@@ ing theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these partic@@ les , there is something else ."
This something else is this d@@ anc@@ ing f@@ il@@ am@@ ent of energy .
"It looks like a vi@@ br@@ ating str@@ ing — that &apos;s where the idea , str@@ ing theory comes from ."
"And just like the vi@@ br@@ ating str@@ ings that you just saw in a c@@ ell@@ o can vi@@ br@@ ate in different patterns , these can also vi@@ br@@ ate in different patterns ."
They don &apos;t pro@@ duce different m@@ us@@ ical not@@ es .
"R@@ a@@ ther , they pro@@ duce the different partic@@ les making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ rec@@ t , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little t@@ iny f@@ il@@ am@@ ents of vi@@ br@@ ating energy , vi@@ br@@ ating in different f@@ requ@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different f@@ requ@@ en@@ ci@@ es pro@@ duce the different partic@@ les .
The different partic@@ les are respon@@ sible for all the r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness in the world around us .
"And there you see uni@@ fic@@ ation , because matter partic@@ les , electr@@ ons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , radi@@ ation partic@@ les , ph@@ ot@@ ons , gra@@ v@@ it@@ ons , are all built up from one enti@@ ty ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the ru@@ bri@@ c of vi@@ br@@ ating str@@ ings .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a uni@@ fied theory .
Now here is the cat@@ ch .
"When you study the ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s of str@@ ing theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , n@@ or five , n@@ or six ."
"F@@ in@@ ally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It le@@ ads us right back to this idea of K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when appro@@ pri@@ ately descri@@ bed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ led up , ye@@ ah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little t@@ iny civi@@ li@@ zation of gre@@ en people wal@@ king around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them e@@ ither . That is true ."
"One of the other predic@@ tions of str@@ ing theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of str@@ ing theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ is@@ es the question : are we just trying to hi@@ de away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ ir@@ st is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ e@@ p@@ est question in the@@ o@@ re@@ tical physics , the@@ o@@ re@@ tical science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scienti@@ sts have done for the last hundred years , there appe@@ ar to be about 20 num@@ bers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"Th@@ ese are num@@ bers like the mass of the partic@@ les , like electr@@ ons and qu@@ ar@@ ks , the stre@@ ng@@ th of gra@@ vity , the stre@@ ng@@ th of the electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic force — a li@@ st of about 20 num@@ bers that have been meas@@ u@@ red with incredi@@ ble preci@@ sion , but no@@ body has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the num@@ bers have the particular val@@ ues that they do ."
"Now , does str@@ ing theory off@@ er an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those num@@ bers have the val@@ ues they do may re@@ ly on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those num@@ bers had any other val@@ ues than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those num@@ bers so fin@@ ely t@@ un@@ ed to al@@ low stars to sh@@ ine and plan@@ ets to form , when we recogni@@ ze that if you fi@@ ddle with those num@@ bers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and fi@@ ddle with those num@@ bers , almost any fi@@ dd@@ ling makes the universe dis@@ appe@@ ar ."
So can we explain those 20 num@@ bers ?
And str@@ ing theory su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that those 20 num@@ bers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in str@@ ing theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the ol@@ der ideas of K@@ al@@ u@@ z@@ a and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what str@@ ing theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very r@@ ich , inter@@ tw@@ ined ge@@ ome@@ try ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ al@@ ab@@ i@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shap@@ e — name isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions fo@@ ld in on themselves and inter@@ tw@@ ine in a very interesting shap@@ e , interesting struc@@ ture ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the m@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ ic l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e of our universe all around us would look like this on the t@@ in@@ i@@ est of sc@@ al@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be mo@@ ving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical imp@@ lic@@ ation , though , re@@ lev@@ ant to those 20 num@@ bers ?"
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der this . If you look at the in@@ str@@ ument , a F@@ ren@@ ch h@@ or@@ n , not@@ ice that the vi@@ br@@ ations of the a@@ ir@@ stre@@ ams are aff@@ ected by the shap@@ e of the in@@ str@@ ument ."
"Now in str@@ ing theory , all the num@@ bers are re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tions of the way str@@ ings can vi@@ br@@ ate ."
"So just as those a@@ ir@@ stre@@ ams are aff@@ ected by the tw@@ ists and turns in the in@@ str@@ ument , str@@ ings themselves will be aff@@ ected by the vi@@ br@@ ational patterns in the ge@@ ome@@ try within which they are mo@@ ving ."
So let me bring some str@@ ings into the story .
"And if you wat@@ ch these little f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws vi@@ br@@ ating around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , not@@ ice that they way they vi@@ br@@ ate is aff@@ ected by the ge@@ ome@@ try of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate the al@@ lowed not@@ es , the al@@ lowed vi@@ br@@ ational patterns ."
"And if we could cal@@ cul@@ ate the al@@ lowed vi@@ br@@ ational patterns , we should be able to cal@@ cul@@ ate those 20 num@@ bers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ cul@@ ations ag@@ re@@ es with the val@@ ues of those num@@ bers that have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed through deta@@ il@@ ed and preci@@ se experim@@ ent@@ ation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the struc@@ ture of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second is@@ sue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more direc@@ tly ?"
"I@@ s this just an interesting ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al struc@@ ture that might be able to explain some pre@@ vi@@ ously un@@ expl@@ ained fe@@ atures of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?"
"And we think — and this is , I think , very exc@@ iting — that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the exist@@ ence of these extra dimensions ."
"@@ Here &apos;s how it goes . I@@ n C@@ E@@ R@@ N , G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land , a machine is being built called the L@@ ar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ r@@ on C@@ ol@@ li@@ der ."
"It &apos;s a machine that will s@@ end partic@@ les around a t@@ un@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so often those partic@@ les will be a@@ im@@ ed at each other , so there &apos;s a he@@ ad@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion ."
"The hope is that if the col@@ li@@ sion has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the de@@ br@@ is from the col@@ li@@ sion from our dimensions , for@@ c@@ ing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the col@@ li@@ sion , comp@@ are it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the col@@ li@@ sion than before , this will be evidence that the energy has dri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it dri@@ f@@ ts away in the right patter@@ n that we can cal@@ cul@@ ate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea vi@@ su@@ ally .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a gra@@ v@@ it@@ on — that &apos;s the kind of de@@ br@@ is we exp@@ ect to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these partic@@ les . You s@@ l@@ am them together .
"You s@@ l@@ am them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that col@@ li@@ sion will go into de@@ br@@ is that f@@ li@@ es off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , se@@ ven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ar@@ s f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ jec@@ ted by not@@ ic@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we beg@@ an , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"And to me this is a really re@@ mark@@ able story , and a re@@ mark@@ able op@@ port@@ unity . G@@ o@@ ing back to N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on with ab@@ sol@@ ute space — didn &apos;t pro@@ vi@@ de anything but an aren@@ a , a st@@ age in which the ev@@ ents of the universe take place ."
"E@@ inste@@ in comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what gra@@ vity is ."
"And now str@@ ing theory comes along and says , y@@ es , gra@@ vity , qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m m@@ ech@@ an@@ ics , electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m , all together in one p@@ ac@@ k@@ age , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ ma@@ zing possi@@ bility .
Thank you very much .

Let me ask you all a question .
O@@ K . And how about this min@@ i@@ b@@ us ?
A@@ ll right .
So she didn &apos;t grow up hear@@ ing a lot about n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons .
"For J@@ as@@ m@@ ine , a f@@ all@@ out sh@@ el@@ ter is an ap@@ p in the A@@ n@@ dro@@ id st@@ ore ."
We have so@@ li@@ d evidence that ter@@ r@@ ori@@ sts are trying to get a@@ hold of them .
"But at that time , R@@ us@@ si@@ an P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ or@@ is Y@@ el@@ t@@ s@@ in came within five minutes of lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing a ful@@ l@@ -@@ sc@@ ale re@@ tal@@ i@@ at@@ ory n@@ uc@@ lear att@@ ack against the United States ."
"So , most of the world &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear n@@ ations have comm@@ it@@ ted to getting ri@@ d of these we@@ ap@@ ons of mass de@@ struc@@ tion ."
He gave us a chall@@ en@@ ge that would have been incredi@@ ble just a few years ear@@ li@@ er .
"And with that chall@@ en@@ ge , he insp@@ i@@ red scienti@@ sts and mar@@ ke@@ ters , astron@@ au@@ ts and scho@@ ol@@ teachers ."
He gave us a vi@@ sion .
"And app@@ aren@@ tly , N@@ i@@ k@@ it@@ a K@@ h@@ ru@@ sh@@ che@@ v , the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et P@@ re@@ mi@@ er , ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"But before that co@@ oper@@ ation could be reali@@ zed , K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy was ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ated , and that part of the vi@@ sion was de@@ fer@@ red ."
But the prom@@ ise of jo@@ in@@ t in@@ no@@ v@@ ation between these two n@@ uc@@ lear super@@ po@@ w@@ ers wasn &apos;t t@@ ot@@ ally ex@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed .
"They called it , &quot; &quot; M@@ eg@@ at@@ ons to M@@ eg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So the res@@ ult is that for over 20 years , our two n@@ ations had a program that me@@ ant that one in 10 ligh@@ t@@ b@@ ul@@ b@@ s in the United States was ess@@ enti@@ ally fu@@ el@@ ed by form@@ er R@@ us@@ si@@ an war@@ he@@ ads ."
"So , together these two n@@ ations did something tru@@ ly au@@ d@@ ac@@ i@@ ous ."
"But the good news is , the global comm@@ unity has the chan@@ ce to do something just as au@@ d@@ ac@@ i@@ ous today ."
"T@@ o get ri@@ d of n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons and to end the sup@@ ply of the materi@@ als requ@@ i@@ red to pro@@ duce them , some exper@@ ts tell me would take 30 years ."
"It would take a ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance of sor@@ ts , the kinds of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation that , for better or wor@@ se , under@@ p@@ in@@ ned both the M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an P@@ ro@@ ject , which gave ri@@ se to n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons , and the M@@ eg@@ at@@ ons to M@@ eg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts program ."
It would take desig@@ n con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts .
"Th@@ ese are fundamental to cre@@ ati@@ vity , things like a pl@@ at@@ form for inter@@ national coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation ; a d@@ ate certain , which is a for@@ c@@ ing m@@ ech@@ an@@ ism ; and a posi@@ tive vi@@ sion that insp@@ i@@ res action ."
It would take us to 20@@ 4@@ 5 .
"Now , 20@@ 4@@ 5 happens to be the 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the bir@@ th of n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons in the New M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o des@@ er@@ t ."
But it &apos;s also an important d@@ ate for another reason .
"It &apos;s predic@@ ted to be the adv@@ ent of the sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity , a new moment in human develop@@ ment , where the l@@ ines between arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence and human intelligence bl@@ ur , where compu@@ ting and consciousness become almost in@@ dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble and adv@@ anc@@ ed techno@@ logi@@ es help us sol@@ ve the 2@@ 1@@ st century &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est problems : h@@ un@@ ger , energy , po@@ ver@@ ty , u@@ sh@@ ering in an er@@ a of ab@@ und@@ ance ."
And we all get to go to space on our way to becom@@ ing a m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ plan@@ et@@ ary spec@@ ies .
"Now , the people who really believe this vi@@ sion are the first to say they don &apos;t yet know preci@@ se@@ ly how we &apos;re going to get there ."
But the val@@ ues be@@ h@@ ind their vi@@ sion and the w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to ask &quot; &quot; How might we ? &quot; &quot; have insp@@ i@@ red a generation of in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors .
"They &apos;re working bac@@ k@@ ward from the out@@ comes they want , using the cre@@ ative proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative desig@@ n ."
They &apos;re bu@@ st@@ ing through ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les .
They &apos;re re@@ defin@@ ing what we all consi@@ der possible .
"It has to be about str@@ ate@@ gi@@ es for mu@@ tually as@@ su@@ red pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity or , at the very le@@ ast , mu@@ tually as@@ su@@ red survi@@ v@@ al ."
"Now , every day , I get to me@@ et people who are real pi@@ on@@ e@@ ers in the field of n@@ uc@@ lear thre@@ at@@ s ."
It &apos;s as if there &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o .
"@@ No problem of human dest@@ iny , he said , is be@@ y@@ on@@ d human be@@ ings ."
I believe that .
"And I be@@ t a lot of you here believe that , too ."
And I know G@@ ener@@ ation P@@ os@@ sible beli@@ ev@@ es it .
So it &apos;s time to comm@@ it to a d@@ ate .
Let &apos;s end the n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons ch@@ ap@@ ter on the 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of its in@@ cep@@ tion .
"A@@ f@@ ter all , by 20@@ 4@@ 5 , we will have hel@@ d b@@ illions of people h@@ os@@ t@@ age to the thre@@ at of n@@ uc@@ lear an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ation ."
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , 100 years will have been enough ."
"S@@ u@@ re@@ ly , if ever there was a global mo@@ on sho@@ t wor@@ th sup@@ por@@ ting , this is it ."
"Now , in the face of real thre@@ at@@ s — for inst@@ ance , N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a &apos;s rec@@ ent n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons te@@ sts , which f@@ ly in the face of s@@ anc@@ tions — reas@@ on@@ able people dis@@ ag@@ ree about whether we should ma@@ in@@ tain some number of n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons to de@@ ter ag@@ gres@@ sion ."
But the question is : What &apos;s the mag@@ ic number ?
I@@ s it a thous@@ and ?
I@@ s it a hundred ? T@@ en ?
And then we have to ask : Wh@@ o should be respon@@ sible for them ?
"I think we can ag@@ ree , ho@@ w@@ ever , that having 1@@ 5@@ ,000 of them re@@ pres@@ ents a gre@@ ater global thre@@ at to J@@ as@@ m@@ ine &apos;s generation than a prom@@ ise ."
"It &apos;s time we ple@@ dge our res@@ our@@ ces as lead@@ ers across the spec@@ tru@@ m to work on this old problem in new ways , to ask , &quot; &quot; How might we ? &quot; &quot; How might we make good on a prom@@ ise of gre@@ ater sec@@ ur@@ ity for J@@ as@@ m@@ ine &apos;s generation in a world be@@ y@@ on@@ d n@@ uc@@ lear we@@ ap@@ ons ?"
I tru@@ ly hope you will jo@@ in us .

"And with all the res@@ our@@ ces that we are p@@ our@@ ing into scho@@ ols , we should stop and ask ourselves : A@@ re we really se@@ tting our kids up for suc@@ cess ?"
"Now , a few years ago , I was a ju@@ dge on a co@@ o@@ king com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion called &quot; &quot; C@@ ho@@ p@@ ped . &quot; &quot; F@@ our che@@ f@@ s com@@ pe@@ te with my@@ st@@ ery in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents to see who can co@@ ok the best di@@ sh@@ es ."
E@@ x@@ cept for this e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de — it was a very speci@@ al one .
"Now , I know it &apos;s been a long time since most of you have had a school l@@ un@@ ch , and we &apos;ve made a lot of progress on n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion , but qu@@ in@@ o@@ a still is not a st@@ ap@@ le in most school c@@ a@@ fe@@ ter@@ i@@ as ."
But the dis@@ h that I will never for@@ get was co@@ o@@ ked by a woman nam@@ ed Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a .
She co@@ o@@ ked this de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous p@@ ast@@ a .
"It was de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous , like , re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ t-@@ qu@@ ality good , ex@@ cept — she basically just thre@@ w the qu@@ in@@ o@@ a , pretty much un@@ co@@ o@@ ked , into the dis@@ h ."
"It was a stran@@ ge cho@@ ice , and it was sup@@ er cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) So I took on the T@@ V ac@@ c@@ us@@ at@@ ory ju@@ dge thing that you &apos;re sup@@ posed to do , and I asked her why she did that ."
"@@ Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l respon@@ ded , &quot; &quot; Well , first , I don &apos;t know what qu@@ in@@ o@@ a is . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; But I do know that it &apos;s a M@@ on@@ day , and that in my school , at H@@ i@@ gh S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ om@@ m@@ unity , I always co@@ ok p@@ ast@@ a . &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ e , Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l expl@@ ained that for many of her kids , there were no me@@ als on the wee@@ k@@ ends ."
No me@@ als on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day .
"@@ No me@@ als on S@@ und@@ ay , e@@ ither ."
So she co@@ o@@ ked p@@ ast@@ a because she wanted to make sure she co@@ o@@ ked something she knew her children would e@@ at .
"S@@ ome@@ thing that would s@@ tic@@ k to their ri@@ b@@ s , she said ."
S@@ ome@@ thing that would f@@ ill them up .
"@@ Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l tal@@ ked about how , by the time M@@ on@@ day came , her kids &apos; h@@ un@@ ger pan@@ gs were so int@@ en@@ se that they couldn &apos;t even beg@@ in to think about learning ."
F@@ ood was the only thing on their mind .
The only thing .
"And un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , the st@@ at@@ s — they tell the same story ."
"So , let &apos;s put this into the cont@@ ex@@ t of a child ."
M@@ e@@ et A@@ l@@ li@@ son .
"S@@ he &apos;s 12 years old , she &apos;s smar@@ t as a wh@@ i@@ p and she wan@@ ts to be a phys@@ ici@@ st when she gro@@ ws up ."
"H@@ er chan@@ ces of getting a n@@ u@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous me@@ al , one with f@@ ru@@ it and mil@@ k , one lo@@ wer in su@@ g@@ ar and s@@ al@@ t , dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally increase ."
A@@ l@@ li@@ son will have a lo@@ wer r@@ ate of ob@@ es@@ ity than the average k@@ id .
She &apos;ll have to vi@@ s@@ it the n@@ ur@@ se less .
She &apos;ll have lo@@ wer lev@@ els of an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty and depres@@ sion .
She &apos;ll have better behavior .
"S@@ he &apos;ll have better att@@ en@@ d@@ ance , and she &apos;ll show up on time more often ."
Why ?
"Well , because there &apos;s a good me@@ al wa@@ iting for her at school ."
"O@@ ver@@ all , A@@ l@@ li@@ son is in much better health than the average school k@@ id ."
So what about that k@@ id who doesn &apos;t have a n@@ u@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast wa@@ iting for him ?
He &apos;s also 12 . He &apos;s a wonderful k@@ id .
He wan@@ ts to be a doc@@ tor .
"B@@ y the time T@@ om@@ my is in kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , he &apos;s already under@@ per@@ form@@ ing in mat@@ h ."
"B@@ y the time he &apos;s in thir@@ d gra@@ de , he &apos;s got lo@@ wer mat@@ h and read@@ ing sc@@ o@@ res ."
"B@@ y the time he &apos;s 11 , it &apos;s more likely that T@@ om@@ my will have to have re@@ pe@@ ated a gra@@ de ."
So how wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad is this problem ?
"Well , un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve ."
"In this c@@ ity al@@ one , in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity , 4@@ 7@@ 4@@ ,000 kids under the age of 18 face h@@ un@@ ger every year ."
It &apos;s crazy .
"O@@ n the other hand , di@@ et and n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion is the number one c@@ ause of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able death and disease in this country , by far ."
And fully a thir@@ d of the kids that we &apos;ve been talking about t@@ on@@ ight are on tr@@ ack to have di@@ ab@@ et@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time .
"Now , what &apos;s hard to put together but is true is that , many times , these are the same children ."
So they f@@ ill up on the un@@ health@@ y and che@@ ap cal@@ ories that sur@@ r@@ ound them in their comm@@ uni@@ ties and that their fam@@ ili@@ es can aff@@ or@@ d .
"But we should be able to sol@@ ve this problem , right ?"
We know what the ans@@ w@@ ers are .
"This program has been incredi@@ bly suc@@ cess@@ ful , because it hel@@ ped us over@@ come a very difficult bar@@ ri@@ er when it came to getting kids a n@@ u@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ."
And that was the bar@@ ri@@ er of sti@@ g@@ m@@ a .
"S@@ e@@ e , scho@@ ols ser@@ ve bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast before school , and it was only av@@ a@@ il@@ able for the po@@ or kids ."
So everybody knew who was po@@ or and who needed government help .
"Now , all kids , no matter how much or how little their parents make , have a lot of pri@@ de ."
So what happened ?
"Well , the scho@@ ols that have imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted this program saw an increase in mat@@ h and read@@ ing sc@@ o@@ res by 1@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent . 1@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent ."
"And resear@@ ch sho@@ ws that when kids have a consi@@ st@@ ent , n@@ u@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast ,"
their chan@@ ces of gra@@ du@@ ating increase by 20 percent . 20 percent .
"When we give our kids the n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment they need ,"
"@@ we give them the chan@@ ce to th@@ ri@@ ve , both in the cl@@ ass@@ room and be@@ y@@ on@@ d ."
"Now , you don &apos;t have to tr@@ ust me on this , but you should talk to D@@ on@@ n@@ a Mar@@ ti@@ n ."
I love D@@ on@@ n@@ a Mar@@ ti@@ n .
"D@@ on@@ n@@ a Mar@@ ti@@ n is the school n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion direc@@ tor at B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty in W@@ ay@@ n@@ es@@ bor@@ o , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty is one of the po@@ o@@ rest di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts in the fi@@ f@@ th@@ -@@ po@@ o@@ rest state in the country , and about 100 percent of D@@ on@@ n@@ a &apos;s students live at or b@@ el@@ ow the po@@ ver@@ ty line ."
"A few years ago , D@@ on@@ n@@ a decided to get out a@@ head of the new st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds that were coming , and over@@ ha@@ u@@ l her n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds ."
She impro@@ ved and ad@@ ded f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and whole gra@@ ins .
She ser@@ ved bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast in the cl@@ ass@@ room to all of her kids .
And she imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted a d@@ in@@ ner program .
Why ?
"Well , many of her kids didn &apos;t have d@@ in@@ ner when they went home ."
So how did they respon@@ d ?
"Well , the kids lo@@ ved the food ."
"They lo@@ ved the better n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion , and they lo@@ ved not being h@@ un@@ gr@@ y ."
But D@@ on@@ n@@ a &apos;s bi@@ gg@@ est sup@@ por@@ ter came from an un@@ exp@@ ected place .
"H@@ is name from E@@ ri@@ c P@@ ar@@ ker , and he was the head fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all co@@ ach for the B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty B@@ ear@@ s ."
"Now , C@@ o@@ ach P@@ ar@@ ker had co@@ ach@@ ed me@@ di@@ oc@@ re te@@ ams for years ."
The B@@ ear@@ s often en@@ ded in the middle of the p@@ ack — a big dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment in one of the most p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all st@@ ates in the U@@ ni@@ on .
"( Laughter ) And C@@ o@@ ach P@@ ar@@ ker , he cre@@ d@@ ited that cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on@@ ship to D@@ on@@ n@@ a Mar@@ ti@@ n ."
"When we give our kids the bas@@ ic n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment , they &apos;re going to th@@ ri@@ ve ."
It &apos;s on all of us .
And fe@@ e@@ ding our kids the bas@@ ic n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion is just the star@@ ting point .
What I &apos;ve la@@ id out is really a mo@@ de@@ l for so many of the most pres@@ sing is@@ su@@ es that we face .
"If we fo@@ c@@ us on the simple go@@ al of pro@@ per@@ ly n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ourselves , we could see a world that is more st@@ able and sec@@ ure ; we could dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally impro@@ ve our economic produc@@ ti@@ vity ; we could trans@@ form our health care and we could go a long way in en@@ sur@@ ing that the Earth can pro@@ vi@@ de for gener@@ ations to come ."
F@@ ood is that place where our coll@@ ec@@ tive eff@@ or@@ ts can have the gre@@ at@@ est imp@@ act .
So we have to ask ourselves : What is the right question ?
What would be the imp@@ act ?
"@@ Ch@@ er@@ y@@ l B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a , D@@ on@@ n@@ a Mar@@ ti@@ n , C@@ o@@ ach P@@ ar@@ ker and the B@@ ur@@ ke C@@ oun@@ ty B@@ ear@@ s — I think they know the answer ."
Thank you gu@@ ys so very much .

"M@@ ic@@ hel@@ ang@@ el@@ o had this el@@ eg@@ ant way of descri@@ b@@ ing it when he said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very bloc@@ k of st@@ one has a st@@ at@@ ue inside of it , and it &apos;s the t@@ ask of the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tor to disc@@ over it . &quot; &quot; But what if he worked in the op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tion ?"
I know that &apos;s an ab@@ sur@@ d n@@ oti@@ on .
It &apos;s probably im@@ possible .
The only way you get a st@@ at@@ ue from a pi@@ le of d@@ ust is if the st@@ at@@ ue built itself — if some@@ how we could com@@ pe@@ l m@@ illions of these partic@@ les to come together to form the st@@ at@@ ue .
"I don &apos;t build with st@@ one , I build with n@@ an@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als ."
"They &apos;re these just im@@ possi@@ bly small , f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating little ob@@ jects ."
There were scienti@@ fic bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s happening all the time .
"The con@@ fer@@ ences were bu@@ z@@ zing , there was t@@ ons of money p@@ our@@ ing in from fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
We were trying to make bl@@ a@@ zing f@@ ast compu@@ ters using n@@ an@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als .
The same thing that makes them so interesting — their small size — also makes them im@@ possible to work with .
It &apos;s liter@@ ally like trying to build a st@@ at@@ ue out of a pi@@ le of d@@ ust .
And we just don &apos;t have the to@@ ols that are small enough to work with them .
"But even if we did , it wouldn &apos;t really matter , because we couldn &apos;t one by one place m@@ illions of partic@@ les together to build a technology ."
"So because of that , all of the prom@@ ise and all of the exc@@ it@@ ement has re@@ ma@@ ined just that : prom@@ ise and exc@@ it@@ ement ."
We &apos;ve built enti@@ re econom@@ ies on this idea .
It &apos;s exp@@ on@@ ential .
And we o@@ we it to ourselves to keep this progress going .
"We want to say the same thing 10 , 20 , 30 years from now : look what we &apos;ve done over the last 30 years ."
Y@@ et we know this progress may not last fore@@ ver .
"So if we want to keep this par@@ ty going , we have to do what we &apos;ve always been able to do , and that is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate ."
They are just like they sound .
"And the science t@@ ells us if we could emp@@ lo@@ y them in compu@@ ting , we could see up to a ten times impro@@ v@@ ement in per@@ form@@ ance ."
It &apos;s like s@@ ki@@ p@@ ping through se@@ ver@@ al technology gener@@ ations in just one ste@@ p .
So there we have it .
"The science is scre@@ am@@ ing at us , &quot; This is what you should be doing to sol@@ ve your problem . &quot;"
"So , all right , let &apos;s get started , let &apos;s do this ."
But you just run right back into that d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ ed@@ g@@ ed s@@ word .
This &quot; &quot; ide@@ al solu@@ tion &quot; &quot; con@@ ta@@ ins a material that &apos;s im@@ possible to work with .
I &apos;d have to ar@@ ran@@ ge b@@ illions of them just to make one single computer ch@@ i@@ p .
"It &apos;s that same con@@ und@@ ru@@ m , it &apos;s like this und@@ ying problem ."
"What are we not doing that nee@@ ds to be done ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like in &quot; &quot; The G@@ o@@ d@@ father , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"When F@@ re@@ do be@@ tr@@ ays his bro@@ ther M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el , we all know what nee@@ ds to be done ."
( Laughter ) But M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el — he pu@@ ts it off .
"F@@ ine , I get it ."
"Th@@ e@@ ir mother &apos;s still ali@@ ve , it would make her up@@ set ."
"We just said , &quot; What &apos;s the F@@ re@@ do in our problem ? &quot;"
"We have to find a way , some@@ how , to com@@ pe@@ l , to con@@ v@@ ince b@@ illions of these partic@@ les to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble themselves into the technology ."
We can &apos;t do it for them . They have to do it for themselves .
"And it &apos;s the hard way , and this is not tri@@ vi@@ al , but in this case , it &apos;s the only way ."
"Now , as it turns out , this is not that ali@@ en of a problem ."
We just don &apos;t build anything this way .
People don &apos;t build anything this way .
But if you look around — and there &apos;s exam@@ pl@@ es every@@ where — M@@ other N@@ ature buil@@ ds everything this way .
E@@ very@@ thing is built from the bot@@ tom up .
"You can go to the be@@ ach , you &apos;ll find these simple org@@ an@@ is@@ ms that use prot@@ e@@ ins — basically m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es — to t@@ em@@ pl@@ ate what is ess@@ enti@@ ally s@@ and , just pl@@ uc@@ king it from the se@@ a and building these ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tures with extre@@ me di@@ vers@@ ity ."
She &apos;s been there for hund@@ re@@ ds of m@@ illions of years .
We &apos;re the ones that are l@@ ate to the par@@ ty .
"So we decided that we &apos;re going to use the same to@@ ol that nature us@@ es , and that &apos;s ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y ."
Ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y is the mis@@ sing to@@ ol .
"We &apos;ve develop@@ ed ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y that goes into the pi@@ le of d@@ ust , into the pi@@ le of n@@ an@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ les , and pul@@ ls out exactly the ones we need ."
"Now , compu@@ ting is just one example ."
"It &apos;s the one that I &apos;m interest@@ ed in , that my group is really inv@@ est@@ ed in , but there are others in re@@ ne@@ w@@ able energy , in medic@@ ine , in struc@@ tur@@ al materi@@ als , where the science is going to tell you to move to@@ wards the n@@ an@@ o ."
That &apos;s where the bi@@ gg@@ est b@@ ene@@ f@@ it is .
And they will need ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y . That &apos;s the point .
"The beau@@ ty of science is that once you devel@@ op these new to@@ ols , they &apos;re out there ."
Thank you so much for your time . I ap@@ preci@@ ate it .

"We are now going through an ama@@ zing and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted moment where the power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics between men and women are shi@@ f@@ ting very r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly , and in many of the places where it coun@@ ts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything ."
"In my mother &apos;s day , she didn &apos;t go to colle@@ ge ."
Not a lot of women did .
"And now , for every two men who get a colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , three women will do the same ."
"W@@ om@@ en , for the first time this year , bec@@ ame the maj@@ or@@ ity of the American wor@@ k@@ force ."
"And they &apos;re star@@ ting to dom@@ in@@ ate lots of prof@@ es@@ sions — doc@@ tors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , b@@ an@@ k@@ ers , ac@@ coun@@ t@@ an@@ ts ."
"O@@ ver 50 percent of man@@ ag@@ ers are women these days , and in the 15 prof@@ es@@ sions pro@@ jec@@ ted to grow the most in the next dec@@ ad@@ e , all but two of them are dom@@ in@@ ated by women ."
"So the global econom@@ y is becom@@ ing a place where women are more suc@@ cess@@ ful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are star@@ ting to r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly aff@@ ect our culture — what our r@@ om@@ an@@ tic com@@ e@@ dies look like , what our marri@@ ages look like , what our d@@ ating lives look like , and our new set of super@@ her@@ o@@ es ."
"For a long time , this is the im@@ age of American man@@ ho@@ od that dom@@ in@@ ated — t@@ ough , ru@@ gg@@ ed , in control of his own environ@@ ment ."
"A few years ago , the Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o M@@ an was re@@ ti@@ red and re@@ plac@@ ed by this much less im@@ pres@@ sive spec@@ im@@ en , who is a par@@ o@@ dy of American man@@ ho@@ od , and that &apos;s what we have in our comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als today ."
The ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; fir@@ st@@ -@@ born son &quot; &quot; is so de@@ e@@ ply in@@ gra@@ ined in our consciousness that this st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c al@@ one sho@@ c@@ ked me .
"In American fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ty cl@@ in@@ ics , 7@@ 5 percent of cou@@ pl@@ es are requ@@ est@@ ing girls and not bo@@ ys ."
"And in places where you wouldn &apos;t think , such as S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a , India and China , the very str@@ ic@@ t pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies are star@@ ting to bre@@ ak down a little , and fam@@ ili@@ es are no longer stron@@ g@@ ly pre@@ fer@@ r@@ ing fir@@ st@@ -@@ born s@@ ons ."
"If you think about this , if you just op@@ en your ey@@ es to this possi@@ bility and start to con@@ n@@ ect the d@@ ots , you can see the evidence every@@ where ."
"You can see it in colle@@ ge gra@@ du@@ ation patterns , in job pro@@ jec@@ tions , in our marri@@ age st@@ atis@@ tics , you can see it in the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c elec@@ tions , which you &apos;ll hear about later , and you can see it on S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an sur@@ ve@@ ys on son pre@@ fer@@ ence , that something ama@@ zing and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted is happening with women ."
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had great progress with women .
The &apos; 20@@ s and the &apos; 6@@ 0s also come to mind .
"But the difference is that , back then , it was dri@@ ven by a very p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate f@@ em@@ in@@ ist mov@@ ement that was trying to pro@@ ject its own des@@ i@@ res , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as this time , it &apos;s not about p@@ assion , and it &apos;s not about any kind of mov@@ ement ."
This is really just about the fac@@ ts of this economic moment that we live in .
"The 200@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ year per@@ i@@ od in which men have been top do@@ g is tru@@ ly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why I talk about the &quot; &quot; end of men . &quot; &quot; Now all you men out there , this is not the moment where you t@@ un@@ e out or th@@ row some tom@@ at@@ o@@ es , because the point is that this is happening to all of us ."
I my@@ self have a h@@ us@@ b@@ and and a father and two s@@ ons wh@@ om I de@@ arly love .
"And this is why I like to talk about this , because if we don &apos;t ac@@ knowledge it , then the tran@@ si@@ tion will be pretty pain@@ ful ."
"But if we do take ac@@ coun@@ t of it , then I think it will go much more s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ly ."
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago .
"I was read@@ ing he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines about the rec@@ es@@ sion just like any@@ one else , and I started to not@@ ice a dist@@ inc@@ t patter@@ n — that the rec@@ es@@ sion was aff@@ ec@@ ting men much more de@@ e@@ ply than it was aff@@ ec@@ ting women ."
"And I remem@@ ber@@ ed back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by S@@ us@@ an F@@ al@@ u@@ d@@ i called &quot; &quot; S@@ ti@@ ff@@ ed : The B@@ e@@ tr@@ ay@@ al of the American M@@ an , &quot; &quot; in which she descri@@ bed how hard the rec@@ es@@ sion had h@@ it men , and I started to think about whether it had g@@ ot@@ ten wor@@ se this time around in this rec@@ es@@ sion ."
And I reali@@ zed that two things were different this time around .
The first was that these were no longer just t@@ em@@ por@@ ary h@@ its that the rec@@ es@@ sion was giving men — that this was re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting a de@@ e@@ per under@@ l@@ ying shi@@ ft in our global econom@@ y .
"And second , that the story was no longer just about the cri@@ s@@ is of men , but it was also about what was happening to women ."
And now look at this second set of sli@@ des .
Th@@ ese are he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines about what &apos;s been going on with women in the next few years .
Th@@ ese are things we never could have imag@@ ined a few years ago .
"W@@ om@@ en , a maj@@ or@@ ity of the wor@@ k@@ place ."
And l@@ ab@@ or st@@ atis@@ tics : women take up most man@@ ag@@ eri@@ al j@@ ob@@ s .
This second set of he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines — you can see that fam@@ ili@@ es and marri@@ ages are star@@ ting to shi@@ ft .
And look at that last he@@ ad@@ line — young women ear@@ ning more than young men .
That particular he@@ ad@@ line comes to me from a market resear@@ ch fir@@ m .
They were basically asked by one of their c@@ li@@ ents who was going to bu@@ y h@@ ous@@ es in that ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in the future .
"And they exp@@ ected that it would be young fam@@ ili@@ es , or young men , just like it had always been ."
"But in fact , they found something very surpri@@ sing ."
"It was young , single women who were the maj@@ or pur@@ cha@@ s@@ ers of h@@ ous@@ es in the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
"And so they decided , because they were in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this fin@@ ding , to do a n@@ ati@@ on@@ wi@@ de sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"So they sp@@ read out all the cen@@ su@@ s data , and what they found , the guy descri@@ bed to me as a sho@@ c@@ ker , which is that in 1@@ ,@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 out of 2@@ ,000 comm@@ uni@@ ties , women , young women , were making more money than young men ."
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more po@@ wer@@ ful ear@@ n@@ ers than the young men around them .
"Now , I &apos;ve just la@@ id out the picture for you , but I still ha@@ ven &apos;t expl@@ ained to you why this is happening ."
"And in a moment , I &apos;m going to show you a grap@@ h , and what you &apos;ll see on this grap@@ h — it beg@@ ins in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , just before women start f@@ loo@@ ding the wor@@ k@@ force , and it br@@ ings us up to our curren@@ t day ."
And basically what you &apos;ll see is what econom@@ ists talk about as the p@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation of the econom@@ y .
Now what does that mean ?
"It means that the econom@@ y is divi@@ ding into high@@ -@@ sk@@ ill , high@@ -@@ w@@ age j@@ ob@@ s and low@@ -@@ sk@@ ill , low@@ -@@ w@@ age j@@ ob@@ s — and that the middle , the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ sk@@ ill j@@ ob@@ s , and the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ ear@@ ning j@@ ob@@ s , are star@@ ting to dro@@ p out of the econom@@ y ."
This has been going on for 40 years now .
But this process is aff@@ ec@@ ting men very differ@@ ently than it &apos;s aff@@ ec@@ ting women .
"You &apos;ll see the women in red , and you &apos;ll see the men in bl@@ ue ."
"You &apos;ll wat@@ ch them both dro@@ p out of the middle cl@@ ass , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men ."
There we go .
So wat@@ ch that . You see them both dro@@ p out of the middle cl@@ ass .
W@@ at@@ ch what happens to the women . W@@ at@@ ch what happens to the men .
"The men sort of st@@ ag@@ n@@ ate there , while the women z@@ o@@ om up in those high@@ -@@ sk@@ ill j@@ ob@@ s ."
So what &apos;s that about ?
"It looks like women got some power bo@@ ost on a vide@@ o g@@ ame , or like they s@@ n@@ uc@@ k in some sec@@ re@@ t ser@@ um into their bir@@ th@@ -@@ control p@@ ills that le@@ ts them sho@@ ot up high ."
"But of course , it &apos;s not about that ."
What it &apos;s about is that the econom@@ y has changed a lot .
"We used to have a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing econom@@ y , which was about building go@@ o@@ ds and produc@@ ts , and now we have a serv@@ ice econom@@ y and an information and cre@@ ative econom@@ y ."
"Th@@ ose two econom@@ ies requ@@ ire very different sk@@ ills , and as it happens , women have been much better at ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the new set of sk@@ ills than men have been ."
"It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn &apos;t have a colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but you had a speci@@ fic set of sk@@ ills , and with the help of a uni@@ on , you could make yourself a pretty good mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ cl@@ ass life ."
But that really isn &apos;t true any@@ more .
"This new econom@@ y is pretty in@@ different to size and stre@@ ng@@ th , which is what &apos;s hel@@ ped men along all these years ."
What the econom@@ y requ@@ i@@ res now is a whole different set of sk@@ ills .
"You basically need intelligence , you need an ability to s@@ it still and fo@@ c@@ us , to comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate op@@ en@@ ly , to be able to li@@ st@@ en to people and to oper@@ ate in a wor@@ k@@ place that is much more flu@@ id than it used to be , and those are things that women do extre@@ me@@ ly well , as we &apos;re seeing ."
"If you look at man@@ ag@@ ement theory these days , it used to be that our ide@@ al lead@@ er s@@ oun@@ ded something like G@@ ener@@ al P@@ att@@ on , right ?"
You would be is@@ su@@ ing ord@@ ers from abo@@ ve .
You would be very hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical .
You would tell everyone b@@ el@@ ow you what to do .
But that &apos;s not what an ide@@ al lead@@ er is like now .
"If you read man@@ ag@@ ement bo@@ o@@ ks now , a lead@@ er is somebody who can f@@ os@@ ter cre@@ ati@@ vity , who can get his — get the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es — see , I still say &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; — who can get the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es to talk to each other , who can basically build te@@ ams and get them to be cre@@ ative ."
And those are all things that women do very well .
"And then on top of that , that &apos;s cre@@ ated a kind of cas@@ c@@ ad@@ ing eff@@ ect ."
"W@@ om@@ en en@@ ter the wor@@ k@@ place at the top , and then at the working cl@@ ass , all the new j@@ ob@@ s that are cre@@ ated are the kinds of j@@ ob@@ s that wi@@ ves used to do for f@@ ree at home ."
"So that &apos;s chil@@ d@@ care , el@@ der care and food pre@@ par@@ ation ."
"So those are all the j@@ ob@@ s that are gro@@ wing , and those are j@@ ob@@ s that women t@@ end to do ."
"Now one day it might be that mo@@ thers will h@@ ire an out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ work , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed , form@@ er ste@@ el@@ wor@@ ker guy to wat@@ ch their children at home , and that would be good for the men , but that ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t quite happened yet ."
"T@@ o see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the wor@@ k@@ force that is now , you have to look at our future wor@@ k@@ force ."
And here the story is fa@@ ir@@ ly simple .
W@@ om@@ en are getting colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ es at a fa@@ ster r@@ ate than men .
Why ? This is a real my@@ st@@ ery .
"@@ People have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to colle@@ ge , to comm@@ unity colle@@ ge , say , and re@@ to@@ ol themselves , learn a new set of sk@@ ills ?"
Well it turns out that they &apos;re just very un@@ com@@ fort@@ able doing that .
"They &apos;re used to thinking of themselves as pro@@ vi@@ d@@ ers , and they can &apos;t seem to build the social ne@@ t@@ works that al@@ low them to get through colle@@ ge ."
So for some reason men just don &apos;t end up going back to colle@@ ge .
And what &apos;s even more dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing is what &apos;s happening with youn@@ ger bo@@ ys .
"There &apos;s been about a dec@@ ad@@ e of resear@@ ch about what people are call@@ ing the &quot; &quot; bo@@ y cri@@ s@@ is . &quot; &quot; Now the bo@@ y cri@@ s@@ is is this idea that very young bo@@ ys , for wh@@ at@@ ever reason , are doing wor@@ se in school than very young girls , and people have the@@ ories about that ."
"I@@ s it because we have an exc@@ es@@ si@@ vely ver@@ b@@ al cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um , and little girls are better at that than little bo@@ ys ?"
"O@@ r that we requ@@ ire kids to s@@ it still too much , and so bo@@ ys in@@ i@@ ti@@ ally feel like fa@@ il@@ ures ?"
"And some people say it &apos;s because , in 9@@ th gra@@ de , bo@@ ys start d@@ rop@@ ping out of school ."
"Because I &apos;m wr@@ iting a book about all this , I &apos;m still looking into it , so I don &apos;t have the answer ."
"But in the mean time , I &apos;m going to call on the wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de education exper@@ t , who &apos;s my 1@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ old d@@ aughter , N@@ o@@ a , to talk to you about why the bo@@ ys in her cl@@ ass do wor@@ se ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) N@@ o@@ a : The girls are ob@@ vi@@ ously smar@@ ter .
I mean they have much lar@@ ger v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
They learn much fa@@ ster .
They are more contro@@ l@@ led .
"O@@ n the bo@@ ard today for l@@ os@@ ing rec@@ ess tom@@ or@@ row , only bo@@ ys ."
H@@ an@@ n@@ a R@@ os@@ in : And why is that ?
N@@ o@@ a : Why ? They were just not li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to the cl@@ ass while the girls s@@ at there very n@@ ic@@ ely .
H@@ R : So there you go .
This whole the@@ s@@ is really came home to me when I went to vi@@ s@@ it a colle@@ ge in K@@ ans@@ as C@@ ity — wor@@ k@@ ing@@ -@@ cl@@ ass colle@@ ge .
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , when I was in colle@@ ge , I had certain exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about my life — that my h@@ us@@ b@@ and and I would both work , and that we would equ@@ ally ra@@ ise the children ."
But these colle@@ ge girls had a completely different view of their future .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their h@@ us@@ b@@ and would maybe have a job , but that m@@ os@@ tly he would be at home taking care of the ki@@ d@@ dies ."
And this was kind of a sho@@ c@@ ker to me .
And then here &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite quot@@ e from one of the girls : &quot; M@@ en are the new b@@ all and cha@@ in . &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now you lau@@ gh , but that quot@@ e has kind of a st@@ ing to it , right ?"
"And I think the reason it has a st@@ ing is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t re@@ ver@@ se themselves without a lot of p@@ ain , and that &apos;s why I talk about us all going through this together ."
"The night after I tal@@ ked to these colle@@ ge girls , I also went to a men &apos;s group in K@@ ans@@ as , and these were exactly the kind of v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of the man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing econom@@ y which I sp@@ o@@ ke to you about ear@@ li@@ er ."
"They were men who had been con@@ tr@@ ac@@ tors , or they had been building h@@ ous@@ es and they had l@@ ost their j@@ ob@@ s after the h@@ ous@@ ing bo@@ om , and they were in this group because they were fa@@ il@@ ing to p@@ ay their child sup@@ port ."
And the in@@ struc@@ tor was up there in the cl@@ ass expl@@ ain@@ ing to them all the ways in which they had l@@ ost their i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty in this new age .
"He was t@@ elling them they no longer had any moral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , that no@@ body needed them for emoti@@ onal sup@@ port any@@ more , and they were not really the pro@@ vi@@ d@@ ers ."
So who were they ?
And this was very di@@ sh@@ ear@@ ten@@ ing for them .
"And what he did was he wr@@ ote down on the bo@@ ard &quot; $ 8@@ 5@@ ,000 , &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s her s@@ al@@ ary , &quot; &quot; and then he wr@@ ote down &quot; &quot; $ 1@@ 2@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s your s@@ al@@ ary ."
So who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; &quot; he asked them .
&quot; &quot; Wh@@ o &apos;s the d@@ am@@ n man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot; &quot; And that really s@@ ent a sh@@ u@@ d@@ der through the room .
"And that &apos;s part of the reason I like to talk about this , because I think it can be pretty pain@@ ful , and we really have to work through it ."
And the other reason it &apos;s kind of ur@@ g@@ ent is because it &apos;s not just happening in the U.@@ S@@ .
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
"In India , po@@ or women are learning English fa@@ ster than their m@@ ale coun@@ ter@@ parts in order to st@@ af@@ f the new call cen@@ ters that are gro@@ wing in India ."
"In China , a lot of the op@@ en@@ ing up of pri@@ v@@ ate ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ ship is happening because women are star@@ ting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , small bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es , fa@@ ster than men ."
"And here &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite example , which is in S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a ."
"O@@ ver se@@ ver@@ al dec@@ ad@@ es , S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a built one of the most pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies we know about ."
They basically en@@ sh@@ r@@ ined the secon@@ d@@ -@@ cl@@ ass st@@ at@@ us of women in the civi@@ l co@@ de .
"And if women fa@@ il@@ ed to bir@@ th m@@ ale children , they were basically tre@@ ated like dom@@ es@@ tic serv@@ an@@ ts ."
And sometimes family would pr@@ ay to the sp@@ ir@@ its to k@@ ill off a gir@@ l child so they could have a m@@ ale child .
"But over the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s , the S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ a government decided they wanted to r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ ze , and so what they did was , they started to p@@ us@@ h women into the wor@@ k@@ force ."
Now they &apos;ve been as@@ king a question since 19@@ 8@@ 5 : &quot; How stron@@ g@@ ly do you pre@@ f@@ er a fir@@ st@@ -@@ born son ? &quot;
And now look at the char@@ t .
That &apos;s from 19@@ 8@@ 5 to 200@@ 3 .
How much do you pre@@ f@@ er a fir@@ st@@ -@@ born son ?
So you can see that these economic changes really do have a str@@ ong eff@@ ect on our culture .
"Now because we ha@@ ven &apos;t fully pro@@ cess@@ ed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our po@@ p culture in these kind of we@@ ir@@ d and ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ated ways , where you can see that the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es are chang@@ ing ."
"And so we have on the m@@ ale side what one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues li@@ kes to call the &quot; &quot; ome@@ g@@ a m@@ al@@ es &quot; &quot; pop@@ ping up , who are the m@@ al@@ es who are r@@ om@@ an@@ tic@@ ally chall@@ eng@@ ed l@@ os@@ ers who can &apos;t find a job ."
And they come up in lots of different for@@ ms .
So we have the per@@ pe@@ tual ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent .
We have the char@@ m@@ less mis@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pe .
Th@@ en we have our B@@ u@@ d L@@ ight guy who &apos;s the happy cou@@ ch p@@ ot@@ a@@ to .
"And then here &apos;s a sho@@ c@@ ker : even America &apos;s most se@@ x@@ i@@ est man ali@@ ve , the se@@ x@@ i@@ est man ali@@ ve gets r@@ om@@ an@@ tic@@ ally play@@ ed these days in a mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"And then on the f@@ em@@ ale side , you have the op@@ pos@@ ite , in which you have these crazy super@@ her@@ o women ."
You &apos;ve got L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a .
"You &apos;ve got our new J@@ am@@ es B@@ on@@ d , who &apos;s A@@ ng@@ el@@ ina J@@ o@@ li@@ e ."
"And it &apos;s not just for the young , right ?"
E@@ ven H@@ el@@ en M@@ ir@@ re@@ n can hold a gu@@ n these days .
And so it fe@@ els like we have to move from this place where we &apos;ve got these u@@ ber@@ -@@ ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ated imag@@ es into something that fe@@ els a little more norm@@ al .
"So for a long time in the economic sp@@ here , we &apos;ve li@@ ved with the ter@@ m &quot; &quot; gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing . &quot; &quot; Now I &apos;ve never really li@@ ked this ter@@ m ."
"For one thing , it pu@@ ts men and women in a really an@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ is@@ tic relation@@ ship with one another , because the men are these de@@ vi@@ ous tr@@ ic@@ k@@ st@@ ers up there who &apos;ve put up this gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And we &apos;re always b@@ el@@ ow the gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing , the women ."
"And we have a lot of sk@@ ill and experience , but it &apos;s a tr@@ ick , so how are you sup@@ posed to pre@@ p@@ are to get through that gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing ?"
"And also , &quot; &quot; sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing the gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing &quot; &quot; is a ter@@ ri@@ ble ph@@ ra@@ se ."
What crazy person would po@@ p their head through a gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing ?
"So the im@@ age that I like to think of , instead of gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing , is the high bri@@ dge ."
"It &apos;s defin@@ it@@ ely ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying to st@@ and at the fo@@ ot of a high bri@@ dge , but it &apos;s also pretty ex@@ h@@ il@@ ar@@ ating , because it &apos;s beautiful up there , and you &apos;re looking out on a beautiful view ."
And the great thing is there &apos;s no tr@@ ick like with the gl@@ ass ce@@ il@@ ing .
There &apos;s no man or woman st@@ anding in the middle about to c@@ ut the c@@ ab@@ les .
There &apos;s no hole in the middle that you &apos;re going to f@@ all through .
And the great thing is that you can take any@@ one along with you .
You can bring your h@@ us@@ b@@ and along .
"You can bring your friends , or your colle@@ ag@@ ues , or your b@@ ab@@ ys@@ it@@ ter to wal@@ k along with you ."
"And h@@ us@@ b@@ ands can d@@ ra@@ g their wi@@ ves across , if their wi@@ ves don &apos;t feel ready ."
"But the point about the high bri@@ dge is that you have to have the con@@ fi@@ dence to know that you des@@ er@@ ve to be on that bri@@ dge , that you have all the sk@@ ills and experience you need in order to wal@@ k across the high bri@@ dge , but you just have to make the deci@@ sion to take the first ste@@ p and do it ."
Th@@ an@@ ks very much .
( Applause )
"A@@ t every st@@ age of our lives we make deci@@ sions that will prof@@ oun@@ dly in@@ flu@@ ence the lives of the people we &apos;re going to become , and then when we become those people , we &apos;re not always thr@@ ill@@ ed with the deci@@ sions we made ."
So young people p@@ ay good money to get t@@ at@@ to@@ o@@ s re@@ mo@@ ved that te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers p@@ a@@ id good money to get .
M@@ i@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed people ru@@ shed to di@@ v@@ or@@ ce people who young ad@@ ults ru@@ shed to mar@@ ry .
O@@ l@@ der ad@@ ults work hard to l@@ ose what mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ ag@@ ed ad@@ ults worked hard to g@@ ain .
O@@ n and on and on .
"The question is , as a psycho@@ logi@@ st , that f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ates me is , why do we make deci@@ sions that our future selves so often re@@ gre@@ t ?"
"Now , I think one of the reas@@ ons — I &apos;ll try to con@@ v@@ ince you today — is that we have a fundamental mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tion about the power of time ."
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the r@@ ate of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an , that your children seem to change by the minut@@ e but your parents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the name of this mag@@ ical point in life where change su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly goes from a gal@@ lo@@ p to a cra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ en@@ age years ? I@@ s it middle age ?
"I@@ s it old age ? The answer , it turns out , for most people , is now , wh@@ er@@ ever now happens to be ."
"What I want to con@@ v@@ ince you today is that all of us are wal@@ king around with an ill@@ u@@ sion , an ill@@ u@@ sion that history , our pers@@ onal history , has just come to an end , that we have just rec@@ ently become the people that we were always me@@ ant to be and will be for the rest of our lives ."
Let me give you some data to back up that cl@@ a@@ i@@ m .
Here &apos;s three val@@ ues .
So how does it do so ?
"Well , we asked thousands of people ."
"We asked half of them to predic@@ t for us how much their val@@ ues would change in the next 10 years , and the others to tell us how much their val@@ ues had changed in the last 10 years ."
"And this en@@ ab@@ led us to do a really interesting kind of anal@@ ys@@ is , because it al@@ lowed us to comp@@ are the predic@@ tions of people , say , 18 years old , to the re@@ por@@ ts of people who were 2@@ 8 , and to do that kind of anal@@ ys@@ is thr@@ ough@@ out the li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
Here &apos;s what we found .
"A@@ t every age , from 18 to 6@@ 8 in our data set , people v@@ ast@@ ly under@@ es@@ tim@@ ated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years ."
We call this the &quot; &quot; end of history &quot; &quot; ill@@ u@@ sion .
"T@@ o give you an idea of the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of this eff@@ ect , you can con@@ n@@ ect these two l@@ ines , and what you see here is that 18@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate chang@@ ing only as much as 5@@ 0-@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds actually do ."
Now it &apos;s not just val@@ ues . It &apos;s all sor@@ ts of other things .
"For example , pers@@ on@@ ality ."
"M@@ any of you know that psycho@@ logi@@ sts now cl@@ a@@ i@@ m that there are five fundamental dimensions of pers@@ on@@ ality : neur@@ ot@@ ic@@ ism , op@@ en@@ ness to experience , ag@@ re@@ e@@ ab@@ l@@ en@@ ess , ex@@ tra@@ ver@@ sion , and consci@@ enti@@ ous@@ ness ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , we asked people how much they exp@@ ected to change over the next 10 years , and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years , and what we found , well , you &apos;re going to get used to seeing this di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m over and over , because once again the r@@ ate of change does s@@ low as we age , but at every age , people under@@ es@@ tim@@ ate how much their pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties will change in the next dec@@ ad@@ e ."
And it isn &apos;t just e@@ ph@@ em@@ er@@ al things like val@@ ues and pers@@ on@@ ality .
"You can ask people about their li@@ kes and dis@@ li@@ kes , their bas@@ ic pre@@ fer@@ ences ."
"For example , name your best fri@@ end , your fav@@ or@@ ite kind of v@@ ac@@ ation , what &apos;s your fav@@ or@@ ite ho@@ b@@ by , what &apos;s your fav@@ or@@ ite kind of mu@@ sic ."
People can name these things .
"We ask half of them to tell us , &quot; Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years ? &quot;"
"@@ and half of them to tell us , &quot; D@@ id that change over the last 10 years ? &quot;"
D@@ o@@ es any of this matter ?
I@@ s this just a form of mis@@ -@@ predic@@ tion that doesn &apos;t have con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences ?
"@@ No , it mat@@ ters quite a bit , and I &apos;ll give you an example of why ."
It be@@ dev@@ il@@ s our deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making in important ways .
B@@ r@@ ing to mind right now for yourself your fav@@ or@@ ite m@@ us@@ ici@@ an today and your fav@@ or@@ ite m@@ us@@ ici@@ an 10 years ago .
I put m@@ ine up on the scre@@ en to help you along .
"And yet , when we asked them how much they would p@@ ay to see the person who was their fav@@ or@@ ite 10 years ago per@@ form today , they say only 80 dollars ."
"Now , in a per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly r@@ ational world , these should be the same number , but we over@@ p@@ ay for the op@@ port@@ unity to in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge our curren@@ t pre@@ fer@@ ences because we over@@ es@@ tim@@ ate their st@@ ability ."
"Wh@@ y does this happen ? We &apos;re not enti@@ re@@ ly sure , but it probably has to do with the e@@ ase of remem@@ b@@ ering ver@@ su@@ s the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of imag@@ in@@ ing ."
"M@@ ost of us can remember who we were 10 years ago , but we find it hard to imagine who we &apos;re going to be , and then we mi@@ sta@@ k@@ en@@ ly think that because it &apos;s hard to imagine , it &apos;s not likely to happen ."
"S@@ or@@ ry , when people say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re u@@ su@@ ally talking about their own l@@ ack of imag@@ in@@ ation , and not about the un@@ li@@ ke@@ li@@ ho@@ od of the ev@@ ent that they &apos;re descri@@ b@@ ing ."
"The bot@@ tom line is , time is a po@@ wer@@ ful force ."
It trans@@ for@@ ms our pre@@ fer@@ ences .
It re@@ shap@@ es our val@@ ues .
It al@@ ters our pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties .
"We seem to ap@@ preci@@ ate this fact , but only in re@@ tr@@ osp@@ ect ."
O@@ n@@ ly when we look bac@@ k@@ wards do we reali@@ ze how much change happens in a dec@@ ad@@ e .
It &apos;s a wat@@ er@@ shed on the tim@@ el@@ ine .
It &apos;s the moment at which we fin@@ ally become ourselves .
H@@ um@@ an be@@ ings are works in progress that mi@@ sta@@ k@@ en@@ ly think they &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed .
"The person you are right now is as tran@@ si@@ ent , as f@@ le@@ e@@ ting and as t@@ em@@ por@@ ary as all the people you &apos;ve ever been ."
The one con@@ st@@ ant in our life is change .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We &apos;ve been told to go out on a lim@@ b and say something surpri@@ sing .
"So I &apos;ll try and do that , but I want to start with two things that everyone already kno@@ ws ."
"And the first one , in fact , is something that has been known for most of rec@@ or@@ ded history , and that is , that the planet Earth , or the sol@@ ar system , or our environ@@ ment or wh@@ at@@ ever , is uni@@ qu@@ ely su@@ ited to su@@ st@@ ain our evolution — or cre@@ ation , as it used to be thought — and our present exist@@ ence , and most important , our future survi@@ v@@ al ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays , this idea has a dr@@ am@@ atic name : S@@ p@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p Earth ."
"And the idea there is that outside the sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , the universe is im@@ plac@@ ably h@@ os@@ ti@@ le , and inside is all we have , all we dep@@ end on , and we only get the one chan@@ ce : if we m@@ ess up our sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , we &apos;ve got no@@ where else to go ."
"Now , the second thing that everyone already kno@@ ws is that , con@@ tr@@ ary to what was beli@@ ev@@ ed for most of human history , human be@@ ings are not , in fact , the hu@@ b of exist@@ ence ."
"As S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king fam@@ ously said , we &apos;re just a ch@@ em@@ ical sc@@ um on the sur@@ face of a typ@@ ical planet that &apos;s in or@@ bit around a typ@@ ical star , which is on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of a typ@@ ical galaxy , and so on ."
"Now , the first of those two things that everyone kno@@ ws is kind of saying that we &apos;re at a very un@@ -@@ typ@@ ical place , uni@@ qu@@ ely su@@ ited and so on , and the second one is saying that we &apos;re at a typ@@ ical place ."
But that doesn &apos;t pre@@ v@@ ent them from both being completely f@@ al@@ se .
( Laughter ) And they are .
"So let me start with the second one : &quot; &quot; T@@ yp@@ ical . &quot; &quot; Well , is this a typ@@ ical place ?"
"Well , let &apos;s look around , you know , look in a ran@@ dom direc@@ tion , and we see a w@@ all , and ch@@ em@@ ical sc@@ um — ( Laughter ) and that &apos;s not typ@@ ical of the universe at all ."
"A@@ ll you &apos;ve got to do is go a few hundred mil@@ es in that same direc@@ tion and look back , and you won &apos;t see any w@@ all@@ s or ch@@ em@@ ical sc@@ um at all — all you see is a bl@@ ue planet ."
"And if you go f@@ ur@@ ther than that , you &apos;ll see the Su@@ n , the sol@@ ar system and the stars and so on , but that &apos;s still not typ@@ ical of the universe , because stars come in galaxies ."
"So let &apos;s go out f@@ ur@@ ther , ti@@ ll we &apos;re outside the galaxy , and look back , and ye@@ ah , there &apos;s the huge galaxy with sp@@ ir@@ al ar@@ ms la@@ id out in front of us ."
"And at this point , we &apos;ve come 1@@ 0@@ 0,000 ligh@@ t-@@ years from here ."
But we &apos;re still no@@ where ne@@ ar a typ@@ ical place in the universe .
"T@@ o get to a typ@@ ical place , you &apos;ve got to go 1@@ ,000 times as far as that , into inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space ."
"And so , what does that look like — &quot; &quot; typ@@ ical ? &quot; &quot; What does a &quot; &quot; typ@@ ical &quot; &quot; place in the universe look like ?"
"Well , at en@@ orm@@ ous exp@@ en@@ se , TED has ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ed a high@@ -@@ res@@ olution im@@ mer@@ sion vir@@ tual reality ren@@ der@@ ing of the view from inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space ."
"C@@ an we have the ligh@@ ts off , ple@@ ase , so we can see it ?"
"Well , not quite , not quite per@@ f@@ ect ."
"You see , inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space is completely dark , p@@ it@@ ch dark ."
"It &apos;s so dark , that if you were to be looking at the ne@@ are@@ st star to you , and that star were to exp@@ lo@@ de as a super@@ no@@ v@@ a , and you were to be star@@ ing direc@@ tly at it at the moment when its light re@@ ach@@ ed you , you still wouldn &apos;t be able to see even a g@@ lim@@ m@@ er ."
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
"And that &apos;s des@@ p@@ ite the fact that a super@@ no@@ v@@ a is so b@@ right , so br@@ illi@@ ant an ev@@ ent , that it would k@@ ill you st@@ one de@@ ad at a ran@@ ge of se@@ ver@@ al ligh@@ t-@@ years ."
"( Laughter ) And yet , from inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , it &apos;s so far away you wouldn &apos;t even see it ."
It &apos;s also very co@@ ld out there — less than three de@@ gre@@ es abo@@ ve ab@@ sol@@ ute z@@ er@@ o .
And it &apos;s very emp@@ ty .
The v@@ ac@@ u@@ um there is one million times less den@@ se than the high@@ est v@@ ac@@ u@@ um that our best technology on Earth can curren@@ tly create .
So that &apos;s how different a typ@@ ical place is from this place .
And that is how un@@ -@@ typ@@ ical this place is .
So can we have the ligh@@ ts back on ple@@ ase ? Thank you .
"Now , how do we know about an environ@@ ment that &apos;s so far away and so different and so ali@@ en from anything we &apos;re used to ?"
"Well , the Earth — our environ@@ ment , in the form of us — is cre@@ ating knowledge ."
"Well , what does that mean ?"
"Well , look out even f@@ ur@@ ther than we &apos;ve just been — I mean from here , with a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e — and you &apos;ll see things that look like stars , they &apos;re called qu@@ as@@ ar@@ s ."
"&quot; Q@@ u@@ as@@ ar@@ s &quot; or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally me@@ ant &quot; qu@@ as@@ i@@ -@@ st@@ ell@@ ar ob@@ ject , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; things that look a bit like stars . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But they &apos;re not stars ."
And we know what they are .
"B@@ illions of years ago and b@@ illions of ligh@@ t-@@ years away , the material at the center of a galaxy coll@@ ap@@ sed to@@ wards a super@@ -@@ massive black hole ."
"Now , the physics of the human brain could har@@ dly be more un@@ like the physics of such a j@@ et ."
We couldn &apos;t survi@@ ve for an inst@@ ant in it .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age bre@@ a@@ ks down when trying to descri@@ be what it would be like in one of those j@@ ets .
"( Laughter ) And yet , that j@@ et happened in preci@@ se@@ ly such a way that b@@ illions of years later , on the other side of the universe , some bit of ch@@ em@@ ical sc@@ um could ac@@ cur@@ ately descri@@ be and mo@@ de@@ l and predic@@ t and explain , abo@@ ve all — there &apos;s your re@@ fer@@ ence — what was happening there , in reality ."
"@@ Not just a super@@ f@@ ici@@ al im@@ age of it , though it con@@ ta@@ ins that as well , but an ex@@ plan@@ at@@ ory mo@@ de@@ l , em@@ bo@@ d@@ ying the same ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al relation@@ shi@@ ps and the same cau@@ s@@ al struc@@ ture ."
"Now , that is knowledge ."
"And if that wer@@ en &apos;t ama@@ zing enough , the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful@@ ness with which the one struc@@ ture re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ es the other is increas@@ ing with time ."
That is the grow@@ th of knowledge .
"So , the la@@ ws of physics have this speci@@ al pro@@ per@@ ty , that physical ob@@ jects as un@@ like each other as they could possi@@ bly be , can ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less em@@ body the same ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al and cau@@ s@@ al struc@@ ture and to do it more and more so over time ."
So we are a ch@@ em@@ ical sc@@ um that is different .
This ch@@ em@@ ical sc@@ um has univers@@ ality .
"I@@ ts struc@@ ture con@@ ta@@ ins , with e@@ ver@@ -@@ increas@@ ing preci@@ sion , the struc@@ ture of everything ."
"This place , and not other places in the universe , is a hu@@ b which con@@ ta@@ ins within itself the struc@@ tur@@ al and cau@@ s@@ al ess@@ ence of the whole of the rest of physical reality ."
"And so , far from being in@@ si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant , the fact that the la@@ ws of physics al@@ low this or even m@@ and@@ ate that this can happen , is one of the most important things about the physical world ."
"Now how does the sol@@ ar system — our environ@@ ment , in the form of us — ac@@ qu@@ ire this speci@@ al relation@@ ship with the rest of the universe ?"
"Well , one thing that &apos;s true about S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king &apos;s re@@ mar@@ k — I mean , it is true , but it &apos;s the wrong emp@@ ha@@ s@@ is ."
"One thing that &apos;s true about it is that it doesn &apos;t do it with any speci@@ al physics , there &apos;s no speci@@ al di@@ sp@@ en@@ s@@ ation , no m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les inv@@ ol@@ ved ."
It does it simply with three things that we have here in ab@@ und@@ ance .
"One of them is matter , because the grow@@ th of knowledge is a form of information pro@@ cess@@ ing ."
"I@@ n@@ formation pro@@ cess@@ ing is comp@@ ut@@ ation , comp@@ ut@@ ation requ@@ i@@ res a computer — there &apos;s no known way of making a computer without matter ."
"We also need energy to make the computer , and most important , to make the me@@ dia , in eff@@ ect , on@@ to which we rec@@ or@@ d the knowledge that we disc@@ over ."
"And then thir@@ dly , less t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble but just as ess@@ ential for the op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded cre@@ ation of knowledge , of ex@@ plan@@ ations , is evidence ."
"Now , our environ@@ ment is in@@ und@@ ated with evidence ."
"But the evidence that we used to do that was f@@ all@@ ing down on every s@@ qu@@ are me@@ ter of the Earth for b@@ illions of years before that , and will contin@@ ue to f@@ all for b@@ illions of years af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And the same is true for all the other sci@@ ences .
"As far as we know , evidence to disc@@ over the most fundamental tru@@ ths of all the sci@@ ences is here just for the taking , on our planet ."
O@@ ur loc@@ ation is s@@ at@@ ur@@ ated with evidence and also with matter and energy .
"O@@ ut in inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , those three pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ it@@ es for the op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded cre@@ ation of knowledge are at their low@@ est possible sup@@ ply — as I said , it &apos;s emp@@ ty , it &apos;s co@@ ld and it &apos;s dark out there ."
O@@ r is it ?
"Now actually , that &apos;s just another par@@ o@@ ch@@ i@@ al mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) Because imagine a cu@@ be out there in inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space , the same size as our home , the sol@@ ar system ."
"Now that cu@@ be is very emp@@ ty by human st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds , but that still means that it con@@ ta@@ ins over a million t@@ ons of matter ."
"And a million t@@ ons is enough to make , say , a self-@@ con@@ tain@@ ed space st@@ ation , on which there &apos;s a col@@ on@@ y of scienti@@ sts that are dev@@ ot@@ ed to cre@@ ating an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded stre@@ am of knowledge , and so on ."
"But the thing is , in a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible universe , if something isn &apos;t for@@ bi@@ dd@@ en by the la@@ ws of physics , then what could possi@@ bly pre@@ v@@ ent us from doing it , other than kno@@ wing how ?"
"In other words , it &apos;s a matter of knowledge , not res@@ our@@ ces ."
"If we could do that , we &apos;d au@@ tom@@ atic@@ ally have an energy sup@@ ply , because this trans@@ m@@ ut@@ ation would be a fu@@ sion re@@ ac@@ tor ."
And evidence ?
"Well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human sen@@ ses , but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , even one of pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day desig@@ n , look out , and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here ."
"And with a more po@@ wer@@ ful tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e , you &apos;ll be able to see stars and plan@@ ets in those galaxies , you &apos;ll be able to do ast@@ ro@@ physics and learn the la@@ ws of physics ."
"And loc@@ ally there you could build partic@@ le ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ ors , and learn el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ le physics and ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y , and so on ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably the har@@ d@@ est science to do would be bio@@ logy field tri@@ ps — ( Laughter ) because it would take se@@ ver@@ al hundred million years to get to the ne@@ are@@ st li@@ fe@@ -@@ be@@ ar@@ ing planet and back .
"But I have to tell you — and sor@@ ry , R@@ ic@@ hard — but I never did like bio@@ logy field tri@@ ps much , ( Laughter ) and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years . ( Laughter )"
"So in fact , inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space does con@@ tain all the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ it@@ es for the op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded cre@@ ation of knowledge ."
"A@@ n@@ y such cu@@ be any@@ where in the universe could become the same kind of hu@@ b that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there ."
"So , we &apos;re not in a uni@@ qu@@ ely h@@ osp@@ it@@ able place ."
"If inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space is cap@@ able of cre@@ ating an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded stre@@ am of ex@@ plan@@ ations , then so is almost every other environ@@ ment , so is the Earth ."
So is a p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ted Earth .
"And the lim@@ iting fac@@ tor , there and here , is not res@@ our@@ ces , because they &apos;re pl@@ enti@@ ful , but knowledge , which is sc@@ ar@@ ce ."
Now this cos@@ mi@@ c knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ -@@ bas@@ ed view may — and I think ought to — make us feel very speci@@ al .
"But it should also make us feel v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able , because it means that without the speci@@ fic knowledge that &apos;s needed to survi@@ ve the on@@ going chall@@ eng@@ es of the universe , we won &apos;t survi@@ ve them ."
"A@@ ll it ta@@ kes is for a super@@ no@@ v@@ a to go off a few ligh@@ t-@@ years away , and we &apos;ll all be de@@ ad !@@ "
"M@@ arti@@ n R@@ e@@ es has rec@@ ently wr@@ it@@ ten a book about our v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability to all sor@@ ts of things , from ast@@ ro@@ physics , to scienti@@ fic experim@@ ents g@@ one wrong , and most import@@ an@@ tly , to ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism with we@@ ap@@ ons of mass de@@ struc@@ tion ."
And he thin@@ ks that civi@@ li@@ zation has only a 50 percent chan@@ ce of survi@@ ving this century .
I think he &apos;s going to talk about that later in the con@@ fer@@ ence .
"Now , I don &apos;t think that prob@@ ability is the right cat@@ eg@@ ory to disc@@ us@@ s this is@@ sue in , but I do ag@@ ree with him about this : We can survi@@ ve and we can fa@@ il to survi@@ ve ."
"But it dep@@ ends not on chan@@ ce , but on whether we create the re@@ lev@@ ant knowledge in time ."
The d@@ an@@ ger is not at all un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted .
S@@ p@@ ec@@ ies go ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t all the time .
C@@ i@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations end .
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing maj@@ or@@ ity of all spec@@ ies and all civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations that have ever exist@@ ed are now history .
"And if we want to be the ex@@ cep@@ tion to that , then log@@ ically , our only hope is to make use of the one fe@@ ature that dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ sh@@ es our spec@@ ies and civi@@ li@@ zation from all the others — nam@@ ely , our speci@@ al relation@@ ship with the la@@ ws of physics , our ability to create new ex@@ plan@@ ations , new knowledge — to be a hu@@ b of exist@@ ence ."
"Now , I &apos;m a phys@@ ici@@ st , but I &apos;m not the right kind of phys@@ ici@@ st ."
"In re@@ g@@ ard to global war@@ m@@ ing , I &apos;m just a l@@ ay@@ man ."
And the r@@ ational thing for a l@@ ay@@ man to do is to take ser@@ i@@ ously the pre@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ ing scienti@@ fic theory .
"And ac@@ cor@@ ding to that theory , it &apos;s already too l@@ ate to av@@ o@@ id a di@@ sa@@ ster , because if it &apos;s true that our best op@@ tion at the moment is to pre@@ v@@ ent C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ sions with something like the K@@ y@@ ot@@ o P@@ r@@ ot@@ o@@ co@@ l , with its con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts on economic acti@@ vity and its en@@ orm@@ ous c@@ ost of hund@@ re@@ ds of b@@ illions of dollars , or wh@@ at@@ ever it is , then that is already a di@@ sa@@ ster by any reas@@ on@@ able measure ."
"And the ac@@ tions that are adv@@ oc@@ ated are not even pur@@ por@@ ted to sol@@ ve the problem , mer@@ ely to pos@@ t@@ p@@ one it by a little ."
"It was probably already too l@@ ate in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , when the best av@@ a@@ il@@ able scienti@@ fic theory was t@@ elling us that in@@ du@@ stri@@ al em@@ is@@ sions were about to preci@@ p@@ it@@ ate a new ice age , in which b@@ illions would die ."
"Now , the l@@ es@@ son of that seems c@@ lear to me , and I don &apos;t know why it isn &apos;t in@@ form@@ ing public de@@ b@@ ate ."
It is that we can &apos;t always know .
"When we know of an imp@@ en@@ ding di@@ sa@@ ster , and how to sol@@ ve it at a c@@ ost less than the c@@ ost of the di@@ sa@@ ster itself , then there &apos;s not going to be much ar@@ g@@ ument , really ."
But no pre@@ cau@@ tions and no pre@@ cau@@ tion@@ ary prin@@ ci@@ ple can av@@ o@@ id problems that we do not yet fore@@ see .
"H@@ ence , we need a st@@ ance of proble@@ m@@ -@@ fi@@ x@@ ing , not just proble@@ m@@ -@@ av@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ance ."
"If you &apos;ve been p@@ un@@ ched on the n@@ ose , then the science of medic@@ ine does not consi@@ st of teach@@ ing you how to av@@ o@@ id p@@ un@@ ch@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) If medic@@ al science st@@ op@@ ped see@@ king cu@@ res and con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated on pre@@ ven@@ tion only , then it would achi@@ e@@ ve very little of e@@ ither ."
The world is bu@@ z@@ zing at the moment with pl@@ ans to force re@@ duc@@ tions in g@@ as em@@ is@@ sions at all cos@@ ts .
"It ought to be bu@@ z@@ zing with pl@@ ans to re@@ duce the t@@ em@@ per@@ ature , and with pl@@ ans to live at the high@@ er t@@ em@@ per@@ ature — and not at all cos@@ ts , but eff@@ ici@@ ently and che@@ ap@@ ly ."
"A@@ t the moment , these things are fr@@ in@@ ge resear@@ ch ; they &apos;re not cen@@ tr@@ al to the human eff@@ ort to face this problem , or problems in gener@@ al ."
"And with problems that we are not aw@@ are of yet , the ability to put right — not the sh@@ e@@ er good l@@ uc@@ k of av@@ o@@ i@@ ding in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely — is our only hope , not just of sol@@ ving problems , but of survi@@ v@@ al ."
"So take two st@@ one t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts , and car@@ ve on them ."
"O@@ n one of them , car@@ ve : &quot; &quot; P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ ms are solu@@ ble . &quot; &quot; And on the other one , car@@ ve : &quot; &quot; P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ ms are in@@ ev@@ it@@ able . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
They need to be part of the p@@ ack .
"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 19@@ 60 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use dig@@ ital technology , as I &apos;ve done d@@ uring my first five TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ ks ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I have progres@@ sed , and I am , today , lau@@ n@@ ch@@ ing a br@@ and new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pic@@ ked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x con@@ ta@@ ins one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed world , 19@@ 60 , had one billion people ."
"In the develop@@ ing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they li@@ ved away then .
There was a big g@@ ap between the one billion in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed world and the two billion in the develop@@ ing world .
"In the in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed world , people were health@@ y , educ@@ ated , r@@ ich , and they had small fam@@ ili@@ es ."
And their as@@ p@@ ir@@ ation was to bu@@ y a c@@ ar .
"And in 19@@ 60 , all S@@ we@@ des were sa@@ ving to try to bu@@ y a V@@ ol@@ v@@ o like this ."
This was the economic level at which S@@ we@@ d@@ en was .
"But in con@@ tr@@ ast to this , in the develop@@ ing world , far away , the as@@ p@@ ir@@ ation of the average family there was to have food for the day ."
They were sa@@ ving to be able to bu@@ y a p@@ air of sho@@ es .
There was an en@@ orm@@ ous g@@ ap in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this g@@ ap between the W@@ est and the rest has cre@@ ated a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic@@ ally when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing W@@ or@@ ld . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s over@@ d@@ ue to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 19@@ 60 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a st@@ ag@@ g@@ ering four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
J@@ ust look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic grow@@ th in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of comp@@ an@@ ies have happened to grow the econom@@ y , so the W@@ est@@ er@@ n population mo@@ ved over to here ."
And now their as@@ p@@ ir@@ ation is not only to have a c@@ ar .
Now they want to have a ho@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ m@@ ote dest@@ in@@ ation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most suc@@ cess@@ ful of the develop@@ ing countries , they have mo@@ ved on , you know , and they have become em@@ er@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ ying car@@ s .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ in@@ ese comp@@ any , G@@ e@@ ely , they ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red the V@@ ol@@ v@@ o comp@@ any , and then fin@@ ally the S@@ we@@ des underst@@ ood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy is that the two billion over here that is str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling for food and sho@@ es , they are still almost as po@@ or as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the bi@@ gg@@ est pi@@ le of b@@ illions , the three b@@ illions here , which are also becom@@ ing em@@ er@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies , because they are quite health@@ y , relati@@ vely well@@ -@@ educ@@ ated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; r@@ ic@@ her also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ p@@ ir@@ ation now is , of course , to bu@@ y a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le , and then later on they would like to have a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any g@@ ap ."
"But the dist@@ ance from the po@@ o@@ rest here , the very po@@ o@@ rest , to the very r@@ ic@@ h@@ est over here is wi@@ der than ever ."
"But there is a contin@@ u@@ ous world from wal@@ king , bi@@ king , dri@@ ving , fl@@ ying — there are people on all lev@@ els , and most people t@@ end to be some@@ where in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to pro@@ ject into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i rec@@ ently , and I li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will cat@@ ch up , just as Jap@@ an did ."
A@@ ll the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with se@@ ven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start fl@@ ying .
"And these lo@@ wer or middle income countries , the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards econom@@ ically ."
"And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can av@@ o@@ id se@@ v@@ ere c@@ lim@@ ate change , and energy can still be relati@@ vely che@@ ap — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to bu@@ y elec@@ tri@@ c car@@ s .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the po@@ o@@ rest two billion ?
What about the po@@ o@@ rest two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; grow@@ th &#93; comes in because there &#91; am@@ ong em@@ er@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is w@@ ide@@ ly used , and population grow@@ th is coming to an end ."
"@@ Here &#91; am@@ ong the po@@ o@@ rest &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; po@@ o@@ rest &#93; two billion will , in the next dec@@ ad@@ es , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ e@@ after increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a n@@ uc@@ lear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; grow@@ th &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; grow@@ th &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the po@@ o@@ rest &#93; get out of po@@ ver@@ ty , they get education , they get impro@@ ved child survi@@ v@@ al , they can bu@@ y a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and a c@@ ell ph@@ one and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population grow@@ th will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and sho@@ es because then we get contin@@ u@@ ed population grow@@ th .
And let me show you why by con@@ ver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d@@ -@@ time dig@@ ital technology .
Here I have on the scre@@ en my country bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es .
E@@ very bu@@ b@@ ble is a country . The size is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ el@@ low on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark bl@@ ue is A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ; bro@@ wn is Euro@@ pe ; gre@@ en is the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ ast and this light bl@@ ue is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ a .
That &apos;s India and this is China . S@@ i@@ ze is population .
"@@ Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big fam@@ ili@@ es , small fam@@ ili@@ es ."
The year is 19@@ 60 .
"And down here , child survi@@ v@@ al , the per@@ cent@@ age of children survi@@ ving chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od up to star@@ ting school : 60 percent , 7@@ 0 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est and health@@ i@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher tal@@ ked about in 19@@ 60 : one billion W@@ est@@ er@@ n world here — high chil@@ d@@ -@@ survi@@ v@@ al , small fam@@ ili@@ es — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develop@@ ing countries , with very large fam@@ ili@@ es and po@@ or child survi@@ v@@ al ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years p@@ ass by , child survi@@ v@@ al is increas@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ ap , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ation , p@@ en@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ am@@ ily size is dec@@ reas@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0-@@ percent child survi@@ v@@ al , then fam@@ ili@@ es dec@@ re@@ ase , and most of the A@@ ra@@ b countries in the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ ast is f@@ all@@ ing down there &#91; to small fam@@ ili@@ es &#93; ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok , B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h cat@@ ch@@ ing up with India ."
"The whole em@@ er@@ g@@ ing world jo@@ ins the W@@ est@@ er@@ n world with good child survi@@ v@@ al and small family size , but we still have the po@@ o@@ rest billion ."
"C@@ an you see the po@@ o@@ rest billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ x@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survi@@ v@@ al of only 7@@ 0 to 80 percent , mean@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at le@@ ast four who survi@@ ve to the next generation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; grow@@ th &#93; to stop is to contin@@ ue to impro@@ ve child survi@@ v@@ al to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why inv@@ est@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ ound@@ ation , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and a@@ id organi@@ z@@ ations , together with national government in the po@@ o@@ rest countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to re@@ ach a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able population size of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
C@@ hi@@ ld survi@@ v@@ al is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child survi@@ v@@ al that we will stop population grow@@ th .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , ne@@ ither am I a p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ st ."
"I &apos;m a very ser@@ i@@ ous &quot; &quot; possi@@ bili@@ st . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new cat@@ eg@@ ory where we take emoti@@ on ap@@ art , and we just work anal@@ y@@ tic@@ ally with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"W@@ ith gre@@ en technology and with inv@@ est@@ ments to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty , and global govern@@ ance , the world can become like this ."
And look at the posi@@ tion of the old W@@ est .
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber when this bl@@ ue bo@@ x was all al@@ one , lead@@ ing the world , living its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ ound@@ ation of the moder@@ n world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

S@@ up@@ pose that two American friends are tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing together in I@@ tal@@ y .
"The second guy — we &apos;ll call him B@@ ill — is trans@@ fi@@ x@@ ed by em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ment , at star@@ ing at the thing there in the center ."
"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two gu@@ ys was more likely to have v@@ ot@@ ed for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , which for A@@ l G@@ ore ?"
"And in this case , the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that li@@ ber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a maj@@ or pers@@ on@@ ality tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"@@ People low on it like things that are fam@@ ili@@ ar , that are sa@@ fe and dep@@ en@@ d@@ able ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at Ap@@ ple@@ be@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about poli@@ tics .
This tra@@ it also t@@ ells us a lot about the kinds of grou@@ ps people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the W@@ e@@ b .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to ra@@ ise your hand , whether you are li@@ ber@@ al , left of center — on social is@@ su@@ es , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ mar@@ ily — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a thir@@ d op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of li@@ ber@@ t@@ ari@@ ans in the au@@ dience ."
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ le@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re li@@ ber@@ t@@ ari@@ an .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And ple@@ ase ra@@ ise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to see@@ k a de@@ e@@ per understanding of the world , our gener@@ al l@@ ack of moral di@@ vers@@ ity here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share val@@ ues , when people all share mor@@ als , they become a te@@ am , and once you eng@@ age the psycho@@ logy of te@@ ams , it sh@@ u@@ ts down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the li@@ ber@@ al te@@ am l@@ os@@ es , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other te@@ am .
"We think they must be bl@@ in@@ ded by religi@@ on , or by simple stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ ot@@ es R@@ e@@ publi@@ can because they are bl@@ in@@ ded in this way , then my mess@@ age to you is that you &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed in a moral mat@@ ri@@ x , in a particular moral mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pic@@ ked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psycho@@ logy and see where it ta@@ kes us .
What is mor@@ ality and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psycho@@ logy is the idea that the mind is a bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ate at bir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ i@@ ti@@ al organi@@ zation of the brain does not dep@@ end that much on experience ."
It gi@@ ves us very str@@ ong feel@@ ings about those who c@@ ause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ ound@@ ation under@@ li@@ es about 7@@ 0 percent of the moral st@@ at@@ em@@ ents I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The thir@@ d f@@ ound@@ ation is in@@ -@@ group / lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
You do find grou@@ ps in the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom — you do find co@@ oper@@ ative grou@@ ps — but these grou@@ ps are always e@@ ither very small or they &apos;re all si@@ bl@@ ings .
"It &apos;s only am@@ ong hum@@ ans that you find very large grou@@ ps of people who are able to co@@ oper@@ ate , jo@@ in together into grou@@ ps , but in this case , grou@@ ps that are un@@ ited to fi@@ ght other grou@@ ps ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tri@@ b@@ al living , of tri@@ b@@ al psycho@@ logy ."
( Laughter ) S@@ por@@ ts is to war as por@@ no@@ grap@@ h@@ y is to se@@ x .
"We get to ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent dri@@ ves ."
The f@@ our@@ th f@@ ound@@ ation is au@@ th@@ or@@ ity / resp@@ ect .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive ge@@ stu@@ res from two mem@@ bers of very cl@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated spec@@ ies .
"It &apos;s bas@@ ed on more v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary de@@ fer@@ ence , and even el@@ em@@ ents of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ ound@@ ation is pur@@ ity / s@@ anc@@ ti@@ ty .
"This pain@@ ting is called &quot; &quot; The A@@ l@@ le@@ g@@ ory O@@ f C@@ ha@@ sti@@ ty , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about sup@@ pres@@ sing f@@ em@@ ale se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ tion@@ n@@ a@@ ire , and you can too ."
Here are the res@@ ults .
"@@ Here are the res@@ ults from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ."
"They give high en@@ d@@ or@@ se@@ ment of these sor@@ ts of st@@ at@@ em@@ ents all across the bo@@ ard , but as you also see , li@@ ber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the line s@@ lo@@ p@@ es down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just f@@ li@@ p through a few other sli@@ des .
"@@ N@@ ot@@ ice also that on all of these grap@@ h@@ s , the s@@ lo@@ pe is ste@@ e@@ per on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , pur@@ ity ."
"Wh@@ ich sho@@ ws that within any country , the dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fa@@ ir@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first pan@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"A@@ ll is or@@ der@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and anim@@ als are doing what they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be doing , where they &apos;re sup@@ posed to be ."
"But then , given the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing wh@@ at@@ ever he wan@@ ts , with every ap@@ er@@ ture of every other person and every other anim@@ al ."
S@@ ome of you might recogni@@ ze this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably gi@@ ves way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the cu@@ tt@@ ings of the ap@@ er@@ tures h@@ ur@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ t@@ y@@ ch , these three pan@@ els por@@ tr@@ ay the tim@@ el@@ ess tru@@ th that order t@@ ends to dec@@ ay ."
The tru@@ th of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first r@@ ound , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people are@@ n &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a suc@@ ker . I &apos;m not going to co@@ oper@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so co@@ oper@@ ation qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly dec@@ ays from reas@@ on@@ ably good , down to cl@@ ose to z@@ er@@ o ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tr@@ ick — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ ach@@ ter said , on the se@@ ven@@ th r@@ ound , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New ru@@ le ."
Because I think that the gre@@ at@@ est won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of ro@@ ck , and then a lot of water and w@@ ind , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that comp@@ lic@@ ated .
"This is an ab@@ sol@@ ute m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ r@@ and C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the dis@@ ag@@ re@@ ement between li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an religi@@ ons have at@@ tain@@ ed .
Th@@ ink about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
You find the same thing in H@@ in@@ du@@ ism .
There are many high go@@ ds in H@@ in@@ du@@ ism .
"T@@ w@@ o of them are V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ u , the pres@@ er@@ ver , and S@@ hi@@ v@@ a , the dest@@ ro@@ y@@ er ."
This im@@ age actually is both of those go@@ ds sh@@ ar@@ ing the same body .
"You have the mark@@ ings of V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ u on the left , so we could think of V@@ i@@ sh@@ n@@ u as the con@@ serv@@ ative go@@ d ."
"You have the mark@@ ings of S@@ hi@@ v@@ a on the right , S@@ hi@@ v@@ a &apos;s the li@@ ber@@ al go@@ d . And they work together ."
"Th@@ ese two st@@ an@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ e@@ p@@ est in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts that have ever been at@@ tain@@ ed into moral psycho@@ logy ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en ma@@ ster S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; If you want the tru@@ th to st@@ and c@@ lear before you , never be for or against ."
"The str@@ u@@ gg@@ le between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , it &apos;s a disease that has been cau@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lead@@ ers ."
"But before you feel super@@ i@@ or to G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h , before you th@@ row a st@@ one , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ p@@ ping out of the b@@ att@@ le of good and evi@@ l ?
C@@ an you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I t@@ elling you to not stri@@ ve ?
"A@@ m I t@@ elling you to em@@ br@@ ace S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this str@@ u@@ gg@@ le of for and against ?"
"@@ No , ab@@ solu@@ tely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a P@@ o@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gi@@ o V@@ i@@ e@@ ir@@ a de M@@ ell@@ o , you can &apos;t just go char@@ g@@ ing in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that requ@@ ire us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ orm@@ ous moral au@@ th@@ or@@ ity of the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a — and it comes from his moral hum@@ ili@@ ty .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is p@@ assi@@ on@@ ately eng@@ ag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
People here are p@@ assi@@ on@@ ately eng@@ ag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate comm@@ it@@ ment to the tru@@ th .
And so I think that the answer is to use that p@@ assi@@ on@@ ate comm@@ it@@ ment to the tru@@ th to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything uni@@ qu@@ e about human be@@ ings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with fully develop@@ ed moral s@@ enti@@ ments .
We &apos;re ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with mor@@ ality as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I pers@@ on@@ ally am ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with mor@@ ality .
"It was all d@@ ue to this woman , S@@ ist@@ er M@@ ary Mar@@ ast@@ el@@ a , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an al@@ t@@ ar bo@@ y , I bre@@ ath@@ ed in a lot of in@@ cen@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ r@@ ases in L@@ ati@@ n , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s t@@ op@@ -@@ down mor@@ ality app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religi@@ ous and n@@ on@@ -@@ religi@@ ous were equ@@ ally ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with mor@@ ality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly bas@@ is for moral deci@@ sions ."
But I wanted to go f@@ ur@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y of mor@@ ality . I want to know
if there was a moral m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experim@@ ents , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I br@@ ought some with me .
This little sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge con@@ ta@@ ins the moral m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le found only in ma@@ m@@ m@@ als .
"In ro@@ d@@ ents , it was known to make mo@@ thers care for their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , and in some cre@@ atures , al@@ lowed for t@@ ol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ mat@@ es ."
"But in hum@@ ans , it was only known to fac@@ ili@@ t@@ ate bir@@ th and bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ e@@ ding in women , and is re@@ le@@ as@@ ed by both se@@ x@@ es d@@ uring se@@ x ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le .
I did what most of us do — I tri@@ ed it on some colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ au@@ l , that is the world &apos;s stu@@ pi@@ di@@ st idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a f@@ em@@ ale m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I coun@@ ter@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stu@@ p@@ id idea ."
But it was te@@ st@@ ably stu@@ p@@ id .
"In other words , I thought I could desig@@ n an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ ur@@ ns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ."
"B@@ as@@ el@@ ine lev@@ els are ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o , without some s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us to c@@ ause its re@@ le@@ ase ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ minut@@ e hal@@ f@@ -@@ life , and de@@ gra@@ des r@@ ap@@ i@@ dly at room t@@ em@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to c@@ ause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it f@@ ast and keep it co@@ ld ."
I think I can do that .
"Now l@@ uc@@ k@@ ily , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the b@@ loo@@ d , so I could do this experiment without learning neur@@ os@@ ur@@ g@@ ery ."
Th@@ en I had to measure mor@@ ality .
So taking on M@@ or@@ ality with a cap@@ ital M is a huge pro@@ ject .
So I started sm@@ all@@ er .
I stu@@ died one single vir@@ tu@@ e : tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 200@@ 0s that countries with a high@@ er pro@@ por@@ tion of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y people are more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic trans@@ ac@@ tions oc@@ cu@@ r and more we@@ al@@ th is cre@@ ated , al@@ le@@ vi@@ ating po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So po@@ or countries are by and large low tr@@ ust countries .
"So if I underst@@ ood the ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty ."
But I &apos;m also a s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ ag@@ u@@ ire appro@@ ach to resear@@ ch ."
"If you &apos;re so vir@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we t@@ emp@@ t people with vir@@ tu@@ e and v@@ ice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ struc@@ tion , and we never ever dec@@ e@@ i@@ ve them ."
Th@@ en we mat@@ ch them in p@@ a@@ ir@@ s by computer .
"And in that p@@ air , one person gets a mess@@ age saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tr@@ ick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now wh@@ at@@ ever you give up gets tri@@ pl@@ ed in the other person &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ t .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ th@@ ier .
And they get a mess@@ age by computer saying person one s@@ ent you this amount of money .
"D@@ o you want to keep it all , or do you want to s@@ end some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for minut@@ e .
You &apos;re going to s@@ it on these hard cha@@ ir@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome ma@@ d scienti@@ st is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a nee@@ d@@ le and take four tu@@ b@@ es of b@@ loo@@ d .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stran@@ ger ?
So this was the bir@@ th of v@@ am@@ p@@ ire econom@@ ics .
M@@ a@@ ke a deci@@ sion and give me some b@@ loo@@ d .
"So in fact , experim@@ ental econom@@ ists had run this test around the world , and for much high@@ er sta@@ kes , and the con@@ sen@@ su@@ s view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of tr@@ ust , and the trans@@ f@@ er from the second person back to the first meas@@ u@@ red tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , econom@@ ists were fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ sum@@ ed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 90 percent of the first deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ ma@@ k@@ ers s@@ ent money , and of those who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ tur@@ ned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by meas@@ uring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ard , the more money they re@@ tur@@ ned ."
So we have a bio@@ logy of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wa@@ it . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ w@@ o things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in is@@ ol@@ ation .
"So we meas@@ u@@ red n@@ ine other m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any eff@@ ect ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ direc@@ t relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin cau@@ sed tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate oxytocin direc@@ tly ."
I used everything sh@@ ort of a dr@@ ill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a n@@ as@@ al in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ ag@@ ues in Z@@ ur@@ ich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or plac@@ e@@ b@@ o , had that same tr@@ ust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only sho@@ wed more tr@@ ust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who s@@ ent all their money to a stran@@ ger — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or cogni@@ tion ."
"So oxytocin is the tr@@ ust m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le , but is it the moral m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ?"
"@@ U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we r@@ an more stu@@ dies ."
We sho@@ wed that oxytocin in@@ fu@@ sion incre@@ ases gener@@ os@@ ity in un@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ f@@ ers by 80 percent .
We sho@@ wed it incre@@ ases d@@ on@@ ations to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated n@@ on@@ -@@ ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ o@@ logi@@ c ways to ra@@ ise oxytocin .
"Th@@ ese in@@ clu@@ de m@@ ass@@ age , d@@ anc@@ ing and p@@ ra@@ ying ."
"Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise oxytocin , people w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ly op@@ en up their wal@@ le@@ ts and share money with str@@ ang@@ ers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is f@@ loo@@ ded with oxytocin ?
"T@@ o inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate this question , we r@@ an an experiment where we had people wat@@ ch a vide@@ o of a father and his four year@@ -@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain cancer ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they wat@@ ched the vide@@ o , we had them r@@ ate their feel@@ ings and took b@@ loo@@ d before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of emp@@ ath@@ y .
So it &apos;s emp@@ ath@@ y that makes us con@@ n@@ ect to other people .
It &apos;s emp@@ ath@@ y that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s emp@@ ath@@ y that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known philosop@@ her nam@@ ed A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith wr@@ ote a book in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The Th@@ e@@ ory of M@@ or@@ al S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; I@@ n this book , S@@ m@@ ith ar@@ gu@@ ed that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a t@@ op@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the emoti@@ ons of others ."
"So if I do something that h@@ ur@@ ts you , I feel that p@@ ain ."
So I t@@ end to av@@ o@@ id that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your jo@@ y ."
So I t@@ end to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith who , 1@@ 7 years later , would wr@@ ite a little book called &quot; &quot; The W@@ e@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ oun@@ ding doc@@ ument of econom@@ ics ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral philosop@@ her , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le be@@ h@@ ind it .
"But kno@@ wing that m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le is val@@ u@@ able , because it t@@ ells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it t@@ ells us why we see im@@ mor@@ ality ."
"So to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate im@@ mor@@ ality , let me bring you back now to 19@@ 80 ."
"I &apos;m working at a g@@ as st@@ ation on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of S@@ an@@ t@@ a B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
"You s@@ it in a g@@ as st@@ ation all day , you see lots of mor@@ ality and im@@ mor@@ ality , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ und@@ ay af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my cas@@ hi@@ er &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ p@@ ens it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the l@@ ost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very val@@ u@@ able .
"We have to find the ow@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ a . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to deci@@ de what to do with this , and the ph@@ one r@@ ings ."
"And a man says very exc@@ it@@ e@@ dly , &quot; &quot; I was in your g@@ as st@@ ation a while ago , and I b@@ ought this j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry for my wi@@ fe , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re sa@@ ving my life . Here &apos;s my ph@@ one number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wa@@ it half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , rel@@ a@@ x ."
"@@ G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ en@@ a in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ g@@ ain he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so n@@ ice , let &apos;s sp@@ li@@ t the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a cl@@ assi@@ c c@@ on called the pi@@ ge@@ on dro@@ p , and I was the pi@@ ge@@ on ."
"So the way many con@@ s work is not that the con@@ man gets the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m to tr@@ ust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tru@@ sts the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m ."
Now we know what happens .
"The v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m &apos;s brain re@@ le@@ ases oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing up your wal@@ let or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate our oxytocin syst@@ ems ?
"We found , te@@ st@@ ing thousands of in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , that five percent of the population don &apos;t re@@ le@@ ase oxytocin on s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us ."
"So if you tr@@ ust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t re@@ le@@ ase oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the t@@ able , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a tech@@ n@@ ical word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them b@@ a@@ star@@ ds .
( Laughter ) Th@@ ese are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es of psycho@@ p@@ a@@ ths .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited .
One is through impro@@ per n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing .
"So we &apos;ve stu@@ died se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t re@@ le@@ ase oxytocin on s@@ tim@@ ul@@ us ."
You need enough n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing for this system to devel@@ op pro@@ per@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high stress in@@ hi@@ b@@ its oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really st@@ res@@ sed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited , which is interesting — through the action of te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one ."
"So we , in experim@@ ents , have ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er@@ ed te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one to men ."
"And instead of sh@@ ar@@ ing money , they become self@@ ish ."
"But interest@@ ing@@ ly , high te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one m@@ al@@ es are also more likely to use their own money to p@@ un@@ ish others for being self@@ ish ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bio@@ logy , we have the y@@ in and y@@ ang of mor@@ ality ."
"We have oxytocin that connec@@ ts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one that makes us want to p@@ un@@ ish people who be@@ have im@@ mor@@ ally ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or government t@@ elling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory experim@@ ents , do they really app@@ ly to real life ?"
"Y@@ eah , I &apos;ve been wor@@ r@@ ying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve g@@ one out of the la@@ b to see if this really ho@@ l@@ ds in our d@@ a@@ ily lives .
"So last sum@@ m@@ er , I att@@ en@@ ded a we@@ d@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Eng@@ land ."
200 people in this beautiful V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I dro@@ ve up in my ren@@ ted V@@ au@@ x@@ h@@ all .
And I took out a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and d@@ ry ice and nee@@ d@@ les and tu@@ b@@ es .
And I took b@@ loo@@ d from the bri@@ de and the gro@@ om and the we@@ d@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the friends before and im@@ me@@ di@@ ately after the v@@ o@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And gu@@ ess what ?
"W@@ e@@ dd@@ ings c@@ ause a re@@ le@@ ase of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the center of the we@@ d@@ ding sol@@ ar system ?
The bri@@ de .
She had the bi@@ gg@@ est increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lo@@ ves the we@@ d@@ ding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
"H@@ er mother , that &apos;s right ."
H@@ er mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends — ar@@ ra@@ y@@ ed around the bri@@ de like plan@@ ets around the Su@@ n ."
"So I think it t@@ ells us that we &apos;ve desig@@ ned this r@@ it@@ u@@ al to con@@ n@@ ect us to this new couple , con@@ n@@ ect us emoti@@ on@@ ally ."
Why ? Because we need them to be suc@@ cess@@ ful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ate the spec@@ ies .
I also wor@@ ri@@ ed that my tr@@ ust experim@@ ents with small amoun@@ ts of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how often we actually tr@@ ust our lives to str@@ ang@@ ers .
"So even though I have a fear of he@@ igh@@ ts , I rec@@ ently str@@ app@@ ed my@@ self to another human being and ste@@ p@@ ped out of an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my b@@ loo@@ d before and after , and I had a huge sp@@ i@@ ke of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can con@@ n@@ ect to people .
"For example , through social me@@ dia ."
M@@ any people are T@@ wee@@ ting right now .
So we inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated the ro@@ le of social me@@ dia and found the using social me@@ dia produc@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ dig@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I r@@ an this experiment rec@@ ently for the K@@ o@@ re@@ an B@@ ro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing S@@ y@@ stem .
And they had the re@@ por@@ ters and their produc@@ ers par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate .
"And one of these gu@@ ys , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 1@@ 50 percent sp@@ i@@ ke in oxytocin ."
"I mean , ast@@ oun@@ ding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social me@@ dia in pri@@ v@@ ate .
"When I wr@@ ote my re@@ port to the K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my gu@@ ess was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They ch@@ ec@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s F@@ ac@@ e@@ book p@@ age .
There you go . That &apos;s connec@@ tion .
"So there &apos;s t@@ ons of ways that we can con@@ n@@ ect to other people , and it seems to be univers@@ al ."
"T@@ w@@ o wee@@ ks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New G@@ u@@ ine@@ a where I went up to the high@@ l@@ ands — very is@@ ol@@ ated tri@@ b@@ es of sub@@ sist@@ ence f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers living as they have li@@ ved for m@@ ill@@ en@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different langu@@ ages in the high@@ l@@ ands .
Th@@ ese are the most pri@@ mi@@ tive people in the world .
And they in@@ de@@ ed also re@@ le@@ ase oxytocin .
So oxytocin connec@@ ts us to other people .
O@@ x@@ y@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to c@@ ause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to re@@ le@@ ase oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fav@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the eas@@ i@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . G@@ i@@ ve me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my p@@ en@@ ch@@ ant for hu@@ gg@@ ing other people has ear@@ ned me the n@@ ic@@ k@@ name D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who re@@ le@@ ase more oxytocin are happ@@ ier .
And they &apos;re happ@@ ier because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all typ@@ es .
D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve says eight hu@@ gs a day .
E@@ ight hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be happ@@ ier and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to tou@@ ch people , I can always sho@@ ve this up your n@@ ose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
M@@ ay@@ be you remember .
"E@@ very day , we heard dev@@ ast@@ ating re@@ por@@ ts from the war in I@@ ra@@ q ."
There were wa@@ ves of ter@@ ro@@ r ro@@ l@@ ling across the g@@ lo@@ be .
It se@@ em@@ ed like hum@@ an@@ ity was sp@@ inning out of control .
"We were living through a time of t@@ ec@@ t@@ on@@ ic shi@@ f@@ ts in ide@@ o@@ logi@@ es , in poli@@ tics , in religi@@ on , in pop@@ ul@@ ations ."
E@@ very@@ thing f@@ el@@ t so pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous .
"And I remember thinking , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , what kind of world did we bring this child into ?"
"And as we en@@ ter@@ ed the 2@@ 1@@ st century , it was very c@@ lear that religi@@ ous extre@@ mis@@ m was once again on the ri@@ se ."
"And even when religi@@ on@@ -@@ rel@@ ated extre@@ mis@@ m does not le@@ ad to violence , it is still used as a political we@@ dge is@@ sue , c@@ y@@ n@@ ically lead@@ ing people to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y the sub@@ ordin@@ ation of women , the sti@@ g@@ m@@ ati@@ zation of L@@ G@@ B@@ T people , r@@ ac@@ ism , I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and an@@ ti@@ -@@ S@@ em@@ i@@ ti@@ s@@ m ."
We need to call this what it is : a great fa@@ il@@ ure of religi@@ on .
"But the thing is , this isn &apos;t even the only chall@@ en@@ ge that religi@@ on fac@@ es today ."
Let me explain what I mean like this .
"One of the great bl@@ ess@@ ings of being a r@@ ab@@ b@@ i is st@@ anding under the ch@@ up@@ p@@ ah , under the we@@ d@@ ding can@@ op@@ y , with a couple , and hel@@ ping them pro@@ cl@@ a@@ i@@ m pub@@ lic@@ ly and make ho@@ ly the love that they found for one another ."
"That &apos;s when we find ourselves in en@@ d@@ less , min@@ d@@ less re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions of words that don &apos;t mean anything to us , ri@@ sing and being se@@ ated because someone has asked us to , ho@@ l@@ ding on@@ to j@@ e@@ al@@ ously gu@@ ar@@ ded doc@@ tr@@ ine that &apos;s completely and w@@ il@@ dly out of ste@@ p with our cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary reality , eng@@ aging in per@@ fun@@ c@@ t@@ ory pr@@ acti@@ ce simply because that &apos;s the way things have always been done ."
R@@ e@@ li@@ gi@@ on is wan@@ ing in the United States .
"Now , we had no money , no space , no g@@ ame pl@@ an , but we did have e@@ ma@@ il ."
So my fri@@ end M@@ e@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ a and I s@@ at down and we wr@@ ote an e@@ ma@@ il which we s@@ ent out to a few friends and colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"It basically said this : &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore you b@@ a@@ il on religi@@ on , why don &apos;t we come together this F@@ ri@@ day night and see what we might make of our own J@@ e@@ w@@ ish in@@ her@@ it@@ ance ? &quot; &quot; We ho@@ ped maybe 20 people would show up ."
It tur@@ ned out 1@@ 3@@ 5 people came .
"They were c@@ y@@ n@@ ics and see@@ k@@ ers , a@@ the@@ ists and r@@ ab@@ b@@ is ."
M@@ any people said that night that it was the first time that they had a mean@@ ing@@ ful religi@@ ous experience in their enti@@ re lives .
"There are J@@ e@@ w@@ ish and Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an and M@@ us@@ li@@ m and C@@ ath@@ o@@ li@@ c religi@@ ous lead@@ ers , many of them women , by the way , who have set out to re@@ cl@@ a@@ i@@ m the heart of our tra@@ di@@ tions , who fir@@ m@@ ly believe that now is the time for religi@@ on to be part of the solu@@ tion ."
"And while the the@@ o@@ logi@@ es and the pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es v@@ ary very much between these in@@ dep@@ en@@ dent comm@@ uni@@ ties , what we can see are some common , consi@@ st@@ ent thre@@ ads between them ."
I &apos;m going to share with you four of those comm@@ it@@ ments now .
The first is wa@@ ke@@ ful@@ ness .
We live in a time today in which we have un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted ac@@ cess to information about every global tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy that happens on every cor@@ ner of this Earth .
We all saw this picture .
We saw this picture of a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old child pul@@ led out of the ru@@ b@@ ble of his building in A@@ le@@ p@@ p@@ o .
"And once we see these imag@@ es , we are called to a certain kind of action ."
This is extre@@ me@@ ly difficult to do .
"@@ P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts tell us that the more we learn about what &apos;s bro@@ ken in our world , the less likely we are to do anything ."
"The second prin@@ ci@@ ple is hope , and I want to say this about hope ."
"H@@ op@@ e is not n@@ a@@ i@@ ve , and hope is not an op@@ i@@ ate ."
&quot; &quot; I need you . You need me .
"It &apos;s sup@@ posed to be about giving people back a sense of pur@@ pose , a sense of hope , a sense that they and their dre@@ ams fundam@@ ent@@ ally matter in this world that t@@ ells them that they don &apos;t matter at all ."
The thir@@ d prin@@ ci@@ ple is the prin@@ ci@@ ple of mi@@ gh@@ t@@ iness .
There &apos;s a r@@ ab@@ b@@ in@@ ic tra@@ di@@ tion that we are to wal@@ k around with two sli@@ ps of p@@ ap@@ er in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts .
"One says , &quot; &quot; I am but d@@ ust and as@@ h@@ es . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not all about me ."
"I can &apos;t control everything , and I cannot do this on my own ."
"The other sli@@ p of p@@ ap@@ er says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or my sa@@ ke the world was cre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ich is to say it &apos;s true that I can &apos;t do everything , but I can su@@ re@@ ly do something ."
I can for@@ give .
I can love .
I can show up .
I can prot@@ est .
I can be a part of this con@@ vers@@ ation .
It &apos;s a si@@ g@@ n of t@@ ot@@ al sub@@ mis@@ sion .
"Now in our comm@@ unity , when we get up off the ground , we st@@ and with our h@@ ands ra@@ is@@ ed to the he@@ av@@ ens , and we say , &quot; &quot; I am str@@ ong , I am mi@@ gh@@ ty , and I am wor@@ th@@ y ."
The f@@ our@@ th and fin@@ al is inter@@ connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"He took a picture of it and pos@@ ted it up on social me@@ dia , and a Jap@@ an@@ ese te@@ en@@ ag@@ er cont@@ ac@@ ted him ."
How small our world has become .
It &apos;s so hard for us to remember how inter@@ connec@@ ted we all are as human be@@ ings .
Let me tell you how this works .
"And gu@@ ess what ? T@@ ran@@ sp@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and r@@ ac@@ ism of all for@@ ms , those are also all of our problems ."
And so too is an@@ ti@@ -@@ S@@ em@@ i@@ ti@@ s@@ m all of our problems .
Because E@@ m@@ m@@ a L@@ az@@ ar@@ us was right .
"O@@ ur hear@@ ts h@@ ur@@ t from the fa@@ il@@ ed religi@@ on of extre@@ mis@@ m , and we des@@ er@@ ve more than the fa@@ il@@ ed religi@@ on of r@@ out@@ in@@ e-@@ ism ."
"It is time for religi@@ ous lead@@ ers and religi@@ ous comm@@ uni@@ ties to take the le@@ ad in the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al and cul@@ tur@@ al shi@@ ft that this country and the world so des@@ per@@ ately nee@@ ds — a shi@@ ft to@@ ward love , to@@ ward j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce , to@@ ward equality and to@@ ward di@@ gn@@ ity for all ."
I believe that our children des@@ er@@ ve no less than that .
Thank you .
( Applause )
D@@ em@@ o@@ cr@@ acy .
"In the W@@ est , we make a col@@ os@@ s@@ al mi@@ sta@@ ke taking it for gr@@ an@@ ted ."
"We see democr@@ acy not as the most fr@@ ag@@ ile of f@@ low@@ ers that it really is , but we see it as part of our society &apos;s f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure ."
We t@@ end to think of it as an in@@ tran@@ si@@ g@@ ent given .
We mi@@ sta@@ k@@ en@@ ly believe that cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism be@@ gets in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably democr@@ acy .
It doesn &apos;t .
"S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore &apos;s L@@ e@@ e K@@ u@@ an Y@@ ew and his great im@@ it@@ at@@ ors in B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing have de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated be@@ y@@ on@@ d reas@@ on@@ able d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that it is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly possible to have a fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism , spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular grow@@ th , while poli@@ tics re@@ ma@@ ins democr@@ ac@@ y-@@ f@@ ree ."
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , democr@@ acy is re@@ ce@@ ding in our nec@@ k of the w@@ oo@@ ds , here in Euro@@ pe ."
"@@ Ear@@ li@@ er this year , while I was re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing G@@ re@@ ece — the ne@@ w@@ ly elec@@ ted G@@ re@@ e@@ k government — in the Euro@@ group as its F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ ist@@ er , I was told in no un@@ certain ter@@ ms that our n@@ ation &apos;s democr@@ atic process — our elec@@ tions — could not be al@@ lowed to inter@@ f@@ ere with economic poli@@ ci@@ es that were being imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted in G@@ re@@ ece ."
"T@@ on@@ ight , here , I want to present to you an economic case for an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c democr@@ acy ."
"And without democr@@ acy , our societies will be n@@ as@@ ti@@ er , our future b@@ le@@ ak and our great , new techno@@ logi@@ es wa@@ sted ."
"S@@ pe@@ a@@ king of wa@@ st@@ e , al@@ low me to point out an interesting par@@ a@@ do@@ x that is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ing our econom@@ ies as we spe@@ ak ."
I call it the tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks par@@ a@@ do@@ x .
We all recogni@@ ze the m@@ oun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ ts .
But few people disc@@ er@@ n its tw@@ in .
"A m@@ oun@@ tain of i@@ d@@ le cas@@ h b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to r@@ ich sa@@ ver@@ s and to cor@@ por@@ ations , too ter@@ ri@@ fied to inv@@ est it into the produc@@ tive acti@@ vi@@ ties that can gener@@ ate the in@@ comes from which you can ex@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish the m@@ oun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ ts and which can pro@@ duce all those things that hum@@ an@@ ity des@@ per@@ ately nee@@ ds , like gre@@ en energy ."
Now let me give you two num@@ bers .
"O@@ ver the last three months , in the United States , in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain and in the Euro@@ z@@ one , we have inv@@ est@@ ed , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , 3@@ .@@ 4 tr@@ illion dollars on all the we@@ al@@ th@@ -@@ produc@@ ing go@@ o@@ ds — things like in@@ du@@ stri@@ al plan@@ ts , mach@@ in@@ ery , off@@ ice bloc@@ ks , scho@@ ols , ro@@ ads , ra@@ il@@ ways , mach@@ in@@ ery , and so on and so for@@ th ."
"So a m@@ oun@@ tain of de@@ b@@ t and a m@@ oun@@ tain of i@@ d@@ le cas@@ h form tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks , fa@@ il@@ ing to canc@@ el each other out through the norm@@ al oper@@ ation of the mar@@ ke@@ ts ."
"And con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , low ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate de@@ m@@ and , which in a ne@@ ver@@ -@@ en@@ ding c@@ y@@ c@@ le , re@@ in@@ for@@ ces the p@@ es@@ sim@@ ism of the inv@@ est@@ ors , who , f@@ ear@@ ing low de@@ m@@ and , re@@ pro@@ duce it by not inv@@ est@@ ing — exactly like O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us &apos; father , who , ter@@ ri@@ fied by the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of the or@@ ac@@ le that his son would grow up to k@@ ill him , un@@ w@@ it@@ t@@ ing@@ ly engine@@ er@@ ed the condi@@ tions that en@@ su@@ red that O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us , his son , would k@@ ill him ."
This is my qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism .
A@@ m I right in beli@@ ev@@ ing that democr@@ acy might be the answer ?
"I believe so , but before we move on , what do we mean by democr@@ acy ?"
"Now , of course A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democr@@ acy ex@@ clu@@ ded too many ."
"W@@ om@@ en , mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts and , of course , the s@@ la@@ ves ."
But it would be a mi@@ sta@@ ke to dis@@ mis@@ s the si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democr@@ acy on the bas@@ is of wh@@ om it ex@@ clu@@ ded .
"Now , of course , A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democr@@ acy didn &apos;t last long ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke a c@@ and@@ le that bur@@ ns bri@@ gh@@ tly , it bur@@ ned out qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , our li@@ ber@@ al democr@@ ac@@ ies today do not have their ro@@ ots in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens ."
"They have their ro@@ ots in the M@@ ag@@ n@@ a C@@ ar@@ t@@ a , in the 1@@ 6@@ 8@@ 8 G@@ l@@ ori@@ ous R@@ evolution , in@@ de@@ ed in the American con@@ stitu@@ tion ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an democr@@ acy was fo@@ c@@ using on the ma@@ st@@ er@@ less ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en and em@@ po@@ w@@ ering the working po@@ or , our li@@ ber@@ al democr@@ ac@@ ies are f@@ oun@@ ded on the M@@ ag@@ n@@ a C@@ ar@@ t@@ a tra@@ di@@ tion , which was , after all , a char@@ ter for ma@@ st@@ ers ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , li@@ ber@@ al democr@@ acy only sur@@ fac@@ ed when it was possible to se@@ par@@ ate fully the political sp@@ here from the economic sp@@ here , so as to con@@ fine the democr@@ atic process fully in the political sp@@ here , le@@ a@@ ving the economic sp@@ here — the cor@@ por@@ ate world , if you want — as a democr@@ ac@@ y-@@ f@@ ree z@@ one ."
"Now , in our democr@@ ac@@ ies today , this se@@ par@@ ation of the economic from the political sp@@ here , the moment it started happening , it gave ri@@ se to an in@@ ex@@ or@@ able , e@@ p@@ ic str@@ u@@ gg@@ le between the two , with the economic sp@@ here col@@ on@@ i@@ zing the political sp@@ here , e@@ ating into its power ."
H@@ ave you wonder@@ ed why poli@@ tici@@ ans are not what they used to be ?
It &apos;s not because their D@@ N@@ A has de@@ gener@@ ated .
"( Laughter ) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has mi@@ gr@@ ated from the political to the economic sp@@ here , which is se@@ par@@ ate ."
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , I sp@@ o@@ ke about my qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l with cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism ."
"If you think about it , it is a little bit like a population of pre@@ dat@@ ors , that are so suc@@ cess@@ ful in dec@@ im@@ ating the pre@@ y that they must fe@@ ed on , that in the end they star@@ ve ."
"S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , the economic sp@@ here has been col@@ on@@ i@@ zing and can@@ ni@@ b@@ ali@@ zing the political sp@@ here to such an ex@@ t@@ ent that it is under@@ min@@ ing itself , cau@@ sing economic cri@@ s@@ is ."
"C@@ or@@ por@@ ate power is increas@@ ing , political go@@ o@@ ds are dev@@ al@@ u@@ ing , in@@ equality is ri@@ sing , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate de@@ m@@ and is f@@ all@@ ing and C@@ E@@ O@@ s of cor@@ por@@ ations are too sc@@ ared to inv@@ est the cas@@ h of their cor@@ por@@ ations ."
"Now , this is not an or@@ ig@@ in@@ al idea ."
"The Mar@@ x@@ ist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well , did it ?"
"The l@@ es@@ son that we learned from the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et de@@ bac@@ le is that only by a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le will the working po@@ or be re@@ em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed , as they were in an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , without cre@@ ating new for@@ ms of br@@ u@@ tal@@ ity and wa@@ st@@ e ."
But there is a solu@@ tion : e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the working po@@ or .
"C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ ism &apos;s doing it by re@@ plac@@ ing low@@ -@@ w@@ age wor@@ k@@ ers with au@@ tom@@ at@@ a , and@@ ro@@ i@@ ds , ro@@ b@@ ots ."
"The problem is that as long as the economic and the political sp@@ her@@ es are se@@ par@@ ate , au@@ tom@@ ation makes the tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks t@@ all@@ er , the wa@@ st@@ e lo@@ f@@ ti@@ er and the social con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts de@@ e@@ per , in@@ clu@@ ding — so@@ on , I believe — in places like China ."
"So we need to re@@ con@@ fig@@ ure , we need to re@@ un@@ ite the economic and the political sp@@ her@@ es , but we &apos;d better do it by democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ uni@@ fied sp@@ here , l@@ est we end up with a sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ an@@ ce@@ -@@ ma@@ d hy@@ per@@ au@@ to@@ cr@@ acy that makes The M@@ at@@ ri@@ x , the mo@@ vi@@ e , look like a doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary ."
( Laughter ) So the question is not whether cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism will survi@@ ve the techno@@ logical in@@ no@@ v@@ ations it is sp@@ aw@@ ning .
"The more interesting question is whether cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism will be suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded by something re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ing a M@@ at@@ ri@@ x d@@ y@@ st@@ op@@ ia or something much cl@@ os@@ er to a St@@ ar T@@ re@@ k@@ -@@ like society , where mach@@ ines ser@@ ve the hum@@ ans and the hum@@ ans exp@@ end their ener@@ gi@@ es expl@@ or@@ ing the universe and in@@ d@@ ul@@ g@@ ing in long de@@ b@@ ates about the mean@@ ing of life in some an@@ ci@@ ent , A@@ th@@ en@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ like , high t@@ ec@@ h ag@@ or@@ a ."
I think we can aff@@ or@@ d to be op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic .
"In pr@@ ac@@ tical ter@@ ms , al@@ low me to share just bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly , a couple of exam@@ pl@@ es ."
"A@@ t the level of the en@@ ter@@ pri@@ se , imagine a cap@@ ital market , where you ear@@ n cap@@ ital as you work , and where your cap@@ ital fol@@ lo@@ ws you from one job to another , from one comp@@ any to another , and the comp@@ any — wh@@ ic@@ h@@ ever one you happen to work at at that time — is so@@ le@@ ly ow@@ ned by those who happen to work in it at that moment ."
"Th@@ en all income st@@ ems from cap@@ ital , from prof@@ its , and the very con@@ cept of w@@ age l@@ ab@@ or becom@@ es ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
"@@ No more se@@ par@@ ation between those who own but do not work in the comp@@ any and those who work but do not own the comp@@ any ; no more tu@@ g@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ war between cap@@ ital and l@@ ab@@ or ; no great g@@ ap between inv@@ est@@ ment and sa@@ ving ; in@@ de@@ ed , no to@@ w@@ ering tw@@ in pe@@ a@@ ks ."
"A@@ t the level of the global political econom@@ y , imagine for a moment that our national curren@@ ci@@ es have a f@@ re@@ e-@@ f@@ lo@@ ating ex@@ change r@@ ate , with a univers@@ al , global , dig@@ ital curren@@ c@@ y , one that is is@@ su@@ ed by the In@@ ter@@ national M@@ on@@ et@@ ary F@@ u@@ nd , the G@@ -@@ 20 , on be@@ half of all hum@@ an@@ ity ."
"And imagine f@@ ur@@ ther that all inter@@ national tr@@ ad@@ e is den@@ om@@ in@@ ated in this curren@@ c@@ y — let &apos;s call it &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mo@@ s , &quot; &quot; in un@@ its of cos@@ mo@@ s — with every government ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing to be p@@ ay@@ ing into a common fu@@ nd a su@@ m of cos@@ mo@@ s un@@ its pro@@ por@@ ti@@ onal to the country &apos;s tr@@ ad@@ e de@@ fic@@ it , or in@@ de@@ ed to a country &apos;s tr@@ ad@@ e sur@@ pl@@ us ."
"And imagine that that fu@@ nd is u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed to inv@@ est in gre@@ en techno@@ logi@@ es , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in parts of the world where inv@@ est@@ ment fund@@ ing is sc@@ ar@@ ce ."
This is not a new idea .
"It &apos;s what , effec@@ ti@@ vely , J@@ o@@ h@@ n M@@ ay@@ n@@ ard K@@ ey@@ n@@ es pro@@ posed in 19@@ 4@@ 4 at the B@@ re@@ tt@@ on W@@ oo@@ ds Con@@ fer@@ ence ."
"The problem is that back then , they didn &apos;t have the technology to imp@@ le@@ ment it ."
"Now we do , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a re@@ uni@@ fied poli@@ tic@@ al@@ -@@ economic sp@@ here ."
"The world that I am descri@@ b@@ ing to you is sim@@ ul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously li@@ ber@@ t@@ ari@@ an , in that it pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ es em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , Mar@@ x@@ ist , since it will have con@@ fin@@ ed to the du@@ st@@ b@@ in of history the divi@@ sion between cap@@ ital and l@@ ab@@ or , and K@@ ey@@ n@@ es@@ i@@ an , global K@@ ey@@ n@@ es@@ i@@ an ."
"But abo@@ ve all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c democr@@ acy ."
W@@ ill such a world d@@ a@@ wn ?
O@@ r sh@@ all we des@@ c@@ end into a M@@ at@@ ri@@ x@@ -@@ like d@@ y@@ st@@ op@@ ia ?
The answer li@@ es in the political cho@@ ice that we sh@@ all be making coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely .

"T@@ o move away from the com@@ plac@@ enc@@ y and the con@@ st@@ ant den@@ i@@ al that there was a massive — and there is a massive ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tur@@ al f@@ au@@ l@@ t line going through the Euro@@ z@@ one , which is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ing , massi@@ vely , the whole of the Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on process ."
"And , un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , the po@@ w@@ ers in the Euro@@ z@@ one , in the Euro@@ group , ch@@ ose to ma@@ in@@ tain den@@ i@@ al ."
But you know what happens .
This is the experience of the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on .
B@@ G : What kind of change are you fore@@ seeing ?
"Y@@ V : Well , there &apos;s no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that if we don &apos;t change the ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the Euro@@ z@@ one , the Euro@@ z@@ one has no future ."
B@@ G : D@@ id you make any mi@@ sta@@ kes when you were F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ ist@@ er ?
Y@@ V : E@@ very day .
"If there &apos;s any M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of F@@ in@@ ance , or of anything else for that matter , who t@@ ells you after six months in a job , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in such a st@@ res@@ s@@ ful sit@@ u@@ ation , that they have made no mi@@ sta@@ ke , they &apos;re d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous people ."
O@@ f course I made mi@@ sta@@ kes .
I was imag@@ in@@ ing that there was a gen@@ u@@ ine inter@@ est on the side of the cre@@ d@@ it@@ ors to find common ground .
And there wasn &apos;t .
We l@@ ost on@@ e-@@ thir@@ d of our n@@ om@@ in@@ al G@@ D@@ P .
This is wor@@ se than the G@@ re@@ at D@@ e@@ pres@@ sion .
Y@@ V : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely .
"@@ Lo@@ ok , my cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m of the Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on and the Euro@@ z@@ one comes from a person who lives and bre@@ ath@@ es Euro@@ pe ."
My gre@@ at@@ est fear is that the Euro@@ z@@ one will not survi@@ ve .
"Because if it doesn &apos;t , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ces that will be un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed will be de@@ mon@@ ic , and they will dest@@ ro@@ y the Euro@@ pe@@ an U@@ ni@@ on ."
And that will be cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hi@@ c not just for Euro@@ pe but for the whole global econom@@ y .
"And if we al@@ low ourselves to f@@ all into a r@@ out@@ e of the pos@@ t@@ moder@@ n 19@@ 30 &apos;s , which seems to me to be what we are doing , then that will be de@@ tri@@ mental to the future of Euro@@ pe@@ ans and n@@ on@@ -@@ Euro@@ pe@@ ans ali@@ ke ."
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to sum@@ m@@ er cam@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
And I just wa@@ ited for the time that I could go off and read my bo@@ o@@ ks .
And I always sen@@ sed de@@ ep down that this was wrong and that int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts were pretty exc@@ ell@@ ent just as they were .
"And at the ri@@ s@@ k of s@@ oun@@ ding gr@@ an@@ di@@ ose , it is the world &apos;s l@@ oss ."
"Because when it comes to cre@@ ati@@ vity and to lead@@ er@@ ship , we need int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts doing what they do best ."
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
"So even if you &apos;re an ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ t yourself , I &apos;m talking about your co@@ wor@@ k@@ ers and your sp@@ ous@@ es and your children and the person sit@@ ting next to you right now — all of them sub@@ ject to this bi@@ as that is pretty de@@ ep and real in our society ."
"Now , to see the bi@@ as c@@ lear@@ ly , you need to understand what int@@ ro@@ ver@@ sion is ."
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ hy@@ ness is about fear of social ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
"I@@ n@@ tro@@ ver@@ sion is more about , how do you respon@@ d to s@@ tim@@ ulation , in@@ clu@@ ding social s@@ tim@@ ulation ."
"O@@ ur most important in@@ stitu@@ tions , our scho@@ ols and our wor@@ k@@ places , they are desig@@ ned m@@ os@@ tly for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts and for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts &apos; need for lots of s@@ tim@@ ulation ."
"We s@@ at in ro@@ ws of des@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ously ."
And kids are working in coun@@ t@@ less group assi@@ gn@@ ments .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , same thing is true in our wor@@ k@@ places ."
"Now , most of us work in op@@ en pl@@ an off@@ ices , without w@@ all@@ s , where we are sub@@ ject to the con@@ st@@ ant no@@ ise and g@@ a@@ ze of our co@@ wor@@ k@@ ers ."
"And what I &apos;m saying is that cul@@ tur@@ ally , we need a much better bal@@ ance ."
"And in fact , we have known for cent@@ ur@@ ies about the tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dent power of so@@ li@@ tu@@ de ."
It &apos;s only rec@@ ently that we &apos;ve stran@@ ge@@ ly be@@ gu@@ n to for@@ get it .
"This is no surpri@@ se , though , if you look at the in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts of cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary psycho@@ logy ."
"It turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without inst@@ inc@@ ti@@ vely m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ing , m@@ im@@ ic@@ king their op@@ in@@ i@@ ons ."
And do you really want to leave it up to chan@@ ce ?
"W@@ est@@ er@@ n societies , and in particular the U.@@ S@@ . , have always fav@@ o@@ red the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ation ."
"So , quite underst@@ and@@ ably , qu@@ ali@@ ties like mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m and char@@ is@@ m@@ a su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly come to seem really important ."
"Now n@@ one of this is to say that social sk@@ ills are un@@ important , and I &apos;m also not call@@ ing for the abo@@ li@@ sh@@ ing of te@@ am@@ work at all ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
So I pre@@ p@@ ared for mom@@ ents like these as best I could .
It &apos;s great for int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts and it &apos;s great for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
"We need to be teach@@ ing kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teach@@ ing them how to work on their own ."
"B@@ e like B@@ u@@ dd@@ h@@ a , have your own re@@ v@@ el@@ ations ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it is , I hope you take these things out every chan@@ ce you get and gr@@ ace us with your energy and your jo@@ y ."
"H@@ i , my name is Mar@@ cin — f@@ ar@@ m@@ er , techno@@ logi@@ st ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.@@ S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ p@@ en S@@ our@@ ce E@@ co@@ logy .
"We &apos;ve i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied the 50 most important mach@@ ines that we think it ta@@ kes for moder@@ n life to ex@@ ist — things from tr@@ ac@@ tors , bre@@ ad o@@ ven@@ s , cir@@ cu@@ it ma@@ k@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and ma@@ in@@ tain at a fr@@ action of the c@@ ost ."
We call this the G@@ lob@@ al V@@ ill@@ age Con@@ struc@@ tion S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ i@@ shed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in fu@@ sion energy , and I disc@@ over@@ ed I was us@@ el@@ ess ."
I had no pr@@ ac@@ tical sk@@ ills .
"The world pres@@ en@@ ted me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I gu@@ ess you can call it the con@@ sum@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
So I started a f@@ ar@@ m in M@@ is@@ s@@ our@@ i and learned about the econom@@ ics of f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
I b@@ ought a tr@@ ac@@ tor — then it bro@@ ke .
I p@@ a@@ id to get it re@@ p@@ a@@ i@@ red — then it bro@@ ke again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was bro@@ ke too ."
"I reali@@ zed that the tru@@ ly appro@@ pri@@ ate , low@@ -@@ c@@ ost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able f@@ ar@@ m and se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment just didn &apos;t ex@@ ist yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were ro@@ b@@ ust , mo@@ d@@ ular , high@@ ly eff@@ ici@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed , low@@ -@@ c@@ ost , made from loc@@ al and rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed materi@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not desig@@ ned for ob@@ sol@@ es@@ c@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them my@@ self .
So I did just that .
And I te@@ sted them .
And I found that in@@ du@@ stri@@ al produc@@ ti@@ vity can be achi@@ ev@@ ed on a small sc@@ ale .
"So then I published the 3@@ D desig@@ ns , s@@ ch@@ em@@ atic@@ s , in@@ struc@@ ti@@ onal vide@@ o@@ s and bu@@ d@@ gets on a wi@@ k@@ i ."
"Th@@ en con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tors from all over the world beg@@ an sho@@ wing up , prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ing new mach@@ ines d@@ uring de@@ dic@@ ated pro@@ ject vi@@ s@@ its ."
"So far , we have prot@@ ot@@ y@@ ped eight of the 50 mach@@ ines ."
And now the pro@@ ject is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that op@@ en s@@ our@@ ce has suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded with to@@ ols for man@@ aging knowledge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is star@@ ting to happen with har@@ d@@ w@@ are too .
We &apos;re fo@@ c@@ using on har@@ d@@ w@@ are because it is har@@ d@@ w@@ are that can change people &apos;s lives in such t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble material ways .
"If we can lo@@ wer the bar@@ ri@@ ers to f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , building , man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just massive amoun@@ ts of human p@@ ot@@ ential ."
That &apos;s not only in the develop@@ ing world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American f@@ ar@@ m@@ er , buil@@ der , ent@@ re@@ pre@@ ne@@ ur , ma@@ ker ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of exc@@ it@@ ement from these people , who can now start a con@@ struc@@ tion business , parts man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , org@@ an@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ ling power back to the g@@ ri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published desig@@ ns so c@@ lear , so comple@@ te , that a single bur@@ ned D@@ V@@ D is effec@@ ti@@ vely a civi@@ li@@ zation star@@ ter k@@ it ."
I &apos;ve plan@@ ted a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve pres@@ sed 5@@ ,000 br@@ ic@@ ks in one day from the di@@ r@@ t b@@ ene@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a tr@@ ac@@ tor in six days ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is tru@@ ly sound , then the imp@@ lic@@ ations are si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant ."
"A gre@@ ater dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ m@@ ent@@ ally sound sup@@ ply cha@@ ins , and a ne@@ w@@ ly re@@ lev@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y ma@@ ker culture can hope to tran@@ sc@@ end arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ity ."
We &apos;re expl@@ or@@ ing the lim@@ its of what we all can do to make a better world with op@@ en har@@ d@@ w@@ are technology .

It &apos;s not rec@@ or@@ ded whether A@@ v@@ el@@ ing told D@@ ar@@ w@@ in to come down off his high h@@ or@@ se .
The on@@ us is not on the rest of us to say why not .
My problem with it is only its app@@ aren@@ t an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ cent@@ ri@@ s@@ m .
( Applause )
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) R@@ ough@@ ly 4@@ 3@@ ,000 years ago , a young c@@ ave be@@ ar died in the ro@@ l@@ ling h@@ ills on the n@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est bor@@ der of moder@@ n day S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia ."
"A thous@@ and years later , a ma@@ m@@ m@@ ot@@ h died in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n G@@ er@@ many ."
"A few cent@@ ur@@ ies after that , a g@@ ri@@ ff@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also died in the same v@@ ic@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these anim@@ als m@@ et their de@@ a@@ ths , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mark@@ able f@@ ate ."
"A@@ f@@ ter their de@@ a@@ ths , a b@@ one from each of their sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons was cra@@ f@@ ted by human h@@ ands into a fl@@ ute ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the fl@@ ute , a to@@ ol that cre@@ ated us@@ el@@ ess vi@@ br@@ ations in air m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es ."
But that is exactly what our an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors did .
Now this turns out to be surpri@@ sing@@ ly common in the history of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation .
"But just as often , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fu@@ n ."
"And here &apos;s the really stran@@ ge thing : many of those play@@ ful but se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly fri@@ v@@ ol@@ ous inv@@ enti@@ ons en@@ ded up sp@@ ar@@ king mom@@ ent@@ ous trans@@ form@@ ations in science , in poli@@ tics and society ."
T@@ a@@ ke what may be the most important inv@@ en@@ tion of moder@@ n times : pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ able compu@@ ters .
"S@@ ome@@ one came up with the br@@ illi@@ ant idea of tri@@ gg@@ ering s@@ ounds by pres@@ sing small le@@ ver@@ s with our fin@@ g@@ ers , inv@@ ent@@ ing the first m@@ us@@ ical ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard ."
"Now , ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds ev@@ ol@@ ved from org@@ ans to cl@@ av@@ ic@@ h@@ or@@ ds to har@@ p@@ s@@ ic@@ h@@ or@@ ds to the pi@@ an@@ o , until the middle of the 19@@ th century , when a b@@ un@@ ch of inv@@ ent@@ ors fin@@ ally h@@ it on the idea of using a ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard to tri@@ g@@ ger not s@@ ounds but le@@ t@@ ters ."
"In fact , the very first t@@ y@@ pe@@ wr@@ it@@ er was or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally called &quot; &quot; the wr@@ iting har@@ p@@ s@@ ic@@ h@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ l@@ ut@@ es and mu@@ sic led to even more po@@ wer@@ ful bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a thous@@ and years ago , at the he@@ ight of the I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ ic R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , three bro@@ thers in B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad desig@@ ned a dev@@ ice that was an au@@ tom@@ ated org@@ an ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ str@@ ument that pl@@ ays itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ str@@ ument was basically a gi@@ ant mu@@ sic bo@@ x ."
The org@@ an could be tr@@ ained to play vari@@ ous s@@ on@@ gs by using in@@ struc@@ tions en@@ co@@ ded by plac@@ ing p@@ ins on a r@@ ot@@ ating c@@ y@@ l@@ in@@ der .
"And if you wanted the machine to play a different s@@ ong , you just s@@ w@@ app@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ l@@ in@@ der in with a different co@@ de on it ."
This in@@ str@@ ument was the first of its kind .
It was pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ able .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a massive le@@ ap for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ w@@ are and so@@ f@@ tw@@ are becom@@ es thin@@ k@@ able for the first time with this inv@@ en@@ tion .
"And that incredi@@ bly po@@ wer@@ ful con@@ cept didn &apos;t come to us as an in@@ str@@ ument of war or of con@@ qu@@ est , or nec@@ ess@@ ity at all ."
It came from the stran@@ ge de@@ light of wat@@ ch@@ ing a machine play mu@@ sic .
"In fact , the idea of pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ able mach@@ ines was ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely ke@@ p@@ t ali@@ ve by mu@@ sic for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0s , m@@ us@@ ic@@ -@@ making mach@@ ines bec@@ ame the play@@ things of the P@@ ari@@ si@@ an e@@ li@@ te ."
"S@@ ho@@ w@@ men used the same co@@ ded c@@ y@@ l@@ in@@ d@@ ers to control the physical mov@@ em@@ ents of what were called au@@ tom@@ at@@ a , an early kind of ro@@ bo@@ t ."
"And as de V@@ au@@ can@@ son was desig@@ ning his ro@@ bo@@ t m@@ us@@ ici@@ an , he had another idea ."
"If you could program a machine to make ple@@ as@@ ing s@@ ounds , why not program it to we@@ ave de@@ ligh@@ t@@ ful patterns of col@@ or out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new patter@@ n for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ l@@ in@@ der ."
This was the first pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ able loo@@ m .
P@@ ap@@ er tur@@ ned out to be much che@@ ap@@ er and more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble as a way of pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing the dev@@ ice .
"That p@@ un@@ ch c@@ ard system insp@@ i@@ red V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an inv@@ ent@@ or Ch@@ ar@@ les B@@ ab@@ b@@ age to create his anal@@ y@@ tical eng@@ ine , the first true pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ able computer ever desig@@ ned ."
So ask yourself this question : what really made the moder@@ n computer possible ?
"Y@@ es , the mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement is an important part of the story , but inv@@ ent@@ ing a computer also requ@@ i@@ red other building bloc@@ ks : mu@@ sic bo@@ x@@ es , to@@ y ro@@ bo@@ t fl@@ ute play@@ ers , har@@ p@@ s@@ ic@@ h@@ or@@ d ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful patterns w@@ o@@ ven into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
"There &apos;s a long li@@ st of wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ chang@@ ing ideas and techno@@ logi@@ es that came out of play : public mu@@ se@@ um@@ s , ru@@ b@@ ber , prob@@ ability theory , the in@@ sur@@ ance business and many more ."
N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ity isn &apos;t always the mother of inv@@ en@@ tion .
"The play@@ ful state of mind is fundam@@ ent@@ ally expl@@ or@@ at@@ ory , see@@ king out new possi@@ bili@@ ties in the world around us ."
And that see@@ king is why so many experi@@ ences that started with simple de@@ light and am@@ u@@ se@@ ment even@@ tually led us to pro@@ found bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s .
"Now , I think this has imp@@ lic@@ ations for how we te@@ ach kids in school and how we enc@@ our@@ age in@@ no@@ v@@ ation in our wor@@ k@@ sp@@ ac@@ es , but thinking about play and de@@ light this way also hel@@ ps us de@@ t@@ ect what &apos;s coming next ."
"Th@@ ink about it : if you were sit@@ ting there in 1@@ 7@@ 50 trying to fig@@ ure out the big changes coming to society in the 19@@ th , the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ ies , au@@ tom@@ ated mach@@ ines , compu@@ ters , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelligence , a pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ able fl@@ ute en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the P@@ ari@@ si@@ an e@@ li@@ te would have been as po@@ wer@@ ful a cl@@ ue as anything else at the time ."
You &apos;ll find the future wh@@ er@@ ever people are having the most fu@@ n .
E@@ very@@ one nee@@ ds a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all play@@ er , a ten@@ n@@ is play@@ er , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or a bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
"( Laughter ) My bri@@ dge co@@ ach , S@@ har@@ on O@@ s@@ ber@@ g , says there are more pic@@ tures of the back of her head than any@@ one else &apos;s in the world . ( Laughter ) S@@ or@@ ry , S@@ har@@ on . Here you go ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we impro@@ ve .
"@@ Un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no syst@@ em@@ atic fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ ob@@ s better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ ob@@ s in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ in@@ d@@ a and I learned how little u@@ se@@ ful fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were b@@ lo@@ wn away ."
"@@ Un@@ til rec@@ ently , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ atis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"If all my bri@@ dge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; s@@ atis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory , &quot; &quot; I would have no hope of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differ@@ ently ?
"T@@ o@@ day , di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts are re@@ v@@ am@@ ping the way they ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them impro@@ ve their pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
O@@ ur teachers des@@ er@@ ve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fa@@ ir to them .
"It &apos;s not fa@@ ir to students , and it &apos;s pu@@ tting America &apos;s global lead@@ er@@ ship at ri@@ s@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for impro@@ v@@ ement they want and des@@ er@@ ve .
Let &apos;s start by as@@ king who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king t@@ ab@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back syst@@ ems ."
"So I looked at the countries wh@@ ose students per@@ form well ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ically , and looked at what they &apos;re doing to help their teachers impro@@ ve ."
Con@@ si@@ der the ran@@ k@@ ings for read@@ ing prof@@ ici@@ enc@@ y .
The U.@@ S@@ . isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ c@@ el@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the places that do better than the U.@@ S@@ . in read@@ ing , how many of them have a form@@ al system for hel@@ ping teachers impro@@ ve ?"
E@@ le@@ ven out of 1@@ 4 .
"The U.@@ S@@ . is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in mat@@ h ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fa@@ il@@ ing to give our teachers the help they need to devel@@ op their sk@@ ills ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c per@@ form@@ er : the pro@@ v@@ ince of S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i , China ."
"Now , they r@@ ank number one across the bo@@ ard , in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science , and one of the ke@@ ys to S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i &apos;s incredi@@ ble suc@@ cess is the way they help teachers keep impro@@ ving ."
They made sure that youn@@ ger teachers get a chan@@ ce to wat@@ ch ma@@ ster teachers at work .
"They have wee@@ k@@ ly study grou@@ ps , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even requ@@ ire each teacher to ob@@ ser@@ ve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much vari@@ ation in the teach@@ ing prof@@ es@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more effec@@ tive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers thr@@ ough@@ out the country who are hel@@ ping their students make ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary g@@ ain@@ s ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be b@@ lowing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ ound@@ ation has been working with 3@@ ,000 teachers in di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts across the country on a pro@@ ject called M@@ eas@@ ures of E@@ ff@@ ec@@ tive T@@ e@@ ach@@ ing ."
We had ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s wat@@ ch vide@@ o@@ s of teachers in the cl@@ ass@@ room and r@@ ate how they did on a ran@@ ge of pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ es .
"For example , did they ask their students chall@@ eng@@ ing questions ?"
D@@ id they find m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple ways to explain an idea ?
"We also had students f@@ ill out sur@@ ve@@ ys with questions like , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ es your teacher know when the cl@@ ass underst@@ ands a l@@ es@@ son ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you learn to cor@@ rec@@ t your mi@@ sta@@ kes ? &quot;"
And what we found is very exc@@ iting .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the teachers who did well on these ob@@ serv@@ ations had far better stud@@ ent out@@ comes ."
So it t@@ ells us we &apos;re as@@ king the right questions .
"And second , teachers in the program told us that these vide@@ o@@ s and these sur@@ ve@@ ys from the students were very hel@@ p@@ ful di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic to@@ ols , because they poin@@ ted to speci@@ fic places where they can impro@@ ve ."
I want to show you what this vide@@ o comp@@ on@@ ent of M@@ E@@ T looks like in action .
( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ ar@@ ah B@@ ro@@ wn W@@ ess@@ ling : G@@ ood mor@@ ning everybody .
Let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s going on today .
"T@@ o get started , we &apos;re doing a pe@@ er re@@ view day , o@@ kay ?"
"A pe@@ er re@@ view day , and our go@@ al by the end of cl@@ ass is for you to be able to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine whether or not you have mo@@ ves to pro@@ ve in your es@@ says ."
My name is S@@ ar@@ ah B@@ ro@@ wn W@@ ess@@ ling .
"I am a high school English teacher at J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ st@@ on H@@ i@@ gh S@@ cho@@ ol in J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ st@@ on , I@@ ow@@ a ."
T@@ ur@@ n to somebody next to you .
T@@ ell them what you think I mean when I talk about mo@@ ves to pro@@ ve . I &apos;ve talk about — I think that there is a difference for teachers between the ab@@ str@@ act of how we see our pr@@ acti@@ ce and then the con@@ cre@@ te reality of it .
"O@@ kay , so I would like you to ple@@ ase bring up your p@@ ap@@ ers ."
I think what vide@@ o off@@ ers for us is a certain de@@ gre@@ e of reality .
"You can &apos;t really di@@ sp@@ ute what you see on the vide@@ o , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a prof@@ es@@ sion when we actually get to see this ."
I just have a f@@ li@@ p cam@@ er@@ a and a little tri@@ po@@ d and inv@@ est@@ ed in this t@@ iny little w@@ ide@@ -@@ ang@@ le l@@ ens .
"A@@ t the beginning of cl@@ ass , I just per@@ ch it in the back of the cl@@ ass@@ room . It &apos;s not a per@@ f@@ ect sho@@ t ."
It doesn &apos;t cat@@ ch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
But I can hear the sound . I can see a lot .
And I &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
So it really has been a simple but po@@ wer@@ ful to@@ ol in my own re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion .
"A@@ ll right , let &apos;s take a look at the long one first , o@@ kay ?"
"O@@ n@@ ce I &apos;m fin@@ i@@ shed t@@ ap@@ ing , then I put it in my computer , and then I &apos;ll s@@ can it and take a pe@@ e@@ k at it ."
"If I don &apos;t wr@@ ite things down , I don &apos;t remember them ."
"So having the not@@ es is a part of my thinking process , and I disc@@ over what I &apos;m seeing as I &apos;m wr@@ iting ."
"I really have used it for my own pers@@ onal grow@@ th and my own pers@@ onal re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion on teach@@ ing str@@ ate@@ gy and me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ logy and cl@@ ass@@ room man@@ ag@@ ement , and just all of those different fac@@ ets of the cl@@ ass@@ room ."
"I &apos;m gl@@ ad that we &apos;ve actually done the process before so we can kind of comp@@ are what works , what doesn &apos;t ."
"I think that vide@@ o ex@@ pos@@ es so much of what &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand , and then help our bro@@ ad@@ er comm@@ uni@@ ties understand what this comple@@ x work is really all about ."
"I think it is a way to ex@@ emp@@ li@@ f@@ y and ill@@ u@@ str@@ ate things that we cannot con@@ v@@ ey in a l@@ es@@ son pl@@ an , things you cannot con@@ v@@ ey in a st@@ and@@ ard , things that you cannot even sometimes con@@ v@@ ey in a book of pe@@ d@@ ag@@ o@@ gy ."
"A@@ l@@ ri@@ gh@@ ty , everybody , have a great wee@@ k@@ end ."
I &apos;ll see you later .
"@@ &#91; E@@ very cl@@ ass@@ room could look like that &#93; ( Applause ) B@@ ill G@@ ates : One day , we &apos;d like every cl@@ ass@@ room in America to look something like that ."
But we still have more work to do .
D@@ i@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing are@@ as where a teacher nee@@ ds to impro@@ ve is only half the b@@ att@@ le .
We also have to give them the to@@ ols they need to act on the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is .
"If you learn that you need to impro@@ ve the way you te@@ ach fr@@ ac@@ tions , you should be able to wat@@ ch a vide@@ o of the best person in the world teach@@ ing fr@@ ac@@ tions ."
So building this comple@@ te teacher fe@@ ed@@ back and impro@@ v@@ ement system won &apos;t be easy .
"For example , I know some teachers are@@ n &apos;t im@@ me@@ di@@ ately com@@ fort@@ able with the idea of a cam@@ er@@ a in the cl@@ ass@@ room ."
"That &apos;s underst@@ and@@ able , but our experience with M@@ E@@ T su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that if teachers man@@ age the process , if they coll@@ ect vide@@ o in their own cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s , and they pic@@ k the l@@ ess@@ ons they want to sub@@ m@@ it , a lot of them will be e@@ ag@@ er to par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate ."
B@@ u@@ il@@ ding this system will also requ@@ ire a consi@@ der@@ able inv@@ est@@ ment .
O@@ ur f@@ ound@@ ation es@@ tim@@ ates that it could c@@ ost up to five billion dollars .
"Now that &apos;s a big number , but to put it in per@@ spec@@ tive , it &apos;s less than two percent of what we sp@@ end every year on teacher s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ."
The imp@@ act for teachers would be ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
"We would fin@@ ally have a way to give them fe@@ ed@@ back , as well as the means to act on it ."
But this system would have an even more important b@@ ene@@ f@@ it for our country .
"It would put us on a pat@@ h to making sure all our students get a great education , find a care@@ er that &apos;s ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing and re@@ war@@ ding , and have a chan@@ ce to live out their dre@@ ams ."
This wouldn &apos;t just make us a more suc@@ cess@@ ful country .
"It would also make us a more fa@@ ir and just one , too ."
I &apos;m exc@@ ited about the op@@ port@@ unity to give all our teachers the sup@@ port they want and des@@ er@@ ve .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .

Let &apos;s just get started here .
"O@@ kay , just a moment ."

"A year ago , I sp@@ o@@ ke to you about a book that I was just in the process of comple@@ ting , that has come out in the inter@@ i@@ m , and I would like to talk to you today about some of the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es that that book insp@@ i@@ red ."
"The book is called &quot; &quot; The B@@ l@@ ank S@@ l@@ ate , &quot; &quot; bas@@ ed on the pop@@ ular idea that the human mind is a bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ate , and that all of its struc@@ ture comes from soci@@ ali@@ zation , culture , paren@@ ting , experience ."
The &quot; &quot; bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ate &quot; &quot; was an in@@ flu@@ ential idea in the 20@@ th century .
"@@ Here are a few quot@@ es in@@ dic@@ ating that : &quot; &quot; M@@ an has no nature , &quot; &quot; from the hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an J@@ ose O@@ r@@ te@@ g@@ a y G@@ as@@ set ; &quot; &quot; M@@ an has no inst@@ inc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; from the an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ st A@@ sh@@ le@@ y M@@ on@@ t@@ ag@@ u ; &quot; &quot; The human brain is cap@@ able of a ful@@ l ran@@ ge of behavi@@ ors and pre@@ di@@ sp@@ os@@ ed to n@@ one , &quot; &quot; from the l@@ ate scienti@@ st S@@ te@@ ph@@ en J@@ ay G@@ ould ."
"There are a number of reas@@ ons to d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the human mind is a bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ate , and some of them just come from common sense ."
"As many people have told me over the years , any@@ one who &apos;s had more than one child kno@@ ws that kids come into the world with certain t@@ em@@ per@@ am@@ ents and tal@@ ents ; it doesn &apos;t all come from the outside ."
And any@@ one who &apos;s ever been in a he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al relation@@ ship kno@@ ws that the min@@ ds of men and the min@@ ds of women are not in@@ dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble .
"There are also , I think , increas@@ ing res@@ ults from the scienti@@ fic study of hum@@ ans that , in@@ de@@ ed , we &apos;re not born bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ates ."
"One of them , from an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy , is the study of human univers@@ als ."
"If you &apos;ve ever taken an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logy , you know that it &apos;s a — kind of an oc@@ c@@ up@@ ational ple@@ as@@ ure of an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts to show how ex@@ ot@@ ic other cul@@ tures can be , and that there are places out there where , sup@@ pos@@ e@@ dly , everything is the op@@ pos@@ ite to the way it is here ."
"But if you instead look at what is common to the world &apos;s cul@@ tures , you find that there is an en@@ orm@@ ously r@@ ich set of behavi@@ ors and emoti@@ ons and ways of con@@ str@@ u@@ ing the world that can be found in all of the world &apos;s 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00-@@ o@@ d@@ d cul@@ tures ."
"The an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ st D@@ on@@ al@@ d B@@ ro@@ wn has tri@@ ed to li@@ st them all , and they ran@@ ge from a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , aff@@ ec@@ tion and age st@@ at@@ us@@ es all the way down to we@@ an@@ ing , we@@ ap@@ ons , we@@ a@@ ther , att@@ emp@@ ts to control , the col@@ or white and a wor@@ l@@ d@@ view ."
"A@@ l@@ so , gen@@ e@@ tics and neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence are increas@@ ing@@ ly sho@@ wing that the brain is in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ately struc@@ tu@@ red ."
"This is a rec@@ ent study by the neuro@@ bio@@ logi@@ st P@@ au@@ l Th@@ om@@ p@@ son and his colle@@ ag@@ ues in which they — using M@@ R@@ I — meas@@ u@@ red the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of gr@@ ay matter — that is , the ou@@ ter l@@ ay@@ er of the cor@@ te@@ x — in a large s@@ am@@ ple of p@@ a@@ ir@@ s of people ."
"They co@@ ded cor@@ rel@@ ations in the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of gr@@ ay matter in different parts of the brain using a f@@ al@@ se col@@ or s@@ che@@ me , in which no difference is co@@ ded as pur@@ ple , and any col@@ or other than pur@@ ple in@@ dic@@ ates a st@@ atis@@ tic@@ ally si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ant cor@@ rel@@ ation ."
"Well , this is what happens when you p@@ air people up at ran@@ dom ."
"B@@ y defin@@ i@@ tion , two people pic@@ ked at ran@@ dom can &apos;t have cor@@ rel@@ ations in the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of gr@@ ay matter in the cor@@ te@@ x ."
This is what happens in people who share half of their D@@ N@@ A — fr@@ at@@ er@@ n@@ al tw@@ ins .
"And as you can see , large amoun@@ ts of the brain are not pur@@ ple , sho@@ wing that if one person has a th@@ ic@@ ker bit of cor@@ te@@ x in that re@@ gi@@ on , so does his fr@@ at@@ er@@ n@@ al tw@@ in ."
And you can see huge are@@ as of cor@@ te@@ x where there are massive cor@@ rel@@ ations in the dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion of gr@@ ay matter .
"Now , these are@@ n &apos;t just differ@@ ences in an@@ at@@ om@@ y , like the shap@@ e of your e@@ ar lob@@ es , but they have con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences in thought and behavior that are well ill@@ u@@ str@@ ated in this fam@@ ous car@@ to@@ on by Ch@@ ar@@ les A@@ dd@@ ams : &quot; S@@ e@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th , the M@@ al@@ li@@ fer@@ t tw@@ ins me@@ et ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally . &quot;"
"As you can see , there are two inv@@ ent@@ ors with i@@ den@@ tical con@@ tr@@ ap@@ tions in their la@@ p , me@@ e@@ ting in the wa@@ iting room of a pat@@ ent att@@ or@@ ne@@ y ."
"Now , the car@@ to@@ on is not such an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation , because stu@@ dies of i@@ den@@ tical tw@@ ins who were se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th and then te@@ sted in ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood show that they have ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing sim@@ il@@ ari@@ ties ."
And this happens in every p@@ air of i@@ den@@ tical tw@@ ins se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th ever stu@@ died — but much less so with fr@@ at@@ er@@ n@@ al tw@@ ins se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite example is a p@@ air of tw@@ ins , one of wh@@ om was br@@ ought up as a C@@ ath@@ o@@ li@@ c in a N@@ az@@ i family in G@@ er@@ many , the other br@@ ought up in a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish family in T@@ r@@ in@@ i@@ d@@ ad ."
"Now — the story might seem to good to be true , but when you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies of psycho@@ logical te@@ sts , you get the same res@@ ults — nam@@ ely , i@@ den@@ tical tw@@ ins se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th show quite ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing sim@@ il@@ ari@@ ties ."
"Now , given both the common sense and scienti@@ fic data call@@ ing the doc@@ tr@@ ine of the bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ate into question , why should it have been such an appe@@ al@@ ing n@@ oti@@ on ?"
"Well , there are a number of political reas@@ ons why people have found it con@@ gen@@ i@@ al ."
"The fore@@ most is that if we &apos;re bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ates , then , by defin@@ i@@ tion , we are equ@@ al , because z@@ er@@ o equ@@ als z@@ er@@ o equ@@ als z@@ er@@ o ."
"But if something is wr@@ it@@ ten on the s@@ l@@ ate , then some people could have more of it than others , and ac@@ cor@@ ding to this line of thinking , that would j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation and in@@ equality ."
"A@@ no@@ ther political fear of human nature is that if we are bl@@ ank s@@ l@@ ates , we can per@@ f@@ ect man@@ kind — the ag@@ e-@@ old dre@@ am of the per@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ bility of our spec@@ ies through social engine@@ ering ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if we &apos;re born with certain inst@@ inc@@ ts , then perhaps some of them might con@@ de@@ m@@ n us to sel@@ fi@@ sh@@ ness , pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and violence ."
"Well , in the book , I ar@@ gu@@ e that these are , in fact , n@@ on se@@ qu@@ it@@ ur@@ s ."
"And just to make a long story sh@@ ort : first of all , the con@@ cept of fa@@ ir@@ ness is not the same as the con@@ cept of s@@ am@@ en@@ ess ."
"And so when Th@@ om@@ as J@@ eff@@ er@@ son wr@@ ote in the D@@ ec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ dep@@ en@@ dence , &quot; &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent , that all men are cre@@ ated equ@@ al , &quot; &quot; he did not mean &quot; &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evi@@ dent , that all men are cl@@ ones . &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ ther , that all men are equ@@ al in ter@@ ms of their ri@@ gh@@ ts , and that every person ought to be tre@@ ated as an in@@ divi@@ du@@ al , and not pre@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the st@@ atis@@ tics of particular grou@@ ps that they may b@@ el@@ ong to ."
"A@@ l@@ so , even if we were born with certain ig@@ no@@ ble moti@@ ves , they don &apos;t au@@ tom@@ atic@@ ally le@@ ad to ig@@ no@@ ble behavior ."
"That is because the human mind is a comple@@ x system with many parts , and some of them can in@@ hi@@ bit others ."
"For example , there &apos;s exc@@ ell@@ ent reason to believe that vir@@ tually all hum@@ ans are born with a moral sense , and that we have cogni@@ tive abili@@ ties that al@@ low us to prof@@ it from the l@@ ess@@ ons of history ."
"So even if people did have imp@@ ul@@ ses to@@ wards sel@@ fi@@ sh@@ ness or gre@@ ed , that &apos;s not the only thing in the sk@@ ul@@ l , and there are other parts of the mind that can coun@@ ter@@ act them ."
"In the book , I go over contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es such as this one , and a number of other ho@@ t bu@@ tt@@ ons , ho@@ t z@@ ones , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ ls , thir@@ d ra@@ il@@ s , and so on — in@@ clu@@ ding the ar@@ ts , cl@@ on@@ ing , cri@@ me , f@@ ree will , education , evolution , gen@@ der differ@@ ences , G@@ od , h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality , in@@ f@@ an@@ tici@@ de , in@@ equality , Mar@@ x@@ ism , mor@@ ality , N@@ az@@ ism , paren@@ ting , poli@@ tics , r@@ ace , r@@ ap@@ e , religi@@ on , res@@ our@@ ce de@@ ple@@ tion , social engine@@ ering , techno@@ logical ri@@ s@@ k and war ."
"And nee@@ d@@ less to say , there were certain ri@@ s@@ ks in taking on these sub@@ jects ."
"When I wr@@ ote a first d@@ ra@@ ft of the book , I cir@@ cul@@ ated it to a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues for comm@@ ents , and here are some of the re@@ ac@@ tions that I got : &quot; B@@ e@@ tter get a sec@@ ur@@ ity cam@@ er@@ a for your h@@ ouse . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t exp@@ ect to get any more a@@ wards , job off@@ ers or posi@@ tions in scho@@ lar@@ ly societies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ell your publi@@ sh@@ er not to li@@ st your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn in your au@@ th@@ or bi@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you have ten@@ ure ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) Well , the book came out in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber , and nothing ter@@ ri@@ ble has happened ."
"I — I like — There was in@@ de@@ ed reason to be ner@@ v@@ ous , and there were mom@@ ents in which I did feel ner@@ v@@ ous , kno@@ wing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al st@@ ands or disc@@ over@@ ed dis@@ qu@@ i@@ e@@ ting fin@@ d@@ ings in the behavi@@ or@@ al sci@@ ences ."
"There are many c@@ ases , some of which I talk about in the book , of people who have been s@@ lan@@ der@@ ed , called N@@ az@@ is , phys@@ ically ass@@ au@@ l@@ ted , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed with cri@@ min@@ al pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ tion for st@@ um@@ bl@@ ing across or ar@@ gu@@ ing about contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al fin@@ d@@ ings ."
And you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these bo@@ o@@ by tr@@ aps .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite example is a p@@ air of psycho@@ logi@@ sts who did resear@@ ch on le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and@@ ers , and published some data sho@@ wing that le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and@@ ers are , on average , more su@@ sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ble to disease , more pr@@ one to ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents and have a sh@@ or@@ ter li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an ."
"It &apos;s not c@@ lear , by the way , since then , whether that is an ac@@ cur@@ ate gener@@ ali@@ zation , but the data at the time se@@ em@@ ed to sup@@ port that ."
"Well , pretty so@@ on they were bar@@ r@@ ag@@ ed with en@@ r@@ ag@@ ed le@@ t@@ ters , death thre@@ at@@ s , b@@ an on the t@@ op@@ ic in a number of scienti@@ fic j@@ our@@ n@@ als , coming from ir@@ ate le@@ f@@ t-@@ h@@ and@@ ers and their adv@@ oc@@ ates , and they were liter@@ ally af@@ ra@@ id to op@@ en their ma@@ il because of the ven@@ om and v@@ it@@ u@@ per@@ ation that they had in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently insp@@ i@@ red . Well ,"
"@@ the night is young , but the book has been out for half a year , and nothing ter@@ ri@@ ble has happened ."
N@@ one of the di@@ re prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences has taken place — I ha@@ ven &apos;t been ex@@ il@@ ed from the c@@ ity of C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge .
But what I wanted to talk about are two of these ho@@ t bu@@ tt@@ ons that have ar@@ ous@@ ed the stron@@ g@@ est respon@@ se in the 8@@ 0-@@ o@@ d@@ d re@@ vie@@ ws that The B@@ l@@ ank S@@ l@@ ate has re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved .
"I &apos;ll just put that li@@ st up for a few secon@@ ds , and see if you can gu@@ ess which two — I would es@@ tim@@ ate that probably two of these t@@ op@@ ics insp@@ i@@ red probably 90 percent of the re@@ action in the vari@@ ous re@@ vie@@ ws and radi@@ o inter@@ vie@@ ws ."
"It &apos;s not violence and war , it &apos;s not r@@ ace , it &apos;s not gen@@ der , it &apos;s not Mar@@ x@@ ism , it &apos;s not N@@ az@@ ism ."
They are : the ar@@ ts and paren@@ ting .
"( Laughter ) So let me tell you what ar@@ ous@@ ed such ir@@ ate respon@@ ses , and I &apos;ll let you deci@@ de if whether they — the cl@@ a@@ im@@ s are really that ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ e@@ ous ."
Let me start with the ar@@ ts .
I n@@ ote that am@@ ong the long li@@ st of human univers@@ als that I pres@@ en@@ ted a few sli@@ des ago are art .
There is no society ever disc@@ over@@ ed in the re@@ m@@ ot@@ est cor@@ ner of the world that has not had something that we would consi@@ der the ar@@ ts .
V@@ i@@ su@@ al ar@@ ts — dec@@ or@@ ation of sur@@ fac@@ es and bo@@ dies — appe@@ ar@@ s to be a human univers@@ al .
"The t@@ elling of stories , mu@@ sic , d@@ ance , po@@ e@@ try — found in all cul@@ tures , and many of the moti@@ f@@ s and them@@ es that give us ple@@ as@@ ure in the ar@@ ts can be found in all human societies : a pre@@ fer@@ ence for sym@@ me@@ tr@@ ical for@@ ms , the use of re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion and vari@@ ation , even things as speci@@ fic as the fact that in po@@ e@@ try all over the world , you have l@@ ines that are very cl@@ ose to three secon@@ ds long , se@@ par@@ ated by p@@ au@@ ses ."
"Now , on the other hand , in the second half of the 20@@ th century , the ar@@ ts are f@@ requ@@ ently said to be in dec@@ line ."
"And I have a coll@@ ec@@ tion , probably 10 or 15 he@@ ad@@ l@@ ines , from high@@ bro@@ w mag@@ az@@ ines de@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the fact that the ar@@ ts are in dec@@ line in our time ."
"I &apos;ll give you a couple of re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative quot@@ es : &quot; &quot; We can as@@ ser@@ t with some con@@ fi@@ dence that our own per@@ i@@ od is one of dec@@ line , that the st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of culture are lo@@ wer than they were 50 years ago , and that the evi@@ d@@ ences of this dec@@ line are vi@@ sible in every de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of human acti@@ vity . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a quot@@ e from T@@ . S@@ . E@@ li@@ ot , a little more than 50 years ago ."
And a more rec@@ ent one : &quot; &quot; The possi@@ bility of su@@ st@@ ain@@ ing high culture in our time is becom@@ ing increas@@ ing proble@@ m@@ atic@@ al .
"S@@ eri@@ ous book st@@ o@@ res are l@@ os@@ ing their fr@@ an@@ ch@@ ise , n@@ on@@ prof@@ it the@@ at@@ ers are survi@@ ving pri@@ mar@@ ily by comm@@ er@@ ci@@ ali@@ zing their re@@ per@@ t@@ ory , sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y or@@ che@@ str@@ as are di@@ l@@ u@@ ting their pro@@ gr@@ ams , public tel@@ evi@@ sion is increas@@ ing its dep@@ en@@ dence on r@@ er@@ un@@ s of B@@ ri@@ ti@@ sh sit@@ com@@ s , cl@@ ass@@ ical radi@@ o st@@ ations are d@@ w@@ in@@ d@@ ling , mu@@ se@@ um@@ s are res@@ or@@ ting to bloc@@ k@@ bu@@ ster sho@@ ws , d@@ ance is d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s from R@@ ob@@ er@@ t B@@ ru@@ ste@@ in , the fam@@ ous dr@@ am@@ a cri@@ tic and direc@@ tor , in The New R@@ e@@ public about five years ago ."
"Well , in fact , the ar@@ ts are not in dec@@ line ."
"I don &apos;t think this will as a surpri@@ se to any@@ one in this room , but by any st@@ and@@ ard they have never been fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing to a gre@@ ater ex@@ t@@ ent ."
"There are , of course , enti@@ re@@ ly new art for@@ ms and new me@@ dia , many of which you &apos;ve heard over these few days ."
The only gra@@ in of tru@@ th to this com@@ pl@@ ain@@ t that the ar@@ ts are in dec@@ line come from three sp@@ her@@ es .
"One of them is in e@@ li@@ te art since the 19@@ 3@@ 0s — say , the kinds of works per@@ form@@ ed by maj@@ or sym@@ ph@@ on@@ y or@@ che@@ str@@ as , where most of the re@@ per@@ t@@ ory is before 19@@ 30 , or the works sho@@ wn in maj@@ or g@@ all@@ er@@ ies and pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous mu@@ se@@ um@@ s ."
"In liter@@ ary cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m and anal@@ ys@@ is , probably 40 or 50 years ago , liter@@ ary cri@@ tics were a kind of cul@@ tur@@ al her@@ o ; now they &apos;re kind of a national jo@@ ke ."
"And the hum@@ ani@@ ties and ar@@ ts pro@@ gr@@ ams in the univer@@ si@@ ties , which by many meas@@ ures , in@@ de@@ ed are in dec@@ line ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are st@@ ay@@ ing away in dro@@ ves , univer@@ si@@ ties are dis@@ inv@@ est@@ ing in the ar@@ ts and hum@@ ani@@ ties ."
"Well , here &apos;s a di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is ."
"They didn &apos;t ask me , but by their own ad@@ mis@@ sion , they need all the help that they can get ."
And I would like to su@@ gg@@ est that it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that this sup@@ posed dec@@ line in the e@@ li@@ te ar@@ ts and cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m oc@@ cur@@ red in the same point in history in which there was a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad den@@ i@@ al of human nature .
"A fam@@ ous quot@@ ation can be found — if you look on the we@@ b , you can find it in liter@@ ally sc@@ o@@ res of English c@@ ore sy@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ us@@ es — &quot; &quot; I@@ n or about D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 19@@ 10 , human nature changed . &quot; &quot; A par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se of a quot@@ e by V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia W@@ o@@ ol@@ f , and there &apos;s some de@@ b@@ ate as to what she actually me@@ ant by that ."
"But it &apos;s very c@@ lear , looking at these sy@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ us@@ es , that — it &apos;s used now as a way of saying that all for@@ ms of ap@@ preci@@ ation of art that were in place for cent@@ ur@@ ies , or m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a , in the 20@@ th century were disc@@ ar@@ ded ."
"The beau@@ ty and ple@@ as@@ ure in art — probably a human univers@@ al — were — beg@@ an to be consi@@ der@@ ed s@@ ac@@ char@@ ine , or k@@ it@@ sc@@ h , or comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al ."
B@@ ar@@ ne@@ t@@ t N@@ e@@ w@@ man had a fam@@ ous quot@@ e that &quot; &quot; the imp@@ ul@@ se of moder@@ n art is the des@@ ire to dest@@ ro@@ y beau@@ ty &quot; &quot; — which was consi@@ der@@ ed b@@ our@@ ge@@ o@@ is or t@@ ac@@ k@@ y .
And here &apos;s just one example .
"I mean , this is perhaps a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative example of the vi@@ su@@ al de@@ pic@@ tion of the f@@ em@@ ale form in the 1@@ 5@@ th century ; here is a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative example of the de@@ pic@@ tion of the f@@ em@@ ale form in the 20@@ th century ."
"And , as you can see , there — something has changed in the way the e@@ li@@ te ar@@ ts appe@@ al to the sen@@ ses ."
"I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , in mov@@ em@@ ents of moder@@ n@@ ism and pos@@ t-@@ moder@@ n@@ ism , there was vi@@ su@@ al art without beau@@ ty , liter@@ ature without n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative and p@@ lot , po@@ e@@ try without me@@ ter and r@@ hy@@ me , ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture and plan@@ ning without or@@ nam@@ ent , human sc@@ ale , gre@@ en space and natural light , mu@@ sic without m@@ el@@ o@@ dy and r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , and cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m without cl@@ ar@@ ity , att@@ en@@ tion to a@@ es@@ the@@ tics and in@@ sight into the human condi@@ tion ."
( Laughter ) Let me give just you an example to back up that last st@@ at@@ ement .
"But here , there — one of the most fam@@ ous liter@@ ary English scho@@ lars of our time is the B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey prof@@ ess@@ or , J@@ u@@ d@@ ith B@@ ut@@ l@@ er ."
"And here is an example of one of her anal@@ ys@@ es : &quot; &quot; The move from a struc@@ tur@@ ali@@ st ac@@ coun@@ t in which cap@@ ital is underst@@ ood to struc@@ ture social rel@@ ations in relati@@ vely h@@ om@@ o@@ log@@ ous ways to a view of he@@ g@@ em@@ on@@ y in which power rel@@ ations are sub@@ ject to re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion , con@@ ver@@ g@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ tic@@ ulation br@@ ought the question of t@@ em@@ por@@ ality into the thinking of struc@@ ture , and mar@@ ked a shi@@ ft from the form of A@@ l@@ th@@ us@@ ser@@ i@@ an theory that ta@@ kes struc@@ tur@@ al t@@ ot@@ ali@@ ties as the@@ o@@ re@@ tical ob@@ jects ... &quot; &quot; Well , you get the idea ."
"B@@ y the way , this is one s@@ ent@@ ence — you can actually par@@ se it ."
"Well , the ar@@ g@@ ument in &quot; &quot; The B@@ l@@ ank S@@ l@@ ate &quot; &quot; was that e@@ li@@ te art and cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m in the 20@@ th century , al@@ though not the ar@@ ts in gener@@ al , have dis@@ d@@ ained beau@@ ty , ple@@ as@@ ure , cl@@ ar@@ ity , in@@ sight and st@@ y@@ le ."
People are st@@ ay@@ ing away from e@@ li@@ te art and cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m .
What a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le — I won@@ der why .
"Well , this tur@@ ned out to be probably the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al cl@@ a@@ i@@ m in the book ."
S@@ ome@@ one asked me whether I st@@ uc@@ k it in in order to de@@ fl@@ ect ire from disc@@ us@@ sions of gen@@ der and N@@ az@@ ism and r@@ ace and so on . I won &apos;t com@@ ment on that .
But it cer@@ tain@@ ly insp@@ i@@ red an ener@@ ge@@ tic re@@ action from many univers@@ ity prof@@ ess@@ ors .
"Well , the other ho@@ t bu@@ tt@@ on is paren@@ ting ."
And the star@@ ting point is the — for that disc@@ us@@ sion was the fact that we have all been sub@@ ject to the adv@@ ice of the paren@@ ting in@@ du@@ stri@@ al comple@@ x .
"Now , here is — here is a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative quot@@ e from a b@@ es@@ i@@ eg@@ ed mother : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed with paren@@ ting adv@@ ice ."
I &apos;m sup@@ posed to do lots of physical acti@@ vity with my kids so I can in@@ still in them a physical f@@ it@@ ness ha@@ bit so they &apos;ll grow up to be health@@ y ad@@ ults .
And I &apos;m sup@@ posed to do all kinds of int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual play so they &apos;ll grow up smar@@ t .
"And there are all kinds of play — cl@@ ay for fin@@ ger de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity , word g@@ am@@ es for read@@ ing suc@@ cess , large m@@ ot@@ or play , small m@@ ot@@ or play . I feel like I could dev@@ ote my life to fig@@ uring out what to play with my kids . &quot; &quot; I think any@@ one who &apos;s rec@@ ently been a paren@@ t can sym@@ p@@ ath@@ i@@ ze with this mother ."
"Well , here &apos;s some so@@ b@@ ering fac@@ ts about paren@@ ting ."
"M@@ ost stu@@ dies of paren@@ ting on which this adv@@ ice is bas@@ ed are us@@ el@@ ess . They &apos;re us@@ el@@ ess because they don &apos;t control for her@@ it@@ ability . They measure some cor@@ rel@@ ation between what the parents do , how the children turn out and as@@ su@@ me a cau@@ s@@ al rel@@ ation : that the paren@@ ting shap@@ ed the child ."
"@@ P@@ aren@@ ts who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate , parents who sp@@ ank their kids have kids who grow up to be viol@@ ent and so on ."
And very few of them control for the possi@@ bility that parents p@@ ass on gen@@ es for — that increase the chan@@ ces a child will be ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate or viol@@ ent and so on .
"@@ Un@@ til the stu@@ dies are re@@ done with ad@@ op@@ tive children , who pro@@ vi@@ de an environ@@ ment but not gen@@ es to their kids , we have no way of kno@@ wing whether these con@@ clu@@ sions are val@@ id ."
The gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally contro@@ l@@ led stu@@ dies have some so@@ b@@ ering res@@ ults .
"R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber the M@@ al@@ li@@ fer@@ t tw@@ ins : se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th , then they me@@ et in the pat@@ ent off@@ ice — re@@ mark@@ ably sim@@ il@@ ar ."
"Well , what would have happened if the M@@ al@@ li@@ fer@@ t tw@@ ins had gro@@ wn up together ?"
"You might think , well , then they &apos;d be even more sim@@ il@@ ar , because not only would they share their gen@@ es , but they would also share their environ@@ ment ."
"That would make them super@@ -@@ sim@@ il@@ ar , right ?"
"W@@ r@@ ong . I@@ den@@ tical tw@@ ins , or any si@@ bl@@ ings , who are se@@ par@@ ated at bir@@ th are no less sim@@ il@@ ar than if they had gro@@ wn up together ."
E@@ very@@ thing that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appe@@ ar@@ s to leave no per@@ man@@ ent st@@ am@@ p on your pers@@ on@@ ality or int@@ ell@@ ect .
"A comple@@ m@@ ent@@ ary fin@@ ding , from a completely different me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ logy , is that ad@@ op@@ ted si@@ bl@@ ings re@@ ared together — the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r im@@ age of i@@ den@@ tical tw@@ ins re@@ ared ap@@ art , they share their parents , their home , their ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , don &apos;t share their gen@@ es — end up not sim@@ il@@ ar at all ."
O@@ K — two different bo@@ dies of resear@@ ch with a sim@@ il@@ ar fin@@ ding .
"What it su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts is that children are shap@@ ed not by their parents over the long run , but in part — only in part — by their gen@@ es , in part by their culture — the culture of the country at large and the children &apos;s own culture , nam@@ ely their pe@@ er group — as we heard from J@@ ill S@@ o@@ bu@@ le ear@@ li@@ er today , that &apos;s what kids care about — and , to a very large ex@@ t@@ ent , lar@@ ger than most people are pre@@ p@@ ared to ac@@ knowledge , by chan@@ ce : chan@@ ce ev@@ ents in the w@@ ir@@ ing of the brain in u@@ ter@@ o ; chan@@ ce ev@@ ents as you live your life ."
So let me con@@ clu@@ de with just a re@@ mar@@ k to bring it back to the the@@ me of cho@@ ices .
"I think that the sci@@ ences of human nature — behavi@@ or@@ al gen@@ e@@ tics , ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ ary psycho@@ logy , neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , cogni@@ tive science — are going to , increas@@ ing@@ ly in the years to come , up@@ set vari@@ ous do@@ g@@ m@@ as , care@@ ers and de@@ e@@ pl@@ y-@@ hel@@ d political belie@@ f syst@@ ems ."
And that pres@@ ents us with a cho@@ ice .
"I have my own answer to that question , which comes from a great arti@@ st of the 19@@ th century , A@@ n@@ t@@ on C@@ he@@ k@@ ho@@ v , who said , &quot; &quot; M@@ an will become better when you show him what he is like . &quot; &quot; And I think that the ar@@ g@@ ument can &apos;t be put any more el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently than that ."
Thank you very much .
