T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ exp@@ ected disc@@ over@@ ies .
Now I work in the sol@@ ar technology in@@ du@@ str@@ y .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environ@@ ment by p@@ ay@@ ing att@@ en@@ tion to ...
... p@@ ay@@ ing att@@ en@@ tion to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ ing .
It &apos;s just a qu@@ ick vide@@ o of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just s@@ ki@@ p — I &apos;ll just s@@ ki@@ p through the vide@@ o instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ u@@ sic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life h@@ ack , and all it requ@@ i@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to p@@ ay att@@ en@@ tion to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ul@@ arly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a h@@ and@@ s@@ ha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation ."
"When we think about comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really mean@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or prom@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity , sho@@ ws that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0-@@ second s@@ ound@@ less c@@ li@@ ps of real phys@@ ici@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the phys@@ ici@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that phys@@ ici@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our th@@ ough@@ ts and our feel@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logi@@ st . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I bec@@ ame es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally interest@@ ed in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the anim@@ al k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ ess@@ ic@@ a T@@ r@@ acy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really po@@ wer@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ch@@ ing this behavior in the cl@@ ass@@ room , and what do I not@@ ice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I not@@ ice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ r@@ on@@ ically less po@@ wer@@ ful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cl@@ ass@@ room , because par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business scho@@ ols have been str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de g@@ ap .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to s@@ mi@@ le by ho@@ l@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the po@@ wer@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the po@@ wer@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the po@@ wer@@ less look like ?
"So po@@ wer@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ri@@ s@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stress ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stress re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"@@ P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shap@@ e the mind , at le@@ ast at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shap@@ e the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this t@@ iny man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation , this t@@ iny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be sit@@ ting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ch@@ ing your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative sit@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
People h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ d@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ s@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the condi@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
Th@@ ese kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or me@@ di@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fr@@ au@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad c@@ ar ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a c@@ ar , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the c@@ ar .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ a@@ ke it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ ali@@ ze .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ iny tw@@ e@@ a@@ ks can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that sit@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de I@@ s@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ g@@ est r@@ out@@ e we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ th@@ ering me for 2@@ ,000 mil@@ es ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My fri@@ end looks at me t@@ ot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a per@@ f@@ ect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the si@@ g@@ ns we keep seeing with the Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just st@@ are@@ s at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the fam@@ ous Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years of my life thinking about sit@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the si@@ g@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a stran@@ ge care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ an@@ t@@ age : no job com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ n fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at le@@ ast to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ sta@@ kes .
"The human spec@@ ies , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay fine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ preci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the w@@ in@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the p@@ ol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So effec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , in our pers@@ onal and prof@@ es@@ si@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And fin@@ ally , I want to con@@ v@@ ince you that it is possible to ste@@ p outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est moral , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual and cre@@ ative le@@ ap you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me ask you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emoti@@ on@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are ans@@ w@@ ering the question : How does it feel to reali@@ ze you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ e@@ ali@@ zing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ ast@@ ating , it can be re@@ v@@ el@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ p@@ id Ch@@ in@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remember that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this p@@ a@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never cat@@ ch@@ ing a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at le@@ ast if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally fine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and reali@@ z@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ all@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we reali@@ ze it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s g@@ one off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tur@@ al reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ n@@ al c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tur@@ al .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sit@@ ting there in cl@@ ass , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qu@@ i@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the k@@ id who got this p@@ ap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b k@@ id , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ zy , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ w@@ its — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ sta@@ kes ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ sp@@ ect , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just becom@@ ing per@@ f@@ ect little A students , per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phys@@ ici@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phys@@ ici@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so fine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we f@@ re@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ e@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ dic@@ al C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ e@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ t@@ on .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ osp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best h@@ osp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"S@@ he &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have g@@ one fine .
"And she wa@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ e@@ th I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wh@@ at@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply f@@ el@@ t that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ n@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 200 million g@@ all@@ ons of o@@ il into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a huge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ n@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ cess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our te@@ am ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ ec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a thir@@ d as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are de@@ li@@ ber@@ ately dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own m@@ al@@ ev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mi@@ sta@@ kes when we ab@@ solu@@ tely need to and cau@@ ses us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ aff@@ ling and most tr@@ ag@@ ic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent w@@ in@@ do@@ ws and we just g@@ a@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to g@@ a@@ ze out of the same w@@ in@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally fundamental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other anim@@ als , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to fig@@ ure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the s@@ our@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"@@ L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found my@@ self li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a lot of e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve l@@ ost it ."
I &apos;ve become the crazy wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ r@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ r@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ vers@@ al and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ bers , as li@@ st@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se en@@ d@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .

And that &apos;s how it goes .

"Th@@ ese are simple ob@@ jects : c@@ loc@@ ks , ke@@ ys , com@@ b@@ s , gl@@ ass@@ es ."
They are the things the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de in B@@ os@@ ni@@ a car@@ ri@@ ed with them on their fin@@ al j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"We are all fam@@ ili@@ ar with these m@@ und@@ an@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
The fact that some of the v@@ ic@@ tim@@ s car@@ ri@@ ed pers@@ onal it@@ ems such as to@@ o@@ th@@ p@@ ast@@ e and a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h is a c@@ lear si@@ g@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers of war ."

And it is quite possi@@ bly the lar@@ g@@ est ever disc@@ over@@ ed .

"It is also about dest@@ ro@@ ying their pro@@ per@@ ty , their cul@@ tur@@ al her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ tim@@ ately the very n@@ oti@@ on that they ever exist@@ ed ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the k@@ ill@@ ing ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty .
There are always tr@@ ac@@ es — no such thing as a per@@ f@@ ect cri@@ me .
"Th@@ ese it@@ ems are re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed from num@@ er@@ ous mass gra@@ ves , and the ma@@ in go@@ al of this coll@@ ec@@ tion of the it@@ ems is a uni@@ qu@@ e process of i@@ d@@ enti@@ f@@ ying those who dis@@ appe@@ ared in the k@@ ill@@ ings , the first act of gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de on Euro@@ pe@@ an so@@ il since the H@@ o@@ loc@@ au@@ st ."

"M@@ any of them get dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of sight and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ e@@ m in order to create a vi@@ su@@ al ar@@ ch@@ i@@ ve that survi@@ v@@ ors could eas@@ ily bro@@ w@@ se .

I am for cho@@ col@@ ate d@@ on@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
This was part of a chall@@ en@@ ge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a t@@ on of fu@@ n ."

"In 19@@ 7@@ 5 , when I was se@@ ven years old , women in I@@ c@@ el@@ and went on a stri@@ ke ."
They mar@@ ched into the center of R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k — 90 percent of women par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated — and pe@@ ac@@ e@@ fully and in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity asked for equality .
"@@ N@@ o@@ thing worked in I@@ c@@ el@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work ."
"I will never for@@ get this day , that P@@ re@@ si@@ dent V@@ ig@@ d@@ í@@ s , as we know her by her first name , ste@@ p@@ ped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mo@@ m with her d@@ aughter by her side as she had won ."
"( Applause ) This woman was an incredi@@ ble ro@@ le mo@@ de@@ l for me and everyone gro@@ wing up at that time , in@@ clu@@ ding bo@@ ys ."
"S@@ he f@@ requ@@ ently s@@ ha@@ res the story of how a young bo@@ y appro@@ ach@@ ed her after a couple of ter@@ ms in off@@ ice and asked , &quot; &quot; C@@ an bo@@ ys really grow up to be pre@@ si@@ dent ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ole mo@@ d@@ els really matter , but even with such str@@ ong ro@@ le mo@@ d@@ els who I am so gr@@ ate@@ ful for , when I was enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed to run for pre@@ si@@ dent , my first re@@ action was , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I to run for pre@@ si@@ dent ?"
Wh@@ o am I to be pre@@ si@@ dent ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consi@@ der run@@ ning than men .
"So a study done in the U@@ S in 20@@ 11 sho@@ wed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had consi@@ der@@ ed run@@ ning for off@@ ice , but 4@@ 5 percent of women ."
"That &apos;s g@@ ap of 1@@ 6 per@@ cent@@ age poin@@ ts , and it &apos;s the same g@@ ap that exist@@ ed a dec@@ ad@@ e ear@@ li@@ er ."
And it was the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of my life .
It was ama@@ zing .
The j@@ our@@ ne@@ y started with p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally as many as 20 can@@ di@@ d@@ ates .
"It bo@@ il@@ ed down to n@@ ine can@@ di@@ d@@ ates qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ying , and ul@@ tim@@ ately the r@@ ace came down to four of us , three men and me ."
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dr@@ am@@ a yet .
Th@@ en later he changed his mind when our pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er re@@ si@@ g@@ ned fol@@ lowing the in@@ fam@@ ous P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ ap@@ ers that imp@@ lic@@ ated him and his family .
"And there was a pop@@ ular prot@@ est in I@@ c@@ el@@ and , so the sit@@ ting pre@@ si@@ dent thought they needed a tru@@ sted lead@@ er ."
"So on M@@ ay 9 , 4@@ 5 days before elec@@ tion day , it was not looking too good for me ."
I did not even make the grap@@ h in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .
"The p@@ ol@@ ls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the high@@ est that any woman an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ing her can@@ di@@ d@@ acy had ear@@ ned ."
"So it would be an underst@@ at@@ ement to say that I had to work extre@@ me@@ ly hard to get my se@@ at at the t@@ able and ac@@ cess to tel@@ evi@@ sion , because the ne@@ t@@ work decided that they would only in@@ clu@@ de those with 2@@ .@@ 5 percent or more in the p@@ ol@@ ls in the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"I found out on the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate that I would par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate along with the three men , and I found out on live T@@ V that I came in at exactly 2@@ .@@ 5 percent on the day of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"( Applause ) So , chall@@ eng@@ es ."
"The fore@@ most chall@@ eng@@ es I had to face and over@@ come on this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y had to do with me@@ dia , mu@@ sc@@ le and money ."
Let &apos;s start with me@@ dia .
There are those who say gen@@ der doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to me@@ dia and poli@@ tics .
It pro@@ ved har@@ der for me to both get ac@@ cess and a@@ ir@@ time in me@@ dia .
And I am not saying me@@ dia is doing this conscious@@ ly .
"But me@@ dia really mat@@ ters , and every time I appe@@ ared on T@@ V , we saw and experienc@@ ed a ri@@ se in the p@@ ol@@ ls , so I know fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this mat@@ ters and why we have to talk about it ."
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other can@@ di@@ d@@ ates and out of co@@ verage about the elec@@ tions .
I got few if any comm@@ ents about my ha@@ ir and pan@@ t@@ su@@ it .
( Applause ) So k@@ u@@ do@@ s to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
"When ac@@ cess to me@@ dia pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we r@@ an our own me@@ dia ."
I r@@ an live F@@ ac@@ e@@ book s@@ es@@ sions where I took questions from v@@ ot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the sp@@ ot .
"And when re@@ ach@@ ing young v@@ ot@@ ers pro@@ ved to be chall@@ eng@@ ing , I bec@@ ame a S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at@@ ter ."
"I got young people to te@@ ach me how to do that , and I used every f@@ il@@ ter on S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at d@@ uring the last part of the cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n ."
"And I actually had to use a lot of hum@@ or and hum@@ ili@@ ty , as I was very bad at it ."
But we gre@@ w the fol@@ lowing am@@ on@@ g@@ st young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different t@@ y@@ pe of cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
"But un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately , one cannot talk about poli@@ tics without m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing money ."
"I am sa@@ d that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al res@@ our@@ ces than the other can@@ di@@ d@@ ates ."
This probably was par@@ tly d@@ ue to the fact that I think I had a har@@ der time as@@ king for fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al sup@@ port .
And maybe I also had the am@@ bi@@ tion to do more with less .
S@@ ome would call that very wom@@ an@@ ly of me .
"But even with one thir@@ d the me@@ dia , one thir@@ d the fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al res@@ our@@ ces , and only an ent@@ re@@ pre@@ neur@@ i@@ al te@@ am , but an ama@@ zing te@@ am , we man@@ ag@@ ed to surpri@@ se everyone on elec@@ tion night , when the first num@@ bers came in ."
"I surpri@@ sed my@@ self , as you may see in that ph@@ ot@@ o ."
"( Laughter ) So the first num@@ bers , I came in nec@@ k to nec@@ k to the lead@@ ing can@@ di@@ d@@ ate ."
"( C@@ he@@ ers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pul@@ l that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with ne@@ arly a thir@@ d of the v@@ ote , and we be@@ at the p@@ ol@@ ls by an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted mar@@ g@@ in , or 10 per@@ cent@@ age poin@@ ts abo@@ ve what the last p@@ ol@@ l came in at ."
"S@@ ome people call me the real w@@ in@@ ner of the elec@@ tion because of this , and there are many people who enc@@ our@@ ag@@ ed me to run again ."
"( Applause ) She is 1@@ 3 , and she had never been on T@@ V before ."
"And on elec@@ tion day , I ob@@ ser@@ ved her on T@@ V re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly , and she was smar@@ t , she was self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent , she was s@@ inc@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother ."
This was probably the high@@ light of my cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
A@@ u@@ dience : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a w@@ in for me .
"What we see , we can be ."
So scre@@ w fear and chall@@ eng@@ es .
"( Applause ) It mat@@ ters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for off@@ ice , be it the off@@ ice of the C@@ E@@ O or the off@@ ice of the pre@@ si@@ dent ."
"I also man@@ ag@@ ed to put an im@@ pres@@ sion on your very own &quot; &quot; New Y@@ or@@ ker . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new ti@@ t@@ le , &quot; &quot; A living em@@ o@@ j@@ i of s@@ in@@ cer@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( C@@ he@@ ers ) It is possi@@ bly my pr@@ ou@@ d@@ est ti@@ t@@ le yet , and the reason is that women too often get p@@ en@@ ali@@ zed for using what I call their emoti@@ onal cap@@ ital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that ."
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
"We c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated as if we had won on elec@@ tion night , because that &apos;s how we f@@ el@@ t ."
So you don &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have to re@@ ach that off@@ ice .
"You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow be@@ y@@ on@@ d anything you will experience before ."
"So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , probably more l@@ ess@@ ons than I can share here in the time we have today ."
"But rest as@@ su@@ red , it was hard work ."
I l@@ ost a lot of s@@ le@@ ep d@@ uring those months .
"It took re@@ si@@ li@@ ence and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance to not qu@@ it , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are tru@@ ly , au@@ th@@ en@@ tic@@ ally li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to your own v@@ o@@ ice and working in ali@@ gn@@ ment with that ."
"As a good si@@ ster of m@@ ine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion , but your in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion never che@@ at@@ s on you ."
"As a matter of fact , the lead@@ ing P@@ R exper@@ t told me before I made my deci@@ sion that I would do well to get se@@ ven percent ."
"I ap@@ preci@@ ated his per@@ spec@@ tive , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on val@@ u@@ able experience ."
"It &apos;s very important to men@@ tion this , because I did l@@ ose a lot of s@@ le@@ ep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me ."
"I took a lot of sup@@ port from others in doing this , and I made the deci@@ sion to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s par@@ tly how I ke@@ p@@ t my energy going thr@@ ough@@ out all of this ."
"I called it a 4@@ G cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n , the G &apos;s re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c words ."
"S@@ econ@@ d one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or jo@@ y ."
I decided to en@@ jo@@ y the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y .
"I ke@@ p@@ t no sec@@ re@@ ts , and it was all op@@ en , on F@@ ac@@ e@@ book and we@@ b@@ sit@@ es ."
"@@ L@@ ast but not le@@ ast , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we r@@ an on the prin@@ ci@@ ple of G@@ ir@@ l@@ power ."
"I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my enti@@ re te@@ am will ag@@ ree with me , that it was wor@@ th it ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell : I &apos;m not le@@ tting you go yet . H@@ all@@ a T@@ ó@@ m@@ as@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ ti@@ r : What a great c@@ ro@@ w@@ d . P@@ M : I can &apos;t let you go without saying

"H@@ T : Y@@ es , so 4@@ 1 years after the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al stri@@ ke , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done ."
( Applause )
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Y@@ or@@ ker a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great bl@@ ess@@ ing as a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ cess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I fam@@ ili@@ ar with the 50 st@@ ates in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ s@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time pro@@ gr@@ ams in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pre@@ si@@ dent , but we also me@@ et the vill@@ ag@@ ers who live in the most re@@ m@@ ote are@@ as of A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to prom@@ ote human ri@@ gh@@ ts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ v@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ gh@@ ts on Earth is , stran@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of religi@@ ous sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tions in the sy@@ n@@ ag@@ o@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es and in the m@@ os@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these r@@ ul@@ es to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily re@@ le@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary posi@@ tion comp@@ ared to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very ser@@ i@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 2@@ 000 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st for 7@@ 0 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ und@@ ay school every S@@ und@@ ay ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ und@@ ay as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 2@@ 000 decided that women should play a secon@@ d@@ ary posi@@ tion , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent posi@@ tion to men ."
"So they is@@ su@@ ed an e@@ dic@@ t , in eff@@ ect , that pre@@ v@@ ents women from being pri@@ est@@ s , p@@ ast@@ ors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or ch@@ ap@@ l@@ ain@@ s in the mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a cl@@ ass@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st se@@ min@@ ary , they cannot te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the bas@@ ic thing is the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant posi@@ tion .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als my@@ self ?"
"The other very ser@@ i@@ ous b@@ light that cau@@ ses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ ort to violence , and that is increas@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for inst@@ ance , we have had an en@@ orm@@ ous increase in ab@@ use of po@@ or people , m@@ os@@ tly black people and min@@ ori@@ ties , by pu@@ tting them in pri@@ son ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"@@ N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ fo@@ ld increase .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all el@@ em@@ ents of human ri@@ gh@@ ts in enc@@ our@@ aging the death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a now , and I fi@@ gu@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a has sp@@ ent four billion dollars in con@@ v@@ ic@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to s@@ end a person to be ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted ."
"@@ N@@ e@@ br@@ as@@ k@@ a this week just p@@ ass@@ ed a la@@ w abo@@ li@@ sh@@ ing the death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty , because it cos@@ ts so much . ( Applause ) So the res@@ ort to violence and ab@@ use of po@@ or people and hel@@ pl@@ ess people is another c@@ ause of the increase in ab@@ use of women ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation .
"@@ G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation is h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a gir@@ l , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely c@@ ut away by a so@@ -@@ called cu@@ tter who has a ra@@ z@@ or bl@@ ad@@ e and , in a n@@ on@@ -@@ st@@ er@@ ili@@ zed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me c@@ ases but not very r@@ are c@@ ases , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the gir@@ l can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets marri@@ ed , the same cu@@ tter goes in and op@@ ens the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have se@@ x ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the f@@ em@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are c@@ ut that way before they re@@ ach mat@@ ur@@ ity ."
This is a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very ser@@ i@@ ous thing is h@@ on@@ or k@@ ill@@ ings , where a family with mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation , again , of a ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ ur@@ an that m@@ and@@ ates this — will ex@@ ec@@ ute a gir@@ l in their family if she is r@@ ap@@ ed or if she marri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she w@@ ear@@ s in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate c@@ lo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family becom@@ es m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the gir@@ l br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ ys@@ is was done in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it sho@@ wed that 7@@ 5 percent of these m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers of a gir@@ l are per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ated by the father , the un@@ c@@ le or the bro@@ ther , but 2@@ 5 percent of the m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers are conduc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women partic@@ ul@@ arly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a into s@@ la@@ very in the New W@@ or@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a m@@ and@@ ate from Con@@ gres@@ s to give a re@@ port every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national b@@ ord@@ ers every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ m@@ ory U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner wan@@ ts to bu@@ y a gir@@ l that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned gir@@ l br@@ ings se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ l@@ ave ."
"The se@@ x tr@@ ad@@ e in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the t@@ ot@@ al dru@@ g tr@@ ad@@ e in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very ser@@ i@@ ous problem , and the bas@@ ic problem is pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ o@@ re@@ h@@ ouse in America that &apos;s not known by the loc@@ al off@@ ici@@ als , the loc@@ al po@@ lic@@ em@@ en , or the ch@@ i@@ e@@ f of poli@@ ce or the may@@ or and so for@@ th ."
"And this le@@ ads to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ought increas@@ ing@@ ly and put into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very in all countries in the world ."
S@@ we@@ d@@ en has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ d@@ en decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the m@@ ale cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has g@@ one down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite posi@@ tion ."
"For every m@@ ale ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ le@@ g@@ al se@@ x tr@@ ad@@ e , 2@@ 5 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , I@@ rel@@ and , I &apos;ve already said S@@ we@@ d@@ en , F@@ r@@ ance , and other countries are mo@@ ving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ we@@ dis@@ h mo@@ de@@ l ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great in@@ stitu@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ m@@ ire : our mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary and our great univers@@ ity system .
"In the mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ u@@ al ass@@ au@@ l@@ ts take place ."
"The last re@@ port I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ u@@ al ass@@ au@@ l@@ ts that took place in the mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and the reason is that the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er of any organi@@ zation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ i@@ on in the A@@ r@@ my or a comp@@ any in the Mar@@ ines — the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ute a r@@ ap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ u@@ al ass@@ au@@ l@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w nee@@ ds to be changed .
"The D@@ e@@ par@@ t@@ ment of J@@ us@@ ti@@ ce says that more than half of the r@@ ap@@ es on a colle@@ ge cam@@ p@@ us take place by ser@@ i@@ al r@@ ap@@ ists , because outside of the univers@@ ity system , if they r@@ ap@@ e somebody , they &apos;ll be pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , but when they get on a univers@@ ity cam@@ p@@ us , they can r@@ ap@@ e with imp@@ unity ."
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ i@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al p@@ ay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I bec@@ ame pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some progress , par@@ ti@@ ally because I was pre@@ si@@ dent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
Th@@ ese are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 5@@ 00 comp@@ an@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 2@@ 5 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head d@@ rop@@ ping bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ ort to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of the ho@@ ly sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures are what cau@@ ses , are the bas@@ ic cau@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic c@@ ause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ ed posi@@ tion that we oc@@ c@@ up@@ y , and this is very sim@@ il@@ ar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had exist@@ ed ."
"R@@ ac@@ i@@ al disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation , le@@ g@@ ally , had exist@@ ed for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ e@@ tween the States , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son got the b@@ ills p@@ ass@@ ed for equ@@ al ri@@ gh@@ ts ."
"But d@@ uring that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that r@@ ac@@ i@@ al disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation was o@@ kay , but they st@@ ay@@ ed qu@@ i@@ et , because they en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed the pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ es of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ qu@@ e ac@@ cess to j@@ ury du@@ ty , better scho@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that ex@@ ists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ v@@ il@@ eg@@ ed posi@@ tion ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the univers@@ ity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mi@@ li@@ t@@ ary system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great religi@@ ons ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to deta@@ il about that .
"I have 12 gr@@ and@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they li@@ ved in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or a fore@@ ig@@ n country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ gh@@ ts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on for women and girls around the world and prot@@ ect their human ri@@ gh@@ ts ."
Thank you very much .

"When I was a stud@@ ent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ le@@ ak ."
The population expl@@ os@@ i@@ on was un@@ st@@ op@@ p@@ able .
G@@ lob@@ al fam@@ ine was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
A cancer e@@ p@@ ide@@ mi@@ c cau@@ sed by ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als in the environ@@ ment was going to sh@@ or@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id ra@@ in was f@@ all@@ ing on the fore@@ sts .
The des@@ er@@ t was adv@@ anc@@ ing by a mi@@ le or two a year .
"The o@@ il was run@@ ning out , and a n@@ uc@@ lear w@@ in@@ ter would fin@@ ish us off ."
"@@ N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly , if you look at what actually happened in my li@@ fe@@ time , the average per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a income of the average person on the planet , in real ter@@ ms , ad@@ ju@@ sted for in@@ fl@@ ation , has tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
L@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
C@@ hi@@ ld mor@@ tal@@ ity is down by tw@@ o@@ -@@ thir@@ ds .
P@@ er@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a food produc@@ tion is up by a thir@@ d .
And all this at a time when the population has d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed .
"@@ How did we achi@@ e@@ ve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we achi@@ e@@ ve that ?
How did we become the only spec@@ ies that becom@@ es more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous as it becom@@ es more pop@@ ul@@ ous ?
"The size of the b@@ lo@@ b in this grap@@ h re@@ pres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the grap@@ h re@@ pres@@ ents G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to com@@ b@@ ine and re@@ com@@ b@@ ine , to me@@ et and , in@@ de@@ ed , to m@@ ate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have se@@ x ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making ob@@ jects like this to making ob@@ jects like this .
Th@@ ese are both real ob@@ jects .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s .
The other is ob@@ vi@@ ously a computer m@@ ouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shap@@ e to an un@@ can@@ n@@ y de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tri@@ ed to work out which is big@@ ger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"They &apos;re both techno@@ logi@@ es . I@@ n the end , their sim@@ il@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just t@@ ells you they were both desig@@ ned to f@@ it the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying desig@@ n for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but to@@ ols changed s@@ lo@@ wer than sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no progress , no in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
"It &apos;s an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ob@@ ject on the right is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the ob@@ ject on the left is made from one sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"The ob@@ ject on the right is made from a con@@ f@@ ec@@ tion of different sub@@ st@@ anc@@ es , from si@@ lic@@ on and me@@ t@@ al and pl@@ as@@ tic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a con@@ f@@ ec@@ tion of different ideas , the idea of pl@@ as@@ tic , the idea of a l@@ as@@ er , the idea of tran@@ sist@@ ors ."
They &apos;ve all been com@@ b@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this com@@ b@@ in@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the sec@@ re@@ t to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"M@@ y body &apos;s an ac@@ c@@ um@@ ulation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"@@ How does evolution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it us@@ es se@@ x@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ u@@ al spec@@ ies , if you get two different m@@ ut@@ ations in different cre@@ atures , a gre@@ en one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t for the other to survi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ u@@ al spec@@ ies , then it &apos;s possible for an in@@ divi@@ du@@ al to in@@ her@@ it both m@@ ut@@ ations from different l@@ ine@@ ages ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ab@@ les the in@@ divi@@ du@@ al to d@@ ra@@ w up@@ on the gen@@ e@@ tic in@@ no@@ v@@ ations of the whole spec@@ ies .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own l@@ ine@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same eff@@ ect in cul@@ tur@@ al evolution as se@@ x is having in bio@@ logical evolution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ chang@@ ing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ qu@@ e human fe@@ ature .
No other anim@@ al does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ c@@ ity in other anim@@ als — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ ject for another never happens .
"As A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ u@@ al culture ."
"@@ Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es , k@@ ill@@ er wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ atures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tra@@ di@@ tions which are h@@ an@@ ded down from paren@@ t to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cr@@ ack n@@ u@@ ts with ro@@ c@@ ks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never grow , never ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ a@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in ter@@ ms of tr@@ ad@@ e between countries ."
A@@ d@@ am ta@@ kes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z ta@@ kes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ar@@ s and ax@@ es than A@@ d@@ am .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ d@@ am .
He can make his own spe@@ ar@@ s and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ar@@ s and A@@ d@@ am make two ax@@ es , and then they tr@@ ad@@ e , then they will each have sa@@ ved an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ d@@ am is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ar@@ s ."
So the g@@ ain@@ s from tr@@ ad@@ e are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more speci@@ ali@@ zation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ d@@ am and O@@ z both sa@@ ved an h@@ our of time .
"That is pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity , the sa@@ ving of time in s@@ atis@@ f@@ ying your nee@@ ds ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to pro@@ vi@@ de for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this even@@ ing to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You ren@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the average w@@ age in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight secon@@ ds on the average w@@ age to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s se@@ ven and a half secon@@ ds of pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve g@@ ained since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s se@@ ven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or serv@@ ice ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the average w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the average person on the average w@@ age could not aff@@ or@@ d a c@@ and@@ le in 18@@ 00 ."
"@@ G@@ o back to this im@@ age of the ax@@ e and the m@@ ouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one ax@@ e was made by someone for h@@ im@@ self ."
It was self-@@ suff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the ob@@ ject on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ und@@ re@@ ds ? Th@@ ous@@ ands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably m@@ illions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to in@@ clu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the o@@ il ri@@ g , who was dr@@ ill@@ ing for o@@ il , which was going to be made into the pl@@ as@@ tic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ouse for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed as a spec@@ ies .
"In the old days , if you were r@@ ich , you liter@@ ally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be r@@ ich ; you emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his si@@ l@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his si@@ l@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or wh@@ at@@ ever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his d@@ in@@ ner every night .
"But a moder@@ n tou@@ ri@@ st going around the p@@ al@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his d@@ in@@ ner t@@ on@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in bi@@ st@@ ro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts and sho@@ ps all over P@@ ar@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s not@@ ice with an exc@@ ell@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to d@@ ra@@ w up@@ on speci@@ ali@@ zation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other anim@@ als working for each other too ."
A@@ n@@ ts are a cl@@ assi@@ c example ; wor@@ k@@ ers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ k@@ ers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ ali@@ ze with resp@@ ect to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ een does it all .
"In our spec@@ ies , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in Eng@@ land , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ u@@ een ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ u@@ al divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work m@@ ale for f@@ em@@ ale and f@@ em@@ ale for m@@ ale .
"In all h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ g@@ a@@ ther@@ er societies today , there &apos;s a for@@ aging divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or between , on the whole , h@@ un@@ ting m@@ al@@ es and g@@ ath@@ ering f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ tion between speci@@ ali@@ zed ro@@ les for m@@ al@@ es and f@@ em@@ al@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it b@@ ene@@ f@@ its both si@@ des .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get ac@@ cess to prot@@ e@@ in is to di@@ g some extra ro@@ ots and tr@@ ad@@ e them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ing h@@ un@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
A@@ ll he has to do is make sure that when he k@@ ills a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des ra@@ ise each other &apos;s st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ u@@ al divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative spec@@ ies .
They were a high@@ ly intellig@@ ent spec@@ ies .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on average , by the end , were big@@ ger than your@@ s and m@@ ine in this room today ."
They were imag@@ in@@ ative . They bur@@ i@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disc@@ over@@ ed here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ ills .
They were br@@ illi@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a se@@ x@@ u@@ al divi@@ sion of l@@ ab@@ or .
There &apos;s no evidence of g@@ ath@@ ering behavior by f@@ em@@ al@@ es .
It looks like the f@@ em@@ al@@ es were co@@ oper@@ ative h@@ un@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the ob@@ jects that you find in N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from loc@@ al materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ au@@ cas@@ us there &apos;s a s@@ ite where you find loc@@ al N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from loc@@ al ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are moder@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from loc@@ al ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings beg@@ an mo@@ ving ob@@ jects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
People for@@ get that . People think of tr@@ ad@@ e as a moder@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hundred thous@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est evidence for it c@@ ro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in A@@ fr@@ ic@@ a , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things mo@@ ving long dist@@ anc@@ es in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ as@@ h@@ ells — as disc@@ over@@ ed by a te@@ am here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — mo@@ ving 1@@ 2@@ 5 mil@@ es in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an in A@@ l@@ g@@ eri@@ a .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ chang@@ ing between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ ali@@ zation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance mov@@ ement means tr@@ ad@@ e rather than mi@@ gr@@ ation ?
"Well , you look at moder@@ n h@@ un@@ ter g@@ a@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ or@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed for st@@ one ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ s@@ a , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ a@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tr@@ ad@@ ed them with their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gr@@ ay bar@@ b@@ s , and the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence was that st@@ one ax@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance mov@@ ement of to@@ ols is a si@@ g@@ n of tr@@ ad@@ e , not mi@@ gr@@ ation ."
"What happens when you c@@ ut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ ali@@ ze ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down techno@@ logical progress , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ ver@@ se ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the se@@ a level r@@ ose and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia bec@@ ame an is@@ land 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienc@@ ed s@@ lo@@ wer progress than people on the ma@@ in@@ land , they actually experienc@@ ed re@@ gres@@ s ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and fi@@ sh@@ ing equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment and c@@ lo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ in@@ tain the speci@@ ali@@ zed sk@@ ills nec@@ ess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ er@@ t is@@ land .
"@@ How many of the things in our po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts could we contin@@ ue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a de@@ l F@@ u@@ e@@ go — sim@@ il@@ ar is@@ land , sim@@ il@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a de@@ l F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ ou@@ th America by a much n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer st@@ ra@@ ight , and there was tr@@ ad@@ ing cont@@ act across that st@@ ra@@ ight thr@@ ough@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"@@ G@@ o back to this im@@ age again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse ?
"@@ N@@ o@@ body , liter@@ ally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of the computer m@@ ouse comp@@ any doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a comp@@ any .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dr@@ ill an o@@ il well to get o@@ il out to make pl@@ as@@ tic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by L@@ e@@ on@@ ard R@@ e@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wr@@ ote about how a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to m@@ ine grap@@ h@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ ali@@ zation , is we &apos;ve cre@@ ated the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ f@@ er ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d our cap@@ abili@@ ties ."
We &apos;ve g@@ one be@@ y@@ on@@ d the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interest@@ ed in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
"What &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant to a society is how well people are comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how c@@ le@@ ver the in@@ divi@@ du@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve cre@@ ated something called the coll@@ ec@@ tive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the ne@@ t@@ work .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ e@@ ting and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is cau@@ sing techno@@ logical progress , incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go for@@ ward , we will , of course , experience ter@@ ri@@ ble things ."
There will be war@@ s ; there will be depres@@ sions ; there will be natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m ab@@ solu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connec@@ tions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and ther@@ e@@ fore living st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d s@@ our@@ c@@ ing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve cre@@ ated , where not just the e@@ li@@ t@@ es but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ re@@ ly ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ating the r@@ ate of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ."
Thank you .

"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k b@@ illions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ orm@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ e@@ k@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ch@@ es on my right ey@@ e ."
And I beg@@ an the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of re@@ disc@@ over@@ ing the value of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I m@@ et with medic@@ al doc@@ tors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more insp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ v@@ olution , this new f@@ em@@ in@@ ist is@@ sue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ fort@@ un@@ ately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ li@@ ty sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having d@@ in@@ ner with a guy who br@@ ag@@ g@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I f@@ el@@ t like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I f@@ el@@ t like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this d@@ in@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ f@@ ast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a g@@ ame of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ illi@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ o@@ ken up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a pers@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de , effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disc@@ over the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disc@@ over the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .

"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minut@@ e about what this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
"@@ Here is this mass of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound mass of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space ."
It can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate itself cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ating on the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ aw@@ are@@ ness , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of neuro@@ logy , and ho@@ pe@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity em@@ er@@ g@@ es the whole spec@@ tru@@ m of abili@@ ties that we call human nature and human consciousness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ st@@ ained d@@ am@@ age to a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small re@@ gi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an acr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cogni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive l@@ oss of one fun@@ c@@ tion , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ ol@@ ved in me@@ di@@ ating that fun@@ c@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p fun@@ c@@ tion on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ c@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ pl@@ es of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ pl@@ es , six minutes each , d@@ uring this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the t@@ em@@ por@@ al lob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the t@@ em@@ por@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed , you can no longer recogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogni@@ ze them from their v@@ o@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , that &apos;s J@@ o@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogni@@ ze yourself in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it w@@ in@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well known as cau@@ sed by d@@ am@@ age to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phys@@ ici@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely norm@@ al , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely norm@@ al , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"S@@ he &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly l@@ uc@@ id and intellig@@ ent in all other resp@@ ec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ u@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ ument app@@ li@@ es to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little b@@ ab@@ y , a young b@@ ab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong se@@ x@@ u@@ al at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comple@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ g@@ es to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , d@@ am@@ aging the cor@@ te@@ x , al@@ lowing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ g@@ es to em@@ er@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally tur@@ ned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation that makes sense to your d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ ument ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , about his pe@@ t po@@ o@@ d@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality in all hum@@ ans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cur@@ i@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the struc@@ ture and fun@@ c@@ tions of the norm@@ al vi@@ su@@ al p@@ ath@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ N@@ orm@@ ally , vi@@ su@@ al si@@ gn@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vi@@ sion , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the mess@@ age goes to a small struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the mess@@ age cas@@ c@@ ad@@ es into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ g@@ es the emoti@@ onal si@@ gni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ solu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ in@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then cas@@ c@@ ad@@ e into the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mu@@ sc@@ ular ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s fort@@ un@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in re@@ sist@@ ance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minut@@ e .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s pro@@ cess@@ ed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a t@@ able , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the mess@@ age cas@@ c@@ ad@@ es into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is c@@ ut to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able l@@ ack of emoti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some stran@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and measure your gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a t@@ able or an um@@ b@@ rel@@ l@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about norm@@ al people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measure his gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ in@@ t , nothing happens , as in norm@@ al people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emoti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters is c@@ ut ."
"So his vi@@ sion is norm@@ al because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are norm@@ al , his emoti@@ ons are norm@@ al — he &apos;ll lau@@ gh , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vi@@ sion to emoti@@ ons is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , neur@@ al psy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the st@@ and@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a preci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in ter@@ ms of the known neur@@ al an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the ph@@ one , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ u@@ sion through the ph@@ one ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate p@@ ath@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the emoti@@ onal cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expl@@ ain@@ s why through the ph@@ one he recogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comple@@ x cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cur@@ i@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gre@@ ne , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ i@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ e@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ n@@ al vi@@ sc@@ er@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , in@@ clu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ str@@ u@@ al cr@@ am@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ a@@ i@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ oul@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the ph@@ one when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll w@@ ave go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"Th@@ ese are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ations ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not d@@ el@@ u@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the p@@ ain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ?"
It s@@ ounds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ ver@@ ed , was c@@ ut , by say , a m@@ ot@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ le ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the p@@ ain in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ t@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pain@@ s , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ i@@ ous cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ t@@ ation , and this p@@ ain then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , the brain sen@@ ds comm@@ ands to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ s@@ ation of a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body im@@ age and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , so you can reli@@ e@@ ve him of this ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be you can reli@@ e@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ tom p@@ ain , the ph@@ an@@ tom cr@@ am@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts m@@ illions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard bo@@ x with a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ achi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ing@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and the norm@@ al hand on the right side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the norm@@ al ar@@ m in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ gg@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al im@@ pres@@ sion that the ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again , and the p@@ ain , the cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your norm@@ al hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your norm@@ al hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my ph@@ an@@ tom is mo@@ ving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my p@@ ain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He cl@@ os@@ es his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your norm@@ al hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , op@@ en your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s mo@@ ving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a k@@ id in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started reali@@ zing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ ys@@ is that you see in neuro@@ logy , like st@@ ro@@ ke , fo@@ c@@ al d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his p@@ ain — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and pr@@ acti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ ay@@ be , after a per@@ i@@ od of pr@@ acti@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and start mo@@ ving your par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ e@@ ve yourself of p@@ ain . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ a@@ ke it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two wee@@ ks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s g@@ one . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s g@@ one ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r bo@@ x was g@@ one ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body im@@ age , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow p@@ ain , no cl@@ en@@ ch@@ ing , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ ar@@ m p@@ ain , all those pain@@ s are g@@ one away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ oul@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the desig@@ n and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory con@@ f@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vi@@ sion saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mu@@ sc@@ le si@@ gn@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ i@@ al — it g@@ ates the si@@ gn@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s , the b@@ on@@ us is , the p@@ ain dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ s because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died p@@ ain f@@ lo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ e has been tri@@ ed on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom p@@ ain , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tri@@ ed it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ bili@@ t@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you norm@@ ally think of as d@@ am@@ age to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also g@@ one through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ w@@ it@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the thir@@ d part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ i@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was disc@@ over@@ ed by F@@ r@@ anc@@ is G@@ al@@ t@@ on in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a c@@ ous@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely norm@@ al , had the fol@@ lowing p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is bl@@ ue , se@@ ven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely norm@@ al in other resp@@ ec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke col@@ or ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F sh@@ ar@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ t@@ on called it sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , a min@@ g@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ inc@@ t ."
Th@@ ese people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in fam@@ ili@@ es , so G@@ al@@ t@@ on said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the ma@@ in the@@ me of this l@@ ec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is eight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What cau@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the thir@@ d theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing between col@@ or and num@@ bers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cr@@ os@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
R@@ e@@ mem@@ ber I said it run@@ s in fam@@ ili@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ norm@@ al gen@@ e , a m@@ ut@@ ation in the gen@@ e that cau@@ ses this ab@@ norm@@ al cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain re@@ gi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other re@@ gi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ m@@ ed down to create the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ d@@ ular ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e cau@@ sing this tri@@ m@@ m@@ ing and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get de@@ f@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ m@@ ing between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical thinking , l@@ in@@ king se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lowing b@@ all of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"@@ N@@ orm@@ al people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ an@@ tly , you &apos;ve found the l@@ in@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ity to@@ wards me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ re@@ no@@ logical view of sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation — can I take one minut@@ e ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in den@@ i@@ al about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t . J@@ ust like your al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent shap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ i@@ k@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ k@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two m@@ ut@@ an@@ ts ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i ? R@@ a@@ ise your h@@ ands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a Mar@@ ti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ de@@ l sy@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ action , mean@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that sh@@ ar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ i@@ k@@ i , m@@ im@@ ics the vi@@ su@@ al in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , su@@ dd@@ en in@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of that j@@ ag@@ g@@ ed shap@@ e ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s t@@ elling you is your brain is eng@@ aging in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a si@@ l@@ ly ill@@ u@@ sion , but these ph@@ ot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this shap@@ e , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory patter@@ n , but the brain is able to extr@@ act the common den@@ om@@ in@@ at@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ str@@ action , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed , these people l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ i@@ k@@ i , but they also l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ li@@ t@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The pati@@ ent says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ iny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to measure its speci@@ fic gra@@ vity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical mean@@ ing ."
"So , this are@@ a is about eight times the size in high@@ er — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in hum@@ ans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ular g@@ y@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cr@@ os@@ s@@ ro@@ ads between hear@@ ing , vi@@ sion and tou@@ ch , and it bec@@ ame en@@ orm@@ ous in hum@@ ans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human abili@@ ties like ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that philosop@@ h@@ ers have been stud@@ ying for m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a , we scienti@@ sts can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stud@@ ying patients and as@@ king the right questions ."
