"When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ouse ."
"M@@ y father was li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C N@@ e@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ u@@ su@@ al then , because the news m@@ os@@ tly depres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I d@@ res@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der si@@ ster , who was no longer al@@ lowed to be outside al@@ one , to a sec@@ re@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different r@@ out@@ e so that no one would su@@ sp@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our bo@@ o@@ ks in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out sho@@ p@@ ping .
"The school was in a h@@ ouse , more than 100 of us p@@ ac@@ ked in one small living room ."
It was co@@ zy in w@@ in@@ ter but extre@@ me@@ ly ho@@ t in sum@@ m@@ er .
"We all knew we were ri@@ s@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly be canc@@ el@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being fol@@ lowed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ ared , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very l@@ uc@@ k@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and d@@ augh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ red .
My gr@@ and@@ father was an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary man for his time .
"A t@@ ot@@ al ma@@ ver@@ ick from a re@@ m@@ ote pro@@ v@@ ince of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , he in@@ si@@ sted that his d@@ aughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother bec@@ ame a teacher .
There she is .
"S@@ he re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ouse into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve an education , in@@ clu@@ ding his d@@ augh@@ ters , des@@ p@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , des@@ p@@ ite the ri@@ s@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was gre@@ ater ri@@ s@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ uring T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remember there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being sc@@ ared and not seeing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ist@@ en , my d@@ aughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ c@@ ed to leave your home d@@ uring a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ ma@@ in with you is what is here , and if we have to s@@ ell our b@@ loo@@ d to p@@ ay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in a country that has been dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by dec@@ ad@@ es of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ y@@ on@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them ."
"I@@ n@@ ste@@ ad , I st@@ and here a pr@@ ou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ i@@ dd@@ le@@ b@@ ury C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ tur@@ ned to A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , my gr@@ and@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ augh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me ."
"He not only br@@ ag@@ s about my colle@@ ge de@@ gre@@ e , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) My family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ ams even big@@ ger for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 1@@ 0@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ bi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing at op@@ port@@ unity .
"And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of d@@ au@@ n@@ ting op@@ posi@@ tion ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his d@@ aughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being k@@ ill@@ ed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the ph@@ one ran@@ g , a v@@ o@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he s@@ ent his d@@ aughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you w@@ ish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my d@@ aughter &apos;s future because of your old and bac@@ k@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to reali@@ ze about A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , and this is something that is often dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that be@@ h@@ ind most of us who suc@@ ce@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ z@@ es the value in his d@@ aughter and who se@@ es that her suc@@ cess is his suc@@ cess ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mo@@ thers are@@ n &apos;t k@@ ey in our suc@@ cess .
"In fact , they &apos;re often the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al and con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ g@@ oti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ augh@@ ters , but in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a society like in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , we must have the sup@@ port of men ."
"@@ Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remember , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an ."
( Applause ) A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the fr@@ ag@@ ili@@ ty in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ y@@ on@@ d the U.@@ S@@ . tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who enc@@ our@@ age them , I see a prom@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"T@@ o me , A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an is a country of hope and b@@ ound@@ less possi@@ bili@@ ties , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ J@@ ust ab@@ solu@@ tely ama@@ zing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ is@@ appe@@ ar@@ s right into the bac@@ k@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s bl@@ u@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it bac@@ k@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was se@@ ven years old , I saw my first public ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion ."
"If anything se@@ em@@ ed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pri@@ s@@ on@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really fort@@ un@@ ate to get out , many other N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ ans have not been so l@@ uc@@ k@@ y ."
"E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be tur@@ ned up@@ side down in an inst@@ ant ."
"We are all K@@ o@@ re@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , d@@ ue to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an or N@@ or@@ th K@@ o@@ re@@ an ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpri@@ sed that a t@@ ot@@ al stran@@ ger care@@ d enough to ask .
I reali@@ zed that this was a sym@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten to be a cir@@ c@@ le .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less cir@@ cul@@ ation on top of the ro@@ of .
"If you are a paren@@ t , you know that kids love to keep making cir@@ cl@@ es ."
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we desig@@ n this ?
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al of this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ si@@ sted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net s@@ tic@@ king out from the e@@ dge of the ro@@ of ?"
"So that it can cat@@ ch the children f@@ all@@ ing off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government off@@ ici@@ al said , &quot; O@@ f course you have to have a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il . &quot;"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ ping through .
And we were al@@ lowed to call this ro@@ pe as a h@@ and@@ ra@@ il .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times 40 children are around a t@@ ree .
"The bo@@ y on the br@@ an@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the t@@ ree so he is e@@ ating the t@@ ree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they s@@ it on the e@@ dge ."
It looks so n@@ ice from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ e@@ e@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g was@@ h@@ ing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to sp@@ r@@ ay water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite norm@@ al ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not was@@ h@@ ing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s pu@@ tting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten is completely op@@ en , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ ound@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ ound@@ ary between cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ous@@ tic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qu@@ i@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ ound@@ ary .
"And the prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to st@@ ay in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ c@@ le , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we consi@@ der no@@ ise very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ ise .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qu@@ i@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , these children show ama@@ zing con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation in cl@@ ass ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le with no@@ ise ."
They need no@@ ise .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y b@@ ar ."
You are not sup@@ posed to be in si@@ l@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely op@@ en ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in w@@ in@@ ter .
I@@ n sum@@ m@@ er you go s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
"And also , you should know that you are wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of ."
You never m@@ el@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are sup@@ posed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divi@@ de cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are sup@@ posed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cl@@ ass@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cl@@ ass@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to f@@ ish another mon@@ k@@ ey from abo@@ ve .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cl@@ ass@@ room has at le@@ ast one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ an@@ t@@ a C@@ lau@@ s comes down at the time of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shap@@ ed kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten ."
The building is only five me@@ ters t@@ all with se@@ ven f@@ lo@@ ors .
"And of course , the ce@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to consi@@ der sa@@ fe@@ ty .
"So , we put our children , a d@@ aughter and a son ."
They tri@@ ed to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s o@@ kay . H@@ is sk@@ ul@@ l is quite str@@ ong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to j@@ um@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am is aw@@ ful in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she nee@@ ds to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of d@@ an@@ ger ."
"And in this kind of oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of op@@ port@@ unity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this d@@ ra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the mov@@ ement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
And the cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence of this building is 18@@ 3 me@@ ters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 me@@ ters in the mor@@ ning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 me@@ ters on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est ath@@ le@@ tic abili@@ ties am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tr@@ ain them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
J@@ ust like sh@@ e@@ ep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep run@@ ning . ( Laughter )
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble sometimes ."
They need to get some in@@ j@@ ury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the att@@ emp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real chall@@ eng@@ es is to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate fundam@@ ent@@ ally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it ser@@ i@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to ple@@ ase rec@@ all a time when you really lo@@ ved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a s@@ ong or a book — and you re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I sp@@ ent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I te@@ ach high school mat@@ h ."
"I s@@ ell a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ c@@ ed by la@@ w to bu@@ y it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing pro@@ posi@@ tion ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an al@@ ge@@ bra@@ -@@ two fin@@ al ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 2@@ 5 percent p@@ ass r@@ ate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call mat@@ h education in the U.@@ S@@ . today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to bre@@ ak mat@@ h down into two cat@@ eg@@ ories ."
One is comp@@ ut@@ ation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ r@@ atic@@ s with lead@@ ing co@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents gre@@ ater than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ vi@@ ded you have a really str@@ ong gr@@ oun@@ ding in reas@@ on@@ ing . M@@ ath reas@@ on@@ ing — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ lic@@ ation of mat@@ h pro@@ cess@@ es to the world around us — this is hard to te@@ ach ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we te@@ ach it in the U.@@ S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to cl@@ ose with , why this is an ama@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h teacher ."
"So first , five sym@@ p@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing wrong in your cl@@ ass@@ room ."
One is a l@@ ack of in@@ i@@ ti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your l@@ ec@@ ture bloc@@ k and im@@ me@@ di@@ ately you have five h@@ ands going up as@@ king you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their des@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents l@@ ack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They l@@ ack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expl@@ ain@@ ing con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ul@@ a to app@@ ly in that sit@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ w@@ ood &quot; &quot; and other ama@@ zing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary dr@@ am@@ a , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it shap@@ es the neur@@ al p@@ ath@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an imp@@ ati@@ ence with ir@@ res@@ olution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re imp@@ ati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t res@@ ol@@ ve qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al bre@@ a@@ ks and a lau@@ gh tr@@ ack ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well@@ -@@ being when I te@@ ach this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — partic@@ ul@@ arly m@@ ass@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks — te@@ ach mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ally equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ w@@ o and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and call@@ ing it a day ."
( Laughter ) I@@ n all ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ li@@ es equ@@ ally to mat@@ h .
"@@ N@@ ot@@ ice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pi@@ ec@@ es of information there , each of which will fig@@ ure into a form@@ ul@@ a some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the stud@@ ent will then comp@@ ute ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to f@@ il@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suff@@ ici@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ str@@ ing@@ ing students because , wat@@ ch this , this is the pr@@ acti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out num@@ bers and tw@@ e@@ a@@ king the cont@@ ex@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the stud@@ ent still doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expl@@ ain@@ s to you what s@@ am@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the form@@ ul@@ a ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , p@@ ass this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ o@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ f@@ ically in mat@@ h .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cur@@ i@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ par@@ ate l@@ ay@@ ers and , partic@@ ul@@ arly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ en@@ ted to the stud@@ ent all at once , how that cre@@ ates this imp@@ ati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ fine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al struc@@ ture , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , l@@ ab@@ els , poin@@ ts , ax@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ ste@@ ps , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ p@@ est ."
So I hope you can see .
"I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ elling question , a comp@@ elling answer , but we &apos;re p@@ a@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , st@@ ra@@ ight pat@@ h from one to the other and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can ste@@ p over the small cr@@ ac@@ ks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ par@@ ate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in ter@@ ms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ me@@ di@@ ately ask the question : Wh@@ ich sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ p@@ est ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ vers@@ ation because the vi@@ su@@ al is cre@@ ated in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people ar@@ gu@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in p@@ a@@ ir@@ s , j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ing , wh@@ at@@ ever ."
And then even@@ tually we reali@@ ze it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lo@@ wer le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just abo@@ ve the m@@ id line .
"And we reali@@ ze how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D l@@ ab@@ els to talk about them more eas@@ ily ."
"And then as we start to de@@ fine what does ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness mean , we reali@@ ze it would be n@@ ice to have some meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments to really n@@ ar@@ row it down , speci@@ f@@ ically what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al struc@@ ture ."
"The mat@@ h ser@@ ves the con@@ vers@@ ation , the con@@ vers@@ ation doesn &apos;t ser@@ ve the mat@@ h ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cl@@ ass@@ es are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ ste@@ ps together ."
"D@@ o you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , comp@@ ared to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my pr@@ acti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll y@@ i@@ el@@ d the f@@ lo@@ or here for a second to E@@ inste@@ in , who , I believe , has p@@ a@@ id his du@@ es ."
"He tal@@ ked about the form@@ ulation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my pr@@ acti@@ ce , in the U.@@ S@@ . here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the form@@ ulation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ elling el@@ em@@ ents of problems like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that sup@@ por@@ ts mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ ir@@ st things first , we e@@ li@@ min@@ ate all the sub@@ ste@@ ps ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to form@@ ul@@ ate those ."
And then not@@ ice that all the information wr@@ it@@ ten on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"@@ N@@ one of it &apos;s a di@@ str@@ ac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ o@@ es the side of it matter ?"
D@@ o@@ es the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ en@@ ted question in mat@@ h cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own ter@@ ms , not in ter@@ ms of line art or c@@ li@@ p art that you so often see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ ks , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a vide@@ o , a vide@@ o of someone f@@ ill@@ ing it up ."
"And it &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ing up s@@ low@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ i@@ z@@ ing@@ ly s@@ low@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ch@@ es , ro@@ l@@ ling their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ a@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the in@@ tr@@ o , I te@@ ach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I te@@ ach the kids that are the most re@@ me@@ di@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ vers@@ ation about mat@@ h because someone else has the form@@ ul@@ a ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the form@@ ul@@ a better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every stud@@ ent is on a level play@@ ing field of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s f@@ ill@@ ed something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ w@@ ering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ them@@ atic@@ ally and con@@ vers@@ ati@@ on@@ ally in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ in@@ ing the con@@ vers@@ ation ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ard , att@@ ach them to gu@@ ess@@ es , and kids have b@@ ought in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer k@@ ey in the back of the teacher &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion ."
"We , instead , just wat@@ ch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical mo@@ d@@ els that always work out in the answer k@@ ey in the back of a teacher &apos;s e@@ di@@ tion , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about s@@ our@@ ces of er@@ ro@@ r when the the@@ o@@ re@@ tical does not mat@@ ch up with the pr@@ ac@@ tical ."
"But those con@@ vers@@ ations have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ port some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these vir@@ us@@ es day one of the cl@@ ass .
"Th@@ ese are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ard , t@@ ot@@ ally new , t@@ ot@@ ally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ vers@@ ation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ ver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by mat@@ h , because we &apos;re s@@ low@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what mat@@ h is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I enc@@ our@@ age mat@@ h teachers I talk to to use m@@ ul@@ ti@@ me@@ dia , because it br@@ ings the real world into your cl@@ ass@@ room in high res@@ olution and ful@@ l col@@ or ; to enc@@ our@@ age stud@@ ent in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion for that level play@@ ing field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fic questions come out in con@@ vers@@ ation ; to let students build the problem , because E@@ inste@@ in said so ; and to fin@@ ally , in t@@ ot@@ al , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and mat@@ h reas@@ on@@ ing , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an ama@@ zing time to be a mat@@ h teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um in our front po@@ c@@ k@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fa@@ ir@@ ly che@@ ap , and the to@@ ols to dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ te it f@@ re@@ ely under op@@ en lic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a vide@@ o ser@@ ies on my b@@ lo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two wee@@ ks ."
"I get e@@ ma@@ il@@ s still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ s@@ ited saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , ye@@ ah . We had a good con@@ vers@@ ation about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow ."
"I put this problem on my b@@ lo@@ g rec@@ ently : I@@ n a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the l@@ ine@@ ar mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing inv@@ ol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my cl@@ ass@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; G@@ ood M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few wee@@ ks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really h@@ un@@ gr@@ y for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary for your own in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
"So I just really enc@@ our@@ age you , wh@@ at@@ ever your sta@@ ke is in education — whether you &apos;re a stud@@ ent , paren@@ t , teacher , po@@ lic@@ y ma@@ ker , wh@@ at@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better mat@@ h cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
"And un@@ less you &apos;ve been on Mar@@ s rec@@ ently , you know there &apos;s a lot of that out there ."
"But let &apos;s face it , there &apos;s a lot of b@@ un@@ k ."
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
"I br@@ ought this with me , this was given to us by N@@ B@@ C D@@ at@@ el@@ ine to test ."
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o C@@ or@@ por@@ ation of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
It &apos;s called the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ r@@ o 2@@ 000 D@@ ow@@ s@@ er R@@ od .
( Laughter ) This was being so@@ ld to high@@ -@@ school ad@@ min@@ i@@ str@@ at@@ ors for $ 9@@ 00 ap@@ i@@ ece .
It &apos;s a piece of pl@@ as@@ tic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ h@@ ack an@@ ten@@ n@@ a att@@ ach@@ ed to it .
So it looks something like this .
I &apos;ll show you .
"( Laughter ) Well , it has kind of a ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ le@@ an@@ ing bi@@ as ."
"Well , this is science , so we &apos;ll do a contro@@ l@@ led experiment ."
It &apos;ll go this way for sure .
"( Laughter ) S@@ ir , do you want to emp@@ ty your po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts , ple@@ ase , si@@ r ? ( Laughter )"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in science , we have to keep tr@@ ack of the mis@@ ses , not just the h@@ its ."
"And that &apos;s probably the k@@ ey l@@ es@@ son to my sh@@ ort talk here : This is how psy@@ ch@@ ics work , ast@@ ro@@ log@@ ers , t@@ ar@@ ot c@@ ard read@@ ers and so on ."
People remember the h@@ its and for@@ get the mis@@ ses .
"In this case , we te@@ sted it ."
"We had two op@@ a@@ qu@@ e bo@@ x@@ es : one with govern@@ m@@ ent@@ -@@ appro@@ ved T@@ H@@ C mar@@ i@@ ju@@ an@@ a , and one with nothing ."
And it got it 50 percent of the time — ( Laughter ) which is exactly what you &apos;d exp@@ ect with a co@@ in@@ -@@ f@@ li@@ p mo@@ de@@ l .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ p@@ tic &quot; &quot; is the qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly pub@@ lic@@ ation . E@@ ach one has a particular the@@ me .
This one is on the future of intelligence .
A@@ re people getting smar@@ ter or d@@ um@@ ber ?
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"W@@ ith science , don &apos;t think of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tici@@ s@@ m as a thing , or science as a thing ."
A@@ re science and religi@@ on comp@@ ati@@ ble ?
"It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ b@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?"
S@@ ci@@ ence is not a thing . It &apos;s a ver@@ b .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
It &apos;s a way of looking for natural ex@@ plan@@ ations for all ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a .
"B@@ e@@ fore we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it &apos;s not in this world ."
( Laughter ) The same the@@ me is ex@@ pres@@ sed n@@ ic@@ ely here in this S@@ i@@ d@@ ne@@ y H@@ ar@@ r@@ is car@@ to@@ on .
"For those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; &quot; Th@@ en a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le oc@@ cur@@ s ."
I think you need to be more exp@@ lic@@ it here in ste@@ p two . &quot; &quot; This single sli@@ de completely dis@@ man@@ t@@ les the intellig@@ ent desig@@ n ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents .
There &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
There &apos;s nothing to test .
It &apos;s the end of the con@@ vers@@ ation for intellig@@ ent desig@@ n cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ists .
It &apos;s the beginning of the cau@@ s@@ al cha@@ in for science .
"For intellig@@ ent desig@@ n cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ists , it &apos;s the end of the cha@@ in ."
"So again , we can ask this : what &apos;s more likely ?"
"A@@ re U@@ F@@ O@@ s ali@@ en sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , or per@@ cep@@ tual cogni@@ tive mi@@ sta@@ kes , or even fa@@ kes ?"
"This is a U@@ F@@ O sho@@ t from my h@@ ouse in A@@ l@@ ta@@ den@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , looking down over P@@ as@@ ad@@ en@@ a ."
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ ick hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap , it &apos;s because it is ."
"You don &apos;t even need P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ ho@@ p or high@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment , you don &apos;t need compu@@ ters ."
This was sho@@ t with a th@@ ro@@ wa@@ way K@@ o@@ d@@ ak In@@ st@@ am@@ atic cam@@ er@@ a .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap ready to go .
C@@ am@@ er@@ a &apos;s ready — that &apos;s it .
"( Laughter ) So , al@@ though it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fa@@ ke or ill@@ u@@ sions or so on , and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fa@@ ke , like the c@@ ro@@ p cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"In the case of G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he tur@@ ned his tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , there was no theory of plan@@ et@@ ary r@@ ings ."
So he wr@@ ote that he had seen — &quot; I have ob@@ ser@@ ved that the f@@ ur@@ the@@ st planet has three bo@@ dies . &quot;
And this is what he en@@ ded up con@@ clu@@ ding that he saw .
"So without a theory of plan@@ et@@ ary r@@ ings and with only gra@@ iny data , you can &apos;t have a good theory ."
It wasn &apos;t sol@@ ved until 1@@ 6@@ 5@@ 5 .
"And we see the ang@@ les of the r@@ ings at different ang@@ les , there ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
"So one of the problems of expl@@ ain@@ ing why people believe we@@ ir@@ d things is that we have things , on a simple level , and then I &apos;ll go to more ser@@ i@@ ous ones ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke , we have a ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y to see fac@@ es ."
"In 19@@ 7@@ 6 , where there was a whole mov@@ ement to get N@@ A@@ S@@ A to ph@@ ot@@ o@@ grap@@ h that are@@ a because people thought this was mon@@ um@@ ental ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture made by Mar@@ ti@@ ans ."
Here &apos;s the cl@@ os@@ e-@@ up of it from 200@@ 1 .
"If you s@@ qu@@ in@@ t , you can still see the face ."
"And when you &apos;re s@@ qu@@ in@@ ting , you &apos;re tur@@ ning that from fin@@ e-@@ gra@@ in to co@@ ar@@ se@@ -@@ gra@@ in , so you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the qu@@ ality of your data ."
"You see the happy face on Mar@@ s , there ."
"( Laughter ) If astron@@ om@@ ers were f@@ ro@@ gs , perhaps they &apos;d see K@@ er@@ m@@ it the F@@ ro@@ g ."
R@@ e@@ li@@ gi@@ ous ic@@ on@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y .
( Laughter ) D@@ is@@ co@@ ver@@ ed by a T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see b@@ a@@ ker in 19@@ 9@@ 6 .
He char@@ g@@ ed five b@@ uc@@ ks a head to come see the n@@ u@@ n bu@@ n ti@@ ll he got a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ des@@ ist from M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a &apos;s la@@ w@@ y@@ er .

"T@@ ree bar@@ k is partic@@ ul@@ arly good because it &apos;s n@@ ice and gra@@ iny , br@@ an@@ ch@@ y , bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white s@@ pl@@ ot@@ ch@@ y and you can get the patter@@ n@@ -@@ see@@ king — hum@@ ans are patter@@ n@@ -@@ see@@ king anim@@ als ."

"( Laughter ) This cas@@ in@@ o p@@ a@@ id $ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 on e@@ B@@ ay for the che@@ ese s@@ and@@ w@@ ich . ( Laughter )"
But who does it really look like ? The V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary ? ( Laughter )
"It has that sort of p@@ uc@@ k@@ er@@ ed li@@ ps , 19@@ 4@@ 0@@ s@@ -@@ er@@ a look ."
"@@ V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary in C@@ lear@@ water , F@@ l@@ ori@@ d@@ a ."
There was a lot of people there .
"The fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful come in their whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ s and c@@ ru@@ t@@ ch@@ es , and so on ."
We went down and inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated .
"@@ J@@ ust to give you a size , that &apos;s D@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , me and The A@@ ma@@ zing R@@ and@@ i , next to this two , two and a half st@@ or@@ y-@@ si@@ zed im@@ age ."

"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the bac@@ k@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
I gu@@ ess you can only have one m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le per building .
"( Laughter ) So is it really a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of M@@ ary , or is it a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of Mar@@ ge ? ( Laughter )"
"And now I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with another example of this , with au@@ d@@ it@@ ory ill@@ u@@ sions ."
"( Laughter ) I@@ n this case , sup@@ pos@@ e@@ dly , these mess@@ ages are hi@@ dd@@ en in electr@@ on@@ ic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a ."
There &apos;s a R@@ e@@ ver@@ se@@ S@@ pe@@ ech@@ .@@ co@@ m we@@ b p@@ age where I do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed this stuff .
This is the most fam@@ ous one of all of these .
Here &apos;s the for@@ ward ver@@ sion of the very fam@@ ous s@@ ong .
( M@@ u@@ sic ends ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t you just li@@ st@@ en to that all day ?
"A@@ ll right , here it is bac@@ k@@ wards , and see if you can hear the hi@@ dd@@ en mess@@ ages that are sup@@ pos@@ e@@ dly in there ."
( M@@ u@@ sic with un@@ int@@ elli@@ gi@@ ble l@@ y@@ r@@ ics ) ( L@@ y@@ r@@ ics ) S@@ at@@ an !
( M@@ u@@ sic with l@@ y@@ r@@ ics ) ( M@@ u@@ sic ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You can &apos;t mis@@ s it when I tell you what &apos;s there . ( Laughter )
"I &apos;m going to just end with a posi@@ tive , n@@ ice little story ."
The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tics is a n@@ on@@ prof@@ it educ@@ ational organi@@ zation .
We &apos;re always looking for little good things that people do .
"One of the top pop@@ ular sing@@ ers in Eng@@ land today , K@@ ati@@ e M@@ el@@ u@@ a ."
And she wr@@ ote a beautiful s@@ ong .
And she has this one p@@ ass@@ age here .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( L@@ y@@ r@@ ics ) We are 12 billion ligh@@ t-@@ years from the e@@ dge That &apos;s a gu@@ ess , No one can ever say it &apos;s true , But I know that I will always be with you ."
"M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ her@@ m@@ er : Well , that &apos;s n@@ ice . A@@ t le@@ ast she got it cl@@ ose ."
"You know , it &apos;s 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion light years , and it &apos;s not a gu@@ ess ."
We know within preci@@ se er@@ ro@@ r bar@@ s how cl@@ ose it is .
"So we can say , al@@ though not ab@@ solu@@ tely true , it &apos;s pretty cl@@ ose to being true ."
So I will end with the new ver@@ sion .
( M@@ u@@ sic with l@@ y@@ r@@ ics ) We are 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 billion light years from the e@@ dge of the ob@@ serv@@ able universe .
That &apos;s a good es@@ tim@@ ate with well@@ -@@ defin@@ ed er@@ ro@@ r bar@@ s .
"And with the av@@ a@@ il@@ able information , I predic@@ t that I will always be with you ."
( Laughter ) How co@@ ol is that ?
( Applause )
Thank you .
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , I st@@ ood on the TED st@@ age in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ a ."
I sp@@ o@@ ke very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly about one of my pr@@ ou@@ d@@ est cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an In@@ ter@@ net .
"O@@ n the st@@ age that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"M@@ y English l@@ ost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have se@@ ven children in my family .
"A@@ ll sist@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disc@@ over@@ ed the won@@ d@@ ers of science , I was just a simple f@@ ar@@ m@@ er in a country of po@@ or f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers ."
"@@ L@@ i@@ ke everyone else , we gre@@ w ma@@ i@@ ze ."
One year our fort@@ un@@ e tur@@ ned very bad .
I@@ n 200@@ 1 we experienc@@ ed an aw@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in five months all M@@ al@@ a@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to death .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at night ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ sim@@ a for each one of us .
The food p@@ ass@@ es through our bo@@ dies .
We dro@@ p down to nothing .
"In M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , the secon@@ d@@ ary school , you have to p@@ ay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the h@@ un@@ ger , I was for@@ c@@ ed to dro@@ p out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I f@@ el@@ t very happy to be at the secon@@ d@@ ary school , so I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ br@@ ary .
"I read bo@@ o@@ ks , science bo@@ o@@ ks , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally physics ."
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ r@@ ams and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that knowledge in my h@@ ands .
It said a w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ill could p@@ um@@ p water and gener@@ ate electr@@ ic@@ ity .
"@@ P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against h@@ un@@ ger , which we were experienc@@ ing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one w@@ in@@ d@@ m@@ ill for my@@ self .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ard where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , in@@ clu@@ ding my mother , said I was crazy ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tr@@ ac@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le f@@ ra@@ me and an old b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four ligh@@ ts , with s@@ w@@ it@@ ch@@ es , and even a cir@@ cu@@ it bre@@ a@@ ker , mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed after an elec@@ tri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine p@@ um@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ u@@ e@@ ues of people start l@@ in@@ ing up at my h@@ ouse ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ one .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ por@@ ters came too , which le@@ ad to b@@ log@@ g@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ p@@ t in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on st@@ age that day in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , my English l@@ ost , I said something like , &quot; I tri@@ ed . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fr@@ ic@@ ans , and the po@@ or who are str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with your dre@@ ams ."
G@@ od bl@@ ess .
M@@ ay@@ be one day you will wat@@ ch this on the In@@ ter@@ net .
"I say to you , tr@@ ust yourself and believe ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
We re@@ tain just 2@@ 5 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ ounds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my p@@ assion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to spe@@ ak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of mor@@ ality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science off@@ ici@@ ally has no op@@ in@@ i@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stitu@@ t@@ es a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ gu@@ e that this is an ill@@ u@@ sion — that the se@@ par@@ ation between science and human val@@ ues is an ill@@ u@@ sion — and actually quite a d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a f@@ ound@@ ation for mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues seem to b@@ el@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es ."
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ th@@ ical ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ c@@ ks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel comp@@ assion for ro@@ c@@ ks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ c@@ ks can suff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our f@@ el@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ sec@@ ts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ posed to a gre@@ ater ran@@ ge of p@@ ot@@ ential happiness and suff@@ ering ."
"Now , the cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al thing to not@@ ice here is that this is a fac@@ tual cl@@ a@@ i@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comple@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bili@@ ties of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ sec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no n@@ oti@@ on , no ver@@ sion of human mor@@ ality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ duc@@ i@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about consci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ tim@@ ately rel@@ ate to condi@@ tions after death — e@@ ither to an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of suff@@ ering in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about consciousness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after death is itself a fac@@ tual cl@@ a@@ i@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to spe@@ ak about the condi@@ tions of well@@ -@@ being in this life , for human be@@ ings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fa@@ il@@ ed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mo@@ thers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where str@@ ang@@ ers cannot find the bas@@ is for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , where people are m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed in@@ disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more i@@ d@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding cho@@ l@@ er@@ a to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ me@@ di@@ ately bl@@ ame their ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human comm@@ uni@@ ties fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic syst@@ ems and political ar@@ ran@@ g@@ em@@ ents ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well@@ -@@ being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is reali@@ zed in the brain — wh@@ at@@ ever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber does get 7@@ 2 vir@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his pers@@ on@@ ality — his rather un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate pers@@ on@@ ality — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore wh@@ at@@ ever cul@@ tur@@ al vari@@ ation there is in how human be@@ ings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at le@@ ast in prin@@ ci@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a mat@@ uring science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , psycho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m ar@@ gu@@ ing is that value &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the consci@@ ous experience of consci@@ ous be@@ ings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ ali@@ ze a space of possible changes in the experience of these be@@ ings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , with pe@@ a@@ ks and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differ@@ ences in the well@@ -@@ being of consci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both pers@@ onal and coll@@ ec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to not@@ ice is that perhaps there are st@@ ates of human well@@ -@@ being that we ra@@ re@@ ly ac@@ cess , that few people ac@@ cess ."
And these a@@ wa@@ it our disc@@ o@@ very .
P@@ er@@ haps some of these st@@ ates can be appro@@ pri@@ ately called m@@ ys@@ tical or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al .
P@@ er@@ haps there are other st@@ ates that we can &apos;t ac@@ cess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tu@@ red but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could ac@@ cess them .
"Now , let me be c@@ lear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to ma@@ p this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fic ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for inst@@ ance , that you will one day con@@ s@@ ult a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ r@@ an &apos;s n@@ uc@@ lear fac@@ ili@@ ties , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the ful@@ l c@@ ost of TED as a business exp@@ en@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human well@@ -@@ being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this — just ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how hum@@ ans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For inst@@ ance , there are 2@@ 1 st@@ ates in our country where cor@@ por@@ al p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the cl@@ ass@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a w@@ oo@@ d@@ en bo@@ ard , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large br@@ u@@ is@@ es and b@@ li@@ st@@ ers and even bre@@ a@@ king the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The loc@@ ations of these en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts , I think , will fa@@ il to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the r@@ ati@@ on@@ ale for this behavior is exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we sp@@ o@@ il the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , to sub@@ ject children to p@@ ain and violence and public hum@@ ili@@ ation as a way of enc@@ our@@ aging health@@ y emoti@@ onal develop@@ ment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the n@@ oti@@ on of well@@ -@@ being is tru@@ ly un@@ defin@@ ed , and se@@ em@@ ing@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually op@@ en to be re@@ -@@ con@@ str@@ u@@ ed ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive n@@ oti@@ on of well@@ -@@ being ?"
"Well , consi@@ der by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this st@@ at@@ ue was car@@ ved the average life exp@@ ec@@ t@@ anc@@ y was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the develop@@ ed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be consi@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ability .
People will s@@ end you d@@ on@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condi@@ tion .
"( Laughter ) N@@ ot@@ ice that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is op@@ en , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely op@@ en for re@@ vi@@ sion , does not make it v@@ ac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between a health@@ y person and a de@@ ad one is about as c@@ lear and con@@ se@@ qu@@ ential as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to not@@ ice is there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e : There may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ways to organi@@ ze a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ jec@@ tive mor@@ ality ?"
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be t@@ emp@@ ted to ar@@ gu@@ e to you that there must be one right food to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a ran@@ ge of materi@@ als that con@@ stitu@@ te health@@ y food .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less a c@@ lear dist@@ inc@@ tion between food and po@@ is@@ on .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not t@@ emp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human n@@ u@@ tri@@ tion ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univers@@ al mor@@ ality would requ@@ ire moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ m@@ it of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for inst@@ ance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the g@@ ame of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a prin@@ ci@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ u@@ een , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ u@@ een is a br@@ illi@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a dom@@ ain of per@@ f@@ ect ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this br@@ ings us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sp@@ here ."
Con@@ si@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ dies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the posi@@ tion , gener@@ ally spe@@ a@@ king , of our int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual comm@@ unity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ t@@ on or P@@ al@@ o A@@ l@@ to , who are we to say that the pr@@ ou@@ d den@@ i@@ z@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and d@@ augh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with l@@ eng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row b@@ at@@ ter@@ y ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pre@@ t@@ end that we know so little about human well@@ -@@ being that we have to be n@@ on@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a pr@@ acti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary w@@ ear@@ ing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to we@@ ar wh@@ at@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary mean in a comm@@ unity where , when a gir@@ l gets r@@ ap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first imp@@ ul@@ se , rather often , is to m@@ ur@@ der her out of s@@ ha@@ me ?"
"@@ J@@ ust let that fact de@@ t@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minut@@ e : Y@@ our d@@ aughter gets r@@ ap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a pe@@ ak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the per@@ f@@ ect solu@@ tion in our own society ."
"For inst@@ ance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civi@@ li@@ zed world ."
"Now , gr@@ an@@ ted , for many men it may requ@@ ire a de@@ gre@@ e in philosop@@ h@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the per@@ f@@ ect ex@@ pres@@ sion of psycho@@ logical bal@@ ance with resp@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like y@@ ou@@ th and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ dies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ tim@@ al environ@@ ment in which to ra@@ ise our children ?"
"@@ P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ haps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ a@@ ks on the moral l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e ."
But the thing to not@@ ice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a pe@@ ak .
"Now the ir@@ on@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are religi@@ ous de@@ mag@@ o@@ gu@@ es of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a v@@ o@@ ice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent anal@@ ys@@ is of the cau@@ ses and condi@@ tion of human and anim@@ al well@@ -@@ being ."
"In fact , the en@@ d@@ ur@@ ance of religi@@ on as a l@@ ens through which most people view moral questions has se@@ par@@ ated most moral talk from real questions of human and anim@@ al suff@@ ering ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like g@@ ay marri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or n@@ uc@@ lear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ ge@@ ly con@@ se@@ qu@@ ential is@@ sue .
But the de@@ mag@@ o@@ gu@@ es are right about one thing : We need a univers@@ al con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what st@@ ands in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to not@@ ice is that we do something different when talking about mor@@ ality — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally sec@@ ular , ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ c , scienti@@ st typ@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about mor@@ ality we value differ@@ ences of op@@ in@@ i@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for inst@@ ance the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a gets up every mor@@ ning me@@ d@@ it@@ ating on comp@@ assion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human be@@ ings is an in@@ te@@ gr@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and r@@ ap@@ ing and t@@ or@@ tur@@ ing and k@@ ill@@ ing young women ."
"So , we appe@@ ar to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ in@@ i@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ est@@ er@@ n int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ als look at this sit@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real ar@@ g@@ ument that p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ally f@@ all@@ s within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He li@@ kes cho@@ col@@ ate , he li@@ kes v@@ an@@ ill@@ a ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ ot@@ ice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a str@@ ing the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the smar@@ test phys@@ ici@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test phys@@ ici@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ it@@ ten ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I sho@@ wed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small sc@@ ale .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a phys@@ ici@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand str@@ ing theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of str@@ ing theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to b@@ el@@ ong to any str@@ ing theory clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ in@@ i@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a dom@@ ain of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for knowledge to coun@@ t .
"@@ How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed ourselves that in the moral sp@@ here there is no such thing as moral exper@@ ti@@ se , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral gen@@ i@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ in@@ i@@ on has to coun@@ t ? How have we con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ o@@ es the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th consi@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well@@ -@@ being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world nee@@ ds now ."
"It nee@@ ds people like ourselves to ad@@ m@@ it that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ing , and mor@@ ality rel@@ ates to that dom@@ ain of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for in@@ divi@@ du@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ f@@ s and des@@ i@@ res that reli@@ ably le@@ ad to nee@@ d@@ less human suff@@ ering ."
J@@ ust ad@@ m@@ it@@ ting this will trans@@ form our disc@@ our@@ se about mor@@ ality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between n@@ ations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world f@@ ill@@ ed with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ en@@ ted ; it will always be eas@@ ier to bre@@ ak things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more resp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in n@@ oti@@ ons of human well@@ -@@ being than we can resp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ ast differ@@ ences in the n@@ oti@@ ons about how disease sp@@ re@@ ads , or in the sa@@ fe@@ ty st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of buil@@ d@@ ings and a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ m@@ it that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is A@@ n@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble material there ."
"Wh@@ e@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ r@@ age thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women d@@ res@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ o@@ ken with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ation of f@@ em@@ ale speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a res@@ ult of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is ar@@ gu@@ ably a s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated psycho@@ logical view — &quot; that m@@ ale l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ sted . &quot;"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ r@@ is : Y@@ eah , well I think I tri@@ ed to bro@@ ach this in a s@@ ent@@ ence , wat@@ ch@@ ing the c@@ loc@@ k tic@@ king , but the question is : What is v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary in a cont@@ ex@@ t where men have certain exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to we@@ ar a ve@@ il , or a very fun@@ n@@ y h@@ at , or t@@ at@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ar@@ ily do wh@@ at@@ ever we want , but we have to be h@@ on@@ est about the con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts that these women are plac@@ ed under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ag@@ er to always take their word for it , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a ful@@ l bur@@ q@@ a ."
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ si@@ onal , where we all have to think the same ."
"@@ P@@ ain@@ t your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ loc@@ k 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ anc@@ ing moral progress with r@@ ic@@ h@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ m@@ it that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important deta@@ il , then you have to ad@@ m@@ it that we are going to understand all of the posi@@ tive and ne@@ g@@ ative qu@@ ali@@ ties of ourselves in much gre@@ ater deta@@ il ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand posi@@ tive social emoti@@ on like emp@@ ath@@ y and comp@@ assion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that enc@@ our@@ age it — whether they &apos;re gen@@ e@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic syst@@ ems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ ab@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my d@@ aughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and well@@ -@@ educ@@ ated in the cont@@ ex@@ t of men who do des@@ ire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ ol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ augh@@ ters just as much in these syst@@ ems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the res@@ ults come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ p@@ ared to shi@@ ft your inst@@ inc@@ tive curren@@ t ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these is@@ su@@ es ?"
"S@@ H : Well ye@@ ah , mo@@ d@@ ul@@ o one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the cont@@ ex@@ t of a tru@@ ly d@@ el@@ u@@ si@@ onal belie@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my g@@ ay son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end , I cho@@ p@@ ped his head off . And that was the most comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts ali@@ g@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the emoti@@ on of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well@@ -@@ being in a lar@@ ger cont@@ ex@@ t ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then b@@ lowing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ vers@@ ation I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : R@@ e@@ ally an h@@ on@@ or . Thank you .

"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ d@@ ress ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ i@@ str@@ ic@@ t E@@ ight ."
"There &apos;s B@@ loc@@ k 1@@ 7 , h@@ ouse number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but wal@@ king around the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I not@@ ic@@ ed that the h@@ ouse num@@ bers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do .

The first h@@ ouse ever built on a bloc@@ k is h@@ ouse number one .
The second h@@ ouse ever built is h@@ ouse number two .
"Th@@ ir@@ d is h@@ ouse number three . It &apos;s easy .

"( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that wh@@ at@@ ever true thing you can say about India , the op@@ pos@@ ite is also true ."
