"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ ar@@ ly a billion people on this planet that activ@@ ely use social net@@ working sit@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"W@@ hi@@ le that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations that are wor@@ th ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ tho@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ er@@ ek K@@ . M@@ il@@ ler , who was a science and technology jour@@ na@@ list who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ il@@ ler did was have his family and friends write a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ or@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wr@@ ote in star@@ ting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my blo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ pa@@ red messa@@ ge I wr@@ ote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ site to an ar@@ chi@@ ve . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ na@@ list , M@@ il@@ ler &apos;s ar@@ chi@@ ve may have been better writ@@ ten and more care@@ fully cu@@ rated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an ar@@ chi@@ ve that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous generation ."
C@@ on@@ si@@ der a few sta@@ ts for a moment .
Ri@@ ght now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single min@@ ute .
There are 200 million T@@ we@@ ets being pos@@ ted every day .
And the average F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 90 piec@@ es of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some phot@@ os or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly ri@@ ch dig@@ ital ar@@ chi@@ ve that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing opportun@@ ities for technologi@@ sts .
"Now to be clear , I &apos;m a jour@@ na@@ list and not a technologi@@ st , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ ef@@ ly is pa@@ int a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some ser@@ vices that are desig@@ ned to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social media ac@@ count@@ s after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ ti@@ ng@@ ly enough , found me when I chec@@ ked into a d@@ eli at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ s@@ qu@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ st@@ row : H@@ ell@@ o .
D@@ e@@ ath : A@@ da@@ m ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : D@@ e@@ ath can cat@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
D@@ e@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
"( Laughter ) A@@ da@@ m O@@ st@@ row : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that ser@@ vice does , quite simply , is let you create a messa@@ ge or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther ser@@ vice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ ories ."
"And what this l@@ ets you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ b@@ ute to your lo@@ ved ones , complet@@ e with phot@@ os and vide@@ os and stories that they can p@@ ost after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably fami@@ li@@ ar with D@@ e@@ b R@@ oy who , back in Mar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ st@@ rated how he was able to anal@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as ma@@ chin@@ es &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast am@@ ou@@ nt@@ s of data contin@@ ues to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to anal@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ we@@ ets , the phot@@ os , the vide@@ os , the blo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such ma@@ ssive numbers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our dig@@ ital perso@@ na@@ s to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone than@@ ks to the v@@ ast@@ ness of the amount of cont@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already star@@ ting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One ser@@ vice called My N@@ ext T@@ we@@ et anal@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some predic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our techni@@ cal cap@@ abil@@ ities impro@@ ve ."
"T@@ ak@@ ing it a step fu@@ r@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media lab is working on ro@@ bot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those ro@@ bot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ que cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of a speci@@ fic person based on the hundreds of thousands of piec@@ es of cont@@ ent that person pro@@ du@@ ces in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"Fi@@ nally , think back to this f@@ am@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gram of hi@@ p h@@ op arti@@ st wil@@ l@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same ty@@ pe of technology to be@@ am a re@@ pre@@ sen@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ oms — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ f@@ eli@@ ke way based on all the cont@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and ex@@ pon@@ entially .
"Now in clos@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ ition of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

P@@ eople re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak : I call them rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"These are people who have taken care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s for el@@ der care , for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , pur@@ su@@ ing a personal inter@@ est or a personal health is@@ sue ."
"C@@ los@@ ely rela@@ ted are care@@ er trans@@ iti@@ on@@ ers of all kinds : v@@ et@@ er@@ ans , mi@@ lit@@ ary sp@@ ou@@ ses , re@@ ti@@ re@@ es coming out of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ating ex@@ pat@@ s ."
Re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak is hard because of a dis@@ conn@@ ect between the em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers and the rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"E@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers can view hi@@ ring people with a g@@ ap on their re@@ su@@ me as a high@@ -@@ risk prop@@ os@@ ition , and individu@@ als on care@@ er bre@@ ak can have d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts about their abil@@ ities to rela@@ un@@ ch their care@@ ers , e@@ specially if they &apos;ve been out for a long time ."
This dis@@ conn@@ ect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
"Now , succe@@ ss@@ ful rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are every@@ where and in every field ."
This is S@@ am@@ i K@@ af@@ al@@ a .
He &apos;s a nu@@ clear physi@@ ci@@ st in the U@@ K who took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak to be home with his five children .
The S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore pre@@ ss rec@@ ently wr@@ ote about nu@@ r@@ ses re@@ tur@@ ning to work after long care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s .
"And speak@@ ing of long care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s , this is M@@ im@@ i K@@ a@@ h@@ n ."
"She &apos;s a social work@@ er in O@@ range C@@ ou@@ nt@@ y , C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , who re@@ turned to work in a social ser@@ vices organiz@@ ation after a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
That &apos;s the long@@ est care@@ er bre@@ ak that I &apos;m a@@ ware of .
Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t Ju@@ sti@@ ce S@@ an@@ d@@ ra D@@ ay O &apos;@@ C@@ on@@ no@@ r took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak early in her care@@ er .
"And this is T@@ rac@@ y S@@ ha@@ pi@@ ro , who took a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
T@@ rac@@ y answ@@ ered a call for e@@ s@@ says by the T@@ o@@ day S@@ how from people who were trying to re@@ turn to work but having a difficult time of it .
"T@@ rac@@ y wr@@ ote in that she was a mo@@ m of five who lo@@ ved her time at home , but she had gone through a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and needed to re@@ turn to work , pl@@ us she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she lo@@ ved working ."
T@@ rac@@ y was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
"She was looking for a fin@@ ance or ac@@ count@@ ing ro@@ le , and she had just spent the last n@@ ine months very di@@ lig@@ ently re@@ sear@@ ching companies on@@ line and ap@@ pl@@ ying for j@@ ob@@ s with no resul@@ ts ."
"I met T@@ rac@@ y in J@@ un@@ e of 20@@ 11 , when the T@@ o@@ day S@@ how asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around ."
The first thing I told T@@ rac@@ y was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conver@@ sa@@ tions that don &apos;t go any@@ where ."
"E@@ x@@ p@@ ect that , and don &apos;t be dis@@ coura@@ g@@ ed by it ."
"There will be a han@@ d@@ ful that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with T@@ rac@@ y in a little bit , but I want to share with you a disco@@ very that I made when I was re@@ tur@@ ning to work after my own care@@ er bre@@ ak of 11 years out of the fu@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ time work@@ for@@ ce ."
"And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is f@@ ro@@ z@@ en in time ."
"What I mean by this is , when you start to get in tou@@ ch with people and you get back in tou@@ ch with those people from the past , the people with wh@@ om you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
"And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has di@@ mini@@ shed over time , as happens with so many of us the far@@ ther re@@ mo@@ ved we are from our profe@@ ssi@@ onal id@@ ent@@ ities ."
"So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this ."
"This is me , cra@@ zy after a day of dri@@ ving around in my mini@@ v@@ an ."
O@@ r here I am in the kit@@ ch@@ en .
"But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this ."
"They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great con@@ fi@@ dence bo@@ ost to be back in tou@@ ch with these people and hear their en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m about your inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work ."
There &apos;s one more thing I remember vi@@ vi@@ dly from my own care@@ er bre@@ ak .
And that was that I har@@ dly ke@@ pt up with the business news .
"My back@@ ground is in fin@@ ance , and I har@@ dly ke@@ pt up with any news when I was home car@@ ing for my four young children ."
So I was af@@ rai@@ d I &apos;d go into an inter@@ view and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t exi@@ st any@@ more .
So I had to re@@ sub@@ scri@@ be to the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal and read it for a good six months co@@ ver to co@@ ver before I felt like I had a han@@ d@@ le on what was going on in the business world again .
"I believe rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are a ge@@ m of the work@@ for@@ ce , and here &apos;s why ."
"Th@@ ink about our life sta@@ ge : for those of us who took care@@ er bre@@ ak@@ s for chil@@ d@@ care reas@@ ons , we have fe@@ w@@ er or no ma@@ ter@@ n@@ ity lea@@ ves ."
We did that already .
We have fe@@ w@@ er sp@@ ous@@ al or par@@ tn@@ er job re@@ loc@@ ations .
We &apos;re in a more set@@ t@@ led time of life .
We have great work experience .
We have a more ma@@ ture per@@ sp@@ ective .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ se .
"P@@ l@@ us we have an energy , an en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m about re@@ tur@@ ning to work preci@@ sel@@ y because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while ."
"O@@ n the f@@ li@@ p side , I speak with em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers , and here are two con@@ cer@@ ns that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers have about hi@@ ring rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers ."
"The first one is , em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers are wor@@ ri@@ ed that rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are technologi@@ cally ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
"Now , I can tell you , having been technologi@@ cally ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e myself at one point , that it &apos;s a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry con@@ dition ."
I had done my fin@@ an@@ cial anal@@ y@@ sis so long ago that I used L@@ ot@@ us 1@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3 .
"I don &apos;t know if any@@ one can even remember back that far , but I had to re@@ learn it on E@@ x@@ ce@@ l ."
It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the com@@ man@@ ds are the same .
"I found P@@ ow@@ er@@ P@@ o@@ int much more challeng@@ ing , but now I use P@@ ow@@ er@@ P@@ o@@ int all the time ."
I tell rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers exp@@ ect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of ba@@ sic offi@@ ce manag@@ ement sof@@ t@@ ware .
"And if they &apos;re not up to spe@@ ed , then it &apos;s their respon@@ si@@ bility to get there ."
And they do .
The second area of con@@ cer@@ n that em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers have about rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers is they &apos;re wor@@ ri@@ ed that rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
I tell rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interest@@ s and sk@@ il@@ ls have changed or have not changed while they have been on care@@ er bre@@ ak .
That &apos;s not the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er &apos;s job .
It &apos;s the rela@@ un@@ ch@@ er &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility to de@@ mon@@ st@@ rate to the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er where they can ad@@ d the most value .
B@@ ac@@ k in 20@@ 10 I started not@@ ic@@ ing something .
"I had been trac@@ king re@@ turn to work pro@@ gram@@ s since 200@@ 8 , and in 20@@ 10 , I started not@@ ic@@ ing the use of a sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m paid work opportunity , whether it was called an inter@@ n@@ ship or not , but an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like experience , as a way for profe@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ls to re@@ turn to work ."
I saw G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s and S@@ ar@@ a Le@@ e start cor@@ po@@ rate re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship pro@@ gram@@ s .
"I saw a re@@ tur@@ ning engine@@ er , a non@@ tra@@ diti@@ onal re@@ ent@@ ry can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , app@@ ly for an ent@@ r@@ y-@@ level inter@@ n@@ ship program in the mi@@ lit@@ ary , and then get a per@@ man@@ ent job af@@ ter@@ ward ."
I saw two univer@@ s@@ ities in@@ te@@ g@@ rate inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps into mi@@ d-@@ care@@ er ex@@ ecu@@ tive education pro@@ gram@@ s .
"So I wr@@ ote a repor@@ t about what I was seeing , and it became this arti@@ cle for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ ine@@ ss Re@@ view called &quot; &quot; The 4@@ 0@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ O@@ ld Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; I have to than@@ k the e@@ dit@@ ors there for that tit@@ le , and also for this ar@@ t@@ work where you can see the 4@@ 0@@ -@@ year-@@ old inter@@ n in the mi@@ d@@ st of all the colle@@ ge inter@@ ns ."
"And then , cour@@ te@@ s@@ y of F@@ o@@ x B@@ us@@ ine@@ ss N@@ e@@ ws , they called the con@@ cept &quot; &quot; The 5@@ 0@@ -@@ Y@@ ear@@ -@@ O@@ ld Inter@@ n . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the bi@@ g@@ gest fin@@ an@@ cial ser@@ vices companies have re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship pro@@ gram@@ s for re@@ tur@@ ning fin@@ ance profe@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ls ."
"And at this point , hundreds of people have parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed ."
"These inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps are paid , and the people who move on to per@@ man@@ ent ro@@ les are com@@ man@@ ding comp@@ et@@ itive sa@@ la@@ ries ."
"And now , seven of the bi@@ g@@ gest engine@@ ering companies are p@@ il@@ ot@@ ing re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship pro@@ gram@@ s for re@@ tur@@ ning engine@@ ers as part of an in@@ iti@@ ative with the S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety of W@@ om@@ en Eng@@ ine@@ ers ."
"Now , why are companies em@@ bra@@ cing the re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship ?"
"Because the inter@@ n@@ ship allow@@ s the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er to ba@@ se their hi@@ ring deci@@ sion on an ac@@ tual work sam@@ ple instead of a ser@@ ies of inter@@ vie@@ ws , and the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er does not have to make that per@@ man@@ ent hi@@ ring deci@@ sion until the inter@@ n@@ ship per@@ i@@ od is over ."
"This te@@ sting out per@@ i@@ od re@@ mo@@ ves the per@@ cei@@ ved risk that some manag@@ ers atta@@ ch to hi@@ ring rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , and they are at@@ trac@@ ting ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent can@@ di@@ dat@@ es who are tur@@ ning into great hi@@ res ."
Th@@ ink about how far we have come .
"B@@ e@@ fore this , most em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers were not interested in eng@@ ag@@ ing with rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers at all ."
"But now , not only are pro@@ gram@@ s being developed speci@@ fi@@ cally with rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers in mind , but you can &apos;t even app@@ ly for these pro@@ gram@@ s un@@ less you have a g@@ ap on your r@@ é@@ sum@@ é ."
"This is the mar@@ k of real change , of true inst@@ itu@@ ti@@ onal shi@@ ft , because if we can solve this problem for rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , we can solve it for other care@@ er trans@@ iti@@ on@@ ers too ."
"In fact , an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er just told me that their v@@ et@@ er@@ ans re@@ turn to work program is based on their re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship program ."
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a re@@ ti@@ ree inter@@ n@@ ship program .
"D@@ i@@ ffer@@ ent po@@ ol , same con@@ cept ."
So let me tell you what happened with T@@ rac@@ y S@@ ha@@ pi@@ ro .
Re@@ member that she had to tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"Well , one cr@@ iti@@ cal conver@@ sation with another par@@ ent in her community led to a job off@@ er for T@@ rac@@ y , and it was an ac@@ count@@ ing job in a fin@@ ance de@@ par@@ t@@ ment ."
But it was a tem@@ p job .
"The company told her there was a possi@@ bility it could turn into something more , but no gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ es ."
This was in the f@@ all of 20@@ 11 .
"T@@ rac@@ y lo@@ ved this company , and she lo@@ ved the people and the offi@@ ce was less than 10 minutes from her house ."
"So even though she had a second job off@@ er at another company for a per@@ man@@ ent fu@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ time ro@@ le , she decided to take her chan@@ ces with this inter@@ n@@ ship and hope for the best ."
"Well , she en@@ ded up b@@ low@@ ing away all of their exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , and the company not only made her a per@@ man@@ ent off@@ er at the beginning of 20@@ 12 , but they made it even more interesting and challeng@@ ing , because they knew what T@@ rac@@ y could han@@ d@@ le ."
"F@@ ast forward to 20@@ 15 , T@@ rac@@ y &apos;s been pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ed ."
They &apos;ve paid for her to get her M@@ B@@ A at night .
She &apos;s even hi@@ red another rela@@ un@@ ch@@ er to work for her .
"T@@ rac@@ y &apos;s tem@@ p job was a tr@@ y@@ out , just like an inter@@ n@@ ship , and it en@@ ded up being a win for both T@@ rac@@ y and her em@@ plo@@ y@@ er ."
"Now , my go@@ al is to bring the re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship con@@ cept to more and more em@@ plo@@ y@@ ers ."
"But in the mean@@ time , if you are re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak , don &apos;t he@@ sit@@ ate to sug@@ gest an inter@@ n@@ ship or an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like ar@@ rang@@ ement to an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er that does not have a forma@@ l re@@ ent@@ ry inter@@ n@@ ship program ."
"B@@ e their first suc@@ cess story , and you can be the example for more rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers to come ."
Thank you .

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organiz@@ ation &apos;s science ad@@ vi@@ s@@ or .
"I really , really lo@@ ved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit dis@@ coura@@ g@@ ed ."
So I wan@@ der@@ ed down the hal@@ l@@ way to my colle@@ ag@@ ue Ch@@ ris H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s offi@@ ce .
"@@ Ch@@ ris had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had deep inst@@ itu@@ ti@@ onal knowledge and in@@ si@@ ghts ."
I expla@@ ined to Ch@@ ris that I was feeling a little bit stu@@ ck .
I had been inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ating a number of i@@ ssues at the inter@@ sec@@ tion of science and ci@@ vi@@ l li@@ ber@@ ti@@ es — su@@ per interesting .
"But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to eng@@ age these i@@ ssues in a much bi@@ gger way , in a way that could really make a difference ."
"So Ch@@ ris cut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the i@@ ssues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gen@@ e@@ tic di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation , and re@@ produc@@ tive technologi@@ es , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , there &apos;s this really co@@ ol is@@ sue , func@@ ti@@ onal M@@ R@@ I and using it for li@@ e det@@ ection , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , and of course , there &apos;s gen@@ e pat@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Yes , you know , pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been is@@ su@@ ing pat@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my offi@@ ce and sent Ch@@ ris three arti@@ cles .
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my offi@@ ce ."
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Wh@@ o can we sue ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ ris is a really bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but he knew almost nothing about pat@@ ent la@@ w and cer@@ tain@@ ly nothing about gen@@ eti@@ cs ."
"I knew something about gen@@ eti@@ cs , but I wasn &apos;t even a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , let alone a pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ er ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fi@@ le a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
"Fi@@ rst , we needed to understand exactly what was pat@@ ented when someone pat@@ ented a gen@@ e ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents ty@@ pi@@ cally con@@ tain do@@ z@@ ens of cla@@ im@@ s , but the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; i@@ so@@ lated DNA &quot; &quot; — nam@@ ely , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ mo@@ ved from a cell ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ent prop@@ on@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ e ? We didn &apos;t pat@@ ent the gen@@ e in your body , we pat@@ ented an i@@ so@@ lated gen@@ e . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gen@@ e requi@@ res that it be i@@ so@@ lated ."
"And the pat@@ ents w@@ er@@ en &apos;t just to a particular gen@@ e that they i@@ so@@ lated , but on every possible ver@@ sion of that gen@@ e ."
So what does that mean ?
"That means that you can &apos;t give your gen@@ e to your doc@@ tor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mu@@ ta@@ tions , without per@@ mi@@ ssion of the pat@@ ent hol@@ der ."
It also means that the pat@@ ent hol@@ der has the right to stop any@@ one from using that gen@@ e in research or cl@@ in@@ ical te@@ sting .
"A@@ l@@ low@@ ing pat@@ ent hol@@ ders , often pri@@ v@@ ate companies , to lo@@ ck up stre@@ t@@ ches of the human gen@@ ome was har@@ ming patients ."
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der A@@ bi@@ g@@ ai@@ l , a 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old with long Q@@ T sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , a seri@@ ous heart con@@ dition that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can result in sudd@@ en death ."
The company that ob@@ ta@@ ined a pat@@ ent on two gen@@ es as@@ soci@@ ated with this con@@ dition developed a test to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t and they never o@@ ffer@@ ed it .
"So another lab tried to off@@ er the test , but the company that hel@@ d the pat@@ ents thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to sue the lab for pat@@ ent in@@ fri@@ ng@@ ement ."
"So as a result , for 2 years , no test was av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing that time , A@@ bi@@ g@@ ai@@ l died of un@@ di@@ ag@@ n@@ osed long Q@@ T ."
G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
"T@@ ur@@ ns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made clear through a long line of c@@ ases , that certain things are not pat@@ ent eli@@ gi@@ ble ."
"You can &apos;t pat@@ ent produc@@ ts of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , el@@ em@@ ents of the per@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ c table ."
"And you can &apos;t pat@@ ent la@@ ws of nature — the la@@ w of gra@@ v@@ ity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 ."
These things are just too fundamen@@ tal and must re@@ main free to all and re@@ ser@@ ved exc@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely to n@@ one .
"It se@@ em@@ ed to us that DNA , the most fundamen@@ tal structure of life , that co@@ des for the produc@@ tion of all of our prot@@ e@@ ins , is both a produc@@ t of nature and a la@@ w of nature , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bo@@ dies or sitting in the bot@@ tom of a test tu@@ be ."
"As we d@@ el@@ ved into this is@@ sue , we tra@@ vel@@ ed all over the country to speak with many different exper@@ ts — scientists , medi@@ cal profe@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ls , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ ers ."
"M@@ ost of them ag@@ re@@ ed that we were right as a matter of po@@ lic@@ y , and , at least in theory , as a matter of la@@ w ."
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent challenge were about z@@ ero .
Why is that ?
"Well , the pat@@ ent offi@@ ce had been is@@ su@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years ."
There were literally thousands of pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
"The pat@@ ent b@@ ar was de@@ ep@@ ly ent@@ ren@@ ched in the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o , the bi@@ ot@@ ech indu@@ stry had gro@@ wn up around this practi@@ ce , and le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation to b@@ an gen@@ e pat@@ ents had been int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed year after year in C@@ ong@@ re@@ ss , and had gone absol@@ utely no@@ where ."
So the bot@@ tom line : cour@@ ts just w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going to be wil@@ ling to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
"Now , ne@@ i@@ ther Ch@@ ris no@@ r I were the ty@@ pe to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and he@@ aring , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; se@@ em@@ ed all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght ."
So we set out to build our case .
"Now , pat@@ ent c@@ ases t@@ end to be : C@@ om@@ pan@@ y A sue@@ s C@@ om@@ pan@@ y B over some really na@@ r@@ row , ob@@ s@@ cu@@ re techni@@ cal is@@ sue ."
"We w@@ er@@ en &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bi@@ gger than that ."
"This was about scienti@@ fic fre@@ e@@ dom , medi@@ cal pro@@ gre@@ ss , the ri@@ ghts of patients ."
So we decided we were going to devel@@ op a case that was not like your ty@@ pi@@ cal pat@@ ent case — more like a ci@@ vi@@ l ri@@ ghts case .
We set out to id@@ enti@@ fy a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent hol@@ der that was vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously en@@ for@@ cing its pat@@ ents and then to organiz@@ e a bro@@ ad co@@ al@@ ition of pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could tell the cour@@ t about all the ways that these pat@@ ents were har@@ ming patients and inno@@ vation .
"We found the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to sue in M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad G@@ ene@@ ti@@ cs , a company that &apos;s based in S@@ al@@ t L@@ ake C@@ ity , U@@ ta@@ h ."
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad hel@@ d pat@@ ents on two gen@@ es , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 gen@@ es ."
W@@ om@@ en with certain mu@@ ta@@ tions along these gen@@ es are consi@@ der@@ ed to be at a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ antly incre@@ as@@ ed risk of develop@@ ing bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had used its pat@@ ents to ma@@ in@@ tain a complet@@ e mon@@ op@@ o@@ ly on B@@ R@@ C@@ A te@@ sting in the United States .
It had for@@ ced mul@@ ti@@ ple la@@ b@@ s that were o@@ ffer@@ ing B@@ R@@ C@@ A te@@ sting to stop .
"It char@@ g@@ ed a lot of money for its test — over 3@@ ,000 dollars ."
It had st@@ op@@ ped shar@@ ing its cl@@ in@@ ical data with the inter@@ national scienti@@ fic community .
"And perhaps wor@@ st of all , for a per@@ i@@ od of se@@ ver@@ al years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ fu@@ sed to up@@ d@@ ate its test to inclu@@ de ad@@ diti@@ onal mu@@ ta@@ tions that had been id@@ enti@@ fied by a team of re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"It has been esti@@ ma@@ ted that during that per@@ i@@ od , for se@@ ver@@ al years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going te@@ sting re@@ cei@@ ved the wrong answer — a ne@@ g@@ ative test result that should have been pos@@ itive ."
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en Ma@@ xi@@ an .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster E@@ i@@ le@@ en developed bre@@ ast cancer at age 40 and she was te@@ sted by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was ne@@ g@@ ative .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
"That me@@ ant that E@@ i@@ le@@ en &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other me@@ mbers of her family didn &apos;t need to be te@@ sted ."
"But two years later , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en was di@@ ag@@ n@@ osed with adv@@ an@@ ce@@ d-@@ sta@@ ge o@@ vari@@ an cancer ."
It turned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster was am@@ ong the 12 percent who re@@ cei@@ ved a fal@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ g@@ ative test result .
"H@@ ad E@@ i@@ le@@ en re@@ cei@@ ved the prop@@ er result , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been te@@ sted , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ v@@ ented ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we set@@ t@@ led on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad , we then had to form a co@@ al@@ ition of pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts that could il@@ lu@@ mi@@ nate these problems ."
"We en@@ ded up with 20 high@@ ly com@@ mit@@ ted pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s : gen@@ e@@ tic cou@@ n@@ sel@@ ors , gen@@ eti@@ ci@@ sts who had re@@ cei@@ ved ce@@ ase and de@@ si@@ st let@@ ters , adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ y organiz@@ ations , four maj@@ or scienti@@ fic organiz@@ ations that coll@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ed more than 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 scientists and medi@@ cal profe@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ls , and individu@@ al women who either couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s test , or who wanted to ob@@ tain a second op@@ ini@@ on but could not , as a result of the pat@@ ents ."
One of the maj@@ or challeng@@ es we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was figu@@ ring out how best to communic@@ ate the science .
"So in order to ar@@ g@@ ue that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inv@@ en@@ tion , and that i@@ so@@ lated B@@ R@@ C@@ A gen@@ es were produc@@ ts of nature , we had to expla@@ in a couple of ba@@ sic con@@ cep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gen@@ e ? What &apos;s DNA ?"
"@@ How is DNA i@@ so@@ lated , and why isn &apos;t that an inv@@ en@@ tion ?"
"We spent hours and hours with our pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts , trying to come up with ways of expla@@ ining these con@@ cep@@ ts simply yet ac@@ cu@@ rat@@ ely ."
"And we en@@ ded up re@@ l@@ ying he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly on the use of me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors , like go@@ ld ."
So i@@ so@@ la@@ ting DNA — it &apos;s like ex@@ trac@@ ting go@@ ld from a m@@ oun@@ tain or taking it out of a stre@@ am bed .
"You might be able to pat@@ ent the process for min@@ ing the go@@ ld , but you can &apos;t pat@@ ent the go@@ ld itself ."
"It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and ef@@ for@@ t to di@@ g the go@@ ld out of the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you still can &apos;t pat@@ ent it , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"And the go@@ ld , once it &apos;s ex@@ trac@@ ted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all sor@@ ts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you can make j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pat@@ ent the go@@ ld , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our case ."
"We fil@@ ed in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ i@@ stri@@ ct of New York , and the case was rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to Ju@@ dge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
"In Mar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , Ju@@ dge S@@ we@@ et i@@ ss@@ ue@@ d his op@@ ini@@ on — 1@@ 5@@ 2 pa@@ ges — and a complet@@ e vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory for our side ."
"In read@@ ing the op@@ ini@@ on , we could not get over how el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently he descri@@ bed the science in the case ."
"I mean , our bri@@ e@@ f — it was pretty good , but not this good ."
How did he devel@@ op such a deep understanding of this is@@ sue in such a sh@@ ort time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
"So it turned out , Ju@@ dge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a la@@ w@@ y@@ er — he was a scienti@@ st ."
He was not just a scienti@@ st — he had a P@@ h@@ D in molecu@@ lar bio@@ logy .
( Laughter ) What an incredible st@@ rok@@ e of lu@@ ck !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"Fi@@ rst , in a pi@@ v@@ o@@ tal moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched si@@ des ."
So in the di@@ stri@@ ct cour@@ t the government sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
"But now in direc@@ t op@@ pos@@ ition to its own pat@@ ent offi@@ ce , the U@@ S government fil@@ es a bri@@ e@@ f that sta@@ t@@ es that is has re@@ consi@@ der@@ ed this is@@ sue in light of the di@@ stri@@ ct cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on , and has con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that i@@ so@@ lated DNA is not pat@@ ent eli@@ gi@@ ble ."
"This was a really big deal , to@@ tally un@@ exp@@ ected ."
"The C@@ our@@ t of A@@ p@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it he@@ ars all pat@@ ent c@@ ases , and it has a re@@ pu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pat@@ ent ."
"So even with this re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble develop@@ ment , we exp@@ ected to l@@ ose ."
And we did .
S@@ ort of .
"E@@ n@@ ds up sp@@ l@@ it deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 ."
"But the two ju@@ d@@ ges who ru@@ led against us , did so for completely different reas@@ ons ."
"The first one , Ju@@ dge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own no@@ vel , bio@@ logical theory — to@@ tally wrong ."
( Laughter ) He decided M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had created a new chemi@@ cal — made absol@@ utely no sense .
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even ar@@ g@@ ue this , so it came out of the blue ."
"The other , Ju@@ dge M@@ o@@ ore , said she basically ag@@ re@@ ed with us that i@@ so@@ lated DNA is a produc@@ t of nature ."
"But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to sha@@ ke up the bi@@ ot@@ ech indu@@ stry . &quot; &quot; The third , Ju@@ dge B@@ r@@ y@@ son , ag@@ re@@ ed with us ."
So now we s@@ ou@@ ght re@@ view by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"And when you p@@ et@@ ition the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to present a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer ."
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a super@@ -@@ long pa@@ ra@@ g@@ rap@@ h , like a whole pa@@ ge long with lots and lots of cla@@ us@@ es , &quot; wh@@ er@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; ther@@ e@@ fore that . &quot;"
We sub@@ mit@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question pre@@ sent@@ ed ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pat@@ en@@ table ?
"Now when Ch@@ ris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know ."
"I think you have to say , &apos; I@@ s i@@ so@@ lated DNA pat@@ en@@ table ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ o@@ pe ."
"I want the ju@@ sti@@ ces to have the very same re@@ action that I had when you brought this is@@ sue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly couldn &apos;t ar@@ g@@ ue with that ."
"The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only he@@ ars about one percent of the c@@ ases that it re@@ cei@@ ves , and it ag@@ re@@ ed to hear ours ."
"The day of the o@@ ral ar@@ gu@@ ment ar@@ ri@@ ves , and it was really , really exc@@ iting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the mor@@ ning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se ."
"T@@ wo bre@@ ast cancer organiz@@ ations , B@@ re@@ ast C@@ an@@ cer A@@ c@@ tion and F@@ O@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organiz@@ ed a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion on the cour@@ thou@@ se st@@ ep@@ s ."
"@@ Ch@@ ris and I sat qui@@ et@@ ly in the hal@@ l@@ way , mom@@ ents before he was to walk in and ar@@ g@@ ue the most important case of his care@@ er ."
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
"But any re@@ ma@@ ining pan@@ ic sub@@ si@@ ded as I wal@@ ked into the cour@@ t@@ room and looked around at a se@@ a of fri@@ en@@ dly fac@@ es : our individu@@ al women cli@@ ents who had sha@@ red their de@@ ep@@ ly personal stories , the gen@@ eti@@ ci@@ sts who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their bu@@ s@@ y care@@ ers to de@@ dic@@ ate themselves to this fi@@ ght and re@@ pre@@ sen@@ tati@@ ves from a di@@ ver@@ se ar@@ ra@@ y of medi@@ cal , patient adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ y , environ@@ mental and reli@@ gi@@ ous organiz@@ ations , who had sub@@ mit@@ ted friend of the cour@@ t bri@@ ef@@ s in the case ."
"A@@ l@@ so in the room were three lead@@ ers of the H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject , inclu@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of DNA h@@ im@@ self , J@@ am@@ es W@@ at@@ son , who had sub@@ mit@@ ted a bri@@ e@@ f to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ fer@@ red to gen@@ e pat@@ ent@@ ing as &quot; &quot; lu@@ na@@ cy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The di@@ versity of the commun@@ ities re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ed in this room and the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality sp@@ oke v@@ olu@@ mes to what was at sta@@ ke ."
The ar@@ gu@@ ment itself was ri@@ v@@ et@@ ing .
Ch@@ ris ar@@ gue@@ d bri@@ l@@ li@@ antly .
"But for me , the most th@@ ri@@ l@@ ling a@@ sp@@ ect was wat@@ ching the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t ju@@ sti@@ ces g@@ rap@@ ple with i@@ so@@ lated DNA , through a ser@@ ies of col@@ or@@ ful anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es and fe@@ i@@ st@@ y ex@@ changes , very much the same way as our leg@@ al team had done for the past seven years ."
Ju@@ sti@@ ce K@@ ag@@ an lik@@ en@@ ed i@@ so@@ la@@ ting DNA to ex@@ trac@@ ting a medi@@ ci@@ nal plant from the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on .
Ju@@ sti@@ ce R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts di@@ sti@@ ng@@ u@@ i@@ shed it from car@@ ving a ba@@ se@@ b@@ all b@@ at from a t@@ ree .
"And in one of my absol@@ utely fav@@ or@@ ite mom@@ ents , Ju@@ sti@@ ce S@@ ot@@ o@@ ma@@ y@@ or pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed i@@ so@@ lated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty con@@ fi@@ dent lea@@ ving the cour@@ t@@ room that day , but I could never have anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed the out@@ come : n@@ ine to z@@ ero ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; A na@@ tu@@ ra@@ lly oc@@ cur@@ ring DNA se@@ g@@ ment is a produc@@ t of nature , and not pat@@ ent@@ -@@ eli@@ gi@@ ble mer@@ ely because it has been i@@ so@@ lated ."
"And fu@@ r@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ in 2@@ 4 hours of the deci@@ sion , five la@@ b@@ s had an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that they would beg@@ in to off@@ er te@@ sting for the B@@ R@@ C@@ A gen@@ es ."
S@@ ome of them pr@@ omi@@ sed to off@@ er the te@@ sts at a low@@ er pri@@ ce than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
S@@ ome pr@@ omi@@ sed to provi@@ de a more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive test than the one M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad was o@@ ffer@@ ing .
But of course the deci@@ sion goes far be@@ yon@@ d M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ year practi@@ ce of allow@@ ing pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es in the United States .
It cle@@ ars a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant bar@@ ri@@ er to bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal disco@@ very and inno@@ vation .
"And it hel@@ ps to en@@ sure that patients like A@@ bi@@ g@@ ai@@ l , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en and E@@ i@@ le@@ en have access to the te@@ sts that they need ."
"A few weeks after the cour@@ t i@@ ss@@ ue@@ d its deci@@ sion , I re@@ cei@@ ved a small p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge in the mai@@ l ."
"It was from B@@ o@@ b C@@ o@@ ok@@ -@@ D@@ e@@ eg@@ an , a profe@@ ss@@ or at D@@ uk@@ e Uni@@ versity and one the very first people Ch@@ ris and I went to vi@@ sit when we started to consi@@ der whether to bring this case ."
I open@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ ff@@ ed anima@@ l .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
P@@ art of what gave us the coura@@ ge to take that risk was kno@@ wing that we were doing the right thing .
"The process took ne@@ ar@@ ly eight years from the start to fin@@ is@@ h , with many t@@ wi@@ sts and turns along the way ."
"A little lu@@ ck cer@@ tain@@ ly hel@@ ped , but it was the commun@@ ities that we bri@@ d@@ g@@ ed , the al@@ li@@ an@@ ces that we created , that made pi@@ gs f@@ ly ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ an@@ cial S@@ er@@ vices Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , the answer is yes ."
"Th@@ en , predic@@ tions can be made and te@@ sted ."
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is literally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
W@@ here are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ tai@@ l was ow@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a value to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they i@@ so@@ lated ?
"These are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expla@@ in by giving you this anal@@ o@@ gy .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ li@@ mp@@ ses of about eight of my pro@@ jects , done in col@@ labo@@ ration with D@@ an@@ is@@ h arti@@ st S@@ o@@ re@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ ao , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ st@@ antly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a gla@@ ss of water , a p@@ ac@@ k of ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ es ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a resp@@ ected figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the situ@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a lan@@ d@@ line tel@@ e@@ phone .
He would hold on to the re@@ cei@@ ver and exp@@ ect me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requi@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle us@@ es a phone that &apos;s desig@@ ned for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mi@@ ssing his com@@ man@@ ds ."
And so I made him a g@@ ol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er through which he could di@@ sp@@ en@@ se his com@@ man@@ ds to ne@@ phe@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an e@@ mai@@ l .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , ty@@ pe his e@@ mai@@ l or com@@ m@@ and and pu@@ ll the paper out ."
This de@@ vice would au@@ to@@ mati@@ cally s@@ end the int@@ en@@ ded person the let@@ ter as an e@@ mai@@ l .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics that under@@ stan@@ ds all of the me@@ chan@@ ical ac@@ tions and conver@@ ts it to dig@@ ital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very g@@ r@@ and and have a sense of rit@@ u@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle lik@@ es it ."
"The next work is a s@@ oun@@ d-@@ sen@@ s@@ itive in@@ sta@@ l@@ lation that we aff@@ ec@@ ti@@ o@@ nately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a noti@@ on of being sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ s@@ itive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ atu@@ res ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ atu@@ res which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ els on three wal@@ ls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ atu@@ res do ."
So they get im@@ mun@@ e to s@@ ounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to back@@ ground s@@ ounds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( N@@ oi@@ se ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground s@@ ounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ f@@ eli@@ ke as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , p@@ sy@@ che , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , perso@@ na@@ l@@ ities and so on ."
So this is a very early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite pla@@ y@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video in@@ sta@@ l@@ lation called &quot; &quot; The Mi@@ ssing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite int@@ ri@@ gue@@ d with pla@@ ying with the noti@@ on of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ era sur@@ ve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce , and we asked them to devel@@ op a piece of sof@@ t@@ ware with us , using a cam@@ era that could look at people in the room , tra@@ ck them and re@@ place one person with the back@@ ground , ren@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ o@@ re@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the proce@@ ssed video where the cam@@ era has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
S@@ o@@ re@@ n ent@@ ers the room . P@@ op ! He goes in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the cam@@ era is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ era looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ st@@ antly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Su@@ n S@@ ha@@ do@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a s@@ he@@ et of paper , like a c@@ ut@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oi@@ l sp@@ ill or a sun ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ a@@ red to be very st@@ rong and ro@@ bu@@ st , and from the side , it almost se@@ em@@ ed very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ n@@ ore it , thinking it was some cra@@ p la@@ ying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pa@@ ssed by , it would start to cli@@ m@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ k@@ y fas@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted , and it would col@@ lap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of fal@@ l@@ en into his hat , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a plant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very d@@ run@@ k@@ en fas@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predic@@ table and extre@@ m@@ ely s@@ low movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle w@@ er@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an in@@ stance — so when people ent@@ er the room , it activ@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very s@@ low@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mom@@ entu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ w@@ er an inst@@ inc@@ t to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manag@@ es to pu@@ ll itself up ."
"So this work was a real techni@@ cal challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ics right and the e@@ qui@@ li@@ bri@@ um and the d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
"And it was very important for us to e@@ sta@@ bli@@ sh the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would da@@ ma@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that fa@@ ta@@ li@@ sm , or that sense of want@@ ing to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quic@@ k video where we are doing a test sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o — it &apos;s much fa@@ ster .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go cat@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manag@@ es to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very int@@ ri@@ gue@@ d with , working with the ae@@ s@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tiny different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber opti@@ cs , which t@@ win@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we w@@ rapp@@ ed this around a b@@ lob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sha@@ pe of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ ang@@ ing from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tra@@ st something very co@@ ld and di@@ st@@ ant and ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t like the universe into the fami@@ li@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and inti@@ mate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ cei@@ ve it to be a ho@@ le in the space , and as if you were looking out into the t@@ win@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ il@@ ler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to inti@@ mi@@ d@@ ate you by growing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s t@@ wi@@ ce its he@@ i@@ ght and &#91; eight &#93; times its v@@ olu@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ st@@ antly ex@@ pan@@ ding and con@@ trac@@ ting to create a d@@ y@@ na@@ mic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a sec@@ re@@ t within its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pai@@ n in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pre@@ ss the emoti@@ ons and behavi@@ o@@ ral patter@@ ns in these cre@@ atu@@ res that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature pop@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really want@@ s to exi@@ st and what form it want@@ s to take and what way it want@@ s to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really gla@@ d to be here .
"I &apos;m gla@@ d you &apos;re here , because that would be a little we@@ i@@ rd ."
I &apos;m gla@@ d we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
O@@ r here .
But here .
I mean Earth .
"And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to sing@@ le@@ -@@ cel@@ led , from mo@@ ld to mu@@ sh@@ ro@@ oms to fl@@ ying be@@ ars . ( Laughter )@@ "
"The interesting thing is , Earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8@@ .@@ 7 million species ."
"We &apos;ve looked other places , maybe not as hard as we should or we could , but we &apos;ve looked and ha@@ ven &apos;t found any ; Earth is the only place we know of with life ."
I@@ s Earth speci@@ al ?
"This is a question I &apos;ve wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child , and I su@@ sp@@ ect 80 percent of this au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer ."
"T@@ o understand whether there are any plan@@ ets — out there in our so@@ lar system or be@@ yon@@ d — that can supp@@ ort life , the first step is to understand what life here requi@@ res ."
"It turns out , of all of those 8@@ .@@ 7 million species , life only needs three things ."
"O@@ n one side , all life on Earth needs energy ."
"C@@ om@@ p@@ le@@ x life like us der@@ i@@ ves our energy from the sun , but life deep under@@ ground can get its energy from things like chemi@@ cal re@@ ac@@ tions ."
There are a number of different energy sources av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble on all plan@@ ets .
"O@@ n the other side , all life needs food or n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment ."
"And this seems like a ta@@ ll order , e@@ specially if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent to@@ ma@@ to ."
"( Laughter ) H@@ ow@@ ever , all life on Earth der@@ i@@ ves its n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ ment from only six chemi@@ cal el@@ em@@ ents , and these el@@ em@@ ents can be found on any plan@@ e@@ ta@@ ry body in our so@@ lar system ."
"So that lea@@ ves the thing in the middle as the ta@@ ll po@@ le , the thing that &apos;s har@@ de@@ st to achi@@ e@@ ve ."
"N@@ ot mo@@ ose , but water ."
( Laughter ) Al@@ though mo@@ ose would be pretty co@@ ol . ( Laughter )
"And not f@@ ro@@ z@@ en water , and not water in a ga@@ se@@ ous state , but li@@ qui@@ d water ."
"This is what life needs to survi@@ ve , all life ."
"And many so@@ lar system bo@@ dies don &apos;t have li@@ qui@@ d water , and so we don &apos;t look there ."
"O@@ ther so@@ lar system bo@@ dies might have ab@@ und@@ ant li@@ qui@@ d water , even more than Earth , but it &apos;s t@@ rapp@@ ed bene@@ ath an ic@@ y sh@@ ell , and so it &apos;s hard to access , it &apos;s hard to get to , it &apos;s hard to even find out if there &apos;s any life there ."
So that lea@@ ves a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem sim@@ pl@@ er for ourselves .
Let &apos;s think only about li@@ qui@@ d water on the surface of a planet .
"There are only three bo@@ dies to think about in our so@@ lar system , with re@@ g@@ ard to li@@ qui@@ d water on the surface of a planet , and in order of di@@ stance from the sun , it &apos;s : V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ars ."
You want to have an at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere for water to be li@@ qui@@ d .
You have to be very care@@ ful with that at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere .
"You can &apos;t have too much at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere , too th@@ ic@@ k or too war@@ m an at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere , because then you end up too h@@ ot like V@@ en@@ us , and you can &apos;t have li@@ qui@@ d water ."
"But if you have too little at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere and it &apos;s too th@@ in and too co@@ ld , you end up like M@@ ars , too co@@ ld ."
"So V@@ en@@ us is too h@@ ot , M@@ ars is too co@@ ld , and Earth is just right ."
You can look at these images behind me and you can see au@@ to@@ mati@@ cally where life can survi@@ ve in our so@@ lar system .
"It &apos;s a G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ ck@@ s@@ -@@ ty@@ pe problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , I &apos;d like to re@@ mind you of two things from the G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really rele@@ v@@ ant here ."
"N@@ u@@ mber one : if M@@ am@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too co@@ ld when G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks wal@@ ks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too co@@ ld ?"
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
W@@ hen G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks wal@@ ks into the room det@@ er@@ min@@ es the answer that we get in the story .
And the same is true with plan@@ ets .
They &apos;re not sta@@ tic things . They change .
They v@@ ary . They ev@@ ol@@ ve .
And at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es do the same .
So let me give you an example .
Here &apos;s one of my fav@@ or@@ ite pic@@ tures of M@@ ars .
"It &apos;s not the high@@ est re@@ solu@@ tion image , it &apos;s not the se@@ xi@@ est image , it &apos;s not the most rec@@ ent image , but it &apos;s an image that show@@ s ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds cut into the surface of the planet ; ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds car@@ ved by f@@ low@@ ing , li@@ qui@@ d water ; ri@@ ver@@ be@@ ds that take hundreds or thousands or ten@@ s of thousands of years to form ."
This can &apos;t happen on M@@ ars today .
The at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere of M@@ ars today is too th@@ in and too co@@ ld for water to be sta@@ ble as a li@@ qui@@ d .
"This one image tel@@ ls you that the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere of M@@ ars changed , and it changed in big ways ."
"And it changed from a state that we would de@@ f@@ ine as ha@@ bit@@ able , because the three requi@@ re@@ ments for life were present long ago ."
W@@ here did that at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere go that allow@@ ed water to be li@@ qui@@ d at the surface ?
"Well , one idea is it e@@ sc@@ ap@@ ed away to space ."
"A@@ tm@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic parti@@ cles got enough energy to bre@@ ak free from the gra@@ v@@ ity of the planet , e@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing away to space , never to re@@ turn ."
And this happens with all bo@@ dies with at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es .
C@@ om@@ ets have tail@@ s that are incredi@@ bly vi@@ sible re@@ min@@ ders of at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic e@@ sc@@ ape .
"But V@@ en@@ us also has an at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere that e@@ sc@@ ap@@ es with time , and M@@ ars and Earth as well ."
It &apos;s just a matter of de@@ gre@@ e and a matter of scale .
So we &apos;d like to figure out how much e@@ sc@@ ap@@ ed over time so we can expla@@ in this trans@@ ition .
How do at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es get their energy for e@@ sc@@ ape ?
How do parti@@ cles get enough energy to e@@ sc@@ ape ?
"There are two ways , if we &apos;re going to re@@ duce things a little bit ."
"N@@ u@@ mber one , sun@@ light ."
Li@@ ght em@@ it@@ ted from the sun can be ab@@ sor@@ bed by at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic parti@@ cles and war@@ m the parti@@ cles .
"@@ Yes , I &apos;m dan@@ cing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my we@@ d@@ ding . ( Laughter )@@ "
They get enough energy to e@@ sc@@ ape and bre@@ ak free from the gra@@ v@@ ity of the planet just by war@@ ming .
A second way they can get energy is from the so@@ lar w@@ ind .
"These are parti@@ cles , ma@@ ss , material , sp@@ it out from the surface of the sun , and they go scre@@ am@@ ing through the so@@ lar system at 4@@ 00 kil@@ omet@@ ers per second , sometimes fa@@ ster during so@@ lar stor@@ ms , and they go hu@@ rt@@ ling through inter@@ plan@@ e@@ ta@@ ry space to@@ wards plan@@ ets and their at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es , and they may provi@@ de energy for at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic parti@@ cles to e@@ sc@@ ape as well ."
"This is something that I &apos;m interested in , because it rela@@ t@@ es to ha@@ bit@@ ability ."
"I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed that there were two things about the G@@ ol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and re@@ mind you about , and the second one is a little bit more sub@@ tle ."
"If P@@ ap@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too h@@ ot , and M@@ am@@ a B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too co@@ ld , sh@@ ouldn &apos;t B@@ ab@@ y B@@ e@@ ar &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l be even col@@ der if we &apos;re follow@@ ing the tr@@ end ?"
"This thing that you &apos;ve ac@@ cep@@ ted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple ."
"And of course , di@@ stance of a planet from the sun det@@ er@@ min@@ es its tem@@ per@@ ature ."
This has to play into ha@@ bit@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
"M@@ a@@ ybe it &apos;s the bo@@ w@@ ls themselves that are also hel@@ ping to det@@ er@@ mine the out@@ come in the story , what is just right ."
"I could talk to you about a lot of different cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ sti@@ cs of these three plan@@ ets that may inf@@ lu@@ ence ha@@ bit@@ ability , but for sel@@ fish reas@@ ons rela@@ ted to my own research and the fact that I &apos;m standing up here hol@@ ding the c@@ lic@@ k@@ er and you &apos;re not — ( Laughter ) I would like to talk for just a min@@ ute or two about mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds ."
Earth has one ; V@@ en@@ us and M@@ ars do not .
M@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds are gener@@ ated in the deep inter@@ i@@ or of a planet by electri@@ cally con@@ duc@@ ting ch@@ ur@@ ning f@@ lu@@ id material that cre@@ ates this big old mag@@ ne@@ tic field that sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ds Earth .
"If you have a compa@@ ss , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
V@@ en@@ us and M@@ ars don &apos;t have that .
"If you have a compa@@ ss on V@@ en@@ us and M@@ ars , c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ la@@ tions , you &apos;re lost ."
( Laughter ) D@@ o@@ es this inf@@ lu@@ ence ha@@ bit@@ ability ?
"Well , how might it ?"
"M@@ any scientists think that a mag@@ ne@@ tic field of a planet ser@@ ves as a shi@@ el@@ d for the at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere , de@@ fl@@ ecting so@@ lar w@@ ind parti@@ cles around the planet in a bit of a for@@ ce fiel@@ d-@@ ty@@ pe eff@@ ect having to do with electri@@ c char@@ ge of those parti@@ cles ."
I like to think of it instead as a sa@@ la@@ d b@@ ar s@@ nee@@ ze gu@@ ard for plan@@ ets .
"( Laughter ) And yes , my colle@@ ag@@ ues who wat@@ ch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the so@@ lar w@@ ind has been equ@@ ated with mu@@ cu@@ s . ( Laughter )@@ "
"O@@ K , so the eff@@ ect , then , is that Earth may have been prot@@ ected for bil@@ lions of years , because we &apos;ve had a mag@@ ne@@ tic field ."
A@@ tm@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ha@@ sn &apos;t been able to e@@ sc@@ ape .
"M@@ ars , on the other hand , has been un@@ prot@@ ected because of its lack of mag@@ ne@@ tic field , and over bil@@ lions of years , maybe enough at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere has been stri@@ pp@@ ed away to ac@@ cou@@ nt for a trans@@ ition from a ha@@ bit@@ able planet to the planet that we see today ."
"O@@ ther scientists think that mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds may act more like the sai@@ ls on a ship , ena@@ b@@ ling the planet to inter@@ act with more energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind than the planet would have been able to inter@@ act with by itself ."
The sai@@ ls may ga@@ ther energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind .
The mag@@ ne@@ tic field may ga@@ ther energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind that allow@@ s even more at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic e@@ sc@@ ape to happen .
"It &apos;s an idea that has to be te@@ sted , but the eff@@ ect and how it works seems ap@@ par@@ ent ."
That &apos;s because we know energy from the so@@ lar w@@ ind is being de@@ pos@@ ited into our at@@ mos@@ ph@@ ere here on Earth .
"That energy is con@@ duc@@ ted along mag@@ ne@@ tic field lin@@ es down into the po@@ lar regi@@ ons , resul@@ ting in incredi@@ bly beautiful au@@ r@@ or@@ a ."
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ en@@ ced them , it &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
We know the energy is getting in .
We &apos;re trying to mea@@ sure how many parti@@ cles are getting out and if the mag@@ ne@@ tic field is inf@@ lu@@ en@@ cing this in any way .
"So I &apos;ve pos@@ ed a problem for you here , but I don &apos;t have a solu@@ tion yet ."
We don &apos;t have a solu@@ tion .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
"Well , we &apos;ve sent sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to all three plan@@ ets ."
"S@@ ome of them are or@@ b@@ iting now , inclu@@ ding the M@@ A@@ V@@ E@@ N sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft which is curr@@ ently or@@ b@@ iting M@@ ars , which I &apos;m inv@@ olved with and which is led here , out of the Uni@@ versity of C@@ o@@ lo@@ ra@@ do ."
It &apos;s desig@@ ned to mea@@ sure at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic e@@ sc@@ ape .
We have simi@@ lar mea@@ su@@ re@@ ments from V@@ en@@ us and Earth .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have all our mea@@ su@@ re@@ ments , we can com@@ b@@ ine all these together , and we can understand how all three plan@@ ets inter@@ act with their space environment , with the sur@@ rou@@ n@@ di@@ ngs ."
And we can deci@@ de whether mag@@ ne@@ tic fiel@@ ds are important for ha@@ bit@@ ability or not .
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"I mean , I care de@@ ep@@ ly ..@@ ."
"And fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally as well , but de@@ ep@@ ly ."
"( Laughter ) F@@ i@@ rst of all , an answer to this question will te@@ ach us more about these three plan@@ ets , V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ars , not only about how they inter@@ act with their environment today , but how they were bil@@ lions of years ago , whether they were ha@@ bit@@ able long ago or not ."
It will te@@ ach us about at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es that sur@@ rou@@ nd us and that are close .
"But mo@@ re@@ over , what we learn from these plan@@ ets can be app@@ li@@ ed to at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es every@@ where , inclu@@ ding plan@@ ets that we &apos;re now ob@@ ser@@ ving around other star@@ s ."
"For example , the K@@ ep@@ ler sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft , which is built and contro@@ l@@ led here in B@@ ou@@ l@@ der , has been ob@@ ser@@ ving a pos@@ ta@@ ge st@@ am@@ p@@ -@@ si@@ zed regi@@ on of the sk@@ y for a couple years now , and it &apos;s found thousands of plan@@ ets — in one pos@@ ta@@ ge st@@ am@@ p@@ -@@ si@@ zed regi@@ on of the sk@@ y that we don &apos;t think is any different from any other part of the sk@@ y ."
"We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from kno@@ wing of z@@ ero plan@@ ets outside of our so@@ lar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to inv@@ esti@@ g@@ ate first ."
An@@ y le@@ ver will help .
"In fact , based on ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations that K@@ ep@@ ler &apos;s taken and other simi@@ lar ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations , we now believe that , of the 200 billion star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay ga@@ la@@ x@@ y alone , on average , every sta@@ r has at least one planet ."
"In ad@@ dition to that , esti@@ mat@@ es sug@@ gest there are some@@ where between 40 billion and 100 billion of those plan@@ ets that we would de@@ f@@ ine as ha@@ bit@@ able in just our ga@@ la@@ x@@ y ."
"We have the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations of those plan@@ ets , but we just don &apos;t know which ones are ha@@ bit@@ able yet ."
"It &apos;s a little bit like being t@@ rapp@@ ed on a red sp@@ ot — ( Laughter ) on a sta@@ ge and kno@@ wing that there are other wor@@ l@@ ds out there and de@@ sp@@ er@@ ately want@@ ing to know more about them , want@@ ing to inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"And so you have to use the tools that you &apos;ve developed around you for V@@ en@@ us , Earth and M@@ ars , and you have to app@@ ly them to these other situ@@ ations , and hope that you &apos;re making reas@@ ona@@ ble inf@@ er@@ ences from the data , and that you &apos;re going to be able to det@@ er@@ mine the best can@@ di@@ dat@@ es for ha@@ bit@@ able plan@@ ets , and those that are not ."
"In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red sp@@ ot , right here ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s ha@@ bit@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
"But for now , this is the only ha@@ bit@@ able planet , and this is our red sp@@ ot ."
I &apos;m really gla@@ d we &apos;re here .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
( Applause )
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ ink about everything it has brought us .
"Th@@ ink about all the ser@@ vices we use , all the conn@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ity , all the ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the com@@ mer@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be re@@ me@@ mb@@ ered as the generation that got on@@ line , the generation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very seri@@ ous problems , problems with sec@@ ur@@ ity and problems with pri@@ vac@@ y ."
I &apos;ve spent my care@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a fl@@ op@@ p@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch fl@@ op@@ p@@ y dis@@ k inf@@ ected by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vi@@ rus we ever found for P@@ C comp@@ ut@@ ers .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot sec@@ tor of an inf@@ ected fl@@ op@@ p@@ y , and if we take a clos@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the du@@ ng@@ eon . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first nam@@ es , P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i first nam@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ ak@@ i@@ sta@@ n ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vi@@ rus problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ ak@@ i@@ sta@@ n myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of phot@@ os I took while I was in P@@ ak@@ i@@ sta@@ n ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ h@@ ore , which is around 3@@ 00 kil@@ omet@@ ers s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ ta@@ bad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was cau@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a ty@@ pi@@ cal stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad lead@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am blo@@ ck at Al@@ lam@@ a I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gue@@ ss who open@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wr@@ ote the first P@@ C vi@@ rus .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting dis@@ cu@@ ssion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their comp@@ ut@@ ers inf@@ ected do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ rela@@ ted other vi@@ ru@@ ses over these years .
So there is some sort of ju@@ sti@@ ce in the world after all .
"Now , the vi@@ ru@@ ses that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that ena@@ b@@ les me to run ag@@ e-@@ old pro@@ gram@@ s on a mo@@ der@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ ount some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a list of old vi@@ ru@@ ses .
So let me just run some vi@@ ru@@ ses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vi@@ rus first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get inf@@ ected by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected because it actually show@@ s up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the vi@@ rus called C@@ ra@@ sh , inv@@ ented in R@@ us@@ sia in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ i@@ se ) And the last example , gue@@ ss what the W@@ al@@ k@@ er vi@@ rus does ?"
"@@ Yes , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get inf@@ ected ."
"So it used to be fai@@ r@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected by a vi@@ rus , when the vi@@ ru@@ ses were writ@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ yi@@ sts and te@@ ena@@ g@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being writ@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ yi@@ sts and te@@ ena@@ g@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vi@@ ru@@ ses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the back@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our la@@ b@@ s , where we tra@@ ck vi@@ rus inf@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blo@@ c@@ ked vi@@ ru@@ ses in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ ai@@ wan and R@@ us@@ sia and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conn@@ ect back to our lab systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vi@@ ru@@ ses , how many new exam@@ ples of ma@@ l@@ ware we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the la@@ test vi@@ rus we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just ma@@ ssive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hundreds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of ma@@ l@@ ware every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cri@@ mi@@ nal g@@ ang@@ s wr@@ iting these vi@@ ru@@ ses because they make money with their vi@@ ru@@ ses ."
It &apos;s g@@ ang@@ s like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ B@@ u@@ ck@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ site oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying inf@@ ected comp@@ ut@@ ers .
"So if you are a vi@@ rus writ@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of inf@@ ecting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws comp@@ ut@@ ers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those inf@@ ected comp@@ ut@@ ers — somebody else &apos;s comp@@ ut@@ ers — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those comp@@ ut@@ ers .
So how do these guys then mon@@ eti@@ ze those inf@@ ected comp@@ ut@@ ers ?
"Well there &apos;s mul@@ ti@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king t@@ ro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ count@@ s when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers sil@@ ently sit on your computer , hi@@ dd@@ en from view , and they recor@@ d everything you ty@@ pe ."
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Goog@@ le sear@@ ches .
E@@ very single Goog@@ le search you ty@@ pe is sa@@ ved and sent to the cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls .
E@@ very single e@@ mai@@ l you write is sa@@ ved and sent to the cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls .
S@@ ame thing with every single pa@@ ss@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are se@@ ssi@@ ons where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ cha@@ ses in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"Because when you do pur@@ cha@@ ses in on@@ line sto@@ res , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number and the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ration d@@ ate , that &apos;s the sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you g@@ ain access to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and bu@@ y wha@@ tever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mar@@ ket@@ place and business ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ eti@@ zing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the pa@@ ges of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted per@@ s@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in , ori@@ gi@@ nally from S@@ we@@ den , and his par@@ tn@@ er in cri@@ me , also list@@ ed on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted pa@@ ges , M@@ r@@ . S@@ hai@@ le@@ sh@@ ku@@ ma@@ r J@@ ain , a U.S@@ . c@@ itiz@@ en ."
"These guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted millions ."
They are both right now on the run .
N@@ o@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.S@@ . offi@@ ci@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ wi@@ ss b@@ ank ac@@ cou@@ nt bel@@ ong@@ ing to M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain , and that b@@ ank ac@@ cou@@ nt had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S@@ . dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls can actually af@@ for@@ d to inv@@ est into their atta@@ cks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls are hi@@ ring pro@@ gram@@ m@@ ers , hi@@ ring te@@ sting people , te@@ sting their co@@ de , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L da@@ ta@@ bas@@ es ."
And they can af@@ for@@ d to wat@@ ch how we work — like how sec@@ ur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any sec@@ ur@@ ity pre@@ cau@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ la@@ ri@@ fied N@@ et@@ works , which il@@ lu@@ st@@ rat@@ es how one single ma@@ l@@ ware family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be ori@@ gi@@ nally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ site is tried to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e ti@@ ck@@ ets to all the on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls of the world .
"Now , cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls who w@@ er@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls ?
How do you actually tra@@ ck them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exp@@ lo@@ it fi@@ le .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x du@@ m@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an exp@@ lo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image he@@ ad@@ er , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the atta@@ ck star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ y@@ pt it ."
It has been en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R func@@ tion 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now dec@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the ori@@ gi@@ nal ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ se@@ ek@@ .@@ c@@ om / d / i@@ o@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that program .
And that &apos;s a back@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more inter@@ esti@@ ng@@ ly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous st@@ ring , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goog@@ led for it .
I got z@@ ero h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ oke with the guys at the lab .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our la@@ b@@ s , and one of them m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ sia ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car lic@@ en@@ se pla@@ t@@ es and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ site ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own we@@ b@@ site , and he run@@ s a blo@@ g under the popu@@ lar Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ nal ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very ni@@ ce car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ de@@ s@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er eng@@ ine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a ni@@ ce car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-@@ old ki@@ d in S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ gg@@ ed about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ nt@@ own S@@ t@@ . P@@ et@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cra@@ shed his car into another car ."
And he put blo@@ gg@@ ed images about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ad@@ a S@@ a@@ mar@@ a he cra@@ shed into .
And you can actually see that the lic@@ en@@ se pla@@ te of the S@@ a@@ mar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e picture , you can see that the pla@@ te of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls are cau@@ ght ?"
Well in most c@@ ases it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me c@@ ases , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the atta@@ cks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ na@@ ls , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evi@@ dence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I wi@@ sh it would be easi@@ er ; un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it inf@@ ected these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , pro@@ gram@@ ma@@ ble logi@@ c &#91; contro@@ l@@ ler &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our inf@@ ra@@ structure .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no di@@ sp@@ la@@ y , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are pro@@ gram@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the el@@ ev@@ at@@ ors in this building most likely are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net inf@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a ma@@ ssive rev@@ olution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cr@@ iti@@ cal inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power plant , any chemi@@ cal plant , any food proce@@ ssing plant , you look around — everything is being run by comp@@ ut@@ ers ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by comp@@ ut@@ ers .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these comp@@ ut@@ ers working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on ba@@ sic things like electri@@ city , obvi@@ ously , on comp@@ ut@@ ers working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if comp@@ ut@@ ers fai@@ l .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ pa@@ re@@ d@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for g@@ r@@ ant@@ ed are@@ n &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very ba@@ sic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about bac@@ ku@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ ink about all the ser@@ vices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ ink about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see be@@ au@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ri@@ ed that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a risk of los@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find on@@ line cri@@ mi@@ nal g@@ ang@@ s — these organiz@@ ed g@@ ang@@ s that are making millions out of their atta@@ cks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vi@@ ru@@ ses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ wal@@ ls .
"What actually ma@@ tt@@ ers is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these atta@@ cks , and even more import@@ antly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ il@@ ls , but without the opportun@@ ities and give them the opportun@@ ities to use their sk@@ il@@ ls for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by o@@ ffer@@ ing you a free no@@ -@@ t@@ ech life ha@@ ck , and all it requi@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sma@@ l@@ ler ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ ci@@ nat@@ ed with body language , and we &apos;re particu@@ larly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ te@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ sha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ u@@ mber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ im@@ es .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communic@@ ation ."
"When we think about communic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and inf@@ er@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really mean@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pr@@ om@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ ini A@@ mb@@ ad@@ y , a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ versity , show@@ s that when people wat@@ ch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ patient inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s ni@@ c@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be sue@@ d ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . Ri@@ ght ?"
"We are also inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ st . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a comp@@ et@@ itive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interested in power d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
I became e@@ specially interested in non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pre@@ ssi@@ ons of power and d@@ om@@ in@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pre@@ ssi@@ ons of power and d@@ om@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the anima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about ex@@ pan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ ening up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ ening up .
"This ex@@ pre@@ ssion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ e@@ ssi@@ ca T@@ rac@@ y has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sma@@ l@@ ler . We don &apos;t mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavior in the cla@@ ss@@ room , and what do I noti@@ ce ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vi@@ r@@ tually col@@ lap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I noti@@ ce a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ally less powerful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion count@@ s for half the gra@@ de ."
So business scho@@ ols have been stru@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de g@@ ap .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , ok@@ ay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing ."
There &apos;s some evi@@ dence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mi@@ le by hol@@ ding a pen in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more opti@@ mi@@ stic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stre@@ ss ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s d@@ om@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stre@@ ss re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ rob@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evi@@ dence , both that the body can sha@@ pe the mind , at least at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can sha@@ pe the mind ."
"So what happens , ok@@ ay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ecting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seems that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social thre@@ at situ@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recor@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
P@@ eople ha@@ te this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the con@@ diti@@ ons .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re bri@@ ng@@ ing to the spe@@ ech .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had id@@ enti@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ is@@ h colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to sta@@ y , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ Li@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feeling ."
"@@ Li@@ ke , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ na@@ li@@ ze .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y t@@ we@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ wo minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that situ@@ ation feeling like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"@@ Gre@@ at cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity . In times of need , we need great cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity ."

C@@ re@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is the me@@ me@@ -@@ mak@@ er that put@@ s s@@ lo@@ g@@ ans on our t-@@ shi@@ r@@ ts and ph@@ ra@@ ses on our li@@ ps .
It &apos;s the pa@@ th@@ fin@@ der that show@@ s us a simple ro@@ ad through an im@@ pen@@ et@@ ra@@ ble mo@@ ral ma@@ ze .
"S@@ ci@@ ence is cle@@ ver , but great cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is something less know@@ able , more ma@@ gi@@ cal . And now we need that ma@@ gi@@ c ."
This is a time of need .
"O@@ ur climate is changing quickly , too quickly ."
And great cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is needed to do what it does so well : to pro@@ v@@ oke us to think differ@@ ently with dra@@ ma@@ tic cre@@ ative sta@@ te@@ ments .
T@@ o te@@ mp@@ t us to act differ@@ ently with deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful cre@@ ative sc@@ rap@@ s .
Here is one such sc@@ rap from an in@@ iti@@ ative I &apos;m inv@@ olved in using cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity to inspi@@ re people to be gre@@ en@@ er .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ e and wonderful things he would not o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se have seen .
A de@@ er with an it@@ ch@@ y le@@ g . A fl@@ ying mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle .
A father and d@@ aughter se@@ pa@@ rated from a bi@@ cy@@ cle by a my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous w@@ all .
And then he st@@ op@@ ped . W@@ al@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed with him through fiel@@ ds and b@@ rok@@ en his heart .
"S@@ u@@ re , she had ag@@ ed a little ."
"In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot ."
But he felt all his old pa@@ ssion for her re@@ turn .
"@@ &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ d , &quot; &quot; he called sof@@ tly . F@@ or that was her name ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t say another word , G@@ u@@ st@@ y , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; I know a t@@ ent next to a ca@@ ra@@ v@@ an , exactly 3@@ 00 y@@ ar@@ ds from here ."
"@@ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the t@@ ent . &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ d und@@ re@@ ssed . She sp@@ read one le@@ g , and then the other ."
"@@ G@@ u@@ st@@ y ent@@ ered her b@@ ol@@ dly and made love to her r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ cally while she fil@@ med him , because she was a ke@@ en ama@@ te@@ ur por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ er ."
The ear@@ th mo@@ ved for both of them .
And they li@@ ved together happ@@ i@@ ly ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
"( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ ob@@ s@@ ba@@ w@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the de@@ b@@ ate ."

"B@@ ea@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . Ri@@ ght ?
"So , I &apos;m going to cou@@ nt to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ dience : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ ma@@ zing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ dience : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gue@@ se , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
Au@@ dience : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Ri@@ ght ?"
"It literally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Ri@@ ght ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . Ri@@ ght ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because perc@@ ep@@ tion is grou@@ n@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ Ri@@ ght ? The brain takes mean@@ ing@@ less information and makes mean@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was u@@ se@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? W@@ hi@@ ch means , when it comes to perc@@ ep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) Ri@@ ght ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s u@@ se@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ yed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about perc@@ ep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And perc@@ ep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our h@@ op@@ es , our dre@@ am@@ s , the c@@ lo@@ the@@ s we we@@ ar , fal@@ ling in love , everything beg@@ ins with perc@@ ep@@ tion ."
"Now if perc@@ ep@@ tion is grou@@ n@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new perc@@ ep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y is a very bad thing . It &apos;s ev@@ olu@@ ti@@ ona@@ ri@@ ly a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too late ."
O@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ a@@ si@@ ck@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y .
"@@ Ri@@ ght ? If you go down bel@@ ow on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m standing still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dang@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y ."
"And yet , the i@@ ron@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tu@@ nately , ev@@ olution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it ena@@ b@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Ri@@ ght ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ yon@@ d the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pp@@ ing into that space ."
So what is ev@@ olution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ la@@ y is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y is actually cel@@ e@@ b@@ rated . U@@ n@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y is what makes play fu@@ n .
"@@ Ri@@ ght ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . Ri@@ ght ? It op@@ ens possi@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bon@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically moti@@ v@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ la@@ y is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od sec@@ tion of a paper .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 ei@@ gh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ ena down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . Ri@@ ght ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fund@@ ing for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a u@@ se@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . Ri@@ ght ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science pu@@ b@@ lic@@ ation the last five to 15 years . Ri@@ ght ?"
So they were asking questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to exper@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the sta@@ ge with someone quite speci@@ al . Ri@@ ght ?"
"She was one of the young people who was inv@@ olved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the you@@ ng@@ est publi@@ shed scientists in the world . Ri@@ ght ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to sta@@ ge , will be the you@@ ng@@ est person to ever speak at TED . Ri@@ ght ?"
"Now , science and asking questions is about coura@@ ge ."
"Now she is the per@@ son@@ i@@ fic@@ ation of coura@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you p@@ le@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton B@@ e@@ es P@@ ro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ o@@ ole : Thank you , B@@ ea@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the lin@@ k between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought simi@@ lar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might solve complex problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new situ@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and con@@ diti@@ ons . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ s@@ ect with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can recogni@@ ze a good f@@ low@@ er re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they desig@@ ned this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain col@@ or , but to a certain col@@ or f@@ low@@ er only when it &apos;s in a certain patter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by the blue , or if the blue f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the be@@ es can learn to solve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and B@@ ea@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ c@@ lu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a cl@@ ue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teach@@ er not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it goes to D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck , who was the col@@ labo@@ rat@@ or on this project . O@@ kay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ tail@@ s of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is ob@@ ser@@ vation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations . They &apos;re recor@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es f@@ ly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Yeah .
"D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ wi@@ ck : So you keep tra@@ ck of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Ri@@ ght ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cs , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ mit this for pu@@ b@@ lic@@ ation . Ri@@ ght ? So we have to write it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , ok@@ ay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sec@@ tions : an int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ tho@@ ds , a resul@@ ts , a dis@@ cu@@ ssion ."
"The int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ tho@@ ds , what did you do ? Re@@ sul@@ ts , what was the ob@@ ser@@ vation ?"
"And the dis@@ cu@@ ssion is , who ca@@ res ? Ri@@ ght ?"
"That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a na@@ r@@ ra@@ tive , which means that this paper is writ@@ ten in ki@@ d@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not writ@@ ten by me . It &apos;s writ@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the cla@@ ss . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science paper beg@@ ins , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resul@@ ts sec@@ tion , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining pha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; Ri@@ ght ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ tho@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mi@@ le@@ y face . Ri@@ ght ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the tit@@ le pa@@ ge . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in bo@@ ld are eight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton P@@ ri@@ ma@@ ry S@@ cho@@ ol , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ en@@ ced , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individu@@ al . So we sub@@ mit it to a public access jour@@ nal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d the paper fai@@ ls our in@@ iti@@ al quality control chec@@ ks in se@@ ver@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once up@@ on a time , &quot; &quot; the figu@@ res are in cra@@ yon , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed . So I sent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the lead@@ ing neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most ori@@ gi@@ nal science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly de@@ ser@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ u@@ re . &quot;"
"@@ L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vi@@ sion , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ sha@@ ble if done by a@@ du@@ l@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We s@@ end it back to the e@@ dit@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ a@@ ta@@ li@@ e H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to write a com@@ men@@ ta@@ ry situ@@ ating the fin@@ di@@ ngs for scientists , right , put@@ ting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vie@@ w@@ ed by five in@@ depen@@ dent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . O@@ kay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ pi@@ cal science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the you@@ ng@@ est publi@@ shed scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ dit@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ oice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver fre@@ ely ac@@ ce@@ ssi@@ ble by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be fre@@ ely ac@@ ce@@ ssi@@ ble by this jour@@ nal .
"@@ L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed paper by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton B@@ e@@ es &apos; rec@@ ently . I don &apos;t have words to expla@@ in exactly how I am feeling right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , inno@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most ba@@ sic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ al@@ ities more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ late your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ c@@ lu@@ de with a physical me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Yeah ye@@ ah . O@@ kay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . Ri@@ ght ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ h@@ im@@ on S@@ cho@@ ck@@ en : Ri@@ ght , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . Ri@@ ght . O@@ kay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) O@@ kay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ lap@@ ping ) ( C@@ lap@@ ping ) O@@ kay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ u@@ dience : ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) W@@ here &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ Ri@@ ght ? We nor@@ ma@@ lly walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y . W@@ hen he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the possi@@ bility to step on un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and ena@@ b@@ ling to ex@@ pre@@ ss that voice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last voice in this sh@@ ort story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it brought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it show@@ ed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the pot@@ ential to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all depen@@ ds on the way the person fe@@ els about change .
"But changing the way I thought about science was surpri@@ sing@@ ly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we pla@@ yed the g@@ am@@ es and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ ject , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of B@@ ea@@ u , and the B@@ la@@ c@@ ka@@ w@@ ton B@@ e@@ e P@@ ro@@ ject ."
Thank you@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bi@@ g@@ gest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ pti@@ cal E@@ n@@ viron@@ men@@ ta@@ list &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your pen and paper .
"B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ wo billion people without san@@ it@@ ation .
There are se@@ ver@@ al million people d@@ ying of H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two bil@@ lions of people who will be se@@ ver@@ ely aff@@ ected by climate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the econom@@ y se@@ ssion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We id@@ enti@@ fied 10 of the bi@@ g@@ gest challeng@@ es in the world , and I will just bri@@ ef@@ ly read them : climate change , communic@@ able dise@@ ases , con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts , education , fin@@ an@@ cial in@@ sta@@ bility , gover@@ nan@@ ce and cor@@ rup@@ tion , ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition and hu@@ ng@@ er , population mi@@ gra@@ tion , san@@ it@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ compa@@ ss the bi@@ g@@ gest problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the bi@@ g@@ gest things ?"
W@@ here should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ av@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focu@@ s on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Su@@ rely the bi@@ g@@ gest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ or@@ iti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ or@@ iti@@ ze solu@@ tions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
T@@ o climate change that would be like K@@ yot@@ o .
"T@@ o communic@@ able dise@@ ases , it might be health cl@@ in@@ ics or mos@@ qu@@ it@@ o n@@ ets ."
"T@@ o con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ ke@@ ep@@ ing for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an im@@ possible ta@@ s@@ k — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ or@@ ities ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econom@@ ics gets evi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ tom of the list ?
"P@@ le@@ ase , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your ne@@ igh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ or@@ ities and the bot@@ tom pri@@ or@@ ities of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s bi@@ g@@ gest i@@ ssues ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also st@@ rong@@ ly en@@ coura@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these dis@@ cu@@ ssi@@ ons af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ or@@ iti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ or@@ itiz@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
N@@ o@@ body want@@ s to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a list ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also ha@@ te to be not on the top of the list .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ nu@@ mb@@ er@@ -@@ one sp@@ ots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perf@@ ect sense not to want to do such a list ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamen@@ tal list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ or@@ iti@@ zing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ or@@ itiz@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ or@@ iti@@ zing , if only imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ likely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ or@@ itiz@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m prop@@ os@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situ@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pri@@ ces , no@@ r the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ mag@@ ine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u c@@ ard , but you have no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"You know , you have a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pri@@ ce is ."
"It could be at one dol@@ lar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a f@@ am@@ il@@ y-@@ size pi@@ z@@ z@@ a ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size pi@@ z@@ z@@ a , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pri@@ ces on these i@@ ssues .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economi@@ sts , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top economi@@ sts write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the bene@@ fit of that ?
L@@ ik@@ e@@ wi@@ se in communic@@ able dise@@ ases .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pri@@ ce ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top economi@@ sts , eight of the world &apos;s top economi@@ sts , inclu@@ ding three N@@ o@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen in Ma@@ y 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ versity pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econom@@ ics .
"That works very well in E@@ uro@@ pe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ or@@ iti@@ zed list .
"And then you ask , why economi@@ sts ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a , you ask a ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about climate , you ask a cli@@ ma@@ to@@ logi@@ st ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what economi@@ sts do .
They pri@@ or@@ iti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ sting ta@@ s@@ k of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ site , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad pro@@ jects — basically , pro@@ jects where if you inv@@ est a dol@@ lar , you get less than a dol@@ lar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fai@@ r pro@@ jects , good pro@@ jects and very good pro@@ jects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good pro@@ jects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from back@@ wards so that we end up with the best pro@@ jects .
These were the bad pro@@ jects .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ tom of the list was climate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , either ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cu@@ ri@@ ous ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with on the list that you wr@@ ote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ yot@@ o — or doing something more than K@@ yot@@ o — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very ine@@ ffi@@ cient .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the average of all ma@@ cr@@ oe@@ con@@ omi@@ c mo@@ d@@ els , is that K@@ yot@@ o , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment ai@@ d that we give the Th@@ i@@ rd Wor@@ ld every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mo@@ d@@ els show it will pos@@ t@@ p@@ one war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh who gets a flo@@ od in 2@@ 100 can wai@@ t until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
"W@@ hi@@ ch is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually esti@@ mate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could solve all maj@@ or ba@@ sic problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , san@@ it@@ ation , ba@@ sic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend t@@ wi@@ ce the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it bec@@ omes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The fai@@ r pro@@ jects — noti@@ ce I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communic@@ able dise@@ ases , scale of ba@@ sic health ser@@ vices — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of ba@@ sic health ser@@ vices is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cos@@ tly ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , what it tel@@ ls us is sudd@@ en@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good pro@@ jects , a lot of san@@ it@@ ation and water pro@@ jects came in ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , san@@ it@@ ation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also cos@@ ts a lot of inf@@ ra@@ structure ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ or@@ ities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a — de@@ al@@ ing with ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a .
The in@@ ci@@ dence of ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get inf@@ ected every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge point of G@@ D@@ P every year for aff@@ ected na@@ tions .
"If we invest@@ ed about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ ci@@ dence down to half ."
"We could av@@ oi@@ d about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more import@@ antly , we could av@@ oi@@ d about a &#91; million &#93; people getting inf@@ ected every year ."
"We would sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ antly incre@@ ase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global war@@ ming ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ a@@ sically , the model show@@ ed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and e@@ specially cut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.S@@ . and E@@ uro@@ pe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global econom@@ y to an ast@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would ac@@ c@@ rue to the Th@@ i@@ rd Wor@@ ld ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , the point is to say that we could actually pu@@ ll two to three hund@@ red million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very radi@@ cally fast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focu@@ s on ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition .
"N@@ ot just ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very che@@ ap way of de@@ al@@ ing with ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition , nam@@ ely , the lack of mic@@ ron@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents ."
"B@@ a@@ sically , about half of the world &apos;s population is la@@ c@@ king in i@@ ron , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and v@@ itam@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inv@@ est about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best invest@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focu@@ s on H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ a@@ sically , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could av@@ oi@@ d 2@@ 8 new million c@@ ases of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , what this does and what it focu@@ ses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inv@@ est first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this focu@@ ses on is saying , we can do a lot more by invest@@ ing in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"B@@ a@@ sically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So again , what we focu@@ s on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first rate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ or@@ ities .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity list and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ likely that we should do that ."
"We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focu@@ s on problems , that we focu@@ s on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling , one of the parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ants in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ ch@@ er ."
E@@ ven the most pe@@ ssi@@ mi@@ stic imp@@ act sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
esti@@ mate that the average person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as ri@@ ch as we are today .
"M@@ u@@ ch more likely , they will be two to four times ri@@ ch@@ er than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ ch@@ er than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fai@@ r@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fai@@ r@@ ly ri@@ ch D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real poor people , right now , in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ el@@ ling put it , imagine if you were a ri@@ ch — as you will be — a ri@@ ch Ch@@ ine@@ se , a ri@@ ch B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a ri@@ ch C@@ ong@@ o@@ le@@ se , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they ca@@ red so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through climate change , and ca@@ red so fai@@ r@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my grand@@ father and my great grand@@ father , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ ped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ or@@ ities st@@ rai@@ ght ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the ty@@ pi@@ cal way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because climate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay A@@ f@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good fil@@ m in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t exp@@ ect E@@ m@@ mer@@ i@@ ch to ca@@ st B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movi@@ e di@@ gg@@ ing la@@ tr@@ ines in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movi@@ e ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole dis@@ cu@@ ssion of pri@@ or@@ ities as a de@@ f@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a fal@@ se choice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the developed world decided we were going to spend t@@ wi@@ ce as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ in@@ ce then our ai@@ d has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pat@@ h of sudd@@ en@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ us@@ h into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real is@@ sue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ or@@ ities .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ ef@@ ly , is this really the right list that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economi@@ sts , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up asking old , wh@@ ite American men ."
"And they &apos;re not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
"The only two requi@@ re@@ ments were that they were stud@@ ying at the univer@@ sity , and they sp@@ oke Eng@@ lish ."
"The maj@@ or@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same material but they could go v@@ ast@@ ly outside the s@@ co@@ pe of dis@@ cu@@ ssion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the surpri@@ sing thing was that the list was very simi@@ lar — with ma@@ l@@ nu@@ tr@@ ition and dise@@ ases at the top and climate change at the bot@@ tom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ mi@@ na@@ r@@ s and univer@@ sity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same list .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pat@@ h a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ or@@ ities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen C@@ on@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ sem@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
M@@ ap out the right pat@@ h for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with the dis@@ cu@@ ssion of how we actually pri@@ or@@ iti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and f@@ r@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ or@@ ities , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A cu@@ ri@@ ous little inv@@ en@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe .
What it allow@@ s you to do is see tiny little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are in@@ vi@@ sible to the nak@@ ed eye .
S@@ o@@ on comes the medi@@ cal disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually cau@@ ses of terri@@ ble human dise@@ ases .
"I@@ mag@@ ine what happened to the society when they realized that an Eng@@ lish mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ in@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast forward 200 years .
"We still have this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the develop@@ ing countries around the tr@@ op@@ ical bel@@ t ."
"@@ Just for ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be te@@ sted because they are at risk for different species of ma@@ la@@ ri@@ al inf@@ ec@@ tions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ st@@ ers .
"You take a sta@@ in , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ ang@@ e or a f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent sta@@ in or G@@ i@@ em@@ sa , and a mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"W@@ h@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in K@@ en@@ ya , F@@ ati@@ ma in B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh , N@@ av@@ jo@@ ot in Mu@@ mb@@ ai , and Ju@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ g@@ an@@ da still wai@@ t months to be able to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose why they are si@@ ck ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ ma@@ ri@@ ly because sc@@ a@@ la@@ bility of the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ti@@ cs is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe itself .
"E@@ ven though the pin@@ na@@ cle of mo@@ der@@ n science , research mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es are not desig@@ ned for field te@@ sting ."
N@@ either were they first desig@@ ned for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ti@@ cs at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , bu@@ l@@ k@@ y , really hard to ma@@ in@@ tain , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ ha@@ t@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 4@@ 0s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his as@@ h@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in India .
"T@@ wo of my students , J@@ i@@ m and J@@ am@@ es , tra@@ vel@@ ed around India and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , star@@ ting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of do@@ nat@@ ed e@@ qui@@ pm@@ ent .
We saw fu@@ ng@@ us growing on mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe l@@ en@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a func@@ ti@@ onal mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pe ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ co@@ pe is a completely func@@ ti@@ onal mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe , a pla@@ t@@ form for f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field , po@@ la@@ ri@@ z@@ ation , pro@@ j@@ ection , all kinds of adv@@ an@@ ced mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y built pu@@ rely by fol@@ ding paper ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single s@@ he@@ et of paper .
What you see here is all the possible comp@@ on@@ ents to build a func@@ ti@@ onal bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field and f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ence mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe .
"So , there are three sta@@ ges : There is the opti@@ cal sta@@ ge , the il@@ lu@@ mi@@ nation sta@@ ge and the ma@@ sk@@ -@@ hol@@ ding sta@@ ge ."
And there are mic@@ ro opti@@ cs at the bot@@ tom that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the paper itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are pla@@ ying like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This paper has no in@@ struc@@ tions and no langu@@ ag@@ es .
"There is a co@@ de , a col@@ or co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that tel@@ ls you exactly how to fo@@ ld that speci@@ fic mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the func@@ ti@@ ona@@ l@@ ities of a stan@@ d@@ ard mic@@ ros@@ co@@ pe , just like an X@@ Y sta@@ ge , a place where a sam@@ ple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stan@@ d@@ ard that &apos;s been opti@@ mi@@ zed for over the years , and many health work@@ ers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what changes , but the stan@@ d@@ ard sta@@ ins all re@@ main the same for many different dise@@ ases ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y sta@@ ge , and then there is a focu@@ sing sta@@ ge , which is a f@@ le@@ x@@ u@@ re me@@ chan@@ ism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allow@@ s us to move and focu@@ s the l@@ en@@ ses by mic@@ ron st@@ ep@@ s ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students ha@@ te when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ gg@@ ed de@@ vices ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re desig@@ ned from a very f@@ le@@ xi@@ ble material , like paper ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fu@@ n fact is , this is what we actually s@@ end out there as a stan@@ d@@ ard di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic to@@ ol , but here in this en@@ vel@@ o@@ pe I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es of different con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pi@@ ck one rand@@ om@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually desig@@ ned speci@@ fi@@ cally for ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a , because it has the f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent fil@@ ters built speci@@ fi@@ cally for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es comes out of this .
"So up ti@@ ll now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the li@@ ghts , p@@ le@@ ase , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es are also pro@@ j@@ ection mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es ."
"I have these two mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of a comp@@ ound eye , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ o@@ om in clos@@ er , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is ."
You actually see how the l@@ en@@ ses are cut together in the c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion patter@@ n .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fav@@ or@@ ite in@@ s@@ ects , I love to ha@@ te this one , is a mos@@ qu@@ it@@ o , and you &apos;re seeing the ant@@ en@@ na of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
Ri@@ ght there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been field te@@ sting some of our mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es by wa@@ shing my c@@ lo@@ the@@ s wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the dr@@ y@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ sc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also show@@ s you how the pro@@ j@@ ection s@@ co@@ pe works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ected and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it cos@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the bi@@ g@@ gest idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and cos@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allow@@ s us to do is to think about a new pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m in mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y , which we call u@@ se@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ th@@ row mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a quic@@ k snap@@ sh@@ ot of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a s@@ he@@ et of paper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 s@@ he@@ et of paper .
These are the three sta@@ ges that you actually see .
"And the opti@@ cal comp@@ on@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture l@@ en@@ ses in paper itself at really high throu@@ gh@@ put@@ s , so it us@@ es a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly and surface ten@@ sion to build ach@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic l@@ en@@ ses in the paper itself ."
So that &apos;s where the l@@ en@@ ses go .
There are some light sources .
"And ess@@ entially , in the end , all the parts line up because of ori@@ g@@ am@@ i , because of the fact that ori@@ g@@ am@@ i allow@@ s us mic@@ ron@@ -@@ scale preci@@ sion of opti@@ cal ali@@ g@@ nm@@ ent ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the a@@ sp@@ ects of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fai@@ r@@ ly so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated ."
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , ty@@ pi@@ cally , if I was going to show that these mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es are ro@@ bu@@ st , is go to the third flo@@ or and d@@ rop it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next step actually is really fin@@ i@@ shing our field tri@@ als ."
We are star@@ ting at the end of the sum@@ mer .
We are at a sta@@ ge where we &apos;ll be making thousands of mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the high@@ est den@@ sity of mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ es ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started coll@@ ecting data for ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a , C@@ ha@@ g@@ as disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from patients themselves ."

O@@ ur world has many super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ pow@@ ers : in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
"For example , the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res , work@@ ers who coll@@ ect rec@@ y@@ cla@@ ble materi@@ als for a living ."
"C@@ a@@ ta@@ do@@ res emer@@ g@@ ed from social ine@@ quality , un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , and the ab@@ und@@ ance of so@@ li@@ d wa@@ ste from the de@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy of the wa@@ ste coll@@ ection system ."
"C@@ a@@ ta@@ do@@ res provi@@ de a he@@ av@@ y , hon@@ est and ess@@ ential work that bene@@ f@@ its the entire population . But they are not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ed for it ."
"H@@ ere in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , they coll@@ ect 90 percent of all the wa@@ ste that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ c@@ led ."
"M@@ ost of the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res work in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently , pic@@ king wa@@ ste from the stre@@ ets and sel@@ ling to j@@ un@@ k y@@ ar@@ ds at very low pri@@ ces ."
"They may coll@@ ect over 3@@ 00 ki@@ lo@@ s in their b@@ ag@@ s , sh@@ op@@ ping car@@ ts , bi@@ cy@@ cles and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from wo@@ od or me@@ tal and found in se@@ ver@@ al stre@@ ets in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , much like gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gi@@ na@@ li@@ zed super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i arti@@ st and ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st and my art is social , environ@@ mental and political in nature ."
"In 200@@ 7 , I took my work be@@ yon@@ d wal@@ ls and on@@ to the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new ur@@ b@@ an supp@@ ort for my messa@@ ge ."
"But at this time , giving voice to the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and hu@@ m@@ or to the c@@ ause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which hel@@ ped call attention to the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res and impro@@ ve their self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m ."
"And also , they are f@@ am@@ ous now on the stre@@ ets , on ma@@ ss media and social ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ u@@ ng@@ ed into this universe and have not st@@ op@@ ped working since ."
I have pain@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been inv@@ ited to do ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iti@@ ons and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
"And then I realized that ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res , in their in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility , are not exc@@ lu@@ sive to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
"I met them in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina , C@@ hi@@ le , B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , S@@ outh Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in developed countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the c@@ ause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
"And then , I created a col@@ labo@@ ra@@ tive movement called P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent to help ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"C@@ a@@ ta@@ do@@ res are as@@ si@@ sted by w@@ ell@@ -@@ being profe@@ ssi@@ ona@@ ls and heal@@ th@@ care , like physi@@ ci@@ ans , d@@ enti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ sts , hair st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , ma@@ ssa@@ ge ther@@ ap@@ i@@ sts and much more ."
"But also , they also re@@ cei@@ ve sa@@ f@@ ety shi@@ r@@ ts , g@@ lo@@ ves , ra@@ in@@ co@@ ats and e@@ ye@@ gla@@ sses to see in high@@ -@@ defin@@ ition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated by our incredible v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they re@@ cei@@ ve sa@@ f@@ ety it@@ ems , too : re@@ fl@@ ective tap@@ es , hor@@ ns and mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bi@@ le art ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition ."
"P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the stre@@ ets of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ au@@ l@@ o , Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ ei@@ ro and C@@ ur@@ iti@@ b@@ a ."
"But to me@@ et the de@@ m@@ and in other cities , inclu@@ ding outside of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is inspi@@ red by TE@@ D@@ x , and it &apos;s a simp@@ li@@ fied , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ed@@ ition of P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a ."
So now everybody can jo@@ in .
"In two years , over 1@@ 70 ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res , 8@@ 00 v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and 200 stre@@ et arti@@ sts and more than 1@@ ,000 don@@ ors have been inv@@ olved in the P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a movement , wh@@ ose ac@@ tions have even been used in teach@@ ing rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling at a local school ."
So ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res are lea@@ ving in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility behind and bec@@ om@@ ing incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly resp@@ ected and val@@ ue@@ d .
"Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ing the ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res and other in@@ vi@@ sible super@@ her@@ o@@ es from your city ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"B@@ eli@@ e@@ ve it or not , there are over 20 million ca@@ ta@@ do@@ res wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , recogni@@ ze them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ it@@ o ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , than@@ k you ."
( Applause ) .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ em@@ plo@@ yed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the long@@ est rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mi@@ les ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ ine@@ se cha@@ rac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me to@@ tally b@@ lan@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perf@@ ect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Ch@@ ine@@ se cha@@ rac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just sta@@ res at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she c@@ rac@@ ks up , because she figu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) Ri@@ ght , the f@@ am@@ ous Ch@@ ine@@ se cha@@ rac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mi@@ s@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a st@@ range care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge : no job comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t .
We all know everybody in this room makes mi@@ sta@@ k@@ es .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is fal@@ li@@ ble — ok@@ ay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , sudd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t ap@@ preci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ eti@@ ngs in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , t@@ rapp@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feeling very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our personal and profe@@ ssi@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feeling of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to conv@@ in@@ ce you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single great@@ est mo@@ ral , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual and cre@@ ative le@@ ap you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feeling of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emoti@@ ona@@ lly — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ u@@ mb@@ s down .
"E@@ mb@@ ar@@ ra@@ ssing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , thu@@ mb@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ssing — than@@ k you , these are great answ@@ ers , but they &apos;re answ@@ ers to a different question ."
You guys are answ@@ ering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ v@@ as@@ ta@@ ting , it can be re@@ ve@@ la@@ t@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Ch@@ ine@@ se cha@@ rac@@ ter mi@@ sta@@ ke ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remember that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ yot@@ e who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ yot@@ e is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bi@@ rd , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ yot@@ e run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ yot@@ e &apos;s to@@ tally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he fal@@ ls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ yot@@ e after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in t@@ rou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tural reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feeling of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ nal c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cul@@ tural .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ ry school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in cla@@ ss , and your teach@@ er is han@@ ding back qui@@ z pap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not mine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this paper ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b ki@@ d , the t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ zy , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to succe@@ ed in life is to never make any mi@@ sta@@ k@@ es ."
We learn these really bad le@@ ss@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ sp@@ ect , e@@ specially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just bec@@ om@@ ing perf@@ ect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ i@@ sts , over@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ Ri@@ ght , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ ma@@ ra@@ thon@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ ma@@ ra@@ thon@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h Is@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ent@@ er for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ et@@ h Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing hospit@@ al for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best hospit@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ e@@ s@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — st@@ it@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she wak@@ es up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ for@@ med a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care quality at B@@ et@@ h Is@@ ra@@ el sp@@ oke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or wha@@ tever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ sting too much in the feeling of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very dang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ nal sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ nal world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of oi@@ l into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global econom@@ y ."
So this is a huge practi@@ cal problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just perf@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to expla@@ in all of those people who di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expla@@ in those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tu@@ nate as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with us , then we move on to a second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion : they know the truth , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own ma@@ le@@ v@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ phe .
This atta@@ ch@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mi@@ sta@@ k@@ es when we absol@@ utely need to and cau@@ ses us to tre@@ at each other terri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mi@@ sses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perf@@ ec@@ tly trans@@ lu@@ c@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ rac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ e@@ sc@@ ar@@ t@@ es said his f@@ am@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , sat down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ al@@ l@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine under@@ sto@@ od that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ssing de@@ f@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s to@@ tally fundamen@@ tal to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ se@@ ssed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ se@@ ssion is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tiv@@ ity and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity ."
"@@ L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself list@@ ening to a lot of e@@ pi@@ so@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ ening and I &apos;m list@@ ening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ zy w@@ rong@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ la@@ ss , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a sta@@ ff , we j@@ oke that every single e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ la@@ ss , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ s@@ al and w@@ rong@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience me@@ mbers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot t@@ wi@@ sts and red her@@ ri@@ ngs and surpri@@ se en@@ di@@ ngs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ us@@ h thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a bun@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ struc@@ tion , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ c@@ rac@@ y to the Mi@@ ddle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ ba@@ ra@@ k thought he was going to be the dic@@ tat@@ or of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pa@@ ss the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ we@@ e@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ omet@@ own and rai@@ se a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody ha@@ t@@ es for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ es us ."
"N@@ o off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about inno@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ em@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents , but you know why we need all of those inno@@ v@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ em@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )@@ "
"W@@ here &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ac@@ k , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )@@ "
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ ster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
Ma@@ ybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

"We ar@@ ri@@ ved at C@@ al@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing R@@ ang@@ e , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being wat@@ ched by the F@@ B@@ I ."
"When it was my turn to sho@@ ot , my father hel@@ ped me hold the ri@@ f@@ le to my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der and expla@@ ined how to aim at the tar@@ get about 30 y@@ ar@@ ds off ."
"That day , the last bu@@ l@@ let I sh@@ ot h@@ it the small or@@ ang@@ e light that sat on top of the tar@@ get and to everyone &apos;s surpri@@ se , e@@ specially mine , the entire tar@@ get bu@@ rst into f@@ lam@@ es ."
"My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in A@@ ra@@ bi@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke father , like son ."
"They all se@@ em@@ ed to get a really big la@@ u@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully under@@ sto@@ od what they thought was so fun@@ ny ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ struc@@ tion my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ en@@ tually be con@@ vi@@ c@@ ted of pla@@ cing a v@@ an fil@@ led with 1@@ ,@@ 500 p@@ ounds of ex@@ pl@@ osi@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the Wor@@ ld T@@ ra@@ de C@@ ent@@ er &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ ow@@ er , cau@@ sing an ex@@ pl@@ osi@@ on that kil@@ led six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already mo@@ ved 20 times in my life , and that in@@ sta@@ bility during my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od didn &apos;t really provi@@ de an opportunity to make many friends ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel com@@ for@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ac@@ k up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"B@@ e@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tual new face in cla@@ ss , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the tar@@ get of bu@@ l@@ lies ."
"I ke@@ pt my id@@ ent@@ ity a sec@@ re@@ t from my cla@@ ss@@ mat@@ es to av@@ oi@@ d being tar@@ g@@ et@@ ed , but as it turns out , being the qui@@ et , chu@@ b@@ by new ki@@ d in cla@@ ss was more than enough am@@ mun@@ ition ."
"So for the most part , I spent my time at home read@@ ing books and wat@@ ching T@@ V or pla@@ ying video g@@ am@@ es ."
"For those reas@@ ons , my social sk@@ il@@ ls were la@@ c@@ king , to say the least , and growing up in a bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se@@ hold , I wasn &apos;t pre@@ pa@@ red for the real world ."
"I &apos;d been rais@@ ed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bit@@ ra@@ ry mea@@ su@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s ra@@ ce or reli@@ gi@@ on ."
So what open@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that challeng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2@@ 000 pre@@ si@@ d@@ ential elec@@ tions .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ outh C@@ on@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ hi@@ la@@ d@@ el@@ phi@@ a ."
"My particular group &apos;s focu@@ s was on you@@ th viol@@ ence , and having been the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m of bu@@ l@@ l@@ ying for most of my life , this was a sub@@ ject in which I felt particu@@ larly pa@@ ssi@@ o@@ nate ."
The me@@ mbers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh friend before , and f@@ ran@@ kly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ d@@ ens , an am@@ u@@ se@@ ment par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ pos@@ ed to people from all sor@@ ts of fai@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundamen@@ tal to the develop@@ ment of my cha@@ rac@@ ter ."
"M@@ ost of my life , I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght that h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality was a sin , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all ga@@ y people were a ne@@ g@@ ative inf@@ lu@@ ence ."
"As chan@@ ce would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the ga@@ y per@@ for@@ m@@ ers at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ de@@ st , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met ."
"B@@ e@@ ing bu@@ l@@ li@@ ed as a ki@@ d created a sense of em@@ pa@@ thy in me to@@ ward the su@@ ffer@@ ing of others , and it comes very un@@ na@@ tu@@ ra@@ lly to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that feeling , I was able to con@@ tra@@ st the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; O@@ n a ni@@ gh@@ tly bas@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ w@@ art for@@ ced me to be int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry and hel@@ ped me to realize that a person &apos;s ra@@ ce , reli@@ gi@@ on or se@@ x@@ u@@ al ori@@ en@@ tation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s cha@@ rac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in de@@ sp@@ er@@ ate need of one .
"I@@ n@@ spi@@ ration can often come from an un@@ exp@@ ected place , and the fact that a J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh com@@ e@@ di@@ an had done more to pos@@ iti@@ v@@ ely inf@@ lu@@ ence my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view than my own extre@@ mi@@ st father is not lost on me ."
"One day , I had a conver@@ sation with my mother about how my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view was star@@ ting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live ."
"She looked at me with the we@@ ary eyes of someone who had experi@@ en@@ ced enough do@@ g@@ mati@@ sm to last a li@@ fe@@ time , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of ha@@ ting people . &quot;"
"In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ g@@ ative energy it takes to hold that ha@@ t@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our conn@@ ection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and pot@@ entially put myself in dang@@ er ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the h@@ op@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ el@@ led to use viol@@ ence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been sub@@ j@@ ected to this viol@@ ent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ o@@ logy , that I did not become fan@@ ati@@ ci@@ zed ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , against the bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry ."
"I do it for the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism and their lo@@ ved ones , for the terri@@ ble pai@@ n and los@@ s that ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism has for@@ ced up@@ on their lives ."
"For the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that viol@@ ence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s reli@@ gi@@ on or ra@@ ce , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"@@ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )@@ "
"A few years ago , I b@@ rok@@ e into my own house ."
"I had just dri@@ ven home , it was around mi@@ d@@ night in the de@@ ad of M@@ on@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been vi@@ sit@@ ing my friend , J@@ e@@ ff , across to@@ wn , and the ther@@ mom@@ et@@ er on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 de@@ gre@@ es — and don &apos;t bo@@ ther asking if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or F@@ a@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two sc@@ al@@ es me@@ et — it was very co@@ ld ."
"And as I sto@@ od on the front por@@ ch fu@@ mb@@ ling in my po@@ ck@@ ets , I found I didn &apos;t have my ke@@ ys ."
"In fact , I could see them through the win@@ do@@ w , l@@ ying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them ."
"So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws , and they were loc@@ ked ti@@ ght ."
"I thought about cal@@ ling a lo@@ ck@@ s@@ mit@@ h — at least I had my cel@@ l@@ phone , but at mi@@ d@@ night , it could take a while for a lo@@ ck@@ s@@ mit@@ h to show up , and it was co@@ ld ."
"I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend J@@ e@@ ff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early f@@ light to E@@ uro@@ pe the next mor@@ ning , and I needed to get my pas@@ sp@@ ort and my su@@ it@@ case ."
"So , de@@ sp@@ er@@ ate and fre@@ e@@ zing co@@ ld , I found a large ro@@ ck and I b@@ rok@@ e through the ba@@ se@@ ment win@@ do@@ w , c@@ lea@@ red out the shar@@ ds of gla@@ ss , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard and tap@@ ed it up over the op@@ ening , figu@@ ring that in the mor@@ ning , on the way to the ai@@ r@@ por@@ t , I could call my con@@ trac@@ tor and ask him to fi@@ x it ."
"This was going to be ex@@ pen@@ sive , but probably no more ex@@ pen@@ sive than a mi@@ dd@@ le@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night lo@@ ck@@ s@@ mit@@ h , so I figu@@ red , under the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces , I was coming out even ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st by tra@@ ining and I know a little bit about how the brain per@@ for@@ ms under stre@@ ss ."
"It rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l that rais@@ es your heart rate , it mo@@ du@@ la@@ t@@ es ad@@ re@@ na@@ line le@@ vel@@ s and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"So the next mor@@ ning , when I w@@ oke up on too little s@@ le@@ ep , wor@@ r@@ ying about the ho@@ le in the win@@ do@@ w , and a mental not@@ e that I had to call my con@@ trac@@ tor , and the fre@@ e@@ zing tem@@ per@@ atu@@ res , and the me@@ eti@@ ngs I had up@@ coming in E@@ uro@@ pe , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l in my brain , my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cl@@ ou@@ dy because my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy ."
"( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the ai@@ r@@ por@@ t chec@@ k@@ -@@ in count@@ er , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ sp@@ ort . ( Laughter )@@ "
"So I rac@@ ed home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ sp@@ ort , rac@@ ed back to the ai@@ r@@ por@@ t , I made it just in time , but they had given away my se@@ at to someone else , so I got stu@@ ck in the back of the plan@@ e , next to the ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms , in a se@@ at that wouldn &apos;t rec@@ line , on an ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ h@@ our f@@ light ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent bad things from happening ?"
"O@@ r at least if bad things happen , will mini@@ mi@@ ze the lik@@ eli@@ ho@@ od of it being a to@@ tal ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ phe ."
"So I started thinking about that , but my thou@@ ghts didn &apos;t cr@@ y@@ sta@@ l@@ li@@ ze until about a mon@@ th later ."
"I was having din@@ ner with my colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man , the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ se@@ dly told him about having b@@ rok@@ en my win@@ do@@ w , and , you know , for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten my pas@@ sp@@ ort , and D@@ an@@ ny sha@@ red with me that he &apos;d been practi@@ cing something called pros@@ p@@ ective h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had g@@ ot@@ ten from the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ st G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had writ@@ ten about it a few years before , also called the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m ."
"Now , you all know what the pos@@ tm@@ or@@ te@@ m is ."
"W@@ h@@ en@@ ever there &apos;s a di@@ sa@@ ster , a team of exper@@ ts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?"
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ an@@ ny expla@@ ined , you look a@@ head and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to pre@@ v@@ ent those things from happening , or to mini@@ mi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ rou@@ nd the home , desig@@ nate a place for things that are easi@@ ly lost ."
"Now , this s@@ ounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our s@@ pati@@ al mem@@ ory works ."
"There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us , that ev@@ olved over ten@@ s of thousands of years , to keep tra@@ ck of the loc@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of f@@ ru@@ it tre@@ es , where the fri@@ en@@ dly and ene@@ my tri@@ b@@ es live ."
The hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us is the part of the brain that in L@@ on@@ don ta@@ x@@ ic@@ a@@ b dri@@ ver@@ s bec@@ omes en@@ lar@@ g@@ ed .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allow@@ s s@@ qui@@ r@@ re@@ ls to find their nu@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experim@@ ent where they cut off the ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory sense of the s@@ qui@@ r@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their nu@@ ts ."
"They w@@ er@@ en &apos;t using sm@@ ell , they were using the hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us , this ex@@ qui@@ sit@@ ely ev@@ olved me@@ chan@@ ism in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we l@@ ose car ke@@ ys and read@@ ing gla@@ sses and pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"So in the home , desig@@ nate a sp@@ ot for your ke@@ ys — a ho@@ ok by the do@@ or , maybe a dec@@ o@@ ra@@ tive bo@@ w@@ l ."
"For your pas@@ sp@@ ort , a particular dra@@ w@@ er ."
"For your read@@ ing gla@@ sses , a particular table ."
"If you desig@@ nate a sp@@ ot and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ pu@@ l@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about tra@@ vel ?
"T@@ ake a cell phone picture of your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se , your pas@@ sp@@ ort , mai@@ l it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
"If these things are lost or st@@ ol@@ en , you can fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate re@@ pla@@ c@@ ement ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"@@ Re@@ member , when you &apos;re under stre@@ ss , the brain rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it cau@@ ses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the practi@@ ce of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recogni@@ ze that under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place ."
And there &apos;s perhaps no more stre@@ ss@@ ful a situ@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a medi@@ cal deci@@ sion to make .
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that pos@@ ition , where we have to make a very important deci@@ sion about the future of our medi@@ cal care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a deci@@ sion ."
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medi@@ cal con@@ dition .
"But this stan@@ ds as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medi@@ cal deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making , and in@@ de@@ ed for fin@@ an@@ cial deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making , and social deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making — any kind of deci@@ sion you have to make that would bene@@ fit from a ra@@ ti@@ onal as@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of the fac@@ ts ."
"So supp@@ ose you go to your doc@@ tor and the doc@@ tor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol is as@@ soci@@ ated with an incre@@ as@@ ed risk of car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar disease , heart atta@@ ck , st@@ rok@@ e ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or under@@ go a sur@@ g@@ ery or any medi@@ cal proce@@ du@@ re before one person is hel@@ ped .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of cra@@ zy sta@@ ti@@ stic is that ?"
The number should be one .
My doc@@ tor wouldn &apos;t pre@@ scri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
"But actually , medi@@ cal practi@@ ce doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the doc@@ tor &apos;s f@@ au@@ l@@ t , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s f@@ au@@ l@@ t , it &apos;s the f@@ au@@ l@@ t of scientists like me ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t figu@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line esti@@ mat@@ es that 90 percent of the dru@@ gs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most wi@@ d@@ ely pre@@ scri@@ bed sta@@ tin , what do you supp@@ ose it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ ped ?
3@@ 00 .
I ran through the numbers myself .
"@@ 3@@ 00 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart atta@@ ck , st@@ rok@@ e or other ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ent is pre@@ v@@ ented ."
"Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , O@@ K , one in 3@@ 00 chan@@ ce of low@@ ering my cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol ."
"W@@ h@@ y not , do@@ c ? G@@ i@@ ve me the pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another sta@@ ti@@ stic , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side eff@@ ects . &quot; &quot; Ri@@ ght ?"
"So for this particular drug , the side eff@@ ects oc@@ cu@@ r in five percent of the patients ."
"And they inclu@@ de terri@@ ble things — de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating mu@@ sc@@ le and jo@@ int pai@@ n , ga@@ st@@ ro@@ in@@ te@@ sti@@ nal di@@ stre@@ ss — but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; F@@ i@@ ve percent , not very likely it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the drug . &quot; &quot; But wai@@ t a min@@ ute ."
Re@@ member under stre@@ ss you &apos;re not thinking c@@ lear@@ ly .
"So think about how you &apos;re going to work through this a@@ head of time , so you don &apos;t have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture the cha@@ in of reas@@ on@@ ing on the sp@@ ot ."
"@@ 3@@ 00 people take the drug , right ? One person &apos;s hel@@ ped , five percent of those 3@@ 00 have side eff@@ ects , that &apos;s 15 people ."
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be har@@ med by the drug than you are to be hel@@ ped by the drug .
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the sta@@ tin or not ."
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conver@@ sation with your doc@@ tor .
"M@@ e@@ di@@ cal eth@@ ics requi@@ res it , it &apos;s part of the prin@@ ci@@ ple of in@@ for@@ med con@@ sent ."
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to beg@@ in the conver@@ sation about whether you want to take the ris@@ ks or not .
"Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pu@@ l@@ led this number out of the air for sho@@ ck value , but in fact it &apos;s rather ty@@ pi@@ cal , this number needed to tre@@ at ."
"For the most wi@@ d@@ ely per@@ for@@ med sur@@ g@@ ery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mov@@ al of the pros@@ ta@@ te for cancer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ ped ."
And the side eff@@ ects in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
"They inclu@@ de imp@@ ot@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le d@@ y@@ s@@ func@@ tion , u@@ ri@@ nary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ tal te@@ aring , f@@ ec@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
So the idea of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think a@@ head of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will pu@@ sh the conver@@ sation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the sp@@ ot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
"Because you have a choice of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes , do you I want a sh@@ or@@ ter life that &apos;s pain@@ -@@ free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pai@@ n to@@ wards the end ?"
"These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your lo@@ ved ones ."
"You might change your mind in the he@@ at of the moment , but at least you &apos;re practi@@ ced with this kind of thinking ."
"@@ Re@@ member , our brain under stre@@ ss rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bun@@ ch on systems sh@@ ut down ."
There &apos;s an ev@@ olu@@ ti@@ ona@@ ry reason for this .
"F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ dat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ mun@@ e system , because if you &apos;re body is ex@@ pen@@ ding me@@ ta@@ bo@@ li@@ sm on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s l@@ un@@ ch , and then n@@ one of those things matter ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , one of the things that goes out the win@@ do@@ w during those times of stre@@ ss is ra@@ ti@@ onal , logical thinking , as D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his colle@@ ag@@ ues have sh@@ own ."
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ zing that all of us are fla@@ w@@ ed .
We all are going to fai@@ l now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fai@@ lu@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help mini@@ mi@@ ze the da@@ ma@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"@@ G@@ etting back to that s@@ no@@ w@@ y night in M@@ on@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my con@@ trac@@ tor in@@ sta@@ ll a com@@ bi@@ nation lo@@ ck next to the do@@ or , with a key to the front do@@ or in it , an easy to remember com@@ bi@@ nation ."
"And I have to ad@@ mit , I still have p@@ il@@ es of mai@@ l that ha@@ ven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and p@@ il@@ es of ema@@ il@@ s that I ha@@ ven &apos;t gone through ."
"So I &apos;m not completely organiz@@ ed , but I see organiz@@ ation as a gra@@ du@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"S@@ us@@ tai@@ na@@ bility re@@ pres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is cau@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s b@@ ou@@ nt@@ y for their living .
U@@ n@@ der@@ standing all of this ena@@ b@@ les us to shi@@ ft our perc@@ ep@@ tion of se@@ a@@ food away from a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity to an opportunity to re@@ st@@ ore our ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .
It allow@@ s for us to cel@@ e@@ b@@ rate the se@@ a@@ food that we &apos;re also so for@@ tu@@ nate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ a@@ food .
"W@@ here su@@ stai@@ na@@ bility is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to en@@ du@@ re and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ is@@ h and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ R@@ est@@ o@@ ra@@ tive se@@ a@@ food allow@@ s for an ev@@ ol@@ ving and d@@ y@@ na@@ mic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a re@@ source , sug@@ ge@@ sting that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ is@@ h the ocean and to en@@ coura@@ ge its resi@@ li@@ en@@ cy ."
"It is a more h@@ ope@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more u@@ se@@ ful way of understanding our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ i@@ des — stan@@ d@@ ard is@@ sue by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ ser@@ vation world — are very han@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"@@ Gre@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ a@@ food species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : bu@@ y green , don &apos;t bu@@ y red , think t@@ wi@@ ce about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green list ."
We can &apos;t su@@ sta@@ in this without the mea@@ sure of our suc@@ cess really changing the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green list ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ cau@@ ght y@@ el@@ low@@ f@@ in tun@@ a here — comes from su@@ stai@@ na@@ ble st@@ oc@@ ks .
P@@ ole cau@@ ght — no b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . Su@@ pp@@ or@@ ting local economi@@ es .
But it &apos;s a lion of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the cont@@ ext of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a ste@@ a@@ kh@@ ouse to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fav@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a cont@@ ext , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ants and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ ink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prot@@ e@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it re@@ gar@@ ds our food , and we are pa@@ ying a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost bene@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ tan@@ ce of ex@@ pan@@ ding wai@@ st@@ lin@@ es .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster pro@@ f@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ a@@ food is that it really takes into ac@@ cou@@ nt our needs .
"@@ R@@ est@@ o@@ ra@@ tive se@@ a@@ food might best be re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ed not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ pp@@ er , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a lik@@ es to say that blue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to resp@@ ec@@ t@@ fully sub@@ mit that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ a@@ food possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les .
The best part about re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ a@@ food though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ mon we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ lap@@ ia b@@ read@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ c@@ ru@@ mb@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of p@@ ec@@ an qu@@ in@@ o@@ a pi@@ la@@ f with c@@ run@@ ch@@ y , g@@ ri@@ l@@ led bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and sm@@ ok@@ y on the outside with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i fla@@ ke ."
W@@ ho@@ o@@ o !
This is an easy s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents are av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble to every family at the ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ ami@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ning to sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a patter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get nu@@ clear ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ ced to han@@ dic@@ ap ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we exp@@ ect from our food .
S@@ us@@ tai@@ na@@ bility is comp@@ lic@@ ated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement rec@@ ently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are lead@@ ing pa@@ ssi@@ o@@ nately the green food D@@ eli@@ ci@@ ous R@@ ev@@ olution .
But green fo@@ o@@ ds often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ at@@ ers .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ re@@ g@@ ard on the pla@@ te .
We have ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o@@ -@@ fri@@ en@@ dly al@@ l@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy din@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive se@@ a@@ food .
"W@@ hi@@ le we try to man@@ age dec@@ lin@@ ing mar@@ ine popu@@ la@@ tions , the media &apos;s re@@ com@@ men@@ ding incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion of se@@ a@@ food ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American grand@@ mo@@ thers , grand@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ a@@ food ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not wil@@ ling to pa@@ ss up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ a@@ food .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pla@@ t@@ es .
"As a che@@ f , I realize the easi@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ duce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pla@@ te ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ eople started bu@@ ying appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ers and sa@@ la@@ ds , because they knew they w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es alone ."
"P@@ eople spent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ eople got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prot@@ e@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ ories over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fied me@@ al .
They got heal@@ thi@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ viron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pla@@ te , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , ma@@ ck@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common ."
"S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mu@@ s@@ sel@@ s , oy@@ st@@ ers , cl@@ am@@ s , ti@@ lap@@ ia , cha@@ r — these were the common species ."
"We were direc@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es to@@ wards more resi@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ sto@@ ra@@ tive op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fav@@ or .
This is what the green list says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those fas@@ hi@@ ona@@ ble species , that green list tun@@ a that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ pe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
S@@ tar@@ t with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pla@@ t@@ es .
"M@@ ound up those four pla@@ t@@ es with ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ und@@ y you have , light the can@@ d@@ les and cel@@ e@@ b@@ rate it ."
C@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ rate the opportunity you have to e@@ at this .
"I@@ n@@ v@@ ite your friends and ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I exp@@ ect a lot from food .
I exp@@ ect health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I exp@@ ect that produc@@ ing ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the commun@@ i@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was lu@@ ck@@ y enough that my father was a fan@@ ta@@ stic co@@ ok .
And he ta@@ u@@ ght me very early on about the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ pres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .
"They were reas@@ ona@@ ble por@@ tions of prot@@ e@@ in ser@@ ved with cop@@ i@@ ous qu@@ ant@@ ities of ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les and small am@@ ou@@ nt@@ s of star@@ ch , u@@ su@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I lar@@ g@@ ely e@@ at today .
I get si@@ ck when I go to ste@@ a@@ kh@@ ou@@ ses .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a h@@ ang@@ over from prot@@ e@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tu@@ nate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty st@@ rai@@ gh@@ t@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ o@@ le@@ some ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for but@@ ter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ ste less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ pes that gen@@ u@@ fl@@ ect to my own personal hi@@ stories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no e@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first step to mini@@ mi@@ ze it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our re@@ sources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ograph@@ y of the commun@@ i@@ on we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to cel@@ e@@ b@@ rate , we can beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or sma@@ l@@ ler por@@ tions of se@@ a@@ food .
And we need to sa@@ ve din@@ ner .
Thank you .

H@@ i . I am an archit@@ ect .
"I am the only archit@@ ect in the world making buil@@ di@@ ngs out of paper like this car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition is the first one I did using paper tu@@ b@@ es ."
"@@ 19@@ 8@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ec@@ o@@ logical i@@ ssues and environ@@ mental i@@ ssues , I just started te@@ sting the paper tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to test the new material for the building , but this is much st@@ rong@@ er than I exp@@ ected , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indu@@ stri@@ al material , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry structure , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry building made out of paper .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ b@@ es , di@@ am@@ et@@ er 5@@ 5 &#91; c@@ enti@@ met@@ ers &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ b@@ es with a di@@ am@@ et@@ er of 1@@ 20 c@@ enti@@ met@@ ers , or four fe@@ et , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the phot@@ o , inside is the to@@ i@@ let ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed with to@@ i@@ let paper , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very u@@ se@@ ful ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar 2@@ 000 , there was a big exp@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the exp@@ o was environ@@ mental i@@ ssues ."
"So I was ch@@ os@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ lion out of paper tu@@ b@@ es , rec@@ y@@ cla@@ ble paper ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s complet@@ ed .
"My go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ lions but after half a year , we create a lot of indu@@ stri@@ al wa@@ ste , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ c@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ c@@ led ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to win the comp@@ et@@ ition to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ ent@@ er in F@@ ran@@ ce in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so poor , I wanted to r@@ ent an offi@@ ce in P@@ ar@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t af@@ for@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to P@@ ar@@ is to build our offi@@ ce on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ ent@@ er in P@@ ar@@ is by ourselves ."
So we brought the paper tu@@ b@@ es and the wo@@ o@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to complet@@ e the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ met@@ er@@ -@@ long offi@@ ce .
We sta@@ yed there for six years without pa@@ ying any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to bu@@ y a ti@@ ck@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I complet@@ ed the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ ent@@ er in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very popu@@ lar mu@@ se@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government ."
"But then I was very di@@ sap@@ poin@@ ted at my profe@@ ssion as an archit@@ ect , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed people , ri@@ ch people , government , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they hi@@ re us to vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ u@@ mental archit@@ ec@@ ture .
"That is our profe@@ ssion , even hi@@ stor@@ ic@@ ally it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very di@@ sap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their h@@ ou@@ ses by natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers ."
But I must say they are no longer natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es never k@@ ill people , but col@@ lap@@ se of the buil@@ di@@ ngs k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of archit@@ ects .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no archit@@ ects working there because we are too bu@@ s@@ y working for pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as archit@@ ects , we can be inv@@ olved in the re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in di@@ sa@@ ster areas .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big di@@ sa@@ ster in R@@ wan@@ da , Africa ."
"T@@ wo tri@@ b@@ es , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ si , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so poor , and they are fre@@ e@@ zing with b@@ lan@@ k@@ ets during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a pla@@ stic s@@ he@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to cut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people cut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fore@@ sta@@ tion and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ u@@ min@@ um pi@@ pes , al@@ u@@ min@@ um bar@@ rac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ ery ex@@ pen@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then c@@ ut@@ ting tre@@ es again ."
"So I prop@@ osed my idea to impro@@ ve the situ@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ c@@ led paper tu@@ b@@ es because this is so che@@ ap and also so st@@ rong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.S@@ . dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the du@@ ra@@ bility and mo@@ is@@ ture and ter@@ mit@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kil@@ led , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ stri@@ ct , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fi@@ re after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ me@@ se re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es su@@ ffer@@ ing and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ tho@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was to@@ tally de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed .
"So I went there and also I prop@@ osed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of paper tu@@ b@@ es ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you cra@@ zy ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fi@@ re , what are you prop@@ os@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ sted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started com@@ mu@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ na@@ me@@ se people ."
They were living like this with very poor pla@@ stic s@@ he@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I prop@@ osed to re@@ build . I rais@@ ed — did fund@@ rais@@ ing .
"I made a paper tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ lish , I used be@@ er c@@ rat@@ es as a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to prop@@ ose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their pla@@ stic be@@ er c@@ rat@@ es red , which doesn &apos;t go with the col@@ or of the paper tu@@ b@@ es ."
The col@@ or co@@ ordi@@ nation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were exp@@ ecting to have a be@@ er inside the pla@@ stic be@@ er c@@ rate , but it came em@@ p@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so di@@ sap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"Fi@@ nally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ sted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you coll@@ ect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to sta@@ y there for three years , but actually it sta@@ yed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ ai@@ wan , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we prop@@ osed to do@@ nate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we sent them over to be built by v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It sta@@ yed there in T@@ ai@@ wan as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in paper can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local material to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka , after the Su@@ ma@@ tr@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , I re@@ built Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s vil@@ la@@ ges ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in C@@ he@@ ng@@ du , S@@ i@@ chu@@ an area in China , ne@@ ar@@ ly 7@@ 0,000 people were kil@@ led , and also e@@ specially many of the scho@@ ols were de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed because of the cor@@ rup@@ tion between the au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and the con@@ trac@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I brought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se students to work with the Ch@@ ine@@ se students .
"In one mon@@ th , we complet@@ ed n@@ ine cla@@ ss@@ ro@@ oms , over 500 s@@ qu@@ are met@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the curr@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ ta@@ ly , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting phot@@ o : for@@ mer P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster B@@ er@@ lu@@ s@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer for@@ mer P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me mini@@ ster ever year ."
"And they are very kind , af@@ for@@ ding my model ."
"I prop@@ osed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry music ha@@ ll , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very f@@ am@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t hal@@ ls were de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed , so mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I prop@@ osed to the ma@@ y@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ lu@@ s@@ con@@ i brought G@@ 8 sum@@ mit , and our for@@ mer pri@@ me mini@@ ster came , so they hel@@ ped us to coll@@ ect money , and I got half a million e@@ uro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se government to re@@ build this tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to f@@ ly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ ing@@ o , nex@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ it@@ i with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ ing@@ o to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local paper tu@@ b@@ es ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no pri@@ vac@@ y .
P@@ eople su@@ ff@@ er men@@ tally and physi@@ cally .
"So we went there to build par@@ t@@ iti@@ ons with all the stud@@ ent v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with paper tu@@ b@@ es , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be f@@ r@@ ame and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ il@@ ity au@@ th@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really nec@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fla@@ t area to build stan@@ d@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"@@ Lo@@ ok at this . E@@ ven ci@@ vi@@ l government is doing such poor con@@ struc@@ tion of the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry h@@ ous@@ ing , so den@@ se and so me@@ ss@@ y because there is no sto@@ ra@@ ge , nothing , water is le@@ ak@@ ing , so I thought , we have to make mul@@ ti@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I prop@@ osed to the ma@@ y@@ or while I was making par@@ t@@ iti@@ ons .
F@@ i@@ nally I met a very ni@@ ce ma@@ y@@ or in O@@ na@@ ga@@ w@@ a vil@@ la@@ ge in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on ba@@ se@@ b@@ all &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ pp@@ ing con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building fu@@ r@@ nit@@ u@@ re to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to sta@@ y here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se students were also kil@@ led , and the most important ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral of the city , the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was to@@ tally de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral .
So this is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ u@@ ments that are bel@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .

"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vi@@ sible by ordinary c@@ itiz@@ ens , it inspi@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the politi@@ ci@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ put@@ nik was pro@@ of that our ene@@ my had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now atta@@ ck us with hy@@ d@@ ro@@ gen b@@ om@@ b@@ s , using their S@@ put@@ nik ro@@ ck@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mi@@ ssi@@ le ."
All h@@ ell b@@ rok@@ e lo@@ ose .
S@@ put@@ nik quickly became one of the three great sh@@ oc@@ ks to h@@ it America — hi@@ st@@ ori@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed the mi@@ ssi@@ le g@@ ap .
It exp@@ lo@@ ded an ar@@ ms ra@@ ce .
It began the space ra@@ ce .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , C@@ ong@@ re@@ ss fund@@ ed huge we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 200 nu@@ clear we@@ ap@@ ons to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ put@@ nik went far be@@ yon@@ d we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ un@@ e 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ ef@@ en@@ se D@@ ri@@ ll , where ten@@ s of millions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ al@@ l@@ up P@@ ol@@ l that show@@ ed that seven in 10 Americ@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a nu@@ clear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kil@@ led ."
But S@@ put@@ nik pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on scho@@ lar@@ ship because of S@@ put@@ nik ."
"S@@ u@@ pp@@ ort for engine@@ ering , ma@@ th and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ put@@ nik led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature do@@ cu@@ men@@ ta@@ ry show@@ s how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also show@@ s how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad situ@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ put@@ nik &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be rele@@ as@@ ed .
"In clos@@ ing , I would like to take a moment to than@@ k one of my invest@@ ors : long@@ time TE@@ D@@ ster , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ k@@ er ."

Now imagine that 60 plan@@ es full of bab@@ ies under five cra@@ sh every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .

It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ de@@ st inv@@ enti@@ ons : a b@@ ar of so@@ ap .
"W@@ as@@ h@@ ing hands with so@@ ap , a ha@@ bit we all take for g@@ r@@ ant@@ ed , can re@@ duce di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a by half , can re@@ duce resp@@ i@@ rat@@ ory inf@@ ec@@ tions by one third ."

H@@ an@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ ap ke@@ ep@@ s kids in school .
It st@@ op@@ s bab@@ ies from d@@ ying .
H@@ an@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ ap is one of the most cos@@ t-@@ eff@@ ective ways of sa@@ ving children &apos;s lives .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of st@@ op@@ ping 10 ju@@ mb@@ o j@@ ets full of bab@@ ies and children from cra@@ shing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty u@@ se@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a min@@ ute .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just sha@@ ke their hands .
P@@ le@@ ase sha@@ ke their hands .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t wa@@ sh their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ i@@ let ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ re@@ tty yu@@ ck@@ y , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
"Well , sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs are actually show@@ ing that four people out of five don &apos;t wa@@ sh their hands when they come out of the to@@ i@@ let , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fan@@ cy to@@ il@@ ets , run@@ ning water , and so@@ ap av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ tal@@ ity is really high ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ ap ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ ap is av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble ."
"In 90 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in K@@ en@@ ya , you will find so@@ ap ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ ap is the lo@@ we@@ st , like E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why are@@ n &apos;t people wa@@ shing their hands ?
"W@@ h@@ y is it that Ma@@ y@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t wa@@ shing his hands ?"
"Well , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ ap is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ ap is used for la@@ und@@ ry , so@@ ap is used for wa@@ shing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a preci@@ ous com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t wa@@ ste it .
"O@@ n average , in Ma@@ y@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ ap for wa@@ shing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for wa@@ shing hands with so@@ ap ."
What &apos;s the result of that ?
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren pi@@ ck up disease in the place that &apos;s supp@@ osed to love them and prot@@ ect them the most , in their h@@ omes ."
Th@@ ink about where you learned to wa@@ sh your hands .
D@@ id you learn to wa@@ sh your hands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to wa@@ sh your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ o@@ ral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ b@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ ow@@ ever , we all cop@@ y what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tural nor@@ ms are something that sha@@ pe how we change our behavior , and this is where the pri@@ v@@ ate sec@@ tor comes in ."
"E@@ very second in A@@ sia and Africa , 1@@ 11 mo@@ thers will bu@@ y this b@@ ar to prot@@ ect their family ."
"M@@ any women in India will tell you they learned all about hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , dise@@ ases , from this b@@ ar of so@@ ap from Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ oy b@@ r@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic b@@ ran@@ ds like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they s@@ ell their produc@@ ts .
"It &apos;s that belie@@ f , pl@@ us the scale of Uni@@ le@@ ver , that allow@@ s us to keep talking about han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ ap and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
B@@ i@@ g busin@@ ess@@ es and b@@ ran@@ ds can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those ha@@ b@@ its that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ ink about it : Mar@@ ket@@ e@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one b@@ r@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ el@@ ling messa@@ ges ."
"@@ Just for a min@@ ute , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a messa@@ ge as powerful as han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ ap ."
The pro@@ fit moti@@ ve is trans@@ for@@ ming health out@@ comes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for centu@@ ries : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ oy b@@ r@@ and was la@@ un@@ ched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an Eng@@ land to actually com@@ b@@ at ch@@ ol@@ era .
"@@ L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ han@@ a with the mini@@ ster of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ bre@@ ak in G@@ han@@ a at the moment ."
"A hund@@ red and ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en years later , the solu@@ tion is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this b@@ ar of so@@ ap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from sp@@ read@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for pro@@ fit is extre@@ m@@ ely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most com@@ mit@@ ted char@@ ity or government ."
"@@ G@@ over@@ nm@@ ent is doing what they can , e@@ specially in terms of the pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs and e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ cs such as ch@@ ol@@ era , or E@@ b@@ ola at the moment , but with comp@@ et@@ ing pri@@ or@@ ities ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"And when you think about this , you think about what is requi@@ red to make han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing a dai@@ ly ha@@ bit , it requi@@ res su@@ sta@@ ined fund@@ ing to re@@ f@@ ine this behavior ."
"In sh@@ ort , those that fi@@ ght for public health are actually depen@@ dent up@@ on the so@@ ap companies to keep pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing han@@ d@@ wa@@ shing with so@@ ap ."

"We are all fami@@ li@@ ar with these mun@@ dan@@ e , every@@ day ob@@ jects ."
The fact that some of the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ri@@ ed personal it@@ ems such as to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ ste and a to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh is a clear sig@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for pri@@ son@@ ers of war ."
"These it@@ ems have been reco@@ vered from nu@@ mer@@ ous ma@@ ss gra@@ ves across my h@@ om@@ el@@ and , and as we speak , for@@ en@@ si@@ cs are ex@@ hu@@ ming bo@@ dies from ne@@ w@@ ly disco@@ vered ma@@ ss gra@@ ves , 20 years after the war ."
And it is quite possi@@ bly the lar@@ gest ever disco@@ vered .
"D@@ ur@@ ing the four years of con@@ f@@ lic@@ t that de@@ v@@ as@@ ta@@ ted the B@@ os@@ ni@@ an nation in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , appro@@ xi@@ mat@@ ely 3@@ 0,000 c@@ itiz@@ ens , ma@@ in@@ ly ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ans , went mi@@ ssing , pre@@ su@@ med kil@@ led , and another 10@@ 0,000 were kil@@ led during com@@ b@@ at oper@@ ations ."

"It is also about de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying their pr@@ oper@@ ty , their cul@@ tural her@@ it@@ age , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the very noti@@ on that they ever exi@@ sted ."
G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kil@@ ling ; it is about the d@@ eni@@ ed id@@ ent@@ ity .
There are always tra@@ ces — no such thing as a perf@@ ect cri@@ me .
There are always re@@ mn@@ ants of the per@@ i@@ shed ones that are more du@@ ra@@ ble than their f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le bo@@ dies and our sel@@ ective and f@@ ad@@ ing mem@@ ory of them .

"S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors are oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ona@@ lly called to try to id@@ enti@@ fy these it@@ ems physi@@ cally , but physical bro@@ w@@ sing is extre@@ m@@ ely difficult , an ine@@ ff@@ ective and pain@@ ful process ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the for@@ en@@ si@@ cs and doc@@ tors and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers are done with these ob@@ jects , they become or@@ ph@@ ans of the na@@ r@@ ra@@ tive ."
"M@@ any of them get de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of si@@ ght and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h every single ex@@ hu@@ med it@@ e@@ m in order to create a vi@@ sual ar@@ chi@@ ve that survi@@ v@@ ors could easi@@ ly bro@@ w@@ se .
"As a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler , I like to give back to the community ."
I like to move be@@ yon@@ d rais@@ ing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"And in this case , someone may recogni@@ ze these it@@ ems or at least their phot@@ ograph@@ s will re@@ main as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed and ac@@ cu@@ rate re@@ min@@ der of what happened ."
"P@@ h@@ ot@@ ograph@@ y is about em@@ pa@@ thy , and the fami@@ li@@ ar@@ ity of these it@@ ems gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ e em@@ pa@@ thy ."
"In this case , I am mer@@ ely a to@@ ol , a for@@ en@@ sic , if you like , and the result is a phot@@ ograph@@ y that is as close as possible of being a do@@ cu@@ ment ."
"O@@ n@@ ce all the mi@@ ssing per@@ s@@ ons are id@@ enti@@ fied , only dec@@ a@@ ying bo@@ dies in their gra@@ ves and these every@@ day it@@ ems will re@@ main ."
"In all their simp@@ lic@@ ity , these it@@ ems are the last te@@ st@@ am@@ ent to the id@@ ent@@ ity of the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms , the last per@@ man@@ ent re@@ min@@ der that these people ever exi@@ sted ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challeng@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ entu@@ rou@@ s before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challeng@@ es .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"So in colle@@ ge , I was a government maj@@ or , which means I had to write a lot of pap@@ ers ."
"Now , when a nor@@ mal stud@@ ent writ@@ es a paper , they might sp@@ read the work out a little like this ."
"So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little s@@ low@@ ly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some he@@ a@@ vi@@ er days later on , everything gets done , things sta@@ y ci@@ vi@@ l . ( Laughter )@@ "
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pla@@ n .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge s@@ eni@@ or the@@ sis , a paper you &apos;re supp@@ osed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a paper like that , my nor@@ mal work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
"So I plan@@ ned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this ."
This is how the year would go .
"So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bu@@ m@@ p it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ic@@ k it up into high ge@@ ar just like a little stai@@ r@@ case ."
How hard could it be to walk up the stai@@ r@@ s ?
"N@@ o big deal , right ?"
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff ."
So we had an a@@ we@@ some new re@@ vi@@ sed pla@@ n .
"( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here ."
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two weeks ."
"And one day I w@@ oke up with three days until the de@@ ad@@ line , still not having writ@@ ten a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wr@@ ote 90 pa@@ ges over 7@@ 2 hours , pu@@ l@@ ling not one but two al@@ l@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — humans are not supp@@ osed to pu@@ ll two al@@ l@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters — sp@@ r@@ in@@ ted across cam@@ p@@ us , do@@ ve in s@@ low moti@@ on , and got it in just at the de@@ ad@@ line ."
I thought that was the end of everything .
"But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school ."
"And they say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this T@@ i@@ m U@@ r@@ b@@ an ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your the@@ sis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
"It was a very , very bad the@@ sis . ( Laughter )@@ "
"I just wanted to en@@ jo@@ y that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )@@ "
"N@@ o , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ ny@@ way , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er@@ -@@ blo@@ gger guy ."
I write the blo@@ g W@@ ai@@ t But Why .
"And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation ."
"My behavior has always per@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ed the non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors around me , and I wanted to expla@@ in to the non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors of the world what goes on in the he@@ ads of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors , and why we are the way we are ."
"Now , I had a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis that the bra@@ ins of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors were actually different than the bra@@ ins of other people ."
"And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I lab that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or , so I could comp@@ are them ."
I actually brought them here to show you today .
I want you to take a look care@@ fully to see if you can noti@@ ce a difference .
"I know that if you &apos;re not a tra@@ ined brain exper@@ t , it &apos;s not that obvi@@ ous , but just take a look , O@@ K ?"
So here &apos;s the brain of a non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or .
( Laughter ) Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"B@@ ot@@ h bra@@ ins have a R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er in them , but the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or &apos;s brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key ."
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
"@@ &#91; This is a perf@@ ect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ o@@ pe ! &#93; So the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er will make the ra@@ ti@@ onal deci@@ sion to do something produc@@ tive , but the M@@ on@@ key doesn &apos;t like that pla@@ n , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; &quot; A@@ c@@ tually , let &apos;s read the entire W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ge of the N@@ an@@ cy K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ ya H@@ ar@@ ding sc@@ an@@ d@@ al , because I just re@@ me@@ mb@@ ered that that happened ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ en — ( Laughter ) Th@@ en we &apos;re going to go over to the fri@@ dge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we &apos;re going to go on a Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be spi@@ ral that star@@ ts with vide@@ os of Ri@@ cha@@ rd F@@ e@@ y@@ n@@ man talking about mag@@ n@@ ets and ends much , much later with us wat@@ ching inter@@ vie@@ ws with Ju@@ sti@@ n B@@ i@@ e@@ ber &apos;s mo@@ m ."
"( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the s@@ che@@ du@@ le for any work today ."
"S@@ or@@ ry ! &quot; &quot; ( S@@ i@@ gh ) Now , what is going on here ?"
The In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key does not see@@ m like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el .
He lives enti@@ rely in the present moment .
"He has no mem@@ ory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only ca@@ res about two things : easy and fu@@ n ."
"Now , in the anima@@ l world , that works f@@ ine ."
"If you &apos;re a do@@ g and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fu@@ n things , you &apos;re a huge suc@@ cess !@@ "
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another anima@@ l species ."
"You have to keep w@@ ell@@ -@@ s@@ le@@ pt , w@@ ell@@ -@@ f@@ ed and prop@@ ag@@ ating into the next generation , which in tri@@ b@@ al times might have worked O@@ K ."
"But , if you ha@@ ven &apos;t not@@ ic@@ ed , now we &apos;re not in tri@@ b@@ al times ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ an@@ ced ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
"W@@ hi@@ ch is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er , who gi@@ ves us the ability to do things no other anima@@ l can do ."
We can vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make long@@ -@@ ter@@ m pl@@ ans .
And he want@@ s to take all of that into ac@@ cou@@ nt .
And he want@@ s to just have us do wha@@ tever makes sense to be doing right now .
"Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fu@@ n , like when you &apos;re having din@@ ner or going to bed or en@@ jo@@ ying w@@ ell@@ -@@ ear@@ ned le@@ i@@ sure time ."
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p .
S@@ ome@@ times they ag@@ ree .
"But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are har@@ der and less p@@ le@@ as@@ ant , for the sak@@ e of the big picture ."
And that &apos;s when we have a con@@ f@@ lic@@ t .
"And for the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or , that con@@ f@@ lic@@ t ten@@ ds to end a certain way every time , lea@@ ving him sp@@ en@@ ding a lot of time in this or@@ ang@@ e z@@ one , an easy and fu@@ n place that &apos;s enti@@ rely out of the M@@ ak@@ es S@@ en@@ se cir@@ cle ."
I call it the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground .
"( Laughter ) Now , the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground is a place that all of you pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors out there know very well ."
It &apos;s where le@@ i@@ sure activ@@ ities happen at times when le@@ i@@ sure activ@@ ities are not supp@@ osed to be happening .
"The fu@@ n you have in the D@@ ar@@ k P@@ la@@ y@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fu@@ n , because it &apos;s completely un@@ ear@@ ned , and the air is fil@@ led with gu@@ il@@ t , dre@@ ad , an@@ xi@@ ety , self-@@ ha@@ t@@ red — all of those good pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or feel@@ ings ."
"And the question is , in this situ@@ ation , with the M@@ on@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or ever get h@@ im@@ self over here to this blue z@@ one , a less p@@ le@@ as@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?"
"Well , turns out the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or has a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an ang@@ el , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and wat@@ ching over him in his dar@@ ke@@ st mom@@ ents — someone called the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster ."
"( Laughter ) Now , the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster is d@@ or@@ man@@ t most of the time , but he sudd@@ en@@ ly wak@@ es up any@@ time a de@@ ad@@ line gets too close or there &apos;s dang@@ er of public em@@ bar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment , a care@@ er di@@ sa@@ ster or some other sc@@ ary con@@ sequ@@ ence ."
"And import@@ antly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is terri@@ fied of ."
"Now , he became very rele@@ v@@ ant in my life pretty rec@@ ently , because the people of TED re@@ ach@@ ed out to me about six months ago and inv@@ ited me to do a TED T@@ al@@ k ."
"( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes ."
It &apos;s always been a dre@@ am of mine to have done a TED T@@ al@@ k in the past .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this exc@@ it@@ ement , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er se@@ em@@ ed to have something else on his mind ."
"He was saying , &quot; &quot; A@@ re we clear on what we just ac@@ cep@@ ted ?"
Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
"We need to sit down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the M@@ on@@ key said , &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ tally ag@@ ree , but let &apos;s just open Goog@@ le Earth and z@@ o@@ om in to the bot@@ tom of India , like 200 fe@@ et ab@@ o@@ ve the ground , and sc@@ ro@@ ll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )@@ "
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to rele@@ ase the speak@@ ers ."
"And I open@@ ed up the we@@ b@@ site , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me ."
And gue@@ ss who w@@ oke up ?
"( Laughter ) So the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster star@@ ts los@@ ing his mind , and a few secon@@ ds later , the whole system &apos;s in ma@@ y@@ he@@ m . ( Laughter )@@ "
"And the M@@ on@@ key — remember , he &apos;s terri@@ fied of the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster — bo@@ om , he &apos;s up the t@@ ree !@@ "
"And finally , finally , the R@@ ational D@@ eci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ M@@ ak@@ er can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk ."
"Now , the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster expla@@ ins all kinds of pretty in@@ san@@ e pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks u@@ na@@ ble to start the op@@ ening sent@@ ence of a paper , and then mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously find the un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work e@@ thi@@ c to sta@@ y up all night and write eight pa@@ ges ."
"And this entire situ@@ ation , with the three cha@@ rac@@ ters — this is the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or &apos;s system ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to write about on the blo@@ g a couple of years ago .
"When I did , I was ama@@ zed by the respon@@ se ."
"@@ L@@ it@@ er@@ ally thousands of ema@@ il@@ s came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things ."
"These are people who were nu@@ r@@ ses , ban@@ k@@ ers , pa@@ int@@ ers , engine@@ ers and lots and lots of P@@ h@@ D students ."
"( Laughter ) And they were all wr@@ iting , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;"
But what stru@@ ck me was the con@@ tra@@ st between the light t@@ one of the p@@ ost and the he@@ av@@ ine@@ ss of these ema@@ il@@ s .
"These people were wr@@ iting with int@@ en@@ se f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion about what pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation had done to their lives , about what this M@@ on@@ key had done to them ."
"And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?"
Why are all of these people in such a dar@@ k place ?
"Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation ."
"E@@ very@@ thing I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about today , the exam@@ ples I &apos;ve given , they all have de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es ."
"And when there &apos;s de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , the eff@@ ects of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation are con@@ ta@@ ined to the sh@@ ort ter@@ m because the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster gets inv@@ olved ."
But there &apos;s a second kind of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation that happens in situ@@ ations when there is no de@@ ad@@ line .
"So if you wanted a care@@ er where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter — something in the ar@@ ts , something ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al — there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get mom@@ entu@@ m , get things going ."
"There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your care@@ er that don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve any de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , like seeing your family or ex@@ er@@ ci@@ sing and taking care of your health , working on your relation@@ ship or getting out of a relation@@ ship that isn &apos;t working ."
"Now if the pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ or &apos;s only me@@ chan@@ ism of doing these hard things is the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non@@ -@@ de@@ ad@@ line situ@@ ations , the P@@ an@@ ic M@@ on@@ ster doesn &apos;t show up ."
"He has nothing to w@@ ake up for , so the eff@@ ects of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation , they &apos;re not con@@ ta@@ ined ; they just ex@@ t@@ end out@@ ward fore@@ ver ."
"And it &apos;s this long@@ -@@ ter@@ m kind of pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation that &apos;s much less vi@@ sible and much less tal@@ ked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m de@@ ad@@ l@@ ine@@ -@@ based kind ."
It &apos;s u@@ su@@ ally su@@ ffer@@ ed qui@@ et@@ ly and pri@@ v@@ ately .
"And it can be the source of a huge amount of long@@ -@@ ter@@ m un@@ happ@@ ine@@ ss , and re@@ gre@@ ts ."
"And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are ema@@ il@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place ."
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re c@@ ram@@ ming for some project .
"It &apos;s that long@@ -@@ ter@@ m pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nation has made them feel like a sp@@ ec@@ tat@@ or , at times , in their own lives ."
The f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion is not that they couldn &apos;t achi@@ e@@ ve their dre@@ am@@ s ; it &apos;s that they w@@ er@@ en &apos;t even able to start cha@@ sing them .
So I read these ema@@ il@@ s and I had a little bit of an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any — that I don &apos;t think non@@ -@@ pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors exi@@ st .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ors .
"Now , you might not all be a me@@ ss , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a heal@@ thy relation@@ ship with de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , but remember : the M@@ on@@ key &apos;s s@@ ne@@ ak@@ i@@ est tri@@ ck is when the de@@ ad@@ lin@@ es are@@ n &apos;t there ."
"Now , I want to show you one last thing ."
I call this a Li@@ fe C@@ al@@ en@@ da@@ r .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"That &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es , e@@ specially since we &apos;ve already used a bun@@ ch of those ."
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ en@@ da@@ r ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ing on , because everyone is pro@@ cra@@ sti@@ nat@@ ing on something in life ."
We need to sta@@ y a@@ ware of the In@@ st@@ ant G@@ ra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation M@@ on@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
"And because there &apos;s not that many bo@@ x@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today ."
"Well , maybe not today , but ..@@ ."
( Laughter ) You know .
S@@ ome@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ il@@ li@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who rec@@ ently was a@@ war@@ ded the c@@ ong@@ re@@ ssi@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or for his ac@@ tions on S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"O@@ n that day , a col@@ u@@ m@@ n of American and A@@ f@@ g@@ ha@@ n t@@ ro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n to help prot@@ ect a group of government offi@@ ci@@ als , a group of A@@ f@@ g@@ ha@@ n government offi@@ ci@@ als , who would be me@@ et@@ ing with some local vil@@ la@@ ge el@@ ders ."
"The col@@ u@@ m@@ n came under am@@ bu@@ sh , and was sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded on three si@@ des , and am@@ ong@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was recogni@@ zed for run@@ ning into live fi@@ re to re@@ sc@@ ue the w@@ oun@@ ded and pu@@ ll out the de@@ ad ."
"One of the people he re@@ sc@@ ue@@ d was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ de@@ v@@ a@@ c hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble about this day is , by s@@ he@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence , one of the me@@ de@@ v@@ a@@ c medi@@ cs happened to have a Go@@ P@@ ro cam@@ era on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole sc@@ en@@ e on cam@@ era ."
It show@@ s C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de bri@@ ng@@ ing this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had re@@ cei@@ ved a g@@ un@@ sh@@ ot to the nec@@ k .
"They put him in the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a ki@@ ss before he turns around to re@@ sc@@ ue more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some deep , deep emoti@@ on , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mi@@ lit@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are wil@@ ling to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce themselves so that others may g@@ ain ."
"In business , we give bon@@ us@@ es to people who are wil@@ ling to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce others so that we may g@@ ain ."
We have it back@@ wards . Ri@@ ght ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my in@@ iti@@ al con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re at@@ trac@@ ted to the mi@@ lit@@ ary .
These better people are at@@ trac@@ ted to this con@@ cept of ser@@ vice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble things , and more import@@ antly , others have that cap@@ ac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to sa@@ ve others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
"The problem with con@@ cep@@ ts of tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are feel@@ ings , they are not in@@ struc@@ tions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ ru@@ st me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply in@@ struc@@ t two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
"If you go back 5@@ 0,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ thi@@ c era , to the early days of H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens , what we find is that the world was fil@@ led with dang@@ er , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
N@@ o@@ thing personal .
"W@@ he@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , lack of re@@ sources , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ duce our li@@ fe@@ sp@@ an ."
"And so we ev@@ olved into social animals , where we li@@ ved together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ f@@ ety , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we bel@@ ong@@ ed ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ ong@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent bene@@ f@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tru@@ st that someone from within my tri@@ be will wat@@ ch for dang@@ er .
B@@ ad system of survi@@ v@@ al .
The mo@@ der@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is fil@@ led with dang@@ er , things that are trying to f@@ ru@@ st@@ rate our lives or re@@ duce our suc@@ cess , re@@ duce our opportunity for suc@@ cess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the econom@@ y , the un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y of the sto@@ ck market ."
It could be a new technology that ren@@ ders your business model ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your comp@@ et@@ ition that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very mini@@ mu@@ m is working hard to f@@ ru@@ st@@ rate your growth and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"These are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only vari@@ able are the con@@ diti@@ ons inside the organiz@@ ation , and that &apos;s where lead@@ er@@ ship ma@@ tt@@ ers , because it &apos;s the lead@@ er that s@@ ets the t@@ one ."
"When a lead@@ er makes the choice to put the sa@@ f@@ ety and lives of the people inside the organiz@@ ation first , to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce their com@@ for@@ ts and s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the tang@@ i@@ ble resul@@ ts , so that the people re@@ main and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they bel@@ ong , re@@ mar@@ ka@@ ble things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was wit@@ ness to an in@@ ci@@ dent where a pas@@ se@@ ng@@ er at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted to bo@@ ard before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had b@@ rok@@ en the la@@ w , like a cri@@ mi@@ nal ."
He was y@@ el@@ led at for at@@ te@@ mp@@ ting to bo@@ ard one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like cat@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"She said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the ru@@ les , I could get in t@@ rou@@ ble or l@@ ose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was telling me is that@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tru@@ st her lead@@ ers .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es is not because they nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly hi@@ re better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their lead@@ ers .
"You see , if the con@@ diti@@ ons are wrong , we are for@@ ced to exp@@ end our own time and energy to prot@@ ect ourselves from each other , and that in@@ her@@ ently we@@ ak@@ ens the organiz@@ ation ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organiz@@ ation , we will na@@ tu@@ ra@@ lly com@@ b@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our stre@@ ng@@ ths and work ti@@ rele@@ ss@@ ly to face the dang@@ ers outside and se@@ iz@@ e the opportun@@ ities ."
"The clos@@ est anal@@ o@@ gy I can give to what a great lead@@ er is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child opportun@@ ities , education , di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine them when nec@@ ess@@ ary , all so that they can grow up and achi@@ e@@ ve more than we could for ourselves ."
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers want exactly the same thing .
"They want to provi@@ de their people opportunity , education , di@@ sci@@ pl@@ ine when nec@@ ess@@ ary , build their self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , give them the opportunity to try and fai@@ l , all so that they could achi@@ e@@ ve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves ."
"C@@ har@@ li@@ e K@@ i@@ m , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ext Ju@@ m@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a t@@ ech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consi@@ der la@@ ying off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we consi@@ der la@@ ying off people inside our organiz@@ ation ?
C@@ har@@ li@@ e imp@@ le@@ m@@ ented a po@@ lic@@ y of li@@ fe@@ time em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ext Ju@@ m@@ p , you cannot get fi@@ red for per@@ for@@ man@@ ce i@@ ssues ."
It &apos;s the complet@@ e op@@ pos@@ ite .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vi@@ sc@@ er@@ al ha@@ t@@ red , ang@@ er , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their di@@ sp@@ rop@@ or@@ ti@@ o@@ nate sa@@ la@@ ries and bon@@ us struc@@ tures ."
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have vi@@ o@@ lated the very defin@@ ition of lead@@ er@@ ship .
They have vi@@ o@@ lated this de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ trac@@ t .
"This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers ."
W@@ ould any@@ body be off@@ en@@ ded if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million bon@@ us to G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million bon@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ e@@ sa ?
Do we have an is@@ sue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce
the people to sa@@ ve the numbers .
They would so@@ on@@ er s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the numbers to sa@@ ve the people .
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer af@@ for@@ d their la@@ b@@ or po@@ ol ."
"They needed to sa@@ ve 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the bo@@ ard got together and dis@@ cu@@ ssed la@@ yo@@ ff@@ s ."
And B@@ o@@ b re@@ fu@@ sed .
"You see , B@@ o@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head count@@ s ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart count@@ s , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ duce the heart cou@@ nt ."
And so they came up with a fu@@ r@@ l@@ ough program .
"E@@ very em@@ plo@@ ye@@ e , from sec@@ re@@ ta@@ ry to C@@ E@@ O , was requi@@ red to take four weeks of un@@ paid vac@@ ation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ sec@@ u@@ tiv@@ ely ."
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all su@@ ff@@ er a little than any of us should have to su@@ ff@@ er a lot , and mo@@ ra@@ le went up ."
"They sa@@ ved 20 million dollars , and most import@@ antly , as would be exp@@ ected , when the people feel sa@@ fe and prot@@ ected by the lead@@ er@@ ship in the organiz@@ ation , the natural re@@ action is to tru@@ st and co@@ oper@@ ate ."
"And quite sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body exp@@ ected , people started tra@@ ding with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could af@@ for@@ d it more would tra@@ de with those who could af@@ for@@ d it less .
P@@ eople would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is a choice . It is not a r@@ ank .
I know many people at the s@@ eni@@ or@@ most le@@ vel@@ s of organiz@@ ations who are absol@@ utely not lead@@ ers .
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ t@@ oms of organiz@@ ations who have no au@@ th@@ or@@ ity and they are absol@@ utely lead@@ ers , and this is because they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the left of them , and they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a lead@@ er is .
"I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in the@@ at@@ er , and as is the Mar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the offi@@ cer ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lead@@ ers because they go first .
We call them lead@@ ers because they take the risk before any@@ body else does .
"They will give us their blood and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars to see that their lead@@ er &apos;s vi@@ sion comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your blood and s@@ we@@ at and te@@ ars for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"The most complex problems in our time can be sol@@ ved with simple techni@@ que@@ s , if we are able to dre@@ am ."
"As a child , I disco@@ vered that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity is the key to c@@ ross from dre@@ am@@ s to reality ."
"I learned this from my grand@@ mother , D@@ r@@ . R@@ u@@ th T@@ i@@ cha@@ ue@@ r , a J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e that set@@ t@@ led in the heart of the An@@ des ."
That is how I gre@@ w up : en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed to see be@@ yon@@ d any limit@@ ation .
"So part of my education inclu@@ ded hel@@ ping her in re@@ mot@@ e , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous commun@@ ities ."
"I ch@@ er@@ is@@ h those mem@@ ories , because they hel@@ ped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possi@@ bil@@ ities , without bar@@ ri@@ ers , as language or culture ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing those tri@@ ps , my grand@@ mother used to rec@@ ite a K@@ i@@ pl@@ ing p@@ oe@@ m : &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing hi@@ dd@@ en . G@@ o and find it ."
G@@ o and look behind the M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
S@@ ome@@ thing lost behind the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins .
"@@ L@@ ost and wa@@ iting for you . G@@ o ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medi@@ cal stud@@ ent ."
One of every hund@@ red children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy .
The fe@@ tu@@ s needs to survi@@ ve inside the mother .
"At the moment of bir@@ th , this communic@@ ation needs to stop ."
"If it doesn &apos;t close , the bab@@ y has a ho@@ le in the heart ."
It is cau@@ sed by pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ity and gen@@ e@@ tic con@@ diti@@ ons .
But what we know today is that a lack of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen is also one of the cau@@ ses .
"As you can see in the char@@ t , the fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy of this kind of ho@@ le dra@@ mati@@ cally incre@@ ases with al@@ tit@@ u@@ de ."
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : ( B@@ ab@@ y cr@@ ying ) W@@ hen you look at patients with this con@@ dition , they see@@ m de@@ sp@@ er@@ ate to bre@@ a@@ the ."
"T@@ o close the ho@@ le , maj@@ or sur@@ g@@ ery used to be the only solu@@ tion ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on regi@@ on ."
Th@@ en came a moment of inspi@@ ration .
So we used the b@@ ran@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first inv@@ en@@ tion .
The hol@@ es in children &apos;s he@@ ar@@ ts can be clos@@ ed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of wi@@ re w@@ rapp@@ ed on@@ to itself .
"It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fan@@ cy to you now , but that was our first succe@@ ss@@ ful at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to create a de@@ vice for this maj@@ or problem ."
"In this video , we can see how a very tiny ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clos@@ es the ho@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of inspi@@ ration , there came a very long time of ef@@ for@@ t develop@@ ing a prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ."
In v@@ it@@ ro and in vi@@ v@@ o stu@@ dies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
"I re@@ turned from G@@ er@@ many to B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , thinking that wh@@ er@@ ever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference ."
"W@@ ith my wi@@ fe and par@@ tn@@ er , D@@ r@@ . A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ d@@ ra H@@ e@@ ath , we started to see patients ."
"A@@ f@@ ter succe@@ ss@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tic ."
"But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et high ."
"And , the patients there need a speci@@ al de@@ vice to solve their heart con@@ dition ."
"M@@ ost patients cannot af@@ for@@ d to be tre@@ ated on time , and they die ."
The first co@@ il could succe@@ ss@@ fully tre@@ at only half of the patients in B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a .
The search started again .
We went back to the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my grand@@ mother &apos;s in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins , we ob@@ ta@@ ined a new de@@ vice ."
"For centu@@ ries , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous women told stories by we@@ a@@ ving complex patter@@ ns on lo@@ oms , and an un@@ exp@@ ected sk@@ ill hel@@ ped us for the new de@@ vice ."
"It seems this time , the we@@ a@@ ving allow@@ s us to create a se@@ am@@ less de@@ vice that doesn &apos;t ru@@ st because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very complex struc@@ tures by a proce@@ du@@ re that took dec@@ ad@@ es to devel@@ op .
"As you can see , the de@@ vice ent@@ ers the body through the natural chan@@ n@@ els ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the ho@@ le .
"O@@ ur de@@ vice ex@@ pan@@ ds , places itself and clos@@ es the ho@@ le ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open sur@@ g@@ ery was nec@@ ess@@ ary .
"( Applause ) A@@ s doc@@ tors , we fi@@ ght with dise@@ ases that take a long time and ef@@ for@@ t to he@@ al — if they do ."
"This is the child from before , after the proce@@ du@@ re ."
"As you can see — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see , once the de@@ vice is in place , the patient is 100 percent heal@@ ed ."
"F@@ rom start to fin@@ is@@ h , the whole proce@@ du@@ re takes only 30 minutes ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medi@@ cal and human point of view .
"We are so p@@ rou@@ d that some of our for@@ mer patients are part of our team — a team , than@@ ks to ad@@ ded close inter@@ action with patients that work with us ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solu@@ tions need to be simple ."
We lost the fear of cre@@ ating something new .
"The pat@@ h , it &apos;s not easy ."
M@@ any ob@@ sta@@ cles ari@@ se all the time .
But we re@@ cei@@ ve stre@@ ng@@ th from our patients .
"O@@ ur go@@ al is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access ."
So we have to start a f@@ oun@@ da@@ tion with a on@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ one model .
We will give one de@@ vice for free to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .
"This whole thing began with one im@@ possible idea as will contin@@ ue it , really : No child is left behind ."
Mu@@ cha@@ s gra@@ ci@@ as .

"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ pop@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ pop@@ o and M@@ pu@@ ma@@ lang@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ et@@ e@@ ma ."
"W@@ at@@ er and electri@@ city supp@@ ly are as un@@ predic@@ table as the we@@ a@@ ther , and growing up in these t@@ ough situ@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rela@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of mine in win@@ ter , and we were sun@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ im@@ pop@@ o sun gets really h@@ ot in win@@ ter .
"So as we were sun@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would bu@@ y that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sh@@ oc@@ king sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have prop@@ er access to water and san@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hund@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ari@@ ous dise@@ ases th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dra@@ stic of which is called tra@@ chom@@ a ."
T@@ ra@@ chom@@ a is an inf@@ ection of the eye due to di@@ r@@ t getting into your eye . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple inf@@ ec@@ tions of tra@@ chom@@ a can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind .
"The disease lea@@ ves eight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind each and every year . The sh@@ oc@@ king part about it is that to av@@ oi@@ d being inf@@ ected with tra@@ chom@@ a , all you have to do is wa@@ sh your face : no medi@@ cine , no p@@ il@@ ls , no in@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"So after seeing these sh@@ oc@@ king sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my N@@ ok@@ ia 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a lap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , ex@@ cept for the 20@@ -@@ ran@@ d-@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia , on Goog@@ le , about l@@ oti@@ ons , cre@@ am@@ s , the com@@ pos@@ iti@@ ons , the mel@@ ting poin@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ ic@@ ities — I did high school science — and I wr@@ ote down a little for@@ mu@@ la on a piece of paper ,@@ "
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C speci@@ al spi@@ ce , you know ?"
"So I was like , ok@@ ay , so we &apos;ve got the for@@ mu@@ la ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into practi@@ ce .
"F@@ ast forward four years later , after having writ@@ ten a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge business pla@@ n on the cell phone , having writ@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the you@@ ng@@ est pat@@ ent@@ -@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had inv@@ ented D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th@@ -@@ sub@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ ing l@@ oti@@ on ."
"You literally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limit@@ ed re@@ sources I had , I went to univer@@ sity , met a few people , got it into practi@@ ce , and we have a fully func@@ tion@@ ing produc@@ t that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble on the market ."
So we learned a few le@@ ss@@ ons in com@@ mer@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble .
One of the things we learned was that poor commun@@ ities don &apos;t bu@@ y produc@@ ts in bu@@ l@@ k .
"They bu@@ y produc@@ ts on de@@ m@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t bu@@ y a box of ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ es . They bu@@ y one ci@@ g@@ are@@ tt@@ e each day , even though it &apos;s more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ac@@ ka@@ g@@ ed D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these inno@@ v@@ ative little sa@@ ch@@ ets .
"You just s@@ nap them in half , and you s@@ que@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the co@@ ol part is , one sa@@ ch@@ et sub@@ st@@ it@@ utes one bat@@ h for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of imp@@ le@@ m@@ ent@@ ing the produc@@ t ."
We realized that even ri@@ ch kids from the su@@ bur@@ b@@ s really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ ny@@ way , we realized that we could sa@@ ve 80 million lit@@ ers of water on average each time they s@@ ki@@ pp@@ ed a bat@@ h , and also we would sa@@ ve two hours a day for kids who are in ru@@ ral areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for h@@ ome@@ work , two hours more to just be a ki@@ d ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we na@@ r@@ ro@@ w@@ ed it down to our key value prop@@ os@@ ition , which was cle@@ an@@ l@@ ine@@ ss and conv@@ eni@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a ri@@ ch man &apos;s conv@@ eni@@ ence and a poor man &apos;s li@@ fe@@ sa@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produc@@ t into practi@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t on@@ to a mul@@ ti@@ national to take it to the re@@ tai@@ l market , and one question I have for the au@@ dience today is , on the gra@@ vel ro@@ ads of L@@ im@@ pop@@ o , with an al@@ lo@@ wan@@ ce of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s st@@ op@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot throu@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Goog@@ le nam@@ ed me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also curr@@ ently the best stud@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur in the world , the first Afri@@ can to get that ac@@ co@@ la@@ de , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"Fi@@ ve years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal , and I re@@ turned to the medi@@ cal univer@@ sity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the wh@@ ite co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a manag@@ ement con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that surpri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the dis@@ cu@@ ssi@@ ons we had were hospit@@ al bu@@ d@@ gets and cos@@ t-@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that se@@ ver@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I met , for@@ mer friends from medi@@ cal school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most moti@@ v@@ ated , eng@@ ag@@ ed and pa@@ ssi@@ o@@ nate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ ni@@ cal , dise@@ ng@@ ag@@ ed , or had di@@ stan@@ ced themselves from hospit@@ al manag@@ ement ."
"So with this focu@@ s on cos@@ t-@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patient ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from stru@@ gg@@ le with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms aim at hol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for patients for sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In se@@ ver@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and nu@@ r@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the governm@@ ents ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the cos@@ tly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and nu@@ r@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive lab test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and f@@ rai@@ l patient ."
"So , by limit@@ ing the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of physi@@ ci@@ ans , this is a way to hold cos@@ ts down ."
"And ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , some physi@@ ci@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are f@@ ru@@ st@@ rated .
"At B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of manag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achi@@ e@@ ve ? &quot;"
"@@ U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re ai@@ ming at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limit@@ ed , or af@@ for@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ ue@@ -@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by value : out@@ comes that matter to patients rela@@ tive to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by Mi@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the cos@@ ts , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fas@@ ci@@ nat@@ ed us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are hospit@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ m@@ ely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ ast@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ ma@@ tic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he su@@ ff@@ ers from pros@@ ta@@ te cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"Now living in E@@ uro@@ pe , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ put@@ ed heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the average hospit@@ al , he will have the risk of bec@@ om@@ ing in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start we@@ aring di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ ini@@ c called the Mar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ lin@@ ik , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ fo@@ ld difference ."
"When we look at many hospit@@ als for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exi@@ st ."
N@@ o@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the hospit@@ al is a lot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the late &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ di@@ sh or@@ th@@ ope@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ nu@@ al me@@ et@@ ing , and they were dis@@ cu@@ ssing the different proce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"T@@ o the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of me@@ tal piec@@ es , arti@@ fi@@ cial hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individu@@ al way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gue@@ d that , &quot; &quot; My techni@@ que is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ mit@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to mea@@ sure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ bat@@ ing , &quot; So what is quality in hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ? &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Oh , we should mea@@ sure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should mea@@ sure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started mea@@ sur@@ ing , and started shar@@ ing the data ."
"@@ V@@ ery quickly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the b@@ one of the patient before you put the me@@ tal sha@@ ft in , it actually la@@ sted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ for@@ med cl@@ in@@ ical practi@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ in@@ ce then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ tom ?"
"And they vi@@ sit each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ v@@ ement ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ di@@ sh hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best resul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were mea@@ sur@@ ing , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the physi@@ ci@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what quality is , they start mea@@ sur@@ ing , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
C@@ on@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ v@@ ement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focu@@ sed on quality , they actually also have the lo@@ we@@ st cos@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ p@@ ose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compa@@ red the U.S@@ . and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ g@@ ery .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies , and so much un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary su@@ ffer@@ ing for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year per@@ i@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sa@@ vi@@ ngs there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a quality which is bel@@ ow the average in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would focu@@ s a lot more on mea@@ sur@@ ing quality , and rai@@ se quality just to the level of average O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 500 billion U.S@@ . dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these numbers are fan@@ ta@@ stic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ g@@ ue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and nu@@ r@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my practi@@ ce as a con@@ sul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hund@@ red or more than a hund@@ red doc@@ tors and nu@@ r@@ ses and other hospit@@ al or heal@@ th@@ care sta@@ ff every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achi@@ e@@ ve in terms of quality for their patients .
"P@@ h@@ ysi@@ ci@@ ans are , like most of you in the au@@ dience , very comp@@ et@@ itive ."
They were always best in cla@@ ss .
We were always best in cla@@ ss .
"And if somebody can show them that the result they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do wha@@ tever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physi@@ ci@@ ans have another cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ stic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er recog@@ n@@ ition .
"If a car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ st cal@@ ls another car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ st in a comp@@ et@@ ing hospit@@ al and dis@@ cu@@ sses why that other hospit@@ al has so much better resul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to impro@@ ve .
"So it is , by mea@@ sur@@ ing and cre@@ ating transp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ v@@ ement , which is what this sli@@ de show@@ s ."
"Now , you may say this is a ni@@ ce idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to mea@@ sure and comp@@ are what we achi@@ e@@ ve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ a@@ de@@ mic inst@@ itu@@ tions , Mi@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ ine@@ ss S@@ cho@@ ol , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ st@@ it@@ ute in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has for@@ med something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
It stan@@ ds for the Inter@@ national C@@ on@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ ea@@ su@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re bri@@ ng@@ ing together lead@@ ing physi@@ ci@@ ans and patients to dis@@ cu@@ ss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we mea@@ sure , and to make those stan@@ dar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : ca@@ ta@@ rac@@ ts , back pai@@ n , cor@@ ona@@ ry ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for in@@ stance , heart atta@@ ck , and pros@@ ta@@ te cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ext year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do eight dise@@ ases , the year after , 16 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pla@@ n to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"Fi@@ ve months ago , I led a work@@ sh@@ op at the lar@@ gest univer@@ sity hospit@@ al in Nor@@ ther@@ n E@@ uro@@ pe ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vi@@ sion : I want to man@@ age my big inst@@ itu@@ tion much more on quality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we sat in a work@@ sh@@ op together with physi@@ ci@@ ans , nu@@ r@@ ses and other sta@@ ff , dis@@ cu@@ ssing le@@ uk@@ e@@ mi@@ a in children ."
"The group dis@@ cu@@ ssed , how do we mea@@ sure quality today ?"
C@@ an we mea@@ sure it better than we do ?
"We dis@@ cu@@ ssed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
"And we dis@@ cu@@ ssed what are the cos@@ ts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m ."
"At the end of the me@@ et@@ ing , the chai@@ r@@ man of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he rais@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he rais@@ ed his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his fi@@ st , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"@@ Thank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally dis@@ cu@@ ssing what this hospit@@ al does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y mea@@ sur@@ ing value in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only cos@@ ts but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make sta@@ ff in hospit@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solu@@ tion ."
"I believe mea@@ sur@@ ing value in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a rev@@ olution , and I &apos;m conv@@ inc@@ ed that the f@@ oun@@ der of mo@@ der@@ n medi@@ cine , the Gre@@ ek H@@ i@@ pp@@ oc@@ rat@@ es , who always put the patient at the cent@@ er , he would s@@ mi@@ le in his gra@@ ve ."

"I &apos;m really exc@@ ited to share with you some fin@@ di@@ ngs that really surpri@@ se me about what makes companies succe@@ ed the most , what fac@@ tors actually matter the most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess ."
I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the great@@ est for@@ ms to make the world a better place .
"If you take a group of people with the right equ@@ ity inc@@ enti@@ ves and organiz@@ e them in a star@@ tu@@ p , you can un@@ lo@@ ck human pot@@ ential in a way never before possible ."
You get them to achi@@ e@@ ve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
"But if the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is so great , why do so many fai@@ l ?"
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually ma@@ tt@@ ers most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And I wanted to try to be sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic about it , av@@ oi@@ d some of my inst@@ inc@@ ts and maybe mi@@ sp@@ er@@ cep@@ tions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
"I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been star@@ ting busin@@ ess@@ es since I was 12 years old when I so@@ ld can@@ dy at the bu@@ s stop in j@@ uni@@ or high school , to high school , when I made so@@ lar energy de@@ vices , to colle@@ ge , when I made l@@ ou@@ d@@ speak@@ ers ."
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge , I started sof@@ t@@ ware companies ."
"And 20 years ago , I started I@@ de@@ a@@ lab , and in the last 20 years , we started more than 100 companies , many succe@@ sses , and many big fai@@ lu@@ res ."
We learned a lot from those fai@@ lu@@ res .
So I tried to look across what fac@@ tors ac@@ count@@ ed the most for company suc@@ cess and fai@@ lu@@ re .
So I looked at these five .
"Fi@@ rst , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
I nam@@ ed my company I@@ de@@ a@@ lab for how much I wor@@ ship the &quot; &quot; a@@ ha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ ecu@@ tion , ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ bility , that mat@@ ter@@ ed even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er Mi@@ ke T@@ y@@ son on the TED sta@@ ge , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body has a pla@@ n , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
So much about a team &apos;s ex@@ ecu@@ tion is its ability to ad@@ ap@@ t to getting p@@ un@@ ched in the face by the cu@@ st@@ om@@ er .
The cu@@ st@@ om@@ er is the true reality .
And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
Th@@ en I started looking at the business model .
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very clear pat@@ h gener@@ ating cu@@ st@@ om@@ er rev@@ enue@@ s ?
That started ris@@ ing to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ ter@@ ed most for suc@@ cess .
Th@@ en I looked at the fund@@ ing .
S@@ ome@@ times companies re@@ cei@@ ved int@@ en@@ se am@@ ou@@ nt@@ s of fund@@ ing .
Ma@@ ybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then of course , the ti@@ ming ."
I@@ s the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
"I@@ s it early , as in , you &apos;re in adv@@ ance and you have to educ@@ ate the world ?"
I@@ s it just right ?
"O@@ r is it too late , and there &apos;s already too many comp@@ et@@ it@@ ors ?"
So I tried to look very care@@ fully at these five fac@@ tors across many companies .
"And I looked across all 100 I@@ de@@ a@@ lab companies , and 100 non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ a@@ lab companies to try and come up with something scienti@@ fic about it ."
"So first , on these I@@ de@@ a@@ lab companies , the top five companies — C@@ it@@ y@@ search , C@@ ar@@ s@@ D@@ i@@ rec@@ t , Go@@ T@@ o , N@@ et@@ Z@@ ero , T@@ ic@@ ket@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ om — those all became bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ lar succe@@ sses ."
"And the five companies on the bot@@ tom — Z@@ .@@ c@@ om , In@@ si@@ der P@@ ag@@ es , M@@ y@@ Li@@ fe , D@@ e@@ sk@@ top F@@ ac@@ t@@ ory , P@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ el@@ ink — we all had high h@@ op@@ es for , but didn &apos;t succe@@ ed ."
So I tried to r@@ ank across all of those at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes how I felt those companies s@@ co@@ red on each of those di@@ men@@ sions .
"And then for non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ a@@ lab companies , I looked at wi@@ ld succe@@ sses , like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b and In@@ sta@@ gram and U@@ ber and Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be and L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In ."
"And some fai@@ lu@@ res : W@@ e@@ b@@ v@@ an , K@@ o@@ z@@ m@@ o , P@@ et@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ om F@@ lo@@ o@@ z and F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ster ."
"The bot@@ tom companies had int@@ en@@ se fund@@ ing , they even had business mo@@ d@@ els in some c@@ ases , but they didn &apos;t succe@@ ed ."
"I tried to look at what fac@@ tors actually ac@@ count@@ ed the most for suc@@ cess and fai@@ lu@@ re across all of these companies , and the resul@@ ts really surpri@@ sed me ."
The number one thing was ti@@ ming .
T@@ im@@ ing ac@@ count@@ ed for 4@@ 2 percent of the difference between suc@@ cess and fai@@ lu@@ re .
"T@@ e@@ am and ex@@ ecu@@ tion came in second , and the idea , the differ@@ enti@@ ability of the idea , the uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of the idea , that actually came in third ."
"Now , this isn &apos;t absol@@ utely defin@@ itive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much surpri@@ sed me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing ."
S@@ ome@@ times it mat@@ ter@@ ed more when it was actually ti@@ med .
"The last two , business model and fund@@ ing , made sense to me actually ."
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and ad@@ d one later if your cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are de@@ man@@ ding what you &apos;re cre@@ ating .
"And fund@@ ing , I think as well , if you &apos;re under@@ fund@@ ed at first but you &apos;re ga@@ ining trac@@ tion , e@@ specially in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get int@@ en@@ se fund@@ ing ."
So now let me give you some speci@@ fic exam@@ ples about each of these .
So take a wi@@ ld suc@@ cess like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b that everybody kno@@ ws about .
"Well , that company was f@@ am@@ ously pa@@ ssed on by many smar@@ t invest@@ ors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to r@@ ent out a space in their home to a st@@ rang@@ er . &quot;"
"O@@ f course , people pro@@ ved that wrong ."
"But one of the reas@@ ons it succe@@ e@@ ded , a@@ side from a good business model , a good idea , great ex@@ ecu@@ tion , is the ti@@ ming ."
"That company came out right during the he@@ i@@ ght of the re@@ ce@@ ssion when people really needed ex@@ tr@@ a money , and that maybe hel@@ ped people over@@ come their ob@@ j@@ ection to r@@ ent@@ ing out their own home to a st@@ rang@@ er ."
S@@ ame thing with U@@ ber .
"@@ U@@ ber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great ex@@ ecu@@ tion , too ."
But the ti@@ ming was so perf@@ ect for their need to get dri@@ ver@@ s into the system .
"D@@ ri@@ ver@@ s were looking for ex@@ tr@@ a money ; it was very , very important ."
"S@@ ome of our early succe@@ sses , C@@ it@@ y@@ search , came out when people needed we@@ b pa@@ ges ."
"@@ Go@@ T@@ o@@ .@@ c@@ om , which we an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced actually at TED in 199@@ 8 , was when companies were looking for cos@@ t-@@ eff@@ ective ways to get tra@@ ffi@@ c ."
"We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the ti@@ ming was probably maybe more important ."
And then some of our fai@@ lu@@ res .
"We started a company called Z@@ .@@ c@@ om , it was an on@@ line ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ment company ."
"We were so exc@@ ited about it — we rais@@ ed enough money , we had a great business model , we even sig@@ ned incredi@@ bly great H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wo@@ od tal@@ ent to jo@@ in the company ."
But bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and pen@@ et@@ ration was too low in 199@@ 9@@ -@@ 2@@ 000 .
"It was too hard to wat@@ ch video cont@@ ent on@@ line , you had to put co@@ dec@@ s in your bro@@ w@@ ser and do all this stuff , and the company ev@@ en@@ tually went out of business in 200@@ 3 ."
"@@ Just two years later , when the co@@ de@@ c problem was sol@@ ved by A@@ do@@ be F@@ la@@ sh and when bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and pen@@ et@@ ration c@@ ros@@ sed 50 percent in America , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be was perf@@ ec@@ tly ti@@ med ."
"@@ Gre@@ at idea , but un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able ti@@ ming ."
"In fact , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started ."
It wasn &apos;t even certain that that would work out .
"But that was beauti@@ fully , beauti@@ fully ti@@ med ."
"So what I would say , in sum@@ ma@@ ry , is ex@@ ecu@@ tion defin@@ it@@ ely ma@@ tt@@ ers a lot ."
The idea ma@@ tt@@ ers a lot .
But ti@@ ming might matter even more .
And the best way to really as@@ se@@ ss ti@@ ming is to really look at whether con@@ sum@@ ers are really ready for what you have to off@@ er them .
"And to be really , really hon@@ est about it , not be in d@@ eni@@ al about any resul@@ ts that you see , because if you have something you love , you want to pu@@ sh it forward , but you have to be very , very hon@@ est about that fac@@ tor on ti@@ ming ."
"As I said ear@@ li@@ er , I think star@@ tu@@ ps can change the world and make the world a better place ."
"I hope some of these in@@ si@@ ghts can maybe help you have a sli@@ gh@@ tly high@@ er suc@@ cess ra@@ ti@@ o , and th@@ us make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se ."
"@@ Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great au@@ dience ."

The day I left home for the first time to go to univer@@ sity was a b@@ right day bri@@ m@@ ming with hope and opti@@ mi@@ sm .
"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully ent@@ ered the stud@@ ent life of l@@ ec@@ tures , parti@@ es and tra@@ ffi@@ c c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"Now appe@@ ar@@ an@@ ces , of course , can be dec@@ ep@@ tive , and to an ex@@ t@@ ent , this fe@@ i@@ st@@ y , ener@@ ge@@ tic per@@ son@@ a of l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ -@@ going and tra@@ ffi@@ c c@@ one ste@@ al@@ ing was a v@@ ene@@ er , al@@ be@@ it a very w@@ ell@@ -@@ cra@@ f@@ ted and conv@@ inc@@ ing one ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ ep@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ sec@@ u@@ re and fundamen@@ tally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fai@@ lu@@ re and of the em@@ p@@ tin@@ ess that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ mi@@ na@@ r when it started , hu@@ m@@ ming to myself , fu@@ mb@@ ling with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hund@@ red times before , when sudd@@ en@@ ly I heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the c@@ lar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ mi@@ sta@@ ka@@ ble ."
&quot; She is op@@ ening the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the voice per@@ si@@ sted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , na@@ r@@ rat@@ ing everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a l@@ ec@@ ture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ ut@@ ral , im@@ pa@@ ssive and even , after a while , st@@ rang@@ ely compan@@ i@@ o@@ nate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did noti@@ ce that its cal@@ m ex@@ teri@@ or sometimes sli@@ pp@@ ed and that it oc@@ ca@@ si@@ ona@@ lly mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ ex@@ pre@@ ssed emoti@@ on ."
"So , for example , if I was ang@@ ry and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ de@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the voice would sound f@@ ru@@ st@@ rated ."
"Now it was then that I made a fa@@ tal mi@@ sta@@ ke , in that I told a friend about the voice , and she was hor@@ ri@@ fied ."
"A sub@@ tle con@@ diti@@ on@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the imp@@ lic@@ ation that nor@@ mal people don &apos;t hear v@@ o@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very seri@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fai@@ r , I was de@@ sp@@ er@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my st@@ range com@@ men@@ tat@@ or ."
"For example , I was part of a stud@@ ent T@@ V sta@@ tion that bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st news bu@@ l@@ let@@ ins around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment which was run@@ ning very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to rap@@ id@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A hospit@@ al ad@@ mi@@ ssion follow@@ ed , the first of many , a di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is of s@@ chi@@ z@@ o@@ ph@@ r@@ eni@@ a came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , t@@ or@@ m@@ ent@@ ing sense of h@@ op@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation and de@@ s@@ pai@@ r about myself and my pros@@ p@@ ects ."
"But having been en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed to see the voice not as an experience but as a sy@@ mp@@ tom , my fear and resi@@ stance to@@ wards it int@@ en@@ si@@ fied ."
"Now ess@@ entially , this re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ed taking an ag@@ gre@@ ssive stance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of p@@ sy@@ chi@@ c ci@@ vi@@ l war , and in turn this cau@@ sed the number of v@@ o@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow pro@@ gre@@ ssi@@ v@@ ely hos@@ ti@@ le and m@@ ena@@ cing ."
You see that gla@@ ss of water ?
"In eff@@ ect , a vi@@ ci@@ ous cy@@ cle of fear , av@@ oi@@ d@@ ance , mi@@ stru@@ st and mi@@ s@@ understanding had been e@@ sta@@ bli@@ shed , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of e@@ sta@@ bli@@ shing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ wo years later , and the det@@ eri@@ o@@ ration was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole f@@ ren@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re : terri@@ f@@ ying v@@ o@@ ices , g@@ rot@@ e@@ s@@ que vi@@ sions , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , in@@ trac@@ table d@@ el@@ u@@ sions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ ka@@ ge and de@@ s@@ pai@@ r of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A b@@ rok@@ en and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who emer@@ g@@ ed was a survi@@ v@@ or and would ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely grow into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ ories grow p@@ ale and fa@@ int in com@@ par@@ i@@ son with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as Ma@@ y , but sum@@ mer always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ d@@ it those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to w@@ el@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ed , l@@ on@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the v@@ o@@ ices appe@@ a@@ red so hos@@ ti@@ le and m@@ ena@@ cing , so in this resp@@ ect , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ pa@@ rate out a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical mean@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al truth ."
"So for example , v@@ o@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to atta@@ ck my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fear and in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , ob@@ j@@ ective dang@@ er ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prot@@ ect them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the v@@ o@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t me@@ ss with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a pla@@ stic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tra@@ te@@ gi@@ c ."
"But a later respon@@ se , and much more u@@ se@@ ful , would be to try and d@@ econ@@ struc@@ t the messa@@ ge behind the words , so when the v@@ o@@ ices war@@ ned me not to leave the house , then I would than@@ k them for dra@@ wing my attention to how un@@ sa@@ fe I felt — because if I was a@@ ware of it , then I could do something pos@@ itive about it — but go on to reas@@ sure both them and myself that we were sa@@ fe and didn &apos;t need to feel fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed any@@ more ."
"It was ar@@ med with this knowledge that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely I would ga@@ ther together my sha@@ t@@ ter@@ ed self , each f@@ ra@@ g@@ ment re@@ pre@@ sent@@ ed by a different voice , gra@@ du@@ ally with@@ dra@@ w from all my medi@@ c@@ ation , and re@@ turn to p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side ."
"I &apos;m now very p@@ rou@@ d to be a part of Inter@@ voice , the organiz@@ ational body of the Inter@@ national H@@ ear@@ ing V@@ o@@ ices M@@ o@@ v@@ ement , an in@@ iti@@ ative inspi@@ red by the work of P@@ ro@@ fe@@ ss@@ or M@@ ari@@ us R@@ om@@ me and D@@ r@@ .

"This ty@@ pe of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way ."
"T@@ o pa@@ ra@@ ph@@ ra@@ se C@@ ha@@ ve@@ z , once social change beg@@ ins , it cannot be re@@ ver@@ sed ."
You cannot hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ate the person who fe@@ els pri@@ de .

O@@ r is it phot@@ ograph@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ era ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in phot@@ ograph@@ y started as I got my first dig@@ ital cam@@ era at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pa@@ ssion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ era , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h with a cam@@ era , the process ends when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ gger ."
So to me it felt like phot@@ ograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pre@@ ss the tri@@ gger ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on along a bu@@ s@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ exp@@ ected t@@ wi@@ st .
"And de@@ sp@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of real@@ ism ."
"O@@ r phot@@ os like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of real@@ ism ."
"When I say real@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o@@ -@@ real@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ e@@ f moment to think to figure out the tri@@ ck .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tri@@ ck that makes it look real@@ i@@ stic ?
I@@ s it something about the de@@ tail@@ s or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the il@@ lu@@ sion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the per@@ sp@@ ective is the il@@ lu@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a t@@ wo@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is real@@ i@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ i@@ stic really ."
So I think the ba@@ si@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different piec@@ es of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ nate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three perf@@ ec@@ tly ima@@ gi@@ na@@ ble physical ob@@ jects , something we all can rela@@ te to living in a thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But com@@ bin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ onal , like it could exi@@ st ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with com@@ bin@@ ing phot@@ ograph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about com@@ bin@@ ing different real@@ ities .
"So the things that make a phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h look real@@ i@@ stic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our dai@@ ly lives ."
"But when com@@ bin@@ ing phot@@ ograph@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to achi@@ e@@ ve a real@@ i@@ stic result .
"As you can see , these images are@@ n &apos;t really speci@@ al ."
"But com@@ bin@@ ed , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that phot@@ os com@@ bin@@ ed should have the same per@@ sp@@ ective .
"S@@ econ@@ dly , phot@@ os com@@ bin@@ ed should have the same ty@@ pe of light ."
And these two images both fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill these two requi@@ re@@ ments — sh@@ ot at the same he@@ i@@ ght and in the same ty@@ pe of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to di@@ sti@@ ng@@ u@@ is@@ h where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was com@@ pos@@ ed .
"So by mat@@ ching col@@ or , con@@ tra@@ st and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding phot@@ ogra@@ phi@@ c de@@ f@@ ects like de@@ p@@ th of field , de@@ sat@@ u@@ rated col@@ ors and no@@ i@@ se , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , de@@ sp@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ y@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape and the low@@ er part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pu@@ lated .
But this image is actually enti@@ rely com@@ pos@@ ed of phot@@ ograph@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
"I perso@@ nally think that it &apos;s easi@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ pr@@ omi@@ se with the ideas in your head ."
But it does requi@@ re a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had se@@ ver@@ al months to pla@@ n it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ shing tri@@ p ."
The sho@@ res are from a different loc@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one pit .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ di@@ sh ."
"So to achi@@ e@@ ve a real@@ i@@ stic result , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about com@@ bin@@ ing the different phot@@ ograph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the phot@@ os , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ i@@ stic ."
"So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our ima@@ gi@@ nation ."
Thank you .

"@@ &#91; O@@ n A@@ pri@@ l 3 , 20@@ 16 we saw the lar@@ gest data le@@ ak in history . &#93; &#91; The P@@ an@@ am@@ a P@@ ap@@ ers ex@@ pos@@ ed ri@@ ch and powerful people &#93; &#91; hi@@ ding v@@ ast am@@ ou@@ nt@@ s of money in off@@ sh@@ ore ac@@ count@@ s . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called R@@ ob@@ er@@ t P@@ al@@ mer of G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness to expla@@ in . &#93; This week , there have been a whole s@@ le@@ w and d@@ el@@ u@@ ge of stories coming out from the le@@ ak of 11 million do@@ cu@@ ments from a P@@ an@@ am@@ ani@@ an@@ -@@ based la@@ w fi@@ r@@ m called M@@ os@@ s@@ ac@@ k F@@ on@@ sec@@ a ."
The rele@@ ase of these pap@@ ers from P@@ an@@ am@@ a li@@ f@@ ts the ve@@ il on a tiny piece of the sec@@ re@@ tive off@@ sh@@ ore world .
"We get an in@@ si@@ ght into how cli@@ ents and ban@@ ks and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers go to companies like M@@ os@@ s@@ ac@@ k F@@ on@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , we want an an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the ema@@ il@@ s , you get to see the ex@@ changes of messa@@ ges , you get to see the me@@ chan@@ ics of how this works , how this oper@@ ates ."
"Now , this has already started to have pretty im@@ medi@@ ate re@@ per@@ cu@@ ssi@@ ons ."
The P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster of I@@ cel@@ and has re@@ sig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the b@@ ru@@ tal S@@ y@@ rian dic@@ tat@@ or B@@ as@@ ha@@ r Al@@ -@@ A@@ ssa@@ d has also got off@@ sh@@ ore companies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that lea@@ ds back to P@@ resi@@ dent V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r P@@ u@@ tin of R@@ us@@ sia vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od friend , who happens to be a top cel@@ list ."
And there will be a lot of ri@@ ch individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of le@@ ak@@ ed do@@ cu@@ ments .
"Now , this s@@ ounds like the p@@ lot of a sp@@ y th@@ ri@@ l@@ ler or a Jo@@ h@@ n G@@ ri@@ sha@@ m no@@ vel ."
"It seems very di@@ st@@ ant from you , me , ordinary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the truth is that if ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money off@@ sh@@ ore and not pay the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for v@@ ital public ser@@ vices like heal@@ th@@ care , education , ro@@ ads ."
And that aff@@ ects all of us .
"Now , for my organiz@@ ation G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been phen@@ om@@ ena@@ l ."
We have the world &apos;s media and political lead@@ ers talking about how individu@@ als can use off@@ sh@@ ore sec@@ rec@@ y to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ i@@ se their as@@ s@@ ets — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a dec@@ a@@ de .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world ba@@ ff@@ ling and con@@ fu@@ sing , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an do@@ ll .
"So you can have one company sta@@ c@@ ked inside another company , sta@@ c@@ ked inside another company , making it almost im@@ possible to really understand who is behind these struc@@ tures ."
"It can be very difficult for la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement or ta@@ x au@@ th@@ or@@ ities , jour@@ na@@ li@@ sts , ci@@ vi@@ l society to really understand what &apos;s going on ."
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less co@@ verage of this is@@ sue in the United States .
"And that &apos;s perhaps because some pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent U@@ S people just ha@@ ven &apos;t figu@@ red in this ex@@ pos@@ é , in this sc@@ an@@ d@@ al ."
"Now , that &apos;s not because there are no ri@@ ch Americ@@ ans who are sta@@ shing their as@@ s@@ ets off@@ sh@@ ore ."
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ s@@ ac@@ k F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fe@@ w@@ er American cli@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw le@@ ak@@ s from the C@@ a@@ y@@ man Is@@ lan@@ ds or even from D@@ e@@ la@@ ware or W@@ yom@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a , you would see many more c@@ ases and exam@@ ples lin@@ king back to Americ@@ ans ."
"In fact , in a number of U@@ S sta@@ t@@ es you need less information , you need to provi@@ de less information to get a company than you do to get a li@@ bra@@ ry c@@ ard ."
That sort of sec@@ rec@@ y in America has allow@@ ed em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es of school di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts to ri@@ p off scho@@ ol@@ children .
It has allow@@ ed sc@@ am@@ m@@ ers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able invest@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavior that aff@@ ects all of us .
"Now , at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practi@@ ce ."
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we sent in an under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ esti@@ g@@ at@@ or to 1@@ 3 M@@ an@@ ha@@ t@@ tan la@@ w fi@@ r@@ ms .
"O@@ ur inv@@ esti@@ g@@ at@@ or pos@@ ed as an Afri@@ can mini@@ ster who wanted to move su@@ sp@@ ect fun@@ ds into the United States to bu@@ y a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"Now , what was tru@@ ly sh@@ oc@@ king was that all but one of those la@@ w@@ y@@ ers provi@@ ded our inv@@ esti@@ g@@ at@@ or with sug@@ ge@@ sti@@ ons on how to move those su@@ sp@@ ect fun@@ ds ."
"These were all pre@@ li@@ mi@@ nary me@@ eti@@ ngs , and n@@ one of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers took us on as a cli@@ ent and of course no money mo@@ ved hands , but it really show@@ s the problem with the system ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individu@@ al c@@ ases .
This is not just about an individu@@ al la@@ w@@ y@@ er who &apos;s sp@@ ok@@ en to our under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ esti@@ g@@ at@@ or and provi@@ ded sug@@ ge@@ sti@@ ons .
It &apos;s not just about a particular s@@ eni@@ or politi@@ ci@@ an who &apos;s been cau@@ ght up in a sc@@ an@@ d@@ al .
"This is about how a system works , that ent@@ ren@@ ches cor@@ rup@@ tion , ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion , po@@ ver@@ ty and in@@ sta@@ bility ."
"And in order to ta@@ ck@@ le this , we need to change the game ."
We need to change the ru@@ les of the game to make this sort of behavior har@@ der .
"This may see@@ m like do@@ om and g@@ lo@@ om , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be ri@@ ch and powerful individu@@ als ."
"But as a natural opti@@ mi@@ st , I do see that we are star@@ ting to get some change ."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real pu@@ sh to@@ wards great@@ er transp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy when it comes to company ow@@ ner@@ ship ."
This is@@ sue was put on the political ag@@ en@@ da by the U@@ K P@@ ri@@ me M@@ ini@@ ster D@@ a@@ vi@@ d C@@ am@@ er@@ on at a big G@@ 8 Su@@ m@@ mit that was hel@@ d in Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ re@@ land in 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
"And since then , the E@@ ur@@ ope@@ an Uni@@ on is going to be cre@@ ating cent@@ ral regi@@ st@@ ers at a national level of who really ow@@ ns and contro@@ ls companies across E@@ uro@@ pe ."
"One of the things that is sa@@ d is that , actually , the U@@ S is la@@ gg@@ ing behind ."
"There &apos;s bi@@ parti@@ san le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation that had been int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed in the H@@ ouse and the S@@ ena@@ te , but it isn &apos;t making as much pro@@ gre@@ ss as we &apos;d like to see ."
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ am@@ a le@@ ak@@ s , this huge pe@@ ek into the off@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of op@@ ening up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
We need ordinary people to get ang@@ ry at the way in which people can hi@@ de their id@@ ent@@ ity behind sec@@ re@@ t companies .
"We need business lead@@ ers to stand up and say , &quot; S@@ ec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need political lead@@ ers to recogni@@ ze the problem , and to com@@ mit to changing the la@@ w to open up this sort of sec@@ rec@@ y ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we can end the sec@@ rec@@ y that is curr@@ ently allow@@ ing ta@@ x ev@@ a@@ sion , cor@@ rup@@ tion , money la@@ under@@ ing to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh ."
"@@ Ch@@ ris An@@ der@@ son : Ju@@ li@@ an , w@@ el@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been repor@@ ted that W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has rele@@ as@@ ed more cla@@ ssi@@ fied do@@ cu@@ ments than the rest of the world &apos;s media com@@ bin@@ ed ."
C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"@@ Ju@@ li@@ an A@@ ss@@ ang@@ e : Yeah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts is able to rele@@ ase more of that ty@@ pe of information than the rest of the world pre@@ ss com@@ bin@@ ed .
C@@ A : How does it work ?
How do people rele@@ ase the do@@ cu@@ ments ?
And how do you sec@@ u@@ re their pri@@ vac@@ y ?
"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — cla@@ ssi@@ cal whi@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this sta@@ te@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ il@@ s , pa@@ ss it through leg@@ al ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to ena@@ ct those leg@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tions ."
"We get information in the mai@@ l , the re@@ gu@@ lar pos@@ tal mai@@ l , en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a re@@ gu@@ lar news organiz@@ ation , forma@@ t it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant da@@ ta@@ bas@@ es of information — rele@@ ase it to the public and then de@@ f@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able leg@@ al and political atta@@ cks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an ef@@ for@@ t to en@@ sure the do@@ cu@@ ments are leg@@ iti@@ mate , but you actually almost never know who the id@@ ent@@ ity of the source is ?"
"@@ J@@ A : That &apos;s right , ye@@ ah . V@@ ery ra@@ rely do we ever know , and if we find out at some sta@@ ge then we de@@ st@@ ro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( P@@ h@@ one ring ) God dam@@ n it .
( Laughter ) C@@ A : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A asking what the co@@ de is for a TED me@@ mb@@ er@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you le@@ ak@@ ed a few years ago .
If we can have this do@@ cu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in K@@ en@@ ya a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll R@@ ep@@ ort .
This was a sec@@ re@@ t intellig@@ ence repor@@ t com@@ mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an government after its elec@@ tion in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ ya was ru@@ led by D@@ ani@@ el a@@ rap M@@ oi for about 18 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ tat@@ or of K@@ en@@ ya .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ al@@ ition of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ rup@@ tion in K@@ en@@ ya — they com@@ mi@@ ssi@@ on@@ ed this repor@@ t , spent about two million p@@ ounds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated repor@@ t ."
"And then the government sat on it and used it for political le@@ verage on M@@ oi , who was the ri@@ che@@ st man — still is the ri@@ che@@ st man — in K@@ en@@ ya ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ rai@@ l of K@@ en@@ y@@ an jour@@ na@@ li@@ sm .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we manag@@ ed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we rele@@ as@@ ed that repor@@ t , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i , had decided to pa@@ l up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ ani@@ el a@@ rap M@@ oi , so this repor@@ t then became a de@@ ad al@@ bat@@ ross around P@@ resi@@ dent K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to cut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the repor@@ t le@@ ak@@ ed into K@@ en@@ ya , not from the offi@@ cial media , but in@@ direc@@ tly , and in your op@@ ini@@ on , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front pa@@ ge of the G@@ uar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ding countries of K@@ en@@ ya , in T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ an and S@@ outh Afri@@ can pre@@ ss ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an pre@@ ss feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts st@@ rai@@ ght on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an intellig@@ ence repor@@ t , which changed the result of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your le@@ ak really sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) C@@ A : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort cli@@ p from this B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d ai@@ r@@ stri@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort cli@@ p ."
"This is — this is int@@ en@@ se material , I should war@@ n you ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ... just fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; e@@ m just open &apos; e@@ m up ."
"I see your el@@ ement , u@@ h , got about four H@@ u@@ m@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..@@ ."
You &apos;re clear . All right . F@@ i@@ ring .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s sho@@ ot .
Li@@ ght &apos; e@@ m all up .
"@@ C &apos;@@ mon , fi@@ re !@@ "
( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fi@@ re ) K@@ e@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n . K@@ e@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n . ( M@@ ach@@ ine gu@@ n fi@@ re ) K@@ e@@ ep sho@@ ot &apos; n .
"H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ u@@ sh@@ ma@@ ster T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , B@@ u@@ sh@@ ma@@ ster T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x ,@@ "
"@@ we need to move , time now !@@ "
"A@@ ll right , we just eng@@ ag@@ ed all eight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Yeah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fi@@ ring ."
R@@ og@@ er . I got &apos; e@@ m .
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , this is T@@ wo@@ -@@ S@@ i@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"@@ God dam@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ ha . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d to fu@@ r@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three atta@@ cks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that atta@@ ck , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ ut@@ ers em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ wo Re@@ ut@@ ers em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 18 and 2@@ 6 people kil@@ led all together .
C@@ A : And rele@@ as@@ ing this cau@@ sed wi@@ de@@ sp@@ read ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key el@@ ement of this that actually cau@@ sed the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gue@@ ss people can see the g@@ ross di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in for@@ ce .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a rela@@ x@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an A@@ pa@@ che hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter sitting up at one kil@@ omet@@ er fi@@ ring 3@@ 0@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ met@@ er can@@ non sh@@ el@@ ls on everyone — looking for any ex@@ cu@@ se to do so — and kil@@ ling people re@@ s@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ na@@ li@@ sts inv@@ olved that c@@ lear@@ ly w@@ er@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their fu@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S@@ . intellig@@ ence anal@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ sted , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he con@@ fe@@ ssed in a chat room to have le@@ ak@@ ed this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 cla@@ ssi@@ fied U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have d@@ eni@@ ed re@@ cei@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been char@@ g@@ ed , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ab@@ les and rele@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had rele@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the Re@@ yk@@ j@@ a@@ vi@@ k U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y , but this is not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly connected ."
"I mean , I was a known vi@@ sit@@ or of that em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ cei@@ ve thousands of U.S@@ . em@@ bas@@ s@@ y di@@ plo@@ ma@@ tic c@@ ab@@ les ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have rele@@ as@@ ed them . ( C@@ A : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( C@@ A : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b governm@@ ents are like , the true human@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ us@@ es in those governm@@ ents ."
"If you look at dec@@ la@@ ssi@@ fied c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there ."
C@@ A : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y ?"
Why is it right to en@@ coura@@ ge le@@ ak@@ ing of sec@@ re@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achi@@ e@@ ve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ en@@ ding economic ef@@ for@@ t into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ nal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ en@@ ding work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practi@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ na@@ li@@ sm is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , either to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where le@@ ak@@ ing can actually have an un@@ int@@ en@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have rele@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ mun@@ iz@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of personal — perso@@ nally id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are leg@@ iti@@ mate sec@@ re@@ ts — you know , your recor@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a leg@@ iti@@ mate sec@@ re@@ t — but we deal with whi@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers that are coming forward that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ moti@@ v@@ ated ."
C@@ A : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ moti@@ v@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S@@ . mi@@ lit@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an inc@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It show@@ s a U.S@@ . sol@@ di@@ er la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pre@@ ssion , has given the im@@ pre@@ ssion , to millions of people around the world that U.S@@ . sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in A@@ f@@ gh@@ ani@@ sta@@ n — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ ini@@ on . It &apos;s not going to change their perc@@ ep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the perc@@ ep@@ tion and op@@ ini@@ on of the people who are pa@@ ying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
C@@ A : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k sec@@ re@@ ts in companies and in government .
Li@@ ght is good .
"But do you see any i@@ ron@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sources ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s di@@ ssi@@ d@@ ents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sources who are di@@ ssi@@ d@@ ents on other sources .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come forward , that would be a tri@@ ck@@ y situ@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mo@@ ra@@ lly comp@@ el@@ led to contin@@ ue our mi@@ ssion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous as to the op@@ ini@@ on in the TED au@@ dience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vie@@ ws of W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s and of Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — bri@@ ng@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the dang@@ er@@ ous t@@ rou@@ b@@ le@@ mak@@ er view ?
"@@ J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet le@@ ak@@ ed , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sam@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So late last year — in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ ber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well b@@ low@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a repor@@ t — a sort of engine@@ ering anal@@ y@@ sis into what happened — saying that , in fact , sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous comp@@ et@@ ing oi@@ l fi@@ r@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tru@@ cks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ i@@ an government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering repor@@ t had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ m@@ ely difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ pti@@ cal that maybe it was a comp@@ et@@ ing oi@@ l fi@@ r@@ m just sort of pla@@ ying the is@@ sue up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ pti@@ cal about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The material looks good , it fe@@ els right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a let@@ ter just this week from the company who wr@@ ote it , want@@ ing to tra@@ ck down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tra@@ ck down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , preci@@ sel@@ y , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had leg@@ al au@@ th@@ or@@ ity over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this scre@@ en sh@@ ot with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ tho@@ ds of id@@ enti@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write let@@ ters ."
C@@ A : Yeah . H@@ a@@ ve you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of seri@@ ous fund@@ rais@@ ing and engine@@ ering ef@@ for@@ t ."
So our pu@@ b@@ lic@@ ation rate over the past few months has been sort of mini@@ mi@@ zed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the phen@@ om@@ ena@@ l public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ ant@@ ity of whi@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ er di@@ sc@@ los@@ u@@ res of a very high cal@@ i@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k , basically jour@@ na@@ li@@ stic v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fund@@ ing of jour@@ na@@ li@@ stic sa@@ la@@ ries ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ sted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will deal with the high@@ est national sec@@ ur@@ ity stuff , and then low@@ er sec@@ ur@@ ity c@@ ases ."
C@@ A : So help us understand a bit about you perso@@ nally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a ki@@ d you went to 3@@ 7 different scho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movi@@ e business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the com@@ bi@@ nation between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ A : I mean , a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ st might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ oi@@ a ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the movi@@ e business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) C@@ A : And you were also — I mean , you were also a ha@@ ck@@ er at an early age and ran into the au@@ th@@ or@@ ities early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ na@@ list ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ na@@ list ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st at an early age ."
"I wr@@ ote a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine , was pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed for it when I was a te@@ ena@@ ger ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with ha@@ ck@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be de@@ plo@@ yed for vari@@ ous things .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , at the moment , it &apos;s mos@@ tly de@@ plo@@ yed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ count@@ s ."
"So this ph@@ ra@@ se is not , not as ni@@ ce as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Yeah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ cou@@ nt , but what about your c@@ ore val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that hel@@ ped det@@ er@@ mine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the c@@ ore val@@ ues : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms ; they nu@@ r@@ ture vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms ; they nu@@ r@@ ture vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a com@@ b@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nu@@ r@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of nu@@ r@@ tur@@ ing vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ p@@ et@@ rat@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my cha@@ rac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last min@@ ute , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , ran into t@@ rou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news ser@@ vice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted from run@@ ning the story ."
"I@@ n@@ stead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ cel@@ and went through this fin@@ an@@ cial c@@ ris@@ is .
It was the har@@ de@@ st h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sec@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the econom@@ y .
"A@@ ny@@ way , so we rele@@ ase this repor@@ t in Ju@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V sta@@ tion was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movi@@ e : in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion lan@@ ded on the news de@@ s@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ site instead , for all that time , as a fil@@ ler , and we became very f@@ am@@ ous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and sp@@ oke about this is@@ sue ."
"And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c politi@@ ci@@ ans and some other inter@@ national leg@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge of le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the free pre@@ ss , with the st@@ rong@@ est jour@@ na@@ li@@ stic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ech ."
"I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to tap into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pa@@ ssed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ an@@ im@@ ously ."
C@@ A : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us wat@@ ching B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be pla@@ yed for either way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ iz@@ e fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ech le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation and transp@@ ar@@ en@@ cy le@@ gi@@ s@@ lation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
W@@ hi@@ ch way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of ef@@ for@@ t , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fl@@ ecting the au@@ dience &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on to say , Ju@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( C@@ A : Thank you . ) ( Applause )@@ "
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Yor@@ k@@ er a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great b@@ le@@ ssing as a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I fami@@ li@@ ar with the 50 sta@@ t@@ es in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ sit@@ ed more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ ent@@ er has had fu@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ time pro@@ gram@@ s in 80 na@@ tions on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pre@@ si@@ dent , but we also me@@ et the vil@@ la@@ g@@ ers who live in the most re@@ mot@@ e areas of Africa ."
"So our over@@ all com@@ mit@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ ent@@ er is to pr@@ om@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any e@@ qui@@ v@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , st@@ rang@@ ely , not ad@@ dre@@ ssed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"Fi@@ rst of all is the mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of reli@@ gi@@ ous scri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ u@@ ran and so for@@ th , and these have been mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ ant pos@@ iti@@ ons in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ g@@ ues and the ch@@ ur@@ ches and in the mos@@ que@@ s ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordi@@ na@@ ri@@ ly rele@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary pos@@ ition compa@@ red to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very seri@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordi@@ na@@ ri@@ ly not ad@@ dre@@ ssed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 2@@ 000 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st for 70 years — I tell you , I still te@@ ach S@@ un@@ day school every S@@ un@@ day ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ un@@ day as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st C@@ on@@ ven@@ tion in the year 2@@ 000 decided that women should play a secon@@ d@@ ary pos@@ ition , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent pos@@ ition to men ."
"So they i@@ ss@@ ue@@ d an e@@ dic@@ t , in eff@@ ect , that pre@@ v@@ ents women from being pri@@ est@@ s , pa@@ st@@ ors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or cha@@ pla@@ ins in the mi@@ lit@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a cla@@ ss@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st se@@ mi@@ nary , they cannot te@@ ach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , there &apos;s over 3@@ 0,000 ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t te@@ ach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the ba@@ sic thing is the scri@@ p@@ tures are mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ ant pos@@ ition .
"That is an al@@ l@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ a@@ sive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive hu@@ s@@ b@@ and or an em@@ plo@@ y@@ er , for in@@ stance , want@@ s to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of God , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I pay them equ@@ al pay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very seri@@ ous bli@@ ght that cau@@ ses this problem is the ex@@ ce@@ ssive re@@ sort to viol@@ ence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for in@@ stance , we have had an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of poor people , mos@@ tly black people and min@@ or@@ ities , by put@@ ting them in pri@@ son ."
"When I was in offi@@ ce as gover@@ no@@ r of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"N@@ o@@ wa@@ days , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ fo@@ ld incre@@ ase .
"And since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 00 percent incre@@ ase in the number of women who are black who are in pri@@ son ."
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty that is a developed country .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ ong@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all el@@ em@@ ents of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing the death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia now , and I figu@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia has spent four billion dollars in con@@ vi@@ c@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia to s@@ end a person to be ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed ."
"N@@ e@@ bra@@ sk@@ a this week just pa@@ ssed a la@@ w ab@@ o@@ li@@ shing the death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty , because it cos@@ ts so much . ( Applause ) So the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and ab@@ use of poor people and hel@@ p@@ less people is another c@@ ause of the incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of women ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ us@@ es of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fai@@ r@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a limit@@ ed amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
"@@ G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely cut away by a so@@ -@@ called c@@ ut@@ ter who has a ra@@ z@@ or b@@ la@@ de and , in a non@@ -@@ ster@@ i@@ li@@ zed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ teri@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me c@@ ases but not very ra@@ re c@@ ases , they se@@ w the ori@@ fi@@ ce up so the girl can just u@@ ri@@ nate or men@@ stru@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets mar@@ ri@@ ed , the same c@@ ut@@ ter goes in and op@@ ens the ori@@ fi@@ ce up so she can have se@@ x ."
"This is not a ra@@ re thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , for in@@ stance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ ma@@ les that live in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are cut that way before they re@@ ach ma@@ tur@@ ity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very seri@@ ous thing is hon@@ or kil@@ li@@ ngs , where a family with mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation , again , of a ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ u@@ ran that man@@ dat@@ es this — will ex@@ ec@@ ute a girl in their family if she is rap@@ ed or if she mar@@ ries a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she we@@ ars i@@ nap@@ prop@@ ri@@ ate c@@ lo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by me@@ mbers of her own family , so the family bec@@ omes mu@@ r@@ der@@ ers when the girl bri@@ ngs so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ y@@ sis was done in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it show@@ ed that 7@@ 5 percent of these mu@@ r@@ ders of a girl are per@@ p@@ et@@ rated by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the mu@@ r@@ ders are con@@ duc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rela@@ t@@ es to women particu@@ larly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ffi@@ c@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ wa@@ days ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from Africa into s@@ la@@ very in the New Wor@@ ld back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment of S@@ ta@@ te now has a man@@ d@@ ate from C@@ ong@@ re@@ ss to give a repor@@ t every year , and the S@@ ta@@ te D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment repor@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are living in human bon@@ da@@ ge , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ ent@@ er is loc@@ ated and where I te@@ ach at E@@ m@@ ory Uni@@ versity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
"A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a has the bu@@ si@@ est ai@@ r@@ por@@ t in the world , and they also have a lot of pas@@ se@@ ng@@ ers that come from the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n H@@ e@@ mi@@ s@@ ph@@ ere ."
"If a bro@@ thel ow@@ ner want@@ s to bu@@ y a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ s@@ kin@@ ned girl bri@@ ngs se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ thel ow@@ ner in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The se@@ x tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the to@@ tal drug tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very seri@@ ous problem , and the ba@@ sic problem is pros@@ tit@@ u@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ o@@ re@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the local offi@@ ci@@ als , the local po@@ lic@@ em@@ en , or the chi@@ e@@ f of poli@@ ce or the ma@@ y@@ or and so for@@ th ."
"And this lea@@ ds to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ou@@ ght incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly and put into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very in all countries in the world ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed if they are in se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ thel ow@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the male cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , and — ( Applause ) — pros@@ tit@@ u@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite pos@@ ition ."
"For every male ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ leg@@ al se@@ x tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , I@@ re@@ land , I &apos;ve already said S@@ we@@ den , F@@ ran@@ ce , and other countries are moving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ we@@ di@@ sh model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great inst@@ itu@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ mi@@ re : our mi@@ lit@@ ary and our great univer@@ sity system .
"In the mi@@ lit@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts take place ."
"The last repor@@ t I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts that took place in the mi@@ lit@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding offi@@ cer of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ atta@@ lion in the Ar@@ my or a company in the Mar@@ ines — the com@@ man@@ ding offi@@ cer has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pros@@ ec@@ ute a rap@@ i@@ st or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their com@@ m@@ and , se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"A@@ b@@ out one out of four gir@@ ls who ent@@ er American univer@@ s@@ ities will be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ted before she gra@@ du@@ ates , and this is now getting a lot of pu@@ b@@ lic@@ ity , parti@@ ally because of my book , but other things , and so 8@@ 9 univer@@ s@@ ities in America are now con@@ de@@ mn@@ ed by the D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation under T@@ it@@ le I@@ X because the offi@@ ci@@ als of the univer@@ s@@ ities are not taking care of the women to prot@@ ect them from se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ t ."
"The D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment of Ju@@ sti@@ ce says that more than half of the rap@@ es on a colle@@ ge cam@@ p@@ us take place by seri@@ al rap@@ i@@ sts , because outside of the univer@@ sity system , if they rap@@ e somebody , they &apos;ll be pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , but when they get on a univer@@ sity cam@@ p@@ us , they can rap@@ e with imp@@ un@@ ity ."
They &apos;re not pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very seri@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls is the lack of equ@@ al pay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted , but for fu@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ time em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some pro@@ gre@@ ss , parti@@ ally because I was pre@@ si@@ dent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no pro@@ gre@@ ss made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 500 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 500 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like nation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head d@@ rop@@ ping b@@ om@@ b@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that atta@@ ck people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d Wor@@ ld W@@ ar .
"There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t d@@ rop a b@@ om@@ b , we didn &apos;t la@@ un@@ ch a mi@@ ssi@@ le , we didn &apos;t fi@@ re a bu@@ l@@ let ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to viol@@ ence and the mi@@ sin@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures are what cau@@ ses , are the ba@@ sic cau@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls ."
"There &apos;s one more ba@@ sic c@@ ause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a dam@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and gir@@ ls qui@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed pos@@ ition that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y , and this is very simi@@ lar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ pa@@ rate but equ@@ al had exi@@ sted ."
"@@ R@@ ac@@ i@@ al di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation , leg@@ ally , had exi@@ sted for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ et@@ ween the States , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 6@@ 0s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son got the bil@@ ls pa@@ ssed for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts ."
"But during that time , there were many wh@@ ite people that didn &apos;t think that ra@@ cial di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation was ok@@ ay , but they sta@@ yed qui@@ et , because they en@@ jo@@ yed the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ges of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ que access to ju@@ ry du@@ ty , better scho@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that exi@@ sts today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation against gir@@ ls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed pos@@ ition ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ or@@ ity of men who control the univer@@ sity system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the mi@@ lit@@ ary system , the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the governm@@ ents of the world , and the maj@@ or@@ ity of men that control the great reli@@ gi@@ ons ."
So what is the ba@@ sic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful na@@ tions like this one , and where you come from , E@@ uro@@ pe and so for@@ th , who have inf@@ lu@@ ence and who have fre@@ e@@ dom to speak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to ra@@ cial di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation against gir@@ ls and women all over the world ."
The average woman in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to de@@ tai@@ l about that .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fer@@ ence , that every woman here will get your hu@@ s@@ ban@@ ds to realize that these ab@@ us@@ es on the colle@@ ge cam@@ pu@@ ses and the mi@@ lit@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prot@@ ect your d@@ augh@@ ters and your g@@ ran@@ dd@@ augh@@ ters ."
"I have 12 grand@@ children , four children , and 10 great@@ -@@ grand@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they li@@ ved in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt or a fore@@ ig@@ n country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ ghts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a cham@@ pi@@ on for women and gir@@ ls around the world and prot@@ ect their human ri@@ ghts ."
Thank you very much .

My name is A@@ mit .
"And 18 months ago , I had another job at Goog@@ le , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms and art to my b@@ os@@ s who &apos;s actually here , and she allow@@ ed me to do it ."
And it took 18 months .
"A lot of fu@@ n , ne@@ g@@ oti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to focu@@ s on the de@@ m@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s access ."
And I gre@@ w up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms and these ar@@ t@@ works .
"And so when I started tra@@ vel@@ ing and going to these mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Goog@@ le , I tried to put this de@@ si@@ re to make it more ac@@ ce@@ ssi@@ ble with technology together ."
"So we for@@ med a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the de@@ m@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ un@@ ch .
"So , simple : you come to Goog@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ P@@ ro@@ j@@ ec@@ t@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ ffi@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , the H@@ er@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an Go@@ gh ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es , the M@@ et@@ rop@@ ol@@ it@@ an Mu@@ se@@ um of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ wo ways of going in — very simple .
"C@@ li@@ ck and , b@@ ang , you &apos;re in this mu@@ se@@ um ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ om@@ ba@@ y , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."
"You move around , you have fu@@ n ."
You want to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate around the mu@@ se@@ um ?
"O@@ pen the pla@@ n up , and , in one cli@@ ck , ju@@ m@@ p ."
"You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or ."
K@@ e@@ ep going . H@@ a@@ ve fu@@ n .
E@@ x@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks . I ha@@ ven &apos;t come to the best part .
"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my fav@@ or@@ ite pain@@ ti@@ ngs , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ v@@ est@@ ers &quot; &quot; by P@@ i@@ et@@ er B@@ rue@@ g@@ el at the M@@ et ."
I see this pl@@ us sig@@ n .
"If the mu@@ se@@ um has given us the image , you cli@@ ck on it ."
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interested in art , you can cli@@ ck this — but I &apos;m going to cli@@ ck this off right now ."
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ o@@ om around very simply .
You see some fu@@ n stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pre@@ ssion is pri@@ cel@@ ess .
But then you really want to go deep .
"And so I started pla@@ ying around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That s@@ ounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started not@@ ic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , sp@@ oke to a couple of my con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called s@@ qu@@ all , which inv@@ ol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a sti@@ ck on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ ue@@ s@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite popu@@ lar .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the c@@ rac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ sp@@ ective , I &apos;m going to z@@ o@@ om out so you really see what you get ."
"H@@ ere is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly ju@@ m@@ p into the M@@ o@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es , &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ i@@ ght . &quot; &quot; Now the example I show@@ ed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ tail@@ s ."
But what if you want to see b@@ ru@@ sh st@@ rok@@ es ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an Go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
You z@@ o@@ om in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fav@@ or@@ ite parts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the c@@ rac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The S@@ tar@@ ry N@@ i@@ ght , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fav@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real co@@ ol part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ tions .
"A@@ ny one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re ri@@ ch , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mu@@ se@@ um on@@ line — create your own coll@@ ection across all these images .
"@@ V@@ ery simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ ow@@ er of Z@@ o@@ om — you can just z@@ o@@ om around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ al@@ l@@ ery ."
"You can an@@ no@@ ta@@ te the stuff , s@@ end it to your friends and really get a conver@@ sation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ piec@@ es ."
"So I think , in con@@ c@@ lu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Goog@@ le ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ ini@@ on , even come from the mu@@ se@@ u@@ ms ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hu@@ mb@@ ling experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this dig@@ ital medi@@ um that we do ju@@ sti@@ ce to their ar@@ t@@ work and re@@ present it pr@@ oper@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the bi@@ g@@ gest question I get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a mu@@ se@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do achi@@ e@@ ve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , coll@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely all the Wor@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vi@@ r@@ tual problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly a bad thing ."
We &apos;re ev@@ ol@@ ving to be a more col@@ labo@@ ra@@ tive and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
And we actually build st@@ rong@@ er social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a result .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
H@@ is work is bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situ@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"B@@ e@@ fore we had a@@ we@@ some game contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had s@@ he@@ ep &apos;s knu@@ ck@@ les ."
P@@ eople were su@@ ffer@@ ing . P@@ eople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the f@@ am@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fi@@ nal di@@ ce game ."
"We want to imagine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achi@@ e@@ ve the e@@ pi@@ c win ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a gra@@ phi@@ c no@@ vel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ il@@ ls like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , su@@ stai@@ na@@ bility , vi@@ sion and re@@ sour@@ ce@@ fu@@ l@@ ness ."
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my de@@ s@@ k . I b@@ rok@@ e my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five st@@ it@@ ches on my right eye ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the value of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with medi@@ cal doc@@ tors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more inspi@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new rev@@ olution , this new fe@@ mini@@ st is@@ sue ."
"We are literally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , literally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation has become a vi@@ ri@@ l@@ ity sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ specially here in W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ fast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ i@@ ght o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck is too late for me , but that &apos;s ok@@ ay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence cal@@ ls and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bu@@ s@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in politi@@ cs , making terri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ i@@ st@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hi@@ le all the bro@@ thers were bu@@ s@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connected 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have not@@ ic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have wok@@ en up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the mul@@ ti@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , g@@ rat@@ itu@@ de , eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .

"Well , as Ch@@ ris poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the func@@ tions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ ute about what this en@@ tail@@ s .
"H@@ ere is this ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te itself con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ting on the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive quality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ uro@@ logy , and h@@ ope@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ ster@@ i@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ la@@ sm , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this activ@@ ity emer@@ ges the whole sp@@ ec@@ tru@@ m of abil@@ ities that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the func@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined da@@ ma@@ ge to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ g@@ n@@ itive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ective los@@ s of one func@@ tion , with other func@@ tions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ ta@@ ct , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ olved in medi@@ ating that func@@ tion ."
"So you can then map func@@ tion on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular func@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral lob@@ es , fron@@ tal lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ e@@ tal lob@@ es , O@@ K — the lob@@ es that con@@ st@@ it@@ ute the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the tem@@ po@@ ral lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer recogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogni@@ ze them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogni@@ ze yourself in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well known as cau@@ sed by da@@ ma@@ ge to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus .
"But there &apos;s another ra@@ re sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so ra@@ re , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ uro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ ju@@ ry , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"W@@ h@@ y would somebody — and this person is perf@@ ec@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intellig@@ ent in all other resp@@ ects , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ u@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ books , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ gu@@ ment app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a st@@ rong se@@ x@@ u@@ al at@@ trac@@ tion to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us complex of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these la@@ t@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"@@ Thank God , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , da@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allow@@ ing these la@@ t@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , f@@ lam@@ ing to the surface , and sudd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your da@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ gu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very ing@@ eni@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ gu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , a patient having the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , about his p@@ et po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )@@ "
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; Ri@@ ght ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the la@@ t@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expla@@ in this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the structure and func@@ tions of the nor@@ mal vi@@ sual pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ ma@@ lly , vi@@ sual sig@@ na@@ ls come in , into the e@@ ye@@ bal@@ ls , go to the vi@@ sual areas in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vi@@ sion , and after proce@@ ssing all that , the messa@@ ge goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus , where you per@@ cei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ s@@ itive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the messa@@ ge c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the li@@ m@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the emoti@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something absol@@ utely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ int , or a piece of chal@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
W@@ hi@@ ch you can completely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the messa@@ ges then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ ton@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to di@@ ssi@@ pat@@ e the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mu@@ s@@ cu@@ lar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tu@@ nate , because we can put two elec@@ t@@ ro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and mea@@ sure the change in sk@@ in resi@@ stance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can det@@ er@@ mine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ ute .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ sual areas and , h@@ ow@@ ever , and it &apos;s proce@@ ssed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus , and you recogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the messa@@ ge c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ ton@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the li@@ m@@ bi@@ c system , the emoti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ ta@@ ct , the cha@@ p can still recogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is cut to the emoti@@ onal cent@@ ers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? Ri@@ ght ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ cou@@ nt for this in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able lack of emoti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some st@@ range woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and mea@@ sure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can mea@@ sure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a pin@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?"
You take the patient and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and mea@@ sure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and chai@@ r@@ s and l@@ int , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fla@@ t ."
"There &apos;s no emoti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the vi@@ sual areas to the emoti@@ onal cent@@ ers is cut ."
"So his vi@@ sion is nor@@ mal because the vi@@ sual areas are nor@@ mal , his emoti@@ ons are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll la@@ u@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the wi@@ re from vi@@ sion to emoti@@ ons is cut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ v@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , ne@@ u@@ ral p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the stan@@ d@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a preci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ u@@ ral an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phon@@ es from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — phon@@ es him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? W@@ here are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ u@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ pa@@ rate pa@@ th@@ way going from the he@@ aring cent@@ ers in the brain to the emoti@@ onal cent@@ ers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he recogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this complex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it nu@@ r@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b .
And you all know what a phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted , for g@@ ang@@ ren@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a seri@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mi@@ ssing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a phant@@ om ar@@ m or a phant@@ om le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a phant@@ om with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ e@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ nal vi@@ sc@@ era ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the ut@@ er@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ ster@@ ec@@ t@@ om@@ y — who have a phant@@ om ut@@ er@@ us , inclu@@ ding phant@@ om men@@ stru@@ al c@@ ram@@ ps at the ap@@ prop@@ ri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phant@@ om P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fic en@@ qui@@ ry , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ sue@@ d that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about phant@@ om li@@ mb@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phant@@ om li@@ mb@@ s c@@ lai@@ m that they can move the phant@@ om ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it ri@@ ngs , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
"These are very comp@@ el@@ ling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The patient &apos;s not d@@ el@@ u@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the patient ."
"But h@@ ow@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b is pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched spa@@ sm and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ati@@ ng@@ ly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pai@@ n will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b be pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed ?"
It s@@ ounds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case s@@ he@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed phant@@ om li@@ mb@@ s , the ori@@ gi@@ nal ar@@ m was pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve supp@@ l@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was cut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the patient had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mi@@ s@@ gu@@ i@@ ded at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pai@@ n in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ tates the ar@@ m , and then you get a phant@@ om ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a seri@@ ous cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pre@@ ssed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ i@@ ci@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case s@@ he@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves supp@@ l@@ ying the ar@@ m had been cut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pai@@ n then gets car@@ ri@@ ed over into the phant@@ om itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ ta@@ ct , but pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ sual fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No . M@@ o@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere com@@ m@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sation of a pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted the ar@@ m , this learned pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis car@@ ries over into your body image and into your phant@@ om , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis , so you can reli@@ e@@ ve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching spa@@ sm of the phant@@ om ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the com@@ m@@ and to the phant@@ om , but give him vi@@ sual fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his com@@ m@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ a@@ ybe you can reli@@ e@@ ve the phant@@ om pai@@ n , the phant@@ om c@@ ram@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vi@@ r@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts millions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard box with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the phant@@ om — so my first patient , D@@ er@@ ek , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the ar@@ m was pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ ta@@ ted ."
"He had a phant@@ om ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ati@@ ng@@ ly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed phant@@ om ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the patient put@@ s his phant@@ om left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in spa@@ sm , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the phant@@ om being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ection of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this phant@@ om has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"@@ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ gg@@ le your phant@@ om — your real fi@@ ng@@ ers , or move your real fi@@ ng@@ ers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ sual im@@ pre@@ ssion that the phant@@ om is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the ast@@ oni@@ shing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phant@@ om is moving again , and the pai@@ n , the cl@@ en@@ ching spa@@ sm , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — than@@ k you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ fl@@ ection of your phant@@ om . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phant@@ om . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand and phant@@ om . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phant@@ om . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ o@@ ve your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phant@@ om is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pai@@ n is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clos@@ es his eyes ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"@@ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; O@@ K , open your eyes . &quot;"
"@@ &quot; Oh my God , o@@ h my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis and the cr@@ iti@@ cal ro@@ le of vi@@ sual in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his phant@@ om li@@ m@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely u@@ sel@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )@@ "
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis that you see in ne@@ uro@@ logy , like st@@ rok@@ e , fo@@ cal d@@ y@@ st@@ oni@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ ek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pai@@ n — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ ek , take it home and practi@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ a@@ ybe , after a per@@ i@@ od of practi@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis , and start moving your pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ zed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ e@@ ve yourself of pai@@ n . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phon@@ es me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phant@@ om I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s di@@ sap@@ pe@@ a@@ red . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ri@@ ed , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , eth@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ ek , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phant@@ om ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no phant@@ om el@@ b@@ ow pai@@ n , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no phant@@ om fore@@ ar@@ m pai@@ n , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my phant@@ om fi@@ ng@@ ers dang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and eli@@ mi@@ nate my phant@@ om fi@@ ng@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory con@@ f@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting messa@@ ges from vi@@ sion saying the phant@@ om is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no prop@@ ri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mu@@ sc@@ le sig@@ na@@ ls saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mot@@ or com@@ m@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no phant@@ om , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of d@@ eni@@ al — it g@@ ates the sig@@ na@@ ls .
"And when the ar@@ m di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ars , the bon@@ us is , the pai@@ n di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died pai@@ n flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us ."
"Now , this techni@@ que has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ sin@@ ki , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for phant@@ om pai@@ n , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ rok@@ e re@@ ha@@ bil@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tr@@ oke you nor@@ ma@@ lly think of as da@@ ma@@ ge to the fi@@ b@@ ers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ rok@@ e pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis is also learned pa@@ ra@@ ly@@ sis , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also gone through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch ge@@ ars now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous phen@@ omen@@ on called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the nin@@ et@@ e@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ sin of C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ win .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , had the follow@@ ing p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"Fi@@ ve is blue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely nor@@ mal in other resp@@ ects ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , ton@@ es ev@@ oke col@@ or ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is blue , F shar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia , a mi@@ ng@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are di@@ st@@ inc@@ t ."
These people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two a@@ sp@@ ects of this problem are very int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia run@@ s in fami@@ lies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ e@@ dit@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main the@@ me of this l@@ ec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity — sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia is eight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , poet@@ s , no@@ v@@ eli@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answ@@ ered before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ? What cau@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One theory is they &apos;re just cra@@ zy .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ ki@@ es and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia . All right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal c@@ ross wi@@ ring between col@@ or and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ member I said it run@@ s in fami@@ lies ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that cau@@ ses this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross wi@@ ring ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ stic mo@@ du@@ lar archit@@ ec@@ ture of the a@@ du@@ l@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e cau@@ sing this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ tates , then you get de@@ fi@@ cient tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain areas ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get nu@@ mb@@ er@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get ton@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pre@@ ssed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ connected ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ v@@ eli@@ sts and poet@@ s have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly un@@ rela@@ ted ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the ea@@ st , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ low@@ ing b@@ all of fi@@ re ?"
"I mean , s@@ chi@@ z@@ o@@ ph@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the sun , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s nu@@ r@@ tur@@ ing like the sun ."
"I@@ n@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this great@@ er c@@ ross wi@@ ring and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a great@@ er prop@@ en@@ sity to@@ wards me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in people with sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia am@@ ong poet@@ s , arti@@ sts and no@@ v@@ eli@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ o@@ logical view of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one min@@ ute ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in d@@ eni@@ al about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call M@@ arti@@ an al@@ pha@@ b@@ et . Just like your al@@ pha@@ b@@ et , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ffer@@ ent sha@@ pes for different phon@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got M@@ arti@@ an al@@ pha@@ b@@ et ."
"One of them is K@@ ik@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
W@@ hi@@ ch one is K@@ ik@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ ik@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ ai@@ se your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ t@@ ants ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ ik@@ i ? R@@ ai@@ se your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a M@@ arti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ model sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ tic ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tion , mean@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p inf@@ l@@ ection — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your au@@ dit@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the hair cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ ik@@ i , mi@@ mi@@ cs the vi@@ sual inf@@ l@@ ection , sudd@@ en inf@@ l@@ ection of that j@@ ag@@ g@@ ed sha@@ pe ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ m@@ itive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a si@@ lly il@@ lu@@ sion , but these phot@@ ons in your eye are doing this sha@@ pe , and hair cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ dit@@ ory patter@@ n , but the brain is able to ex@@ trac@@ t the common den@@ omi@@ nat@@ or ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ m@@ itive form of ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tion , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ rus of the brain , because when that &apos;s da@@ mag@@ ed , these people l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ ik@@ i , but they also l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to mea@@ sure its speci@@ fic gra@@ v@@ ity , O@@ K ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mi@@ ss the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical mean@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about eight times the size in high@@ er — e@@ specially in humans — as in low@@ er pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ u@@ lar g@@ y@@ rus , because it &apos;s the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ads between he@@ aring , vi@@ sion and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."

This story is about taking ima@@ gi@@ nation seri@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ count@@ ered this ordinary material , fi@@ sh@@ net , used the same way for centu@@ ries ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bil@@ low@@ ing , v@@ ol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous for@@ ms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ g@@ ed buil@@ di@@ ngs in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ likely person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ died s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or archit@@ ec@@ ture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to seven art scho@@ ols and was re@@ j@@ ected by all seven ."
"I went off on my own to become an arti@@ st , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was o@@ ffer@@ ed a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"P@@ r@@ omi@@ sing to give ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iti@@ ons of pain@@ ti@@ ngs , I shi@@ pp@@ ed my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pu@@ ra@@ m ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ shing vil@@ la@@ ge was f@@ am@@ ous for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tried b@@ ron@@ ze ca@@ sting .
But to make large for@@ ms was too he@@ av@@ y and ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men b@@ und@@ le their n@@ ets into m@@ ounds on the sand ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make v@@ olu@@ met@@ ri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture was made in col@@ labo@@ ration with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it tit@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ de H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We h@@ oi@@ sted them on pol@@ es to phot@@ og@@ rap@@ h .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ pp@@ le of w@@ ind in con@@ st@@ antly changing patter@@ ns .
I was me@@ sm@@ er@@ iz@@ ed .
"I contin@@ ue@@ d stud@@ ying cra@@ ft tra@@ diti@@ ons and col@@ labo@@ rat@@ ing with arti@@ san@@ s , next in Li@@ th@@ uan@@ ia with la@@ ce mak@@ ers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine de@@ tai@@ l it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to India to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed kn@@ ots — in@@ sta@@ l@@ led bri@@ ef@@ ly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ou@@ sands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ i@@ st M@@ an@@ u@@ al S@@ o@@ la@@ -@@ M@@ o@@ ra@@ les who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pre@@ ser@@ ve my art .
"D@@ u@@ ra@@ ble , engine@@ ered , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ pos@@ ition to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic , d@@ el@@ ic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time re@@ main so@@ ft enough to move f@@ lu@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ ffi@@ c cir@@ cle .
"So we rais@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el ring ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gra@@ ce@@ fully in an average bre@@ e@@ ze and survi@@ ve in hu@@ r@@ ri@@ can@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering sof@@ t@@ ware to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant a@@ er@@ ona@@ u@@ ti@@ cal engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sai@@ ls for America &apos;s C@@ up rac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts nam@@ ed P@@ et@@ er H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me ta@@ ck@@ le the t@@ win challeng@@ es of preci@@ se sha@@ pe and g@@ ent@@ le movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because han@@ d-@@ ti@@ ed kn@@ ots w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ stand a hu@@ r@@ ri@@ can@@ e .
"So I developed a relation@@ ship with an indu@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ t@@ ory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their ma@@ chin@@ es , and figu@@ red out a way to make la@@ ce with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ late this an@@ cient , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic han@@ d@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could produce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we rais@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ s@@ qu@@ are@@ -@@ fo@@ ot la@@ ce net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had imag@@ ined was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ lation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ sec@@ tion had been b@@ land and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ograph@@ y un@@ fo@@ ld , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , connected to limit@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ i@@ st@@ ori@@ c P@@ hi@@ la@@ d@@ el@@ phi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pla@@ z@@ a , I felt , needed a material for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than n@@ etting ."
"So we experim@@ ented with tiny at@@ omi@@ zed water parti@@ cles to create a d@@ ry mi@@ st that is sha@@ ped by the w@@ ind and in te@@ sting , disco@@ vered that it can be sha@@ ped by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture material to tra@@ ce the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins ab@@ o@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ ra@@ y of the city &apos;s cir@@ cu@@ la@@ t@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ext challenge , the B@@ i@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Americ@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 na@@ tions of the W@@ est@@ er@@ n he@@ mi@@ s@@ ph@@ ere and their inter@@ conn@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said yes ."
I read about the rec@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in C@@ hi@@ le and the t@@ su@@ nam@@ i that ri@@ pp@@ led across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ec@@ ton@@ ic pla@@ t@@ es , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s ro@@ tation and literally sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed the leng@@ th of the day ."
"So I con@@ ta@@ c@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , and trans@@ lated it into this ."
I@@ ts tit@@ le : &quot; &quot; 1.@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of mic@@ ros@@ econ@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el ring , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sha@@ pe was too complex now .
"So I re@@ pla@@ ced the me@@ tal ar@@ ma@@ ture with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine me@@ sh of a fi@@ ber 15 times st@@ rong@@ er than ste@@ el ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ rely so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to exi@@ sting buil@@ di@@ ngs — literally bec@@ om@@ ing part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no sof@@ t@@ ware that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ v@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity asking if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ i@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tural me@@ th@@ od ena@@ b@@ les me to model these and build these s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fund@@ ing yet , but I dre@@ am now of bri@@ ng@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for be@@ au@@ ty in the tra@@ diti@@ onal things , in cra@@ ft for@@ ms ."
"Now I com@@ b@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ t@@ ech materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create v@@ ol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ low@@ ing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ di@@ ngs ."
My arti@@ stic h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ h@@ oen@@ i@@ x .
"A@@ n at@@ t@@ or@@ ney in the offi@@ ce who &apos;d never been interested in art , never vi@@ sit@@ ed the local art mu@@ se@@ um , dra@@ gg@@ ed everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the gra@@ ss , not@@ ic@@ ing the changing patter@@ ns of w@@ ind be@@ side people they didn &apos;t know , shar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .

The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal a@@ x@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pu@@ ber@@ ty , we f@@ all off the map ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .

So when I was a ki@@ d ...
this was my team .
( Laughter ) I st@@ un@@ k at sp@@ or@@ ts .
"I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to wat@@ ch them ."
So this is what I did . I went fi@@ shing .
"And for all of my growing up I fi@@ shed on the sho@@ res of C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut , and these are the cre@@ atu@@ res that I saw on a re@@ gu@@ lar bas@@ is ."
"But after I gre@@ w up and went to colle@@ ge , and I came home in the early 90 &apos;s , this is what I found ."
My team had sh@@ run@@ k .
It was like literally having your ros@@ ter de@@ v@@ as@@ ta@@ ted .
"And as I sort of looked into that , from a very personal point of view as a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , I started to kind of figure out , well , what was the rest of the world thinking about it ?"
F@@ i@@ rst place I started to look was fish mark@@ ets .
"And when I went to fish mark@@ ets , in sp@@ ite of where I was — whether I was in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina , or P@@ ar@@ is , or L@@ on@@ don , or wh@@ er@@ ever — I ke@@ pt seeing this we@@ ir@@ dly re@@ pe@@ ating t@@ ro@@ pe of four cre@@ atu@@ res , again and again — on the men@@ us , on ice — sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , tun@@ a , s@@ al@@ mon and c@@ od ."
"And I thought this was pretty st@@ range , and as I looked at it , I was wonder@@ ing , did any@@ one else noti@@ ce this sort of sh@@ r@@ in@@ king of the market ?"
"Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team ."
"O@@ r@@ di@@ nary people , the way they looked at se@@ a@@ food was like this ."
It &apos;s not an un@@ u@@ sual human cha@@ rac@@ teri@@ stic to re@@ duce the natural world down to very few el@@ em@@ ents .
"We did it before , 1@@ 0,000 years ago , when we came out of our ca@@ ves ."
"If you look at fi@@ re p@@ its from 1@@ 0,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see rac@@ co@@ ons , you &apos;ll see , you know , w@@ ol@@ ves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different cre@@ atu@@ res ."
"But if you tel@@ e@@ s@@ co@@ pe to the age of — you know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four ma@@ m@@ ma@@ ls : pi@@ gs , c@@ ow@@ s , s@@ he@@ ep and go@@ ats ."
"It &apos;s true of bir@@ ds , too ."
"You look at the men@@ us in New York C@@ ity re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants 1@@ 50 years ago , 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see s@@ ni@@ pe , wo@@ od@@ co@@ ck , grou@@ se , do@@ z@@ ens of duc@@ ks , do@@ z@@ ens of ge@@ e@@ se ."
"But tel@@ e@@ s@@ co@@ pe a@@ head to the age of mo@@ der@@ n anima@@ l hu@@ s@@ ban@@ d@@ ry , and you &apos;ll see four : tur@@ ke@@ ys , duc@@ ks , chi@@ ck@@ en and ge@@ e@@ se ."
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve he@@ ad@@ ed in this direc@@ tion .
But how have we he@@ ad@@ ed in this direc@@ tion ?
Well ...
"@@ first it &apos;s a very , very new problem ."
This is the way we &apos;ve been fi@@ shing the oce@@ ans over the last 50 years .
Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I was a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous inc@@ enti@@ ve to ar@@ m ourselves in a war against fish .
"A@@ ll of the technology that we perf@@ ected during Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I — so@@ na@@ r , li@@ gh@@ t@@ we@@ i@@ ght pol@@ y@@ m@@ ers — all these things were re@@ direc@@ ted to@@ wards fish ."
"And so you see this tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous buil@@ du@@ p in fi@@ shing cap@@ ac@@ ity , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ing in the course of time , from the end of Wor@@ ld W@@ ar I@@ I to the present time ."
And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 90 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons out of the se@@ a every year .
That &apos;s the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the human we@@ i@@ ght of China taken out of the se@@ a every year .
And it &apos;s no co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that I use China as the example because China is now the lar@@ gest fi@@ shing nation in the world .
"Well , that &apos;s only half the story ."
"The other half of the story is this incredible bo@@ om in fish far@@ ming and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , which is now , only in the last year or two , star@@ ting to ex@@ ce@@ ed the amount of wi@@ ld fish that we produce ."
"So that if you ad@@ d wi@@ ld fish and far@@ med fish together , you get the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of two C@@ hi@@ na@@ s created from the ocean each and every year ."
"And again , it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that I use China as the example , because China , in ad@@ dition to being the bi@@ g@@ gest cat@@ ch@@ er of fish , is also the bi@@ g@@ gest far@@ mer of fish ."
So let &apos;s look though at the four cho@@ ices we are making right now .
"The first one — by far the most con@@ su@@ med se@@ a@@ food in America and in much of the W@@ est , is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
S@@ h@@ ri@@ m@@ p in the wi@@ ld — as a wi@@ ld produc@@ t — is a terri@@ ble produc@@ t .
"@@ 5 , 10 , 15 p@@ ounds of wi@@ ld fish are re@@ gu@@ larly kil@@ led to bring one p@@ ound of sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p to the market ."
They &apos;re also incredi@@ bly fue@@ l ine@@ ffi@@ cient to bring to the market .
"In a rec@@ ent study that was produc@@ ed out of D@@ al@@ h@@ ou@@ si@@ e Uni@@ versity , it was found that dra@@ gg@@ ing for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is one of the most car@@ bon@@ -@@ int@@ en@@ sive ways of fi@@ shing that you can find ."
"So you can far@@ m them , and people do far@@ m them , and they far@@ m them a lot in this very area ."
P@@ rob@@ le@@ m is ...
the place where you far@@ m sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is in these wi@@ ld ha@@ bit@@ ats — in m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ve fore@@ sts .
Now look at those lo@@ v@@ ely ro@@ ots coming down .
"Th@@ ose are the things that hold so@@ il together , prot@@ ect co@@ a@@ sts , create ha@@ bit@@ ats for all sor@@ ts of young fish , young sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , all sor@@ ts of things that are important to this environment ."
"Well , this is what happens to a lot of co@@ as@@ tal m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ve fore@@ sts ."
We &apos;ve lost millions of ac@@ res of co@@ as@@ tal m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ves over the last 30 or 40 years .
"That rate of de@@ struc@@ tion has s@@ low@@ ed , but we &apos;re still in a maj@@ or m@@ ang@@ ro@@ ve de@@ fic@@ it ."
"The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a phen@@ omen@@ on that the fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er Mar@@ k B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in called &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ in@@ ding N@@ em@@ o . &quot; &quot; This phen@@ omen@@ on is very , very rele@@ v@@ ant to anything that you &apos;ve ever seen on a tr@@ op@@ ical re@@ e@@ f ."
"Because what &apos;s going on right now , we have sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p dra@@ gg@@ ers dra@@ gg@@ ing for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , cat@@ ching a huge amount of b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch , that b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch in turn gets ground up and turned into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p food ."
"And sometimes , many of these ve@@ s@@ sel@@ s — man@@ ned by s@@ la@@ ves — are cat@@ ching these so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; tra@@ sh fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would love to see on a re@@ e@@ f , g@@ r@@ in@@ ding them up and tur@@ ning them into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p fe@@ ed — an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem literally e@@ ating itself and sp@@ it@@ ting out sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
"The next most con@@ su@@ med se@@ a@@ food in America , and also throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est , is tun@@ a ."
So tun@@ a is this ul@@ ti@@ mate global fish .
These huge manag@@ ement areas have to be ob@@ ser@@ ved in order for tun@@ a to be well manag@@ ed .
"O@@ ur own manag@@ ement area , called a Re@@ gi@@ onal F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ ies M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation , is called I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T , the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mi@@ ssion for the C@@ on@@ ser@@ vation of A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic T@@ u@@ na@@ s ."
"O@@ f course we &apos;ve seen incredible impro@@ v@@ ement in I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T in the last few years , there is to@@ tal room for impro@@ v@@ ement , but it re@@ ma@@ ins to be said that tun@@ a is a global fish , and to man@@ age it , we have to man@@ age the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"Well , we could also try to grow tun@@ a but tun@@ a is a sp@@ ec@@ ta@@ cu@@ larly bad anima@@ l for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
M@@ any people don &apos;t know this but tun@@ a are war@@ m@@ -@@ blo@@ o@@ ded .
"They can he@@ at their bo@@ dies 20 de@@ gre@@ es ab@@ o@@ ve am@@ bi@@ ent tem@@ per@@ ature , they can s@@ wi@@ m at over 40 mi@@ les an h@@ our ."
"So that pretty much eli@@ mi@@ nat@@ es all the adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ges of far@@ ming a fish , right ?"
"A far@@ med fish is — or a fish is col@@ d-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , it doesn &apos;t move too much ."
That &apos;s a great thing for growing prot@@ e@@ in .
The next cre@@ ature — most con@@ su@@ med se@@ a@@ food in America and throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est — is s@@ al@@ mon .
"Now s@@ al@@ mon got its pl@@ under@@ ing , too , but it didn &apos;t really nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly happen through fi@@ shing ."
This is my home state of C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut .
C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut used to be home to a lot of wi@@ ld s@@ al@@ mon .
"But if you look at this map of C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut , every dot on that map is a da@@ m ."
"There are over 3@@ ,000 dam@@ s in the state of C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut ."
"I often say this is why people in C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut are so u@@ pti@@ ght — ( Laughter ) If somebody could just un@@ blo@@ ck C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut &apos;s chi , I feel that we could have an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely better world ."
"But I made this particular com@@ ment at a con@@ ven@@ tion once of national par@@ ks of@@ fic@@ ers , and this guy from Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina si@@ d@@ led up to me , he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you ou@@ gh@@ tn &apos;t be so hard on your C@@ on@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut , c@@ ause we here in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ ina , we got 3@@ 5@@ ,000 dam@@ s . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic , it &apos;s an inter@@ national e@@ pi@@ de@@ mic ."
"And there are dam@@ s every@@ where , and these are preci@@ sel@@ y the things that stop wi@@ ld s@@ al@@ mon from re@@ ach@@ ing their spa@@ w@@ ning grou@@ n@@ ds ."
Th@@ ose p@@ ell@@ ets are in turn re@@ duc@@ ed fish .
"So the ac@@ tual — what &apos;s called the F@@ I@@ F@@ O , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say ."
"But in any case , cre@@ d@@ it to the indu@@ stry , it has low@@ ered the amount of fish per p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ mon ."
P@@ rob@@ le@@ m is we &apos;ve also gone cra@@ zy with the amount of s@@ al@@ mon that we &apos;re produc@@ ing .
A@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture is the fa@@ ste@@ st growing food system on the planet .
It &apos;s growing at something like seven percent per year .
"And so even though we &apos;re doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still kil@@ ling a lot of these little fish ."
"And it &apos;s not just fish that we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding fish to , we &apos;re also fe@@ e@@ ding fish to chi@@ ck@@ ens and pi@@ gs ."
"So we &apos;ve got chi@@ ck@@ ens and they &apos;re e@@ ating fish , but we@@ ir@@ dly , we also have fish that are e@@ ating chi@@ ck@@ ens ."
"Because the b@@ y@@ produc@@ ts of chi@@ ck@@ ens — fe@@ a@@ thers , blood , b@@ one — get ground up and f@@ ed to fish ."
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons of wi@@ ld cre@@ atu@@ res that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
"That &apos;s the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the se@@ a each and every year ."
The last of the four is a kind of am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous thing .
"It &apos;s what the indu@@ stry cal@@ ls &quot; &quot; wh@@ it@@ e@@ fish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish that get cy@@ c@@ led into this wh@@ it@@ e@@ fish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , I think , is through that cla@@ ssi@@ c piece of American cu@@ li@@ nary inno@@ vation , the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ is@@ h san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch ."
So the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ is@@ h san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch actually started as ha@@ li@@ but .
"And it started because a local f@@ ran@@ chi@@ se ow@@ ner found that when he ser@@ ved his M@@ c@@ D@@ ona@@ ld &apos;s on F@@ ri@@ day , no@@ body came ."
"Because it was a C@@ a@@ tho@@ li@@ c community , they needed fish ."
"So he went to R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring you a fish san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch , going to be made out of ha@@ li@@ but . &quot;"
"@@ R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work ."
"I want to do a H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger , and there &apos;s going to be a sli@@ ce of p@@ ine@@ ap@@ ple on a bu@@ n ."
"But let &apos;s do this , let &apos;s have a b@@ et ."
"W@@ hos@@ ever san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch sel@@ ls more , that will be the win@@ ning san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sa@@ d for the ocean that the H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger didn &apos;t win ."
So he made his ha@@ li@@ but san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately though , the san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch came in at 30 c@@ ents ."
"@@ R@@ ay wanted the san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch to come in at 25 c@@ ents , so he turned to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic c@@ od ."
We all know what happened to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic c@@ od in New Eng@@ land .
"So now the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ is@@ h san@@ d@@ wi@@ ch is made out of A@@ la@@ sk@@ a pol@@ lo@@ ck , it &apos;s the lar@@ gest f@@ in fish fi@@ sh@@ ery in the United States , 2 to 3 billion p@@ ounds of fish taken out of the se@@ a every single year ."
"If we go through the pol@@ lo@@ ck , the next choice is probably going to be ti@@ lap@@ ia ."
T@@ il@@ ap@@ ia is one of those fish no@@ body ever heard of 20 years ago .
"It &apos;s actually a very e@@ ffi@@ cient conver@@ ter of plant prot@@ e@@ in into anima@@ l prot@@ e@@ in , and it &apos;s been a go@@ d@@ s@@ end to the third world ."
"It &apos;s actually a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously su@@ stai@@ na@@ ble solu@@ tion , it goes from an eg@@ g to an a@@ du@@ l@@ t in n@@ ine months ."
It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called an oi@@ ly fish pro@@ fi@@ le .
It doesn &apos;t have the E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s that we all think are going to make us live fore@@ ver .
So what do we do ?
"I mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the c@@ lu@@ pe@@ i@@ ds ?"
The fish that re@@ present a huge part of that 20 to 30 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons .
C@@ ould we e@@ at them direc@@ tly instead of fe@@ e@@ ding them to s@@ al@@ mon ?
"They are tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously fue@@ l e@@ ffi@@ cient to bring to market , a f@@ rac@@ tion of the fue@@ l cost of say , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , and at the very top of the car@@ bon e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ en@@ cy scale ."
"They also are ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 ri@@ ch , a great source for E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ."
So that is a pot@@ ential .
"And if we were to go down that rou@@ te what I would say is , instead of pa@@ ying a few bu@@ cks a p@@ ound — or a few bu@@ cks a ton , really — and making it into a@@ qu@@ a@@ fe@@ ed , could we hal@@ ve the cat@@ ch and d@@ ou@@ ble the pri@@ ce for the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men and make that our way of tre@@ ating these particular fish ?"
"O@@ ther possi@@ bility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bi@@ val@@ ves , particu@@ larly mu@@ s@@ sel@@ s ."
"Now , mu@@ s@@ sel@@ s are very high in E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A , they &apos;re simi@@ lar to can@@ ned tun@@ a ."
They &apos;re also extre@@ m@@ ely fue@@ l e@@ ffi@@ cient .
T@@ o bring a p@@ ound of mu@@ s@@ sel@@ s to market is about a thi@@ r@@ ti@@ et@@ h of the car@@ bon as requi@@ red to bring be@@ e@@ f to market .
"They requi@@ re no fo@@ ra@@ ge fish , they actually get their ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s by fil@@ ter@@ ing the water of mic@@ ro@@ al@@ g@@ ae ."
"In fact , that &apos;s where ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish ."
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ al@@ g@@ ae make the ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , they &apos;re only bio@@ con@@ cent@@ rated in fish ."
M@@ us@@ sel@@ s and other bi@@ val@@ ves do tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous am@@ ou@@ nt@@ s of water fil@@ tra@@ tion .
A single mu@@ s@@ se@@ l can fil@@ ter do@@ z@@ ens of g@@ al@@ l@@ ons every single day .
And this is incredi@@ bly important when we look at the world .
"@@ Ri@@ ght now , nit@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation , over@@ use of ph@@ os@@ pha@@ t@@ es in our wat@@ er@@ ways are cau@@ sing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous al@@ g@@ al blo@@ oms ."
"O@@ ver 4@@ 00 new de@@ ad z@@ ones have been created in the last 20 years , tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sources of mar@@ ine life death ."
We also could look at not a fish at all .
We could look at a ve@@ ge@@ table .
"We could look at se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , the k@@ el@@ ps , all these different vari@@ eti@@ es of things that can be high in ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , can be high in prot@@ e@@ ins , tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously good things ."
They fil@@ ter the water just like mu@@ s@@ sel@@ s do .
"And we@@ ir@@ dly enough , it turns out that you can actually fe@@ ed this to c@@ ow@@ s ."
"Now , I &apos;m not a big f@@ an of cat@@ tle ."
"But if you wanted to keep growing cat@@ tle in a time and place where water re@@ sources are limit@@ ed , you &apos;re growing se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — maj@@ or consi@@ der@@ ation ."
And the last fish is a question mar@@ k .
We have the ability to create a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ red fish that cre@@ ates a net g@@ ain of mar@@ ine prot@@ e@@ in for us .
"This cre@@ ature would have to be ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ rian , it would have to be fast growing , it would have to be ad@@ ap@@ table to a changing climate and it would have to have that oi@@ ly fish pro@@ fi@@ le , that E@@ P@@ A , D@@ H@@ A , ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id pro@@ fi@@ le that we &apos;re looking for ."
This exi@@ sts kind of on paper .
I have been repor@@ ting on these sub@@ jects for 15 years .
"E@@ very time I do a new story , somebody tel@@ ls me , &quot; &quot; We can do all that . We can do it . We &apos;ve figu@@ red it all out ."
We can produce a fish that &apos;s a net g@@ ain of mar@@ ine prot@@ e@@ in and has ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s . &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at .
It doesn &apos;t see@@ m to be getting sc@@ al@@ ed up .
It is time to scale this up .
"If we do , 30 million met@@ ri@@ c t@@ ons of se@@ a@@ food , a third of the world cat@@ ch , sta@@ ys in the water ."
So I gue@@ ss what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
We t@@ end to go with our app@@ et@@ it@@ es rather than our min@@ ds .
"But if we went with this , or some con@@ figu@@ ration of it , we might have a little more of this ."
Thank you .
