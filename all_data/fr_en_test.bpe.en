"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ arly a billion people on this planet that activ@@ ely use social net@@ working s@@ ites ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"Wh@@ ile that might be a some@@ what mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really prof@@ ound impl@@ ications that are wor@@ th explor@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a blo@@ g pos@@ t au@@ tho@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ er@@ e@@ k K@@ . M@@ ill@@ er , who was a science and technology journ@@ alis@@ t who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his family and friends wr@@ ite a pos@@ t that went out sh@@ or@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wr@@ ote in starting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m d@@ ead , and this is my last pos@@ t to my blo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ un@@ ish@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends pu@@ bl@@ ish this pre@@ par@@ ed message I wr@@ ote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an active we@@ b@@ site to an arch@@ ive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journ@@ alis@@ t , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s arch@@ ive may have been better wr@@ it@@ ten and more care@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are cre@@ ating an arch@@ ive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous gener@@ ation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few st@@ ats for a moment .
Right now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being u@@ pl@@ o@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minute .
There are 200 million T@@ we@@ ets being pos@@ ted every day .
And the average F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is cre@@ ating 90 pi@@ ec@@ es of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some photos or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all cre@@ ating this incredi@@ bly r@@ ich dig@@ ital arch@@ ive that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ oud in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tr@@ ig@@ u@@ ing oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties for technolo@@ g@@ ists .
"Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journ@@ alis@@ t and not a technolo@@ g@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ e@@ fly is pain@@ t a picture of what the pres@@ ent and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are design@@ ed to let us dec@@ ide what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ingly enough , found me when I ch@@ ec@@ ked into a del@@ i at a rest@@ aur@@ ant in New York on four@@ squ@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ str@@ ow : H@@ ell@@ o .
De@@ ath : A@@ d@@ am ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : De@@ ath can cat@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
De@@ ath : G@@ o to ifi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ n@@ et before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ str@@ ow : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther service right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ ories ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tribu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with photos and vide@@ os and stories that they can pos@@ t after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably famil@@ i@@ ar with De@@ b R@@ o@@ y who , back in Mar@@ ch , dem@@ on@@ str@@ ated how he was able to analy@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ ues to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analy@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ we@@ ets , the photos , the vide@@ os , the blo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such mas@@ sive numbers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our dig@@ ital pers@@ on@@ as to continue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ an@@ ks to the vas@@ t@@ ness of the amount of cont@@ ent we &apos;re cre@@ ating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One service called My N@@ ext T@@ we@@ et analy@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted on@@ to T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some predic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the resul@@ ts can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ n@@ ical cap@@ abil@@ ities impro@@ ve ."
"T@@ a@@ king it a step fur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media la@@ b is working on robots that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those robots were able to inter@@ act based on the unique char@@ acter@@ is@@ tics of a spec@@ ifi@@ c person based on the hundreds of thousands of pi@@ ec@@ es of cont@@ ent that person produ@@ ces in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous s@@ cen@@ e from el@@ ection night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gr@@ am of hi@@ p ho@@ p arti@@ st w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son Co@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to b@@ ea@@ m a repres@@ ent@@ ation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ oms — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ f@@ eli@@ ke way based on all the cont@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally .
"Now in clo@@ sing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ ition of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

So I wan@@ der@@ ed down the h@@ all@@ way to my colle@@ ag@@ ue Chr@@ is H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s off@@ ice .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never off@@ ered it .
There were literally thousands of pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
So we set out to build our case .
This is K@@ ath@@ le@@ en M@@ ax@@ ian .
The test was ne@@ g@@ ative .
S@@ ort of .
"En@@ ds up s@@ pl@@ it dec@@ ision , 2 to 1 ."
We sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question pres@@ ented ever .
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ vous than he was .
The ar@@ gu@@ ment itself was ri@@ v@@ eting .
Chr@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed br@@ illi@@ antly .
J@@ us@@ tice R@@ ob@@ er@@ ts dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ished it from car@@ ving a bas@@ e@@ ball b@@ at from a t@@ ree .
But of course the dec@@ ision goes far be@@ y@@ ond M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ anci@@ al S@@ er@@ v@@ ices Au@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , the answer is y@@ es ."
"Th@@ en , predic@@ tions can be made and tes@@ ted ."
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is literally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
Wh@@ ere are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in det@@ ail was ow@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a value to the company given by the oper@@ ating reven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"These are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me expl@@ ain by giving you this an@@ alo@@ gy .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of about eight of my proj@@ ects , done in collabor@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish arti@@ st S@@ ore@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first obj@@ ect , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was insp@@ i@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar hab@@ it of const@@ antly as@@ king me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a gl@@ ass of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ ettes ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a resp@@ ected figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the situation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fi@@ ed me the most was his use of a land@@ line tel@@ e@@ phone .
He would hold on to the re@@ ce@@ i@@ ver and exp@@ ect me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it re@@ qui@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s design@@ ed for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started m@@ iss@@ ing his comm@@ ands ."
And so I made him a g@@ ol@@ den ty@@ pe@@ wr@@ iter through which he could dis@@ pense his comm@@ ands to ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an em@@ ail .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of pap@@ er , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , type his em@@ ail or comm@@ and and pul@@ l the pap@@ er out ."
This dev@@ ice would autom@@ atic@@ ally s@@ end the int@@ ended person the let@@ ter as an em@@ ail .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of electr@@ on@@ ics that underst@@ ands all of the me@@ chan@@ ical actions and con@@ ver@@ ts it to dig@@ ital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a me@@ chan@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the obj@@ ect had to be very grand and have a sense of r@@ itu@@ alis@@ m , the way my un@@ cle li@@ kes it ."
"The next work is a sou@@ n@@ d-@@ sen@@ si@@ tive inst@@ all@@ ation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a no@@ tion of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ atures ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ atures which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ els on three w@@ all@@ s of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"So when it &apos;s qui@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ atures do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ une to sou@@ nds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to back@@ ground sou@@ nds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( No@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground sou@@ nds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Wh@@ ist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ f@@ eli@@ ke as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psy@@ che , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , pers@@ on@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video inst@@ all@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ iss@@ ing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tr@@ ig@@ u@@ ed with pl@@ aying with the no@@ tion of in@@ visi@@ bil@@ ity .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visi@@ bil@@ ity ?
"So we worked with a company that spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ era sur@@ veill@@ ance , and we asked them to dev@@ el@@ op a piece of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are with us , using a cam@@ era that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the back@@ ground , rend@@ ering them in@@ visible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"On the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ ore@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the proc@@ essed video where the cam@@ era has made him in@@ visible ."
S@@ ore@@ n ent@@ ers the room . P@@ op ! He goes in@@ visible .
And you can see that the cam@@ era is tr@@ ac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we hav@@ en &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ era looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , excep@@ t with one difference : one person was const@@ antly in@@ visible wh@@ er@@ ever they mo@@ ved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The S@@ un Sh@@ ado@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er , like a cu@@ tout of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oil sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this obj@@ ect appe@@ ar@@ ed to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ bus@@ t , and from the side , it almost se@@ em@@ ed very wea@@ k ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ no@@ re it , thinking it was some cr@@ a@@ p l@@ aying around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pass@@ ed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ ky fas@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ed , and it would coll@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of fall@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a pl@@ ant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fas@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predic@@ table and ext@@ rem@@ ely s@@ low mo@@ vement .
And it &apos;s kind of constr@@ ained by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to w@@ and@@ er about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an inst@@ ance — so when people enter the room , it activ@@ ates this obj@@ ect ."
"And it very s@@ low@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it g@@ ains mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an inst@@ inc@@ t to almost go and help , or s@@ ave the subj@@ ect ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pul@@ l itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ n@@ ical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the me@@ chan@@ ics right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the dy@@ nam@@ ics ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would t@@ op@@ ple over , then it would dam@@ age itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ alis@@ m , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ick video where we are doing a test s@@ cen@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much fas@@ ter .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ vous , so he &apos;s going to go cat@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tr@@ ig@@ u@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tiny different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a blo@@ b@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ape of a te@@ d@@ dy b@@ ear , which was h@@ ang@@ ing from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of contr@@ ast something very c@@ old and dis@@ tant and ab@@ str@@ act like the universe into the famil@@ i@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy b@@ ear , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ tim@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy b@@ ear and you would almost per@@ ce@@ ive it to be a ho@@ le in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in progr@@ ess , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big st@@ anding in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ate you by growing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; eight &#93; times its volu@@ me ."
And so this obj@@ ect is const@@ antly exp@@ anding and contr@@ ac@@ ting to create a dy@@ nam@@ ic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a secre@@ t within its se@@ ams or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pain in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ pr@@ ess the emo@@ tions and behavi@@ or@@ al pat@@ tern@@ s in these cre@@ atures that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really w@@ ants to ex@@ ist and what form it w@@ ants to take and what way it w@@ ants to move ."
Thank you .

"O@@ K , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love ."
"And spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ally , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love ."
"M@@ o@@ st of us will probably f@@ all in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the Engl@@ ish language , this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , fall@@ ing , is really the main way that we talk about that experience ."
And I picture it this way because fall@@ ing is not j@@ um@@ ping .
"F@@ all@@ ing is ac@@ cid@@ ent@@ al , it &apos;s un@@ contr@@ oll@@ able ."
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our cons@@ ent .
And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relation@@ ship .
"I am a wr@@ iter and I &apos;m also an Engl@@ ish tea@@ cher , which means I think about words for a living ."
"You could say that I get p@@ aid to ar@@ gue that the language we use mat@@ ters , and I would like to ar@@ gue that many of the met@@ ap@@ hors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem ."
"So , in love , we f@@ all ."
We &apos;re struc@@ k .
We are cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed .
We s@@ w@@ o@@ on .
We bur@@ n with pas@@ sion .
"L@@ o@@ ve makes us cr@@ az@@ y , and it makes us s@@ ick ."
"O@@ ur hear@@ ts a@@ che , and then they brea@@ k ."
So our met@@ ap@@ hors equ@@ ate the experience of lo@@ ving someone to ex@@ tre@@ me violence or ill@@ ness .
( Laughter ) They do .
And they position us as the vic@@ ti@@ ms of un@@ for@@ es@@ e@@ en and tot@@ ally un@@ av@@ o@@ id@@ able cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ances .
"My favor@@ ite one of these is &quot; &quot; sm@@ it@@ ten , &quot; &quot; which is the past parti@@ ci@@ ple of the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dic@@ tion@@ ary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defin@@ ed as both &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I ten@@ d to associ@@ ate the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite &quot; &quot; with a very particular cont@@ ext , which is the O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent ."
"In the Bo@@ ok of Ex@@ od@@ us alone , there are 16 re@@ fer@@ ences to sm@@ iting , which is the word that the Bi@@ ble uses for the ven@@ ge@@ ance of an an@@ gr@@ y God ."
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to expl@@ ain a pl@@ ag@@ ue of loc@@ us@@ ts . ( Laughter )
Right ?
"So , how did this happen ?"
How have we come to associ@@ ate love with great pain and suff@@ ering ?
And why do we talk about this o@@ st@@ en@@ si@@ bly good experience as if we are vic@@ ti@@ ms ?
"These are difficult questions , but I have some the@@ ories ."
"And to think this through , I want to foc@@ us on one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or in particular , which is the idea of love as ma@@ d@@ ness ."
"When I first started resear@@ ching rom@@ an@@ tic love , I found these ma@@ d@@ ness met@@ ap@@ hors every@@ where ."
These are just a few exam@@ ples .
"&quot; G@@ ot me looking , got me looking so cr@@ az@@ y in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great phil@@ os@@ op@@ her , B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é K@@ no@@ w@@ les . ( Laughter )"
"I f@@ ell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty tur@@ bul@@ ent relation@@ ship right from the start ."
"And it was long dist@@ ance for the first couple of years , so for me that me@@ ant very high high@@ s and very low lo@@ ws ."
I can remember one moment in particular .
"And it was l@@ ate , it was ne@@ arly mid@@ night , we &apos;d g@@ ot@@ ten into an ar@@ gu@@ ment over din@@ ner , and when we got back to our room , he thre@@ w his things in the b@@ a@@ g and st@@ orm@@ ed out ."
"Wh@@ ile I can no longer remember what that ar@@ gu@@ ment was about , I very c@@ lear@@ ly remember how I felt wat@@ ching him leave ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , it was my first time in the develop@@ ing world , and I was tot@@ ally alone ."
"I had another week until my f@@ light home , and I knew the name of the to@@ wn that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around ."
"I had no gu@@ ide@@ book and very little money , and I spo@@ ke no S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"S@@ ome@@ one more ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just fro@@ ze ."
I just s@@ at there .
And then I bur@@ st into t@@ ear@@ s .
"But des@@ p@@ ite my pan@@ ic , some small vo@@ ice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow . That was dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c ."
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel mis@@ er@@ able in love .
"And it sou@@ nds so str@@ ange to me now , but at 2@@ 2 , I long@@ ed to have dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c experi@@ ences , and in that moment , I was ir@@ r@@ ational and fu@@ ri@@ ous and dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated , and we@@ ir@@ d@@ ly enough , I thought that this some@@ how le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed the fe@@ el@@ ings I had for the guy who had just left me ."
"I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit cr@@ az@@ y , because I thought that that was how lo@@ ved worked ."
"This really should not be sur@@ pris@@ ing , consi@@ der@@ ing that ac@@ cor@@ ding to W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , there are eight fil@@ ms , 14 son@@ gs , two al@@ b@@ um@@ s and one nov@@ el with the ti@@ tle &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y Lo@@ ve . &quot; &quot; A@@ bout half an h@@ our later , he came back to our room ."
"This must be a real rom@@ ance . &quot; &quot; I exp@@ ected my first love to feel like ma@@ d@@ ness , and of course , it met that exp@@ ect@@ ation very well ."
But lo@@ ving someone like that — as if my entire w@@ ell@@ -@@ being depend@@ ed on him lo@@ ving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I su@@ sp@@ ect this experience of love is not that un@@ usu@@ al .
Mo@@ st of us do feel a bit ma@@ d in the early st@@ ages of rom@@ an@@ tic love .
"In fact , there is research to con@@ fir@@ m that this is some@@ what normal , because , neuro@@ chem@@ ically spea@@ king , rom@@ an@@ tic love and mental ill@@ ness are not that eas@@ ily dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ished ."
This is true .
This study from 199@@ 9 used bloo@@ d tes@@ ts to con@@ fir@@ m that the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in lev@@ els of the ne@@ w@@ ly in love very clo@@ sel@@ y res@@ embl@@ ed the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in lev@@ els of people who had been diagno@@ s@@ ed with ob@@ s@@ essi@@ ve@@ -@@ comp@@ ul@@ sive dis@@ order .
So there is some ev@@ id@@ ence that love is associ@@ ated with changes to our mo@@ o@@ ds and our behavi@@ ors .
And there are other stu@@ dies to con@@ fir@@ m that most relation@@ shi@@ ps beg@@ in this way .
"R@@ es@@ ear@@ chers believe that the low lev@@ els of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in is cor@@ rel@@ ated with ob@@ s@@ es@@ sive thinking about the obj@@ ect of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up cam@@ p in your brain ."
And most of us feel this way when we first f@@ all in love .
"But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usu@@ ally from a few months to a couple of years ."
"When I got back from my tri@@ p to Sou@@ th America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , ch@@ ec@@ king my em@@ ail , des@@ per@@ ate to hear from the guy I lo@@ ved ."
"I decided that if my friends could not understand my gri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , then I did not need their fri@@ end@@ ship ."
So I st@@ op@@ ped h@@ ang@@ ing out with most of them .
And it was probably the most un@@ happy year of my life .
"But I think I felt like it was my job to be mis@@ er@@ able , because if I could be mis@@ er@@ able , then I would pro@@ ve how much I lo@@ ved him ."
"And if I could pro@@ ve it , then we would have to end up together even@@ tually ."
O@@ ur experi@@ ences of love are both biolo@@ gical and cul@@ tural .
"O@@ ur biolo@@ gy tel@@ ls us that love is good by activ@@ ating these re@@ ward cir@@ cu@@ its in our brain , and it tel@@ ls us that love is pain@@ ful when , after a fi@@ ght or a bre@@ ak@@ up , that neuro@@ chem@@ ical re@@ ward is with@@ dra@@ wn ."
"And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neuro@@ chem@@ ically spea@@ king , going through a bre@@ ak@@ up is a lot like going through co@@ c@@ aine with@@ dra@@ w@@ al , which I find reas@@ sur@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to sh@@ ape and re@@ in@@ force these ideas about love .
"In this case , we &apos;re talking about met@@ ap@@ hors about pain and ad@@ dic@@ tion and ma@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s kind of an interesting fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ p .
"L@@ o@@ ve is powerful and at times pain@@ ful , and we ex@@ pr@@ ess this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories pri@@ me us to exp@@ ect love to be powerful and pain@@ ful ."
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that val@@ ues li@@ fel@@ ong mon@@ o@@ gam@@ y .
That sou@@ nds terri@@ ble .
"( Laughter ) T@@ o re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this , we need to either change our culture or change our exp@@ ect@@ ations ."
"So , imagine if we were all less pas@@ sive in love ."
"If we were more ass@@ er@@ tive , more op@@ en-@@ min@@ ded , more gener@@ ous and instead of fall@@ ing in love , we st@@ ep@@ ped into love ."
"I know that this is as@@ king a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to sugg@@ est this ."
"They ar@@ gue that met@@ ap@@ hors really do sh@@ ape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a gu@@ ide for future actions , like self-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies ."
Joh@@ n@@ son and L@@ ak@@ off sugg@@ est a new met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for love : love as a collabor@@ ative work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
"L@@ in@@ gu@@ ists talk about met@@ ap@@ hors as having ent@@ ail@@ ments , which is essenti@@ ally a way of consi@@ der@@ ing all the impl@@ ications of , or ideas cont@@ ained within , a given met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"So if love is a collabor@@ ative work of art , then love is an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience ."
"L@@ o@@ ve is un@@ predic@@ table , love is cre@@ ative , love re@@ qui@@ res communication and dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , it is fr@@ ustr@@ ating and emo@@ tion@@ ally demand@@ ing ."
And love invol@@ ves both jo@@ y and pain .
"@@ U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , each experience of love is different ."
"When I was youn@@ ger , it never oc@@ cur@@ red to me that I was al@@ lowed to dem@@ and more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accep@@ t whatever love off@@ ered ."
"When 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old Ju@@ li@@ et first me@@ ets — or , when 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old Ju@@ li@@ et cannot be with R@@ ome@@ o , wh@@ om she has met four days ago , she does not feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted or ang@@ st@@ y ."
Wh@@ ere is she ?
She w@@ ants to die .
Right ?
"And just as a re@@ f@@ res@@ her , at this point in the play , act three of five , R@@ ome@@ o is not d@@ ead ."
"He &apos;s ali@@ ve , he &apos;s heal@@ thy , he &apos;s just been ban@@ ished from the city ."
"I understand that 1@@ 6@@ th@@ -@@ century V@@ er@@ on@@ a is un@@ like cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary Nor@@ th America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Ju@@ li@@ et &apos;s suff@@ ering made sense to me ."
"@@ Re@@ fr@@ am@@ ing love as something I get to create with someone I ad@@ mi@@ re , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or cons@@ ent , is em@@ power@@ ing ."
It &apos;s still hard .
"L@@ o@@ ve still fe@@ els tot@@ ally ma@@ dd@@ en@@ ing and cr@@ us@@ h@@ ing some days , and when I feel really fr@@ ustr@@ ated , I have to re@@ mind myself : my job in this relation@@ ship is to talk to my part@@ ner about what I want to make together ."
"This isn &apos;t easy , either ."
"But it &apos;s just so much better than the al@@ tern@@ ative , which is that thing that fe@@ els like ma@@ d@@ ness ."
This version of love is not about w@@ inning or lo@@ sing someone &apos;s aff@@ ection .
"In@@ st@@ ead , it re@@ qui@@ res that you tr@@ ust your part@@ ner and talk about things when tru@@ st@@ ing fe@@ els difficult , which sou@@ nds so simple , but is actually a kind of re@@ volu@@ tion@@ ary , radic@@ al act ."
"This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re g@@ aining or lo@@ sing in your relation@@ ship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to off@@ er ."
"This version of love allo@@ ws us to say things like , &quot; H@@ ey , we &apos;re not very good collabor@@ at@@ ors . M@@ ay@@ be this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;"
"O@@ r , &quot; &quot; That relation@@ ship was sh@@ or@@ ter than I had pl@@ ann@@ ed , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collabor@@ ative work of art is that it will not pain@@ t or dra@@ w or s@@ cul@@ pt itself ."
This version of love allo@@ ws us to dec@@ ide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really gl@@ ad to be here .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
O@@ r here .
"On one side , all life on Earth needs energy ."
"And this seems like a t@@ all order , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent tom@@ a@@ to ."
"This is what life needs to sur@@ vi@@ ve , all life ."
So that le@@ aves a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
You want to have an atmosp@@ here for water to be li@@ qui@@ d .
"It &apos;s a G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ k@@ s-@@ type problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it ."
"N@@ um@@ ber one : if M@@ ama B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ w@@ l is too c@@ old when G@@ ol@@ d@@ il@@ oc@@ ks wal@@ ks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too c@@ old ?"
O@@ r could it have been just right at some other time ?
And the same is true with plan@@ ets .
They v@@ ary . They evol@@ ve .
"And of course , dist@@ ance of a planet from the su@@ n det@@ er@@ min@@ es its tem@@ per@@ ature ."
Earth has one ; V@@ en@@ us and Mars do not .
I like to think of it instead as a sal@@ ad b@@ ar s@@ nee@@ ze gu@@ ard for plan@@ ets .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
We have simil@@ ar mea@@ su@@ rem@@ ents from V@@ en@@ us and Earth .
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habit@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
I &apos;m really gl@@ ad we &apos;re here .
Th@@ an@@ ks .
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ ink about everything it has brought us .
"Th@@ ink about all the services we use , all the connec@@ tiv@@ ity , all the ent@@ ert@@ ain@@ ment , all the business , all the commer@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history books hundreds of years from now . This time our gener@@ ation will be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed as the gener@@ ation that got on@@ line , the gener@@ ation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But y@@ es , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very ser@@ ious problems , problems with sec@@ ur@@ ity and problems with priv@@ acy ."
I &apos;ve spent my care@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Br@@ ain .
This is a flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k inf@@ ected by Br@@ ain@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for P@@ C compu@@ ters .
And we actually know where Br@@ ain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot sec@@ tor of an inf@@ ected flo@@ p@@ p@@ y , and if we take a clo@@ ser look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 19@@ 8@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad are first nam@@ es , P@@ ak@@ ist@@ an@@ i first nam@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ d@@ res@@ s in P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 19@@ 8@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C virus problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ ak@@ istan myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in P@@ ak@@ istan ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ ho@@ re , which is around 3@@ 00 kilom@@ et@@ ers sou@@ th from A@@ b@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was cau@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a ty@@ p@@ ical stre@@ et view .
"And here &apos;s the stre@@ et or ro@@ ad lea@@ ding to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am bloc@@ k at Al@@ l@@ ama I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who op@@ en@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here st@@ anding up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ itting down is his bro@@ ther Am@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wr@@ ote the first P@@ C virus .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting discus@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of s@@ atis@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad had had their compu@@ ters inf@@ ected do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ rel@@ ated other vir@@ uses over these years .
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
"Now , the vir@@ uses that we used to see in the 19@@ 8@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ables me to run ag@@ e-@@ old program@@ s on a moder@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a l@@ ist of old vir@@ uses .
So let me just run some vir@@ uses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de virus first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de s@@ cro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get inf@@ ected by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected because it actually shows up .
"H@@ ere &apos;s another one . This is the virus called C@@ r@@ ash , invent@@ ed in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ ker virus does ?"
"@@ Yes , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get inf@@ ected ."
"So it used to be fai@@ r@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected by a virus , when the vir@@ uses were wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being wr@@ it@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vir@@ uses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the back@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack virus inf@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just bloc@@ ked vir@@ uses in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ ai@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just conn@@ ect back to our la@@ b systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vir@@ uses , how many new exam@@ ples of mal@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s the l@@ at@@ est virus we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just s@@ cro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find t@@ ens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed crimin@@ al g@@ ang@@ s wr@@ iting these vir@@ uses because they make money with their vir@@ uses ."
It &apos;s g@@ ang@@ s like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ st@@ a@@ B@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ site oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ co@@ w where these guys are bu@@ ying inf@@ ected compu@@ ters .
"So if you are a virus wr@@ iter and you &apos;re capable of inf@@ ec@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws compu@@ ters , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those inf@@ ected compu@@ ters — somebody else &apos;s compu@@ ters — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those compu@@ ters .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those inf@@ ected compu@@ ters ?
"Well there &apos;s multi@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers ."
"@@ K@@ ey@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers sil@@ ently s@@ it on your computer , hi@@ dd@@ en from view , and they re@@ cord everything you type ."
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google se@@ ar@@ ches .
E@@ very single Google se@@ ar@@ ch you type is sav@@ ed and sent to the crimin@@ als .
E@@ very single em@@ ail you wr@@ ite is sav@@ ed and sent to the crimin@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pass@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ es@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es in any on@@ line sto@@ re .
"Because when you do pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es in on@@ line st@@ or@@ es , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ d@@ res@@ s , your cre@@ dit car@@ d number and the cre@@ dit car@@ d sec@@ ur@@ ity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ dit car@@ d number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pir@@ ation d@@ ate , that &apos;s the sec@@ ur@@ ity code , and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the car@@ d ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you g@@ ain access to other people &apos;s cre@@ dit car@@ d information , you can just go on@@ line and buy whatever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mark@@ et@@ place and business ec@@ o@@ system built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are capable of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ z@@ ing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and se@@ ar@@ ch for wanted pers@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in , origin@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his part@@ ner in cri@@ me , also lis@@ ted on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ages , M@@ r@@ . Sh@@ ail@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ ma@@ r J@@ ain , a U.S. ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en ."
"These guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted millions ."
They are both right now on the run .
No@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.S. off@@ ici@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , fro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t bel@@ ong@@ ing to M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is signific@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line crimin@@ als can actually aff@@ or@@ d to inv@@ est into their att@@ ac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line crimin@@ als are hi@@ r@@ ing program@@ m@@ ers , hi@@ r@@ ing tes@@ ting people , tes@@ ting their code , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es ."
And they can aff@@ or@@ d to watch how we work — like how sec@@ ur@@ ity people work — and try to work their way around any sec@@ ur@@ ity pre@@ cau@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ antage .
"I mean , the Internet is intern@@ ational ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ l@@ ari@@ fi@@ ed N@@ et@@ works , which ill@@ ustr@@ ates how one single mal@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be origin@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ site is tried to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally police oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ k@@ ets to all the on@@ line crimin@@ als of the world .
"Now , crimin@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t capable of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line crimin@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one explo@@ it fi@@ le .
"H@@ ere , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x d@@ um@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which cont@@ ains an explo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and r@@ uns code ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image hea@@ der , and there the actu@@ al code of the att@@ ack star@@ ts ."
"And that code has been en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ y@@ pt it ."
It has been en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R func@@ tion 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the code is now dec@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the origin@@ al ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ d@@ res@@ s : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that program .
And that &apos;s a back@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more inter@@ est@@ ingly , if we continue dec@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ st@@ er@@ ious str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That code is there under@@ ne@@ ath the en@@ cr@@ y@@ ption as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goo@@ gl@@ ed for it .
I got z@@ er@@ o h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spo@@ ke with the guys at the la@@ b .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city code for the city of St@@ . P@@ et@@ ers@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ates and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for cont@@ ac@@ ts in St@@ . P@@ et@@ ers@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we even@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ site ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who r@@ uns his own we@@ b@@ site , and he r@@ uns a blo@@ g under the popul@@ ar Li@@ ve J@@ our@@ n@@ al ."
"And on this blo@@ g , he blo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . P@@ et@@ ers@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very ni@@ ce car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a Mer@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 6@@ 00 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er eng@@ ine with more than 4@@ 00 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a ni@@ ce car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-@@ old ki@@ d in St@@ . P@@ et@@ ers@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ gg@@ ed about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ cident .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn St@@ . P@@ et@@ ers@@ bur@@ g , he actually cr@@ ash@@ ed his car into another car ."
And he put blo@@ gg@@ ed images about the car ac@@ cident — that &apos;s his Mer@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ad@@ a S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he cr@@ ash@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the li@@ cen@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the s@@ cen@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the Mer@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line crimin@@ als are cau@@ ght ?"
Well in most cas@@ es it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast major@@ ity of the on@@ line cri@@ me cas@@ es , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the att@@ ac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line crimin@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough ev@@ id@@ ence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I w@@ ish it would be eas@@ ier ; un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ n@@ et .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ n@@ et did is that it inf@@ ected these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 4@@ 00 P@@ L@@ C , program@@ m@@ able lo@@ gi@@ c &#91; contr@@ oll@@ er &#93; ."
And this is what r@@ uns our infrastruc@@ ture .
This is what r@@ uns everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard , which are program@@ m@@ ed , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the el@@ ev@@ at@@ ors in this building most lik@@ ely are contr@@ oll@@ ed by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ n@@ et inf@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive re@@ volution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical infrastruc@@ ture ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power pl@@ ant , any chem@@ ical pl@@ ant , any food proc@@ ess@@ ing pl@@ ant , you look around — everything is being run by compu@@ ters ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is being run by compu@@ ters .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these compu@@ ters working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on bas@@ ic things like electr@@ ic@@ ity , obvi@@ ously , on compu@@ ters working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of continu@@ ing to work even if compu@@ ters fai@@ l .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stuff — thinking about continu@@ ity , thinking about back@@ u@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ ink about all the services we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ ink about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life def@@ ending the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a risk of lo@@ sing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , intern@@ ational la@@ w en@@ forc@@ ement work to find on@@ line crimin@@ al g@@ ang@@ s — these organiz@@ ed g@@ ang@@ s that are making millions out of their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vir@@ uses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ all@@ s .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these att@@ ac@@ ks , and even more import@@ antly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but hav@@ en &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ ills , but without the oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties and give them the oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties to use their sk@@ ills for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing with really re@@ mark@@ able spe@@ ed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ec@@ tions sugg@@ est that the Chin@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s proj@@ ected that the Chin@@ ese economy will be tw@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the In@@ di@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should b@@ ear in mind here that these proj@@ ec@@ tions were dra@@ wn up before the W@@ es@@ tern financi@@ al cr@@ is@@ is .
"A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the l@@ at@@ est proj@@ ection by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ bas for when China will have a larg@@ er economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ected 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The pos@@ t-@@ cr@@ is@@ is proj@@ ection is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a dec@@ ade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundament@@ al resp@@ ects .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , it &apos;s a huge develop@@ ing country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a dec@@ ade , it will have the larg@@ est economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the moder@@ n era has the larg@@ est economy in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , rather than a developed country ."
"S@@ ec@@ ond@@ ly , for the first time in the moder@@ n era , the dom@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ational ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad as@@ sum@@ ption in the W@@ est that as countries mo@@ derni@@ ze , they also w@@ es@@ ter@@ ni@@ ze ."
This is an il@@ lu@@ sion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ sum@@ ption that moder@@ n@@ ity is a produc@@ t simply of com@@ peti@@ tion , mark@@ ets and technology ."
It is not . It is also sh@@ ap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"Ch@@ in@@ a is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will rem@@ ain in very fundament@@ al resp@@ ects very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the conv@@ enti@@ onal appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ es@@ tern terms , using W@@ es@@ tern ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three building bloc@@ ks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state for the last hundre@@ d years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the vic@@ t@@ ory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ n@@ as@@ ty in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the w@@ arr@@ ing@@ -@@ state per@@ i@@ od — the bir@@ th of moder@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of moder@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ n@@ as@@ ty , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it occu@@ pi@@ es most of what we now know as E@@ as@@ tern China , which is where the v@@ ast major@@ ity of Chin@@ ese li@@ ved then and live now ."
"Now what is extraordin@@ ary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Chin@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Chin@@ ese , comes not from the last hundre@@ d years , not from the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state per@@ i@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the per@@ i@@ od , if you like , of the civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ oms like anc@@ es@@ tr@@ al wor@@ ship , of a very dist@@ inc@@ tive no@@ tion of the state , li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise , a very dist@@ inc@@ tive no@@ tion of the family , social relation@@ shi@@ ps like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an val@@ ues and so on ."
These are all things that come from the per@@ i@@ od of the civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ es@@ tern st@@ ates and most countries in the world , is sh@@ ap@@ ed by its sense of civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation , its exist@@ ence as a civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than as a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , dem@@ ograp@@ h@@ ically and ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ically , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is ext@@ rem@@ ely di@@ verse and very pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic , and in many ways very dec@@ entr@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of prof@@ ound impl@@ ications ."
I &apos;ll give you two qu@@ ick ones .
"The first is that the most important political value for the Chin@@ ese is un@@ ity , is the main@@ ten@@ ance of Chin@@ ese civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Europe : bre@@ ak@@ down — the fr@@ ag@@ ment@@ ation of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ p@@ ire ."
"It di@@ vi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ main@@ ed di@@ vi@@ ded ever since ."
"Ch@@ in@@ a , over the same time per@@ i@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite direction , very pain@@ fully hol@@ ding this huge civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation , civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pro@@ s@@ ai@@ c , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
D@@ o you remember the h@@ an@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by Br@@ it@@ ain to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Chin@@ ese con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ position was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll l@@ ay a w@@ ager that bar@@ ely any@@ one in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ do@@ w dr@@ ess@@ ing .
"When China gets its hands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and leg@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ ink of G@@ er@@ man uni@@ fication , 199@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ lowed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the n@@ ation@@ -@@ state ment@@ ality .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ ai@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me off@@ er you another building bloc@@ k to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a com@@ for@@ table one .
"The Chin@@ ese have a very , very different concep@@ tion of r@@ ace to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Chin@@ ese , over 90 percent of them think they bel@@ ong to the same r@@ ace , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most popul@@ ous countries ."
"In@@ dia , the United States , In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il — all of them are multi@@ rac@@ ial ."
The Chin@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multi@@ rac@@ ial really at the mar@@ g@@ ins .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , essenti@@ ally is , again , back to the civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , occu@@ p@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ ption , as@@ simil@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this no@@ tion of the H@@ an emer@@ g@@ ed — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a growing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tural identi@@ ty ."
"Now the great adv@@ antage of this hist@@ or@@ ical experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an identi@@ ty has been the c@@ ement which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great dis@@ adv@@ antage of it is that the H@@ an have a very wea@@ k concep@@ tion of cul@@ tural difference .
"They really believe in their own super@@ i@@ or@@ ity , and they are dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ titu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ u@@ rs and to the T@@ i@@ bet@@ ans ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building bloc@@ k , the Chin@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly se@@ em to think — in these days at least — that the auth@@ or@@ ity and le@@ gi@@ tim@@ acy of the state is a func@@ tion of demo@@ cr@@ acy .
The problem with this pro@@ position is that the Chin@@ ese state en@@ jo@@ ys more le@@ gi@@ tim@@ acy and more auth@@ or@@ ity am@@ ong@@ st the Chin@@ ese than is true with any W@@ es@@ tern state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reas@@ ons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with demo@@ cr@@ acy , because in our terms the Chin@@ ese certain@@ ly don &apos;t have a demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very spec@@ ial — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very spec@@ ial signific@@ ance as the repres@@ ent@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Chin@@ ese civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation , of the civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spir@@ itu@@ al ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in Europe and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is continu@@ ously chall@@ eng@@ ed — I mean in the Euro@@ pe@@ an tradi@@ tion , hist@@ or@@ ically against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other sec@@ tors of the ar@@ is@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , against mer@@ ch@@ ants and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Chin@@ ese state has not been chall@@ eng@@ ed ."
It &apos;s had no ser@@ ious ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been construc@@ ted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ es@@ tern history .
"The resul@@ t , by the way , is that the Chin@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as we ten@@ d to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a str@@ anger , certain@@ ly an org@@ an wh@@ ose po@@ w@@ ers need to be lim@@ ited or defin@@ ed and constr@@ ained , the Chin@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Chin@@ ese view the state as an in@@ tim@@ ate — not just as an in@@ tim@@ ate actually , as a mem@@ ber of the family — not just in fact as a mem@@ ber of the family , but as the head of the family , the pa@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Chin@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ou@@ rs ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would sugg@@ est to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Chin@@ ese cont@@ ext , is a new kind of par@@ adi@@ g@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith , already wr@@ iting in the l@@ ate 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chin@@ ese market is larg@@ er and more developed and more s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the M@@ a@@ o per@@ i@@ od , that has re@@ main@@ ed more or less the case ever since ."
But this is combin@@ ed with an ext@@ rem@@ ely str@@ ong and u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s lea@@ ding fir@@ ms — many of them are still public@@ ly ow@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , ho@@ w@@ ever large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , de@@ pen@@ d in many ways on state pa@@ tr@@ on@@ age ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its auth@@ or@@ ity flo@@ ws into lots of other areas — as we are famil@@ i@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child poli@@ cy ."
"M@@ ore@@ over , this is a very old state tradi@@ tion , a very old tradi@@ tion of stat@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an ill@@ ustr@@ ation of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the Gr@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was construc@@ ted in the first inst@@ ance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally complet@@ ed in the s@@ ev@@ ent@@ h century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 14 miles , lin@@ king B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and Sh@@ an@@ gh@@ ai ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of extraordin@@ ary state infrastruc@@ tural proj@@ ects in China , which I sup@@ pose hel@@ ps us to expl@@ ain what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ org@@ es D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state comp@@ et@@ ence within China ."
"So there we have three building bloc@@ ks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , the no@@ tion of r@@ ace and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still ins@@ ist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on W@@ es@@ tern experience , looking at it through W@@ es@@ tern eyes , using W@@ es@@ tern concep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ingly se@@ em to get China wrong — our predic@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ correc@@ t — this is the reason .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ titu@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little W@@ es@@ tern@@ er ment@@ ality ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ e@@ fore we have the univers@@ al mea@@ sure ."
"And secon@@ d@@ ly , it &apos;s ign@@ or@@ ant ."
We re@@ fu@@ se to really ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the issue of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pass@@ age in a book by P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en , the American hist@@ ori@@ an ."
And P@@ au@@ l Co@@ h@@ en ar@@ gues that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most co@@ s@@ mo@@ po@@ lit@@ an of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ chi@@ al , because for 200 years , the W@@ est has been so dom@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if nec@@ ess@@ ary by force , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far wea@@ ker position , vis@@ -@@ a-@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by forc@@ ed to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pres@@ ence in those soci@@ e@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , they are , as a resul@@ t , more co@@ s@@ mo@@ po@@ lit@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , K@@ ore@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the larg@@ est economic re@@ gion in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very g@@ er@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d , to the pres@@ ent ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"What is happening is that , very rapid@@ ly in hist@@ or@@ ical terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sh@@ ap@@ ed , not by the old developed countries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 u@@ sur@@ ping very rapid@@ ly the position of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two conse@@ qu@@ ences of this .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the W@@ est is rapid@@ ly lo@@ sing its influ@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c ill@@ ustr@@ ation of this actually a year ago — C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en , clim@@ ate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Europe was not at the final ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating table .
Wh@@ en did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second impl@@ ication is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly , as a conse@@ qu@@ ence , become increas@@ ingly un@@ famil@@ i@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sh@@ ap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and hist@@ ories that we are not really famil@@ i@@ ar with , or convers@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d — take Europe ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Euro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ign@@ or@@ ant , are un@@ aw@@ are about the way the world is changing ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an Engl@@ ish friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is s@@ le@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increas@@ ingly out of tou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of lo@@ ss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Europe once , of course , once comm@@ and@@ ed the future in its confi@@ d@@ ence ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to t@@ as@@ te the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ."
This is a rai@@ l@@ way st@@ ation the li@@ kes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a rai@@ l@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; rai@@ l@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed tr@@ ains .
China already has a bigg@@ er net@@ work than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out sh@@ or@@ tly in a sub@@ ur@@ b of B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing ."
"H@@ ere you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the up@@ per dec@@ k car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It trav@@ els on rai@@ ls down a sub@@ urb@@ an ro@@ ad , and the cars trav@@ el under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ e@@ ds of up to about 100 miles an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very spec@@ ifi@@ c problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ titu@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very rapid@@ ly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gue , abo@@ ve all , a bi@@ g@@ -@@ picture positive for this world ."
"For 200 years , the world was essenti@@ ally govern@@ ed by a fr@@ ag@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Europe and Nor@@ th America repres@@ ented .
"The arriv@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ don@@ es@@ ia and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and so on , repres@@ ent the most important single act of demo@@ crati@@ z@@ ation in the last 200 years ."
"C@@ iv@@ il@@ iz@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not lis@@ ten@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of repres@@ ent@@ ation in this world ."
"As human@@ ists , we must w@@ el@@ come , su@@ re@@ ly , this transform@@ ation , and we will have to learn about these civ@@ il@@ iz@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one s@@ ail@@ ed in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 1@@ 5@@ th century on his great voy@@ ages around the Sou@@ th China S@@ e@@ a , the E@@ ast China S@@ e@@ a and across the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Chr@@ ist@@ op@@ her C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us cro@@ ss@@ ed the A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look care@@ fully at this sil@@ k s@@ cro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re pl@@ aying g@@ ol@@ f .
"Ch@@ ris@@ t , the Chin@@ ese even invent@@ ed g@@ ol@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .

I &apos;m here today to start a re@@ volution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you brea@@ k into s@@ ong , or you pic@@ k a favor@@ ite colo@@ r , I want to def@@ ine what I mean by re@@ volution ."
"B@@ y re@@ volution , I mean a dr@@ as@@ tic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , St@@ eve , why do we need a re@@ volution ?"
We need a re@@ volution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really s@@ ad because I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us not living up to our potenti@@ al ."
I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bot@@ tom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bot@@ tom ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ conom@@ ist ."
"We &apos;re the s@@ ad@@ d@@ est place on Earth , rel@@ ative to G@@ D@@ P per capit@@ a — the s@@ ad@@ d@@ est place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Wh@@ ere do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another re@@ port by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science . L@@ ast ."
B@@ us@@ iness : The low@@ est per@@ cep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that entrepren@@ eurs provi@@ de bene@@ f@@ its to society .
"Wh@@ y as a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
The low@@ est per@@ cent@@ age of entrepren@@ eurs starting bus@@ in@@ esses .
And this is des@@ p@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the eng@@ ine of econom@@ ies .
We h@@ ire the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our eng@@ ine &apos;s bro@@ ken , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Europe G@@ D@@ P per capit@@ a .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no sur@@ prise , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ gar@@ i@@ ans are not opti@@ mis@@ tic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st bus@@ in@@ esses ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story ta@@ le ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ spir@@ acy I have got against B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is bro@@ ken ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ ken ."
"We need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ as@@ tic to some of you — because we are h@@ an@@ dic@@ app@@ ing ourselves .
We &apos;re hol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , adul@@ ts play ."
We don &apos;t value play .
"In fact , we dev@@ al@@ ue play ."
And we dev@@ al@@ ue it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
So@@ cial : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f commun@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individual and squ@@ ash@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently , cre@@ ativ@@ ity , individual self-@@ ex@@ pression and innovation ."
"And instead , what do we value ?"
"Because it &apos;s sh@@ own the way we appl@@ y , gener@@ ate and use knowledge is aff@@ ected by our social and institu@@ tional cont@@ ext , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?"
T@@ o be ser@@ ious .
"T@@ o be really , really ser@@ ious ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e ser@@ ious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the par@@ k for l@@ etting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ e@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d they play in the dir@@ t , the k@@ al , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ k@@ v@@ i , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ ado@@ s that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is ser@@ ious and we need to train them for the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a ser@@ ious mem@@ e run@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e run@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a ser@@ ious gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a bab@@ y . I@@ sk@@ am bab@@ y . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the bab@@ y . W@@ oo@@ ho@@ o !"
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to fur@@ ther my care@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ ff@@ e@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ k@@ o to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been inf@@ ected by the ser@@ ious mem@@ e for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"She pas@@ ses that virus on to bab@@ y , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ w@@ ood tre@@ es — for that ser@@ ious mem@@ e to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ ues r@@ ote learning , mem@@ or@@ iz@@ ation and stand@@ ar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and dev@@ al@@ ues self-@@ ex@@ pression , self-@@ explor@@ ation , ques@@ tion@@ ing , cre@@ ativ@@ ity and play ."
It &apos;s a cr@@ a@@ p system .
Tr@@ ue story : I went looking for a school for my ki@@ d .
We went to this pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study mat@@ h 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and rec@@ ess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the s@@ che@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so ser@@ ious because education is ser@@ ious that we &apos;re cre@@ ating min@@ d@@ less , robo@@ tic wor@@ kers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ dr@@ ill@@ ed ho@@ les ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ d@@ us@@ tri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution ."
"We need adap@@ t@@ ability , the ability to learn how to be cre@@ ative and innov@@ ative ."
We don &apos;t need me@@ chan@@ iz@@ ed wor@@ kers .
"But no , now our mem@@ e goes into work where we don &apos;t value play ."
"We create robo@@ tic wor@@ kers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to l@@ ever and just thro@@ w away ."
What are qu@@ ali@@ ties of a B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ian work ?
Au@@ to@@ crati@@ c — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the bo@@ ss and I know better than you .
"@@ Un@@ tru@@ st@@ ing — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a crimin@@ al , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all cam@@ er@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ tr@@ oll@@ ing — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ lion little proc@@ esses for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t step out of the box ."
"So they &apos;re res@@ tr@@ ic@@ tive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bile phone , don &apos;t use your l@@ ap@@ top , don &apos;t se@@ ar@@ ch the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ professi@@ onal and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing because you &apos;re contr@@ oll@@ ed , you &apos;re res@@ tr@@ ic@@ ted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any f@@ un ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , St@@ eve . What a d@@ um@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"J@@ ust play , that &apos;s a stu@@ pi@@ d thing . &quot; &quot; We have the ser@@ ious mem@@ e in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ ech — that play is the cat@@ aly@@ st , it is the re@@ volution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
P@@ l@@ ay : our br@@ ains are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ volution has sel@@ ected , over millions and bil@@ lions of years , for play in animals and in humans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ volution does a really , really good job of des@@ el@@ ec@@ ting trai@@ ts that ar@@ en &apos;t adv@@ ant@@ age@@ ous to us and sel@@ ec@@ ting trai@@ ts for com@@ peti@@ tive adv@@ antage ."
"N@@ ature isn &apos;t stu@@ pi@@ d , and it sel@@ ected for play ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , for example : ants . An@@ ts play ."
M@@ ay@@ be you didn &apos;t know that .
"But when they &apos;re pl@@ aying , they &apos;re learning the social order and dy@@ nam@@ ics of things ."
"R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that r@@ ats that play more have bigg@@ er br@@ ains and they learn t@@ as@@ ks better , sk@@ ills ."
K@@ it@@ t@@ ens play . We all know k@@ it@@ t@@ ens play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ t@@ ens de@@ priv@@ ed of play are un@@ able to inter@@ act soci@@ ally .
"They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
B@@ ear@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more sur@@ vi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been sh@@ own , a cor@@ relation between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the bigg@@ er the br@@ ains there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big br@@ ains , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the bigg@@ est br@@ ains are the bigg@@ est play@@ ers ?
Y@@ ou@@ rs tru@@ ly : humans .
"@@ K@@ ids play , we play — of every n@@ ation@@ ality , of every r@@ ace , of every colo@@ r , of every religion ."
It &apos;s a univers@@ al thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adul@@ ts too ."
Re@@ ally cool ter@@ m : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile trai@@ ts in adul@@ ts .
And who are the bigg@@ est ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
H@@ um@@ ans . We play s@@ ports .
"We do it for f@@ un , or as O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ ans , or as professi@@ on@@ als ."
We play mus@@ ical in@@ str@@ uments .
"We d@@ ance , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re design@@ ed by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re design@@ ed to do that continu@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop pl@@ aying .
It is a huge bene@@ fit .
"J@@ ust like there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its to animals , there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its to humans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sh@@ own to sti@@ mul@@ ate neur@@ al growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , in the area where it contr@@ ols emo@@ tions ."
It &apos;s been sh@@ own to prom@@ ote pre@@ -@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
"As a resul@@ t , what happens ?"
We dev@@ el@@ op more emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity if we play more .
We dev@@ el@@ op better dec@@ is@@ i@@ on-@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s c@@ old , hard science ."
These are the bene@@ f@@ its to play .
"It is a gen@@ e@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spea@@ king or seeing ."
"And if we h@@ an@@ dic@@ a@@ p ourselves with play , we h@@ an@@ dic@@ a@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We hold ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a world without the@@ ater , without the ar@@ ts , without s@@ ong , without d@@ anc@@ ing , without so@@ c@@ c@@ er , without fo@@ ot@@ ball , without l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty bl@@ ea@@ k .
It &apos;s pretty g@@ lu@@ m .
Now imagine your wor@@ k@@ place .
I@@ s it f@@ un ? I@@ s it play@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
I@@ s it f@@ un ? I@@ s it play@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cr@@ a@@ p ? I@@ s it au@@ to@@ crati@@ c , contr@@ oll@@ ing , res@@ tr@@ ic@@ tive and un@@ tru@@ st@@ ing and un@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ing ?"
We have this concept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen pl@@ aying at work .
"&quot; Oh , my colle@@ ag@@ ues see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my bo@@ ss might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is back@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is de@@ pression . It &apos;s de@@ pression .
"In fact , play impro@@ ves our work ."
"J@@ ust like there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its for humans and animals , there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it sti@@ mul@@ ates cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
It increas@@ es our op@@ enn@@ ess to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It provi@@ des a sense of pur@@ pose and mas@@ ter@@ y — two key mo@@ tiv@@ ational things that incre@@ ase produc@@ tiv@@ ity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not ser@@ ious , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous ."
"You know , the professi@@ onal ath@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s ser@@ ious about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having f@@ un , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A doc@@ tor might be ser@@ ious , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medic@@ ine ."
O@@ ur thinking is back@@ wards .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be feeling gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be cel@@ e@@ br@@ ating play .
Qu@@ ick example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy mot@@ to : people , service , prof@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ ier , they &apos;re ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , they have a sense of mas@@ ter@@ y and pur@@ pose ."
"What happens ? They give better service — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers call for service and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make dec@@ is@@ ions and are ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ed , how do the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feeling cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?"
"They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which lea@@ ds to more prof@@ it ."
"P@@ eople , service , prof@@ it ."
"P@@ l@@ ay increas@@ es produc@@ tiv@@ ity , not dec@@ reas@@ es ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Ge@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia ."
"N@@ o way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia , you guys . T@@ w@@ o reas@@ ons ."
"One , play is univers@@ al ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about B@@ ul@@ gar@@ i@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , bes@@ i@@ des the ser@@ ious mem@@ e that we have to k@@ ick out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had z@@ er@@ o happy cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
N@@ ot one cu@@ st@@ om@@ er would re@@ f@@ er us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ g@@ in@@ al prof@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ g@@ in@@ al prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders ."
"Th@@ r@@ ough some bas@@ ic change , change like impro@@ ving trans@@ par@@ ency , change like prom@@ ot@@ ing self-@@ direction and collabor@@ ation , encour@@ ag@@ ing collabor@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , the things like having a resul@@ t@@ s-@@ foc@@ us ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cu@@ st@@ om@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ?
B@@ as@@ ically prom@@ ot@@ ing f@@ un .
"Th@@ r@@ ough prom@@ ot@@ ing f@@ un and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three sh@@ ort years — sou@@ nds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , from z@@ er@@ o to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing us , abo@@ ve average prof@@ its for the indus@@ try and happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we ent@@ ered , one of the ran@@ k@@ ings for best employ@@ er for small business ."
In@@ depend@@ ent analy@@ s@@ is from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous employ@@ e@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia ."
"There &apos;s nothing hol@@ ding us back , excep@@ t our own ment@@ ality about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this re@@ volution through play .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ ec@@ ond of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it was that as a ki@@ d you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that prom@@ o@@ tion you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be ser@@ ious , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ t@@ ain bi@@ king or read@@ ing a book or pl@@ aying a game .
"@@ Re@@ disco@@ ver that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your friends and ign@@ ite the fi@@ re of change in the play re@@ volution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colle@@ ag@@ ues , your employ@@ e@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tr@@ ust you . &quot; &quot; W@@ e@@ ird concept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tr@@ ust you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make dec@@ is@@ ions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to del@@ eg@@ ate to the low@@ est level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to encour@@ age construc@@ tive cri@@ tic@@ ism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge auth@@ or@@ ity .
Because it &apos;s by chall@@ eng@@ ing the way things are always done is that we are able to brea@@ k out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create innov@@ ative solutions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
We &apos;re going to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate fear .
F@@ ear is the en@@ em@@ y of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like el@@ im@@ in@@ ate res@@ tr@@ ic@@ tions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bile phone for pers@@ onal call@@ s — he@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on inst@@ ant mess@@ eng@@ ers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ches .
L@@ unch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . G@@ ive them some fre@@ e@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have f@@ un at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be , what , a mis@@ er@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we w@@ ake up and say , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this it ?"
I@@ s that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ accep@@ table . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; re@@ volution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; re@@ volution .
What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing .
"S@@ er@@ i@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ o@@ day is the start of the u@@ pris@@ ing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ am@@ es of the re@@ volution . You need to go and share your ideas and your succ@@ ess st@@ ori@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ating our lives , our scho@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play prom@@ ot@@ es a sense of prom@@ ise and self-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ; of how play prom@@ ot@@ es innovation and produc@@ tiv@@ ity , and , ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , how play cre@@ ates me@@ an@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no@@ -@@ t@@ ech life h@@ ack , and all it re@@ qui@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ dit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ aller ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a hand@@ sh@@ ake ."
N@@ arr@@ ator : Here they are arri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication ."
"When we think about communication , we think about inter@@ actions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or prom@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"We are also influ@@ enc@@ ed by our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our fe@@ el@@ ings and our phy@@ si@@ olo@@ gy ."
So what n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psycho@@ log@@ ist . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I te@@ ach at a com@@ peti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ itable that I would become interested in power dy@@ nam@@ ics ."
I became esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally interested in n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavior in the cl@@ ass@@ room , and what do I no@@ tice ?"
"When they s@@ it down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ tice a couple of things about this .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ ron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not sur@@ pris@@ ing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cl@@ ass@@ room , because particip@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gr@@ ade ."
So business scho@@ ols have been stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with this g@@ end@@ er gr@@ ade ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re particip@@ ating ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ sus the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people ten@@ d to be , not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , more ass@@ er@@ tive and more confi@@ dent , more opti@@ mis@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at gam@@ es of chance .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to str@@ ess ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lea@@ der that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on tes@@ to@@ st@@ er@@ one , but really str@@ ess re@@ active ?"
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this tiny mani@@ pul@@ ation , this tiny inter@@ vention ?"
Here are a couple more .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on tes@@ to@@ st@@ er@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ sol .
"So it seems that our n@@ on@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social thre@@ at situ@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
I@@ mag@@ ine this is the person inter@@ vie@@ wing you .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
P@@ eople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the conditions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ech .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it till you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fr@@ au@@ d .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ cident ."
I was thro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had identi@@ fi@@ ed with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feeling ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it till you make it ."
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ ea@@ ks can l@@ ead to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your tes@@ to@@ st@@ er@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ sol down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"@@ Gre@@ at cre@@ ativ@@ ity . In times of need , we need great cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."

T@@ o temp@@ t us to act differ@@ ently with deli@@ gh@@ t@@ ful cre@@ ative s@@ cr@@ ap@@ s .
Here is one such s@@ cr@@ a@@ p from an initi@@ ative I &apos;m invol@@ ved in using cre@@ ativ@@ ity to insp@@ ire people to be gre@@ en@@ er .
"( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"N@@ arr@@ ator : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."
S@@ tr@@ ange and wonderful things he would not o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise have seen .
A de@@ er with an it@@ ch@@ y le@@ g . A fl@@ ying mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle .
A father and d@@ aughter se@@ par@@ ated from a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle by a my@@ st@@ er@@ ious w@@ all .
And then he st@@ op@@ ped . W@@ al@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped with him through fiel@@ ds and bro@@ ken his heart .
"S@@ ure , she had ag@@ ed a little ."
"In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot ."
But he felt all his old pas@@ sion for her re@@ turn .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ d , &quot; &quot; he called so@@ f@@ tly . F@@ or that was her name ."
"&quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t say another word , Gu@@ st@@ y , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name ."
"&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a car@@ av@@ an , exactly 3@@ 00 y@@ ards from here ."
"L@@ et &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ d un@@ dr@@ essed . She sp@@ read one le@@ g , and then the other ."
"@@ Gu@@ st@@ y ent@@ ered her b@@ ol@@ d@@ ly and made love to her r@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ ically while she fil@@ m@@ ed him , because she was a ke@@ en am@@ ateur por@@ no@@ grap@@ her ."
The ear@@ th mo@@ ved for both of them .
And they li@@ ved together happ@@ ily ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
"( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ ob@@ s@@ b@@ aw@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the de@@ b@@ ate ."
The mor@@ al im@@ per@@ ative is on the table .
"@@ Gre@@ at cre@@ ativ@@ ity is needed to take it all , make it simple and shar@@ p ."

"B@@ eau L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ di@@ ence : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Au@@ di@@ ence : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
Au@@ di@@ ence : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?"
"It literally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ Right ? The brain takes me@@ an@@ ing@@ less information and makes me@@ an@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was us@@ e@@ ful to see in the past ."
"A@@ ll right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this fro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s us@@ e@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ y@@ ed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dre@@ ams , the clo@@ th@@ es we w@@ ear , fall@@ ing in love , everything beg@@ ins with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ certain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ certain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
Okay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ as@@ ick@@ ness is a conse@@ qu@@ ence of un@@ certain@@ ty .
"@@ Right ? If you go down bel@@ ow on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in reg@@ ister with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m st@@ anding still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ certain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most danger@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ certain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the ir@@ on@@ y is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , evol@@ ution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ables us to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ certain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ext@@ ends be@@ y@@ ond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really st@@ ep@@ ping into that space ."
So what is evol@@ ution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ certain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . Ex@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ l@@ ay is one of the only human end@@ e@@ av@@ ors where un@@ certain@@ ty is actually cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated . Un@@ certain@@ ty is what makes play f@@ un .
"@@ Right ? It &apos;s adap@@ table to change . Right ? It op@@ ens possibil@@ ity , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bon@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ically mo@@ tiv@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ l@@ ay is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od sec@@ tion of a pap@@ er .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d ru@@ les to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So arm@@ ed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can any@@ one become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 ei@@ gh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the ai@@ m of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . Right ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fun@@ ding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a us@@ e@@ ful contribu@@ tion to science , and the tea@@ chers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . Right ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small prin@@ t so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science public@@ ation the last five to 15 years . Right ?"
So they were as@@ king questions that were signific@@ ant to exper@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite spec@@ ial . Right ?"
"She was one of the young people who was invol@@ ved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ g@@ est pu@@ bl@@ ished scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes on@@ to stage , will be the youn@@ g@@ est person to ever spea@@ k at TED . Right ?"
"Now , science and as@@ king questions is about cour@@ age ."
"Now she is the pers@@ on@@ i@@ fication of cour@@ age , because she &apos;s going to st@@ and up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you pl@@ ease come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es Pro@@ j@@ ect , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ o@@ ole : Thank you , B@@ eau . We thought that it was easy to see the lin@@ k between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible lin@@ k with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought simil@@ ar , since they se@@ em so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might sol@@ ve complex problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also adap@@ t themselves to new situ@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned ru@@ les and conditions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insec@@ t with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can recogni@@ ze a good flo@@ wer regard@@ less of the time of day , the light , the wea@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they design@@ ed this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain colo@@ r , but to a certain colo@@ r flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain pat@@ tern ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers if the y@@ el@@ low f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the bl@@ ue , or if the bl@@ ue f@@ low@@ ers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different ru@@ les the be@@ es can learn to sol@@ ve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and B@@ eau , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding adul@@ ts . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ c@@ lu@@ ding the tea@@ chers , and that was really hard for the tea@@ chers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a c@@ lu@@ e what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the la@@ b , but for a tea@@ cher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ dit goes to D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick , who was the collabor@@ ator on this project . Okay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole det@@ ails of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observ@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the observ@@ ations . They &apos;re re@@ cor@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es fly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : I@@ s she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Yeah .
"D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So you keep tr@@ ack of ea@@ ch@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observ@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s , aver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to wr@@ ite this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for public@@ ation . Right ? So we have to wr@@ ite it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a pap@@ er has four different sec@@ tions : an intro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ tho@@ ds , a resul@@ ts , a discus@@ sion ."
"The intro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ tho@@ ds , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ul@@ ts , what was the observ@@ ation ?"
"And the discus@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? Right ?"
"That &apos;s a science pap@@ er , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a n@@ arr@@ ative , which means that this pap@@ er is wr@@ it@@ ten in k@@ id@@ spea@@ k ."
"It &apos;s not wr@@ it@@ ten by me . It &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the clas@@ s . A@@ s a conse@@ qu@@ ence , this science pap@@ er beg@@ ins , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce u@@ pon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The resul@@ ts sec@@ tion , it says : &quot; &quot; Tr@@ aining ph@@ ase , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ tho@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e p@@ ie ) , &quot; &quot; s@@ mil@@ ey face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science pap@@ er . We &apos;re going to try to get it pu@@ bl@@ ished ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle page . We have a number of auth@@ ors there .
All the ones in b@@ old are eight to 10 years old .
"The first auth@@ or is B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ cho@@ ol , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ed , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public access journ@@ al , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ rai@@ d the pap@@ er fai@@ ls our initi@@ al qu@@ ality control ch@@ ec@@ ks in s@@ ever@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once u@@ pon a time , &quot; &quot; the figu@@ res are in cr@@ ay@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ wed . So I sent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ cad@@ em@@ y of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the lea@@ ding neuro@@ scientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most origin@@ al science pap@@ er I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certain@@ ly des@@ er@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ arr@@ y M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The pap@@ er is magni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be pu@@ bl@@ ish@@ able if done by adul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We s@@ end it back to the ed@@ it@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ arr@@ y and N@@ at@@ al@@ ie H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to wr@@ ite a comm@@ ent@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , pu@@ tting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to Bi@@ olo@@ gy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vie@@ wed by five in@@ depend@@ ent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was pu@@ bl@@ ished . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it pu@@ bl@@ ished . ( Laughter ) T@@ y@@ p@@ ical science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ g@@ est pu@@ bl@@ ished scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was pu@@ bl@@ ished two days before Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ d@@ it@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ o@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science mag@@ az@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver fre@@ ely acc@@ essi@@ ble by Bi@@ olo@@ gy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only pap@@ er that will ever be fre@@ ely acc@@ essi@@ ble by this journ@@ al .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed pap@@ er by Bi@@ olo@@ gy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and tea@@ chers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; rec@@ ently . I don &apos;t have words to expl@@ ain exactly how I am feeling right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , in@@ no@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most bas@@ ic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ lea@@ se con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclu@@ de with a physical met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh y@@ eah , y@@ eah , y@@ eah , come on . Yeah y@@ eah . Okay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ h@@ im@@ on S@@ cho@@ c@@ ken : Right , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . Right . Okay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little dem@@ on@@ str@@ ation , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) ( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) Okay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"Au@@ di@@ ence : ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) Br@@ illi@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ Right ? We nor@@ m@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ certain@@ ty . Wh@@ en he op@@ en@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the possibil@@ ity to step on un@@ certain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ pr@@ ess that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this sh@@ ort story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it brought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it sho@@ wed me that any@@ one , and I mean any@@ one , has the potenti@@ al to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can l@@ ead into a big disco@@ very ."
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all depend@@ s on the way the person fe@@ els about change .
"But changing the way I thought about science was sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we play@@ ed the gam@@ es and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing subj@@ ect , and that any@@ one can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of B@@ eau , and the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ e Pro@@ j@@ ect ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bigg@@ est problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ alis@@ t &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good cho@@ ice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and pap@@ er because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and pap@@ er .
"B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to l@@ ist some of them .
There are 8@@ 00 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ w@@ o billion people without san@@ itation .
There are s@@ ever@@ al million people d@@ ying of H@@ I@@ V and A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
The l@@ ists go on and on .
There &apos;s two bil@@ lions of people who will be s@@ ever@@ ely aff@@ ected by clim@@ ate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would sol@@ ve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually sol@@ ve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy s@@ ession — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start as@@ king ourselves , which ones should we sol@@ ve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We identi@@ fi@@ ed 10 of the bigg@@ est chall@@ eng@@ es in the world , and I will just bri@@ e@@ fly read them : clim@@ ate change , commun@@ ic@@ able dis@@ eas@@ es , conf@@ lic@@ ts , education , financi@@ al inst@@ ability , govern@@ ance and cor@@ ru@@ ption , mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and hun@@ ger , population mi@@ gr@@ ation , san@@ itation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de b@@ arri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ compas@@ s the bigg@@ est problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the bigg@@ est things ?"
Wh@@ ere should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ av@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in as@@ king people to foc@@ us on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t sol@@ ve problems .
Su@@ re@@ ly the bigg@@ est problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to sol@@ ve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solutions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more compl@@ ic@@ ated .
T@@ o clim@@ ate change that would be like K@@ y@@ ot@@ o .
"T@@ o commun@@ ic@@ able dis@@ eas@@ es , it might be health clin@@ ics or mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to ne@@ ts ."
"T@@ o conf@@ lic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ ke@@ e@@ ping forces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible t@@ ask — wr@@ ite down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econom@@ ics gets ev@@ il — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bot@@ tom of the l@@ ist ?
"P@@ lea@@ se , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your neigh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ ori@@ ties and the bot@@ tom pri@@ ori@@ ties of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s bigg@@ est issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also str@@ ong@@ ly encour@@ age you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discus@@ sions af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a l@@ ist never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table .
No@@ body w@@ ants to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a l@@ ist ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also h@@ ate to be not on the top of the l@@ ist .
"And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one spo@@ ts on the l@@ ist than there is number ones , it makes perf@@ ect sense not to want to do such a l@@ ist ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundament@@ al l@@ ist of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing — any dec@@ ision is a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ing , if only impl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ lik@@ ely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pr@@ ices , no@@ r the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ mag@@ ine going into a rest@@ aur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u car@@ d , but you have no idea what the pr@@ ice is ."
"You know , you have a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pr@@ ice is ."
"It could be at one doll@@ ar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a famil@@ y-@@ size pi@@ z@@ z@@ a ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size pi@@ z@@ z@@ a , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ sus is really trying to do — to try to put pr@@ ices on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ sus &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econom@@ ists , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top econom@@ ists wr@@ ite about clim@@ ate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the bene@@ fit of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise in commun@@ ic@@ able dis@@ eas@@ es .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pr@@ ice ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ists , eight of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ists , inclu@@ ding three No@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ versity pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econom@@ ics .
"That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed l@@ ist .
"And then you ask , why econom@@ ists ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about mal@@ ari@@ a , you ask a mal@@ ari@@ a exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about clim@@ ate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ olo@@ g@@ ist ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econom@@ ists do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing t@@ ask of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the l@@ ist , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ site , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a l@@ ist where they said there were bad proj@@ ects — basically , proj@@ ects where if you inv@@ est a doll@@ ar , you get less than a doll@@ ar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fai@@ r proj@@ ects , good proj@@ ects and very good proj@@ ects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good proj@@ ects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from back@@ wards so that we end up with the best proj@@ ects .
These were the bad proj@@ ects .
A@@ s you might see the bot@@ tom of the l@@ ist was clim@@ ate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , either ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curi@@ ous ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ ag@@ ree with on the l@@ ist that you wr@@ ote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ ot@@ o — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ ot@@ o — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global w@@ arm@@ ing is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the average of all m@@ acro@@ economic mod@@ els , is that K@@ y@@ ot@@ o , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment aid that we give the Th@@ ird World every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mod@@ els show it will pos@@ t@@ po@@ ne w@@ arm@@ ing for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ angl@@ ad@@ es@@ h who gets a f@@ loo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can w@@ ait until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
"Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually esti@@ m@@ ate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could sol@@ ve all maj@@ or bas@@ ic problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , san@@ itation , bas@@ ic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend tw@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it be@@ comes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ or@@ ity ."
"The fai@@ r proj@@ ects — no@@ tice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but commun@@ ic@@ able dis@@ eas@@ es , scale of bas@@ ic health services — just made it , simply because , y@@ es , scale of bas@@ ic health services is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very co@@ st@@ ly ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , what it tel@@ ls us is sudd@@ en@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good proj@@ ects , a lot of san@@ itation and water proj@@ ects came in ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , san@@ itation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also co@@ sts a lot of infrastruc@@ ture ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ ori@@ ties which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The four@@ th best problem is mal@@ ari@@ a — de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ ari@@ a .
The in@@ cid@@ ence of mal@@ ari@@ a is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get inf@@ ected every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a per@@ cent@@ age point of G@@ D@@ P every year for aff@@ ected n@@ ations .
"If we inv@@ es@@ ted about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ cid@@ ence down to half ."
"We could av@@ o@@ id about 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more import@@ antly , we could av@@ o@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting inf@@ ected every year ."
"We would signific@@ antly incre@@ ase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global w@@ arm@@ ing ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the model sho@@ wed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally cut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically en@@ liv@@ en the global economy to an as@@ tou@@ n@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 billion dollars a year , half of which would ac@@ cr@@ ue to the Th@@ ird World ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , the point is to say that we could actually pul@@ l two to three hundre@@ d million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very radic@@ ally fast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to foc@@ us on mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion .
"N@@ ot just mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very ch@@ ea@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion , nam@@ ely , the l@@ ack of m@@ ic@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and vit@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inv@@ est about 12 billion dollars , we could make a s@@ ev@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best inv@@ est@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to foc@@ us on H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could av@@ o@@ id 2@@ 8 new million cas@@ es of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , what this does and what it foc@@ uses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ vention .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inv@@ est first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more ex@@ pen@@ sive than pre@@ vention ."
"So basically , what this foc@@ uses on is saying , we can do a lot more by inv@@ es@@ ting in pre@@ vention ."
"B@@ as@@ ically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ vention ."
"So again , what we foc@@ us on is pre@@ vention rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first r@@ ate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ or@@ ity l@@ ist and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is clim@@ ate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ lik@@ ely that we should do that ."
"We should also do clim@@ ate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually foc@@ us on problems , that we foc@@ us on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ om@@ as S@@ ch@@ elling , one of the particip@@ ants in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the clim@@ ate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ri@@ cher ."
E@@ ven the most p@@ es@@ sim@@ is@@ tic impact s@@ cen@@ ari@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
esti@@ m@@ ate that the average person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as r@@ ich as we are today .
"M@@ uch more lik@@ ely , they will be two to four times ri@@ cher than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ri@@ cher than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sav@@ ing people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ angl@@ ad@@ es@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor B@@ angl@@ ad@@ es@@ h@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fai@@ r@@ ly r@@ ich D@@ u@@ t@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fai@@ r@@ ly r@@ ich D@@ u@@ t@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real poor people , right now , in B@@ angl@@ ad@@ es@@ h , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very ch@@ ea@@ pl@@ y ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ elling put it , imagine if you were a r@@ ich — as you will be — a r@@ ich Chin@@ ese , a r@@ ich Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a r@@ ich C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through clim@@ ate change , and car@@ ed so fai@@ r@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my grand@@ father and my great grand@@ father , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ ped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ ori@@ ties str@@ ai@@ ght ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t accord to the ty@@ p@@ ical way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s main@@ ly because clim@@ ate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay Af@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t exp@@ ect E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to c@@ ast Br@@ ad P@@ it@@ t in his next mo@@ vie di@@ gg@@ ing la@@ tr@@ ines in T@@ anz@@ an@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a mo@@ vie ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ sus and the whole discus@@ sion of pri@@ ori@@ ties as a def@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we realiz@@ e it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other objec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a f@@ al@@ se cho@@ ice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would certain@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 19@@ 70 , the developed world decided we were going to spend tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ in@@ ce then our aid has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the pat@@ h of sudd@@ en@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ w@@ ise , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ ush into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ e@@ fly , is this really the right l@@ ist that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econom@@ ists , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly end up as@@ king old , white American men ."
"And they &apos;re not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 80 young people from all over the world to come and sol@@ ve the same problem .
"The only two re@@ qui@@ rem@@ ents were that they were stu@@ d@@ ying at the univers@@ ity , and they spo@@ ke Engl@@ ish ."
"The major@@ ity of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same material but they could go vas@@ tly outside the sc@@ ope of discus@@ sion , and they certain@@ ly did , to come up with their own l@@ ists ."
And the sur@@ pris@@ ing thing was that the l@@ ist was very simil@@ ar — with mal@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and dis@@ eas@@ es at the top and clim@@ ate change at the bot@@ tom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other sem@@ in@@ ars and univers@@ ity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same l@@ ist .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a pat@@ h a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ ori@@ ties , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en Con@@ sen@@ sus as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to ass@@ emble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
M@@ a@@ p out the right pat@@ h for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ orm@@ ous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can dis@@ ag@@ ree with the discus@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and fr@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ ori@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A curi@@ ous little in@@ vention is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a micro@@ sc@@ ope .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tiny little li@@ fe@@ form@@ s that are in@@ visible to the n@@ a@@ ked ey@@ e .
So@@ on comes the medic@@ al disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ form@@ s are actually cau@@ ses of terri@@ ble human dis@@ eas@@ es .
"I@@ mag@@ ine what happened to the society when they realized that an Engl@@ ish mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ in@@ king a mon@@ st@@ er sou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast forward 200 years .
"We still have this mon@@ st@@ er sou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the develop@@ ing countries around the tr@@ op@@ ical bel@@ t ."
They all have fac@@ es .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the micro@@ sc@@ ope itself .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , bul@@ ky , really hard to ma@@ int@@ ain , and cost a lot of money ."
We saw all kinds of don@@ ated e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ ope ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ ope is a completely func@@ tional micro@@ sc@@ ope , a plat@@ form for flu@@ or@@ esc@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field , pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation , proj@@ ection , all kinds of adv@@ anc@@ ed micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y built pu@@ re@@ ly by fol@@ ding pap@@ er ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stand@@ ard that &apos;s been opti@@ mi@@ zed for over the years , and many health wor@@ kers are actually used to this ."
You po@@ p this in .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re design@@ ed from a very fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble material , like pap@@ er ."
"So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cro@@ ss@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of a com@@ pou@@ nd ey@@ e , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ o@@ om in clo@@ ser , right there , I am going through the z-@@ ax@@ is ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my favor@@ ite insec@@ ts , I love to h@@ ate this one , is a mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ n@@ a of a cul@@ e@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
Right there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it co@@ sts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the bigg@@ est idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to-@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and co@@ sts ."
I &apos;m going to give you a qu@@ ick s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of pap@@ er .
There are some light sour@@ ces .
"And essenti@@ ally , in the end , all the parts line up because of orig@@ ami , because of the fact that orig@@ ami allo@@ ws us m@@ ic@@ r@@ on-@@ scale pre@@ cis@@ ion of op@@ tical al@@ ign@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the asp@@ ects of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fai@@ r@@ ly s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ated ."
"There it is , and it sur@@ vi@@ ves ."
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
O@@ ur world has many super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ po@@ w@@ ers : in@@ visi@@ bil@@ ity .
"For example , the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es , wor@@ kers who coll@@ ect rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able mater@@ i@@ als for a living ."
"C@@ at@@ ad@@ or@@ es emer@@ g@@ ed from social in@@ equ@@ ality , un@@ employ@@ ment , and the ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance of so@@ li@@ d was@@ te from the de@@ fici@@ ency of the was@@ te coll@@ ection system ."
"C@@ at@@ ad@@ or@@ es provi@@ de a he@@ av@@ y , hon@@ est and essenti@@ al work that bene@@ f@@ its the entire population . But they are not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ed for it ."
"H@@ ere in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , they coll@@ ect 90 percent of all the was@@ te that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"M@@ o@@ st of the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es work in@@ depend@@ ently , pic@@ king was@@ te from the stre@@ ets and sel@@ ling to j@@ un@@ k y@@ ards at very low pr@@ ices ."
"C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from w@@ ood or met@@ al and found in s@@ ever@@ al stre@@ ets in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , much like gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i and stre@@ et art ."
And this is how I first met these mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ed super@@ her@@ o@@ es .
"I am a gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i arti@@ st and acti@@ vis@@ t and my art is social , environ@@ mental and political in nature ."
"In 200@@ 7 , I took my work be@@ y@@ ond w@@ all@@ s and on@@ to the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new urb@@ an support for my message ."
"But at this time , giving vo@@ ice to the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es ."
"And also , they are fam@@ ous now on the stre@@ ets , on mas@@ s media and social ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ g@@ ed into this universe and have not st@@ op@@ ped working since ."
I have pain@@ ted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been inv@@ ited to do ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de .
"And then I realized that cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es , in their in@@ visi@@ bil@@ ity , are not exc@@ lu@@ sive to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
"I met them in Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ a , C@@ hi@@ le , Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ a , Sou@@ th Africa , T@@ ur@@ key and even in developed countries such as the United States and J@@ ap@@ an ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people j@@ oin the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
"And then , I created a collabor@@ ative mo@@ vement called P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça — ( Laughter ) — which is a large cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça is a large cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded ev@@ ent to help cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"C@@ at@@ ad@@ or@@ es are ass@@ is@@ ted by w@@ ell@@ -@@ being professi@@ on@@ als and heal@@ th@@ care , like phys@@ ici@@ ans , d@@ enti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ a@@ tr@@ ists , h@@ air st@@ y@@ l@@ ists , m@@ ass@@ age ther@@ ap@@ ists and much more ."
"But also , they also re@@ ce@@ ive s@@ af@@ ety sh@@ ir@@ ts , glo@@ ves , r@@ ain@@ co@@ ats and ey@@ e@@ gl@@ as@@ ses to see in high@@ -@@ defin@@ ition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated by our incredible vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers ."
"And then they re@@ ce@@ ive s@@ af@@ ety it@@ ems , too : re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive t@@ ap@@ es , hor@@ ns and mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a stre@@ et arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bile art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça took to the stre@@ ets of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ au@@ l@@ o , Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ b@@ a ."
"But to me@@ et the dem@@ and in other cities , inclu@@ ding outside of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is insp@@ i@@ red by TE@@ D@@ x , and it &apos;s a simpl@@ ifi@@ ed , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , cro@@ w@@ d@@ fun@@ ded e@@ di@@ tion of P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça ."
So now everybody can j@@ oin .
"In two years , over 1@@ 70 cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es , 8@@ 00 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and 200 stre@@ et arti@@ sts and more than 1@@ ,000 don@@ ors have been invol@@ ved in the P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça mo@@ vement , wh@@ ose actions have even been used in tea@@ ching rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing at a local school ."
So cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es are le@@ av@@ ing in@@ visi@@ bil@@ ity behind and be@@ coming increas@@ ingly resp@@ ected and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ing the cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es and other in@@ visible super@@ her@@ o@@ es from your city ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , recogni@@ ze them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause ) .
"A@@ bout a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al Earth , brought me over to become the archit@@ ect of B@@ ing M@@ ap@@ s , which is M@@ icro@@ so@@ ft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ m@@ app@@ ing eff@@ ort ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way m@@ ap@@ s work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of m@@ app@@ ing and direction site that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might no@@ tice about the m@@ app@@ ing site is just the flu@@ id@@ ity of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the p@@ ann@@ ing , which , if you &apos;re famil@@ i@@ ar at all with S@@ ea@@ dr@@ ag@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ graph@@ y , it &apos;s also about imag@@ ery ."
"So , as we z@@ o@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ y@@ ond a certain level this res@@ ol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ i@@ m C@@ it@@ y-@@ like virtu@@ al view at 4@@ 5 de@@ gre@@ es ."
"This can be vie@@ wed from any of the car@@ din@@ al direc@@ tions to show you the 3@@ D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ades ."
"Now , we see this space , this thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sor@@ ts of appl@@ ications can play out , and ma@@ p &apos;s direc@@ tions are really just one of them ."
"If you cli@@ ck on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve l@@ aun@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the dis@@ as@@ ter in H@@ ai@@ ti , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ma@@ p that sho@@ wed before and after pic@@ tures from the sk@@ y ."
"This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local blo@@ gs in real time and m@@ app@@ ing those stories , those en@@ tries to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the blo@@ gs ."
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more c@@ and@@ y sort of stuff .
"So , we see the imag@@ ery , of course , not st@@ op@@ ping at the sk@@ y ."
These little green bu@@ b@@ bles repres@@ ent phot@@ o@@ syn@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them either , but phot@@ o@@ syn@@ ths are in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the ma@@ p ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing that &apos;s cas@@ ed in bl@@ ue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imag@@ ery on the ground as well .
"And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . Wh@@ en you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ery , the first thing that you might no@@ tice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal understanding of this environment as there is of the thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal city from abo@@ ve , so if I cli@@ ck on something to get a clo@@ ser view of it , then , the fact that that tran@@ si@@ tion looks as it does , is a func@@ tion of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D understanding behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a f@@ un ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a collabor@@ ation with our friends at F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , ge@@ o@@ reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed imag@@ ery and uses phot@@ o@@ syn@@ th@@ -@@ like proc@@ esses to conn@@ ect that imag@@ ery to our imag@@ ery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pul@@ l up , but — ( Laughter ) But no@@ tice — this is , of course , a popul@@ ar tour@@ ist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ lic@@ k@@ r photo , that &apos;s our imag@@ ery ."
"So you really see how this kind of cro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ed imag@@ ery is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating , in a very de@@ ep way , into the ma@@ p itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are s@@ ever@@ al reas@@ ons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time trav@@ el ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful hist@@ or@@ ic imag@@ ery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augment@@ ing this visu@@ al repres@@ ent@@ ation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation for augment@@ ed reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a tran@@ si@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , no@@ tice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of abo@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ k@@ et .
"And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a back@@ p@@ ack cam@@ era , so , we &apos;re now not only imag@@ ing in the stre@@ et with this cam@@ era on t@@ op@@ s of cars , but we &apos;re also imag@@ ing inside ."
"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of reg@@ istr@@ ation , not only of still images , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) OK .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( No@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m h@@ itting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace Mar@@ k@@ et , the la@@ b ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting this live .
"O@@ K , Ge@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show points of inter@@ est .
"N@@ o , no . The other way ."
"@@ Yeah , y@@ eah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , OK , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these points of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spo@@ t , you can think about this — this is taking a step in ad@@ di@@ tion to augment@@ ed reality ."
"What the h@@ ell are you guys — oh , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the team ."
They &apos;ve done a fantas@@ tic job of pul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ and@@ on them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for tel@@ e@@ pres@@ ence , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the spo@@ t , for augment@@ ed reality ."
"When you use it on the spo@@ t , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that met@@ ad@@ at@@ a and information about the world to you ."
"So here , we &apos;re taking the extr@@ a step of also bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ting it ."
"That was being bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast , by the way , on a 4@@ G net@@ work from the market ."
"A@@ ll right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that M@@ icro@@ so@@ ft has given in the past s@@ ever@@ al years ."
"And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ ti@@ s W@@ ong , Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ ide T@@ el@@ esc@@ ope ."
"So , we &apos;re going to head over to the d@@ um@@ p@@ st@@ ers , where it &apos;s tradi@@ tional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a brea@@ k , but also st@@ are up at the sk@@ y ."
This is the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ation of Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ ide T@@ el@@ esc@@ ope into our m@@ ap@@ s .
"( Applause ) This is the cur@@ rent — th@@ ank you — this is the cur@@ rent time . If we s@@ cru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sk@@ y will look at different times , and we can get all of this very det@@ ail@@ ed information about different times , different dat@@ es : Let &apos;s move the mo@@ on a little high@@ er in the sk@@ y , maybe change the d@@ ate ."
I would like to kind of z@@ o@@ om in on the mo@@ on .
"So , this is an astr@@ onom@@ ically comple@@ te repres@@ ent@@ ation of the sk@@ y in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated right into the Earth ."
"A@@ ll right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop ."
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are ro@@ ck and lots of se@@ a ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ ome@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I j@@ um@@ ped in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast off S@@ pain .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him Jo@@ e — what would Jo@@ e see ?"
"If Jo@@ e j@@ um@@ ped in a cor@@ al re@@ ef , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"@@ V@@ ery un@@ lik@@ ely , Jo@@ e would j@@ um@@ p on a pr@@ ist@@ ine cor@@ al re@@ ef , a vir@@ g@@ in cor@@ al re@@ ef with lots of cor@@ al , shar@@ ks , cro@@ co@@ di@@ les , man@@ at@@ e@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"So , probably , what Jo@@ e would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the picture ."
"H@@ ere we have the ex@@ tre@@ me with d@@ ead cor@@ als , micro@@ bi@@ al sou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the re@@ e@@ fs of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ growing the cor@@ als , lots of b@@ acter@@ ia , and where the large animals are gone ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scientists have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started moder@@ n science with s@@ cu@@ b@@ a di@@ ving long after we started de@@ grad@@ ing mar@@ ine ec@@ o@@ systems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like ."
"And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the L@@ ine Is@@ l@@ ands , where we have con@@ duc@@ ted a ser@@ ies of N@@ ational Ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions ."
"This se@@ a is an arch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago bel@@ ong@@ ing to K@@ i@@ ri@@ bat@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has s@@ ever@@ al un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited , un@@ f@@ ished , pr@@ ist@@ ine is@@ l@@ ands and a few in@@ hab@@ ited is@@ l@@ ands ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as Is@@ land , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"M@@ o@@ st of the re@@ e@@ fs are d@@ ead , most of the cor@@ als are d@@ ead — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are sm@@ aller than the pen@@ c@@ ils we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single shar@@ k .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ t@@ ain Co@@ ok disco@@ vered in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7 and he descri@@ bed a huge ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance of shar@@ ks b@@ iting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going as@@ ho@@ re .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ ann@@ ing Is@@ land , 2@@ ,@@ 500 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ vers would consi@@ der par@@ a@@ dis@@ e .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a K@@ ey@@ s N@@ ational Mar@@ ine S@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ t@@ ol@@ l , where I was with J@@ er@@ em@@ y J@@ ack@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are shar@@ ks ."
You can see shar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ usu@@ al in today &apos;s cor@@ al re@@ e@@ fs .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolu@@ tely heal@@ thy and g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing spec@@ tac@@ ular struc@@ tures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 shar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bi@@ om@@ ass p@@ y@@ ram@@ id .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al re@@ ef together and we@@ igh them , this is what we would exp@@ ect ."
"M@@ o@@ st of the bi@@ om@@ ass is low on the food ch@@ ain , the her@@ bi@@ v@@ or@@ es , the par@@ r@@ ot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little dam@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ ass of car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ es , and a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ ass of top head , or the shar@@ ks , the large s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , the large grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a conse@@ qu@@ ence .
This view of the world is a conse@@ qu@@ ence of having stu@@ died de@@ grad@@ ed re@@ e@@ fs .
"When we went to pr@@ ist@@ ine re@@ e@@ fs , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ ram@@ id was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bi@@ om@@ ass , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ ef , which is now prot@@ ected ."
"The good news is that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is bigg@@ er .
"We have more shar@@ ks , more bi@@ om@@ ass of s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , more bi@@ om@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ v@@ or@@ es , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats ."
"They cle@@ an the re@@ ef ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the re@@ ef cle@@ an and al@@ low the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these anci@@ ent , pr@@ ist@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important com@@ pon@@ ents of the ec@@ o@@ system like the gi@@ ant cl@@ ams ; p@@ av@@ ements of gi@@ ant cl@@ ams in the l@@ ag@@ o@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per squ@@ are met@@ er ."
"These have dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed from every in@@ hab@@ ited re@@ ef in the world , and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water cle@@ an from micro@@ bes and pa@@ tho@@ gens ."
"But still , now we have global w@@ arm@@ ing ."
"If we don &apos;t have f@@ ish@@ ing because these re@@ e@@ fs are prot@@ ected by la@@ w or their rem@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the cor@@ als die .
"So how are these fish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?"
"Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during E@@ l N@@ in@@ o , year &apos; 9@@ 7 , &apos; 9@@ 8 , the water was too war@@ m for too long , and many cor@@ als bl@@ ea@@ ched and many died ."
"In Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as , where the food web is really tr@@ im@@ m@@ ed down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not re@@ co@@ vered ."
"In F@@ ann@@ ing Is@@ land , the cor@@ als are not re@@ co@@ vered ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that died and coll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .
"And the fish have gr@@ az@@ ed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little lo@@ wer ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ ra A@@ t@@ ol@@ l that has more bi@@ om@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ v@@ or@@ es , and the d@@ ead cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pr@@ ist@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"These places bl@@ ea@@ ched too , but they re@@ co@@ vered fas@@ ter ."
"The more int@@ act , the more comple@@ te , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the high@@ er the res@@ ili@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more lik@@ ely that the system is going to re@@ co@@ ver from the sh@@ or@@ t-@@ ter@@ m imp@@ ac@@ ts of w@@ arm@@ ing ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to re@@ co@@ ver that structure ."
We need to make sure that all of the pi@@ ec@@ es of the ec@@ o@@ system are there so the ec@@ o@@ system can adap@@ t to the eff@@ ects of global w@@ arm@@ ing .
"So if we have to res@@ et the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to p@@ ush the ec@@ o@@ system back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are s@@ ever@@ al ways ."
"One very clear way is the mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ves that we set as@@ ide to al@@ low for the re@@ co@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a ki@@ d .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ ques C@@ ou@@ st@@ eau &apos;s shows on T@@ V , with all this ri@@ ch@@ ness and ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance and di@@ versity ."
"And I thought that this ri@@ ch@@ ness bel@@ ong@@ ed to tr@@ op@@ ical se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an was a nat@@ ur@@ ally poor se@@ a ."
"But , little did I know , until I j@@ um@@ ped for the first time in a mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again ."
"So you have this little alg@@ al for@@ est , and in the size of a l@@ ap@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , mo@@ st@@ ly micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system re@@ co@@ vers ."
"And this particular place , the M@@ e@@ des Is@@ l@@ ands Mar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 h@@ ect@@ ar@@ es , and it br@@ ings 6 million eu@@ ro@@ s to the local economy , 20 times more than f@@ ish@@ ing , and it repres@@ ents 8@@ 8 percent of all the tour@@ ist reven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the ec@@ o@@ system but also help the people who can bene@@ fit from the ec@@ o@@ system .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ves do .
"These places , when we prot@@ ect them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prot@@ ected areas ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species increas@@ es 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would exp@@ ect 200 more in a mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al .
"The size of organis@@ ms increas@@ es a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance , how many fish you have per squ@@ are met@@ er , increas@@ es almost 1@@ 70 percent ."
"And the bi@@ om@@ ass — this is the most spec@@ tac@@ ular change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bi@@ om@@ ass on average , just after five to seven years ."
In some places up to 10 times larg@@ er bi@@ om@@ ass inside the res@@ er@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the res@@ er@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ produce . That &apos;s population biolo@@ gy 10@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larg@@ er and they re@@ produce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
"These are eg@@ g cas@@ es l@@ aid by a s@@ n@@ ail off the co@@ ast of C@@ hi@@ le , and this is how many eg@@ gs they l@@ ay on the bot@@ tom ."
"O@@ u@@ t@@ side the res@@ er@@ ve , you cannot even det@@ ect this ."
One point three million eg@@ gs per squ@@ are met@@ er inside the mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ve where these s@@ n@@ ails are very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
"So these organis@@ ms re@@ produce , the little lar@@ v@@ a@@ e ju@@ ven@@ iles sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can bene@@ fit from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ ah@@ am@@ as : N@@ ass@@ au grou@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance of grou@@ per@@ s inside the res@@ er@@ ve , and the clo@@ ser you get to the res@@ er@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the f@@ ish@@ er@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the res@@ er@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats lin@@ ed up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are bene@@ f@@ its be@@ y@@ ond the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies of these res@@ er@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the res@@ er@@ ve is prot@@ ec@@ ting the entire habit@@ at . It is building res@@ ili@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world without res@@ er@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this princip@@ al that we don &apos;t tou@@ ch ; that produ@@ ces re@@ turns , social , economic and ec@@ olo@@ gical ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bi@@ om@@ ass inside the res@@ er@@ ves , this is like com@@ pou@@ nd inter@@ est ."
"T@@ w@@ o exam@@ ples , again , of how these res@@ er@@ ves can bene@@ fit people ."
"This is how much f@@ ish@@ er@@ men get every@@ day in Ken@@ y@@ a , f@@ ish@@ ing over a ser@@ ies of years , in a place where there is no prot@@ ection ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ grad@@ ing f@@ ish@@ ing g@@ ear , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ mo@@ ved , the f@@ ish@@ er@@ men were cat@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually cat@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ve on top of that , the f@@ ish@@ er@@ men are still making more money by f@@ ish@@ ing less around an area that is prot@@ ected ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ ass@@ au grou@@ per@@ s in B@@ el@@ ize in the M@@ es@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ican Re@@ ef .
"This is grou@@ per se@@ x , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the full mo@@ ons of D@@ ec@@ ember and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a week ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the t@@ ens of thousands , 3@@ 0,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one h@@ ect@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ ish@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they cau@@ ght them , and they de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 2@@ 000 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the f@@ ish@@ er@@ men were auth@@ or@@ iz@@ ed to cat@@ ch 30 percent of the entire sp@@ aw@@ ning population every year .
"So we did a simple analy@@ s@@ is , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ ck@@ et science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your f@@ ish@@ ery is going to coll@@ ap@@ se very quickly ."
"And with the f@@ ish@@ ery , the entire re@@ produc@@ tive ability of the species goes ext@@ inc@@ t ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , tot@@ al , for the entire f@@ ish@@ ery , s@@ ever@@ al f@@ ish@@ ing bo@@ ats ."
"Now , if you do an economic analy@@ s@@ is and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 di@@ vers one mon@@ th per year , the reven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be sust@@ ain@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"If this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ br@@ ain@@ er , how much of this do we have ?"
And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s prot@@ ected .
"We &apos;re getting clo@@ ser to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prot@@ ec@@ tions of the Ch@@ ag@@ os Ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago , and only a fr@@ action of this is fully prot@@ ected from f@@ ish@@ ing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c stu@@ dies re@@ comm@@ end that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prot@@ ected .
The esti@@ m@@ ated r@@ ange is between 20 and 50 percent for a ser@@ ies of go@@ als of bio@@ di@@ versity and f@@ ish@@ ery en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement and res@@ ili@@ ence .
"Now , is this possible ? P@@ eople would ask : How much would that cost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are p@@ aying now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze f@@ ish@@ ing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to des@@ truc@@ tive f@@ ish@@ ing pr@@ acti@@ ces .
"Well , there are a couple esti@@ mat@@ es of how much it would cost to create a net@@ work of prot@@ ected areas co@@ ver@@ ing 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fr@@ action of what we are now p@@ aying ; the government hands out to a f@@ ish@@ ery that is coll@@ ap@@ sing ."
P@@ eople are lo@@ sing their j@@ ob@@ s because the f@@ ish@@ er@@ ies are coll@@ ap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a net@@ work of res@@ er@@ ves would provi@@ de direc@@ t employ@@ ment for more than a million people plus all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary bene@@ f@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so clear that these sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prot@@ ected areas like the Ch@@ ag@@ os Ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
"The problem is that we can create these large res@@ er@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conf@@ lic@@ t , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organiz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of f@@ ish@@ ing ?"
"Well , there are three main reas@@ ons why we don &apos;t have t@@ ens of thousands of small res@@ er@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ves do , and f@@ ish@@ er@@ men ten@@ d to be really , really def@@ en@@ sive when it comes to reg@@ ul@@ ating or clo@@ sing an area , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ ec@@ ond , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ as@@ t@@ al communi@@ ties around the world don &apos;t have the auth@@ or@@ ity to mon@@ it@@ or the res@@ ources to create the res@@ er@@ ve and en@@ force it ."
It &apos;s a top down hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical structure where people w@@ ait for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not effec@@ tive . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough res@@ ources .
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more res@@ er@@ ves , is that the fun@@ ding mod@@ els have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments spend a lot of time and energy and res@@ ources in a few small areas , usu@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation and co@@ as@@ t@@ al prot@@ ection has become a sin@@ k for government or phil@@ an@@ thro@@ pi@@ c money , and this is not sust@@ ain@@ able ."
So the solutions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ ir@@ st , we need to dev@@ el@@ op a global aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to insp@@ ire local communi@@ ties and govern@@ ments to create no@@ -@@ take res@@ er@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sav@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ sus the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ ec@@ ond , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so con@@ serv@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts can be dec@@ entr@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ serv@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts don &apos;t de@@ pen@@ d on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and can be created by the local communi@@ ties , like it happens in the Ph@@ ili@@ p@@ p@@ ines and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to dev@@ el@@ op new business mod@@ els ."
The phil@@ an@@ thro@@ p@@ y sin@@ k as the only way to create res@@ er@@ ves is not sust@@ ain@@ able .
"We really need to dev@@ el@@ op mod@@ els , business mod@@ els , where co@@ as@@ t@@ al con@@ serv@@ ation is an inv@@ est@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine res@@ er@@ ves provi@@ de social , ec@@ olo@@ gical and economic bene@@ f@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organiz@@ ation alone is going to s@@ ave the ocean ."
"There has been a lot of com@@ peti@@ tion in the past , and we need to dev@@ el@@ op a new model of part@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly collabor@@ ative , where we are looking for compl@@ ement@@ ing , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting ."
The st@@ a@@ kes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ al@@ a : Thank you .
CA : That was a mas@@ ter@@ ful job of pul@@ ling things together .
"F@@ ir@@ st of all , your p@@ y@@ ram@@ id , your in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ram@@ id , sho@@ wing 8@@ 5 percent bi@@ om@@ ass in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that seems impossible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent sur@@ vi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ear@@ s of a watch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very s@@ low@@ ly , and the small one is moving fast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the lo@@ wer parts of the food ch@@ ain , they re@@ produce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eg@@ gs ."
"@@ U@@ p there , you have shar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ produce very s@@ low@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism ; and , basically , they just ma@@ int@@ ain their bi@@ om@@ ass ."
"So , basically , the production sur@@ plus of these guys down there is enough to ma@@ int@@ ain this bi@@ om@@ ass that is not moving ."
They are like capac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
CA : That &apos;s very fascin@@ ating .
"So , really , our picture of a food p@@ y@@ ram@@ id is just — we have to change that completely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t least in the se@@ as .
"What we found in cor@@ al re@@ e@@ fs is that the in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ram@@ id is the equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ eng@@ et@@ i , with five lions per w@@ il@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this cannot work ."
But at least on cor@@ al re@@ e@@ fs are systems where there is a bot@@ tom com@@ pon@@ ent with structure .
We think this is univers@@ al .
But we have started stu@@ d@@ ying pr@@ ist@@ ine re@@ e@@ fs only very rec@@ ently .
CA : So the numbers you pres@@ ented really are as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re sp@@ ending 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas that actually give new living cho@@ ices to the f@@ ish@@ er@@ men as well .
"If the world was a smar@@ ter place , we could sol@@ ve this problem for ne@@ g@@ ative 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ performan@@ ce of f@@ ish@@ er@@ ies that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big solutions is have the World T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ dies to sust@@ ain@@ able pr@@ acti@@ ces ."
"C@@ A : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m hear@@ ing out there about ending this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ d@@ ness ."
So th@@ ank you for those numbers .
The last one &apos;s a pers@@ onal question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oce@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ grad@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pr@@ ess@@ ing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feeling that you must have experi@@ enc@@ ed of going to these pr@@ ist@@ ine areas and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a spir@@ itu@@ al experience .
"We go there to try to understand the ec@@ o@@ systems , to try to mea@@ sure or coun@@ t fish and shar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feeling is this bi@@ oph@@ il@@ ia that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ t@@ am@@ ed nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larg@@ er thing or of a larg@@ er global ec@@ o@@ system ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job ."
It would be just too de@@ pr@@ ess@@ ing .
"C@@ A : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for shar@@ ing some of that spir@@ itu@@ al experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from Pro@@ vi@@ d@@ ence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ employ@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ a@@ ds through state par@@ ks and national for@@ es@@ ts — basically the long@@ est rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of Sou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 miles ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me tot@@ ally blan@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an in the front row who &apos;s doing a perf@@ ect im@@ itation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few moments , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she figu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) Right , the fam@@ ous Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Chr@@ is say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might str@@ i@@ ke you as a str@@ ange care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ antage : no job com@@ peti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possibil@@ ity that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ e@@ fs I hold , here in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se , sudd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bil@@ ity goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the pres@@ ent ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the pres@@ ent ten@@ se .
"So effec@@ tiv@@ ely , we all kind of w@@ ind up trav@@ eling through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feeling very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our pers@@ onal and professi@@ onal lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collec@@ tiv@@ ely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feeling of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to conv@@ in@@ ce you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est mor@@ al , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tu@@ al and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uc@@ k in this feeling of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ b@@ s down .
"E@@ m@@ b@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing . Okay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ b@@ s down , emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realiz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ as@@ tat@@ ing , it can be re@@ v@@ el@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ n@@ y , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Chin@@ ese char@@ ac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an an@@ alo@@ gy .
D@@ o you remember that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always ch@@ as@@ ing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ ode of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is ch@@ as@@ ing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner r@@ uns off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can fly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote r@@ uns off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ n@@ y — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he fall@@ s .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realiz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually correc@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tural reason , why we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feeling of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ ind@@ ness .
"M@@ o@@ st of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of intern@@ al cu@@ e to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uc@@ k inside this feeling as well — and this one is cul@@ tural .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ ement@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in clas@@ s , and your tea@@ cher is h@@ anding back qui@@ z pap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not mine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gr@@ ade school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this pap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b ki@@ d , the trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er , the one who never does his hom@@ e@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ sp@@ ect , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just be@@ coming perf@@ ect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ers ."
"@@ Right , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , astr@@ op@@ hy@@ s@@ ic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , astr@@ op@@ hy@@ s@@ ic@@ ists , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
Ex@@ cep@@ t that then we fre@@ a@@ k out at the possibil@@ ity that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just ins@@ ist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and virtu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h Is@@ ra@@ el De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ dic@@ al C@@ enter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ et@@ h Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in Bo@@ st@@ on .
It &apos;s the tea@@ ching hosp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best hosp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , s@@ ends her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing seems to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she w@@ a@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has per@@ form@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vi@@ ce pres@@ id@@ ent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h Is@@ ra@@ el spo@@ ke about this in@@ cident , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or whatever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the correc@@ t side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feeling of being on the correc@@ t side of anything can be very danger@@ ous ."
This intern@@ al sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ ide to what is actually going on in the ex@@ tern@@ al world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop ent@@ ert@@ aining the possibil@@ ity that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 200 million g@@ allons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge pr@@ ac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ e@@ fs just perf@@ ect@@ ly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to expl@@ ain all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us expl@@ ain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we usu@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ign@@ or@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ ption , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right pi@@ ec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together correc@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ ption : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ astr@@ op@@ he .
This atta@@ ch@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mis@@ takes when we absolu@@ tely need to and cau@@ ses us to tre@@ at each other terri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ aff@@ ling and most tr@@ ag@@ ic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perf@@ ect@@ ly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just g@@ az@@ e out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to g@@ az@@ e out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ rac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And y@@ eah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ tes said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wr@@ ote &quot; &quot; F@@ allo@@ r er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our capac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing def@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fundament@@ al to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ s@@ essed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ s@@ ession is the source and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tiv@@ ity and cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself lis@@ ten@@ ing to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ adi@@ o show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing and I &apos;m lis@@ ten@@ ing , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cr@@ az@@ y wr@@ ong@@ ness l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just imagin@@ ed it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ l@@ ass , who &apos;s the ho@@ st of the show ."
"And I m@@ enti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a st@@ af@@ f , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ ode of our show has the same cr@@ y@@ p@@ to-@@ them@@ e ."
"And the cr@@ y@@ p@@ to-@@ them@@ e is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ l@@ ass , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these moments of sur@@ prise and re@@ vers@@ al and wr@@ ong@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience mem@@ bers , as lis@@ ten@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like pl@@ ot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and sur@@ prise end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ Ge@@ or@@ ge B@@ ush thought he was going to inv@@ ade I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ unch of wea@@ pon@@ s of mas@@ s des@@ truc@@ tion , liber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ cr@@ acy to the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ a@@ k thought he was going to be the dic@@ tat@@ or of E@@ gy@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too s@@ ick and could pas@@ s the re@@ ign@@ s of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your hom@@ et@@ own and rai@@ se a b@@ unch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a subj@@ ect everybody h@@ ates for an audience that would never mater@@ i@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ es us ."
"N@@ o off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our capac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ ements and impro@@ v@@ ements , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ ements and impro@@ v@@ ements ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ g@@ gl@@ ing and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Chr@@ is ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The them@@ e of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fi@@ ed space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the vas@@ t@@ ness and complex@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ ay@@ be I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
"On No@@ v@@ ember 5@@ th , 199@@ 0 , a man nam@@ ed E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air wal@@ ked into a h@@ ot@@ el in M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an and ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ated R@@ ab@@ b@@ i M@@ e@@ ir K@@ ah@@ ane , the lea@@ der of the J@@ e@@ w@@ ish De@@ f@@ en@@ se Le@@ ag@@ ue ."
"S@@ ad@@ ly , the 199@@ 3 b@@ omb@@ ing of the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter was not ."
N@@ os@@ air would even@@ tually be conv@@ ic@@ ted for his invol@@ vement in the pl@@ ot .
E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
"My father ex@@ posed me to a side of Is@@ l@@ am that few people , inclu@@ ding the major@@ ity of M@@ us@@ lim@@ s , get to see ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small per@@ cent@@ age of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beli@@ e@@ fs that they feel they must use any means nec@@ ess@@ ary to make others live as they do ."
"A few months pri@@ or to his arr@@ est , he s@@ at me down and expl@@ ained that for the past few wee@@ k@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ ot@@ ing r@@ ange on L@@ ong Is@@ land for tar@@ get pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
"That day , the last bul@@ let I sho@@ t h@@ it the small or@@ ange light that s@@ at on top of the tar@@ get and to everyone &apos;s sur@@ prise , esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally mine , the entire tar@@ get bur@@ st into fl@@ am@@ es ."
"My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Ar@@ ab@@ ic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke father , like son ."
They thought they saw in me the same des@@ truc@@ tion my father was capable of .
"Th@@ ose men would even@@ tually be conv@@ ic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an f@@ ill@@ ed with 1@@ ,@@ 500 pou@@ nds of explo@@ si@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , caus@@ ing an explo@@ sion that kill@@ ed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already mo@@ ved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my chil@@ d@@ hood didn &apos;t really provi@@ de an opportunity to make many friends ."
"B@@ e@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al new face in clas@@ s , I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the tar@@ get of bul@@ lies ."
"I &apos;d been rais@@ ed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary mea@@ su@@ rem@@ ents , like a person &apos;s r@@ ace or religion ."
So what op@@ en@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that chall@@ eng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2@@ 000 pres@@ identi@@ al el@@ ec@@ tions .
"Th@@ r@@ ough a colle@@ ge pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ ou@@ th Con@@ vention in Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia ."
"My particular group &apos;s foc@@ us was on y@@ ou@@ th violence , and having been the vic@@ ti@@ m of bul@@ l@@ ying for most of my life , this was a subj@@ ect in which I felt particul@@ arly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate ."
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ vention , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was J@@ e@@ w@@ ish ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish friend before , and fran@@ k@@ ly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a b@@ arri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ d@@ ens , an am@@ usement par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fai@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundament@@ al to the develop@@ ment of my char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"M@@ o@@ st of my life , I &apos;d been t@@ au@@ ght that hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all g@@ ay people were a ne@@ g@@ ative influ@@ ence ."
"B@@ e@@ ing bul@@ li@@ ed as a ki@@ d created a sense of emp@@ ath@@ y in me to@@ ward the suff@@ ering of others , and it comes very un@@ nat@@ ur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that feeling , I was able to contr@@ ast the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes I &apos;d been t@@ au@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; On a ni@@ gh@@ tly bas@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ w@@ art forc@@ ed me to be int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry and hel@@ ped me to realiz@@ e that a person &apos;s r@@ ace , religion or sex@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s char@@ ac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ g@@ ative energy it takes to hold that h@@ at@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ a@@ k E@@ br@@ a@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our conn@@ ection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potenti@@ ally put myself in d@@ anger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ ell@@ ed to use violence may hear my story and realiz@@ e that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been subj@@ ected to this viol@@ ent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ olo@@ gy , that I did not become f@@ an@@ ati@@ ci@@ zed ."
"For the vic@@ ti@@ ms of terror@@ ism , I will spea@@ k out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s actions ."
"And with that simple fact , I st@@ and here as pro@@ of that violence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s religion or r@@ ace , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m hon@@ o@@ red by the inv@@ itation , and th@@ an@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , I su@@ sp@@ ect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"F@@ ir@@ st off , my b@@ ad@@ ge says I &apos;m an astr@@ onom@@ er ."
"I would love to talk about my astr@@ onom@@ y , but I su@@ sp@@ ect that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative trans@@ f@@ er in non-@@ gr@@ ay atmosp@@ her@@ es and pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation of light in J@@ up@@ iter &apos;s up@@ per atmosp@@ here are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a b@@ us sh@@ el@@ ter ."
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much f@@ un to talk about some stuff that happened in 19@@ 8@@ 6 and 19@@ 8@@ 7 , when a computer h@@ ack@@ er is brea@@ king into our systems over at L@@ a@@ wr@@ ence B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ ab@@ s ."
"And I cau@@ ght the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the So@@ vi@@ et K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ al@@ ing information and sel@@ ling it ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be f@@ un — but , 20 years later ..."
"I find computer sec@@ ur@@ ity , fran@@ k@@ ly , to be kind of bor@@ ing ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science ."
"The second time , it &apos;s engine@@ ering ."
"A third time , it &apos;s just being a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an ."
"I &apos;m a scienti@@ st . O@@ n@@ ce I do something , I do something else ."
"So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that ."
"N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvi@@ ous stat@@ ements from my first book , &quot; &quot; S@@ il@@ ic@@ on S@@ n@@ ake O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , no@@ r am I going to talk about why I believe compu@@ ters don &apos;t bel@@ ong in scho@@ ols ."
I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more compu@@ ters into scho@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"@@ G@@ et them out of scho@@ ols , and keep them out of scho@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the ar@@ gu@@ ment is so obvi@@ ous to any@@ one who &apos;s hun@@ g around a four@@ th gr@@ ade cl@@ ass@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
"H@@ av@@ ing said that , I out@@ lin@@ ed my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wr@@ ote on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m sup@@ posed to talk about the future , y@@ es ?"
"O@@ h , right . And my feeling is , as@@ king me to talk about the future is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gr@@ ay h@@ air , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future ."
"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technolo@@ g@@ ist , a scienti@@ st , a phys@@ ic@@ ist ."
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s wr@@ iting code .
"N@@ o , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten tea@@ cher ."
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten tea@@ cher , ask an experi@@ enc@@ ed one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another gener@@ ation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I su@@ sp@@ ect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ ert@@ ain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there ."
"But to me , things ar@@ en &apos;t the future ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally good at t@@ ext mess@@ ag@@ ing and spend a huge amount of on-@@ scre@@ en time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?"
"Ch@@ ange is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be f@@ un , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
I@@ s that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"@@ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the audience who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has z@@ er@@ o volu@@ me . And it &apos;s non-@@ ori@@ ent@@ able .
It has wonderful pro@@ per@@ ties .
"If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common ed@@ ge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of gl@@ ass ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a c@@ old . ) H@@ ow@@ ever , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course st@@ ands for design ."
"J@@ ust two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four dimen@@ sions it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to hold any flu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perf@@ ect@@ ly capable of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ ati@@ al dimen@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ ati@@ al dimen@@ sions , it can hold flu@@ ids ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about to@@ po@@ lo@@ gy with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ st@@ ead , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mo@@ m , who pass@@ ed away last sum@@ mer ."
"H@@ ad coll@@ ected photograp@@ h@@ s of me , as mo@@ thers will do ."
C@@ ould somebody put this guy up ?
"And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had coll@@ ected a picture of me , st@@ anding — well , sitting — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , in front of a b@@ unch of di@@ als ."
"And I looked at it , and said , oh my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o !"
"As a tech@@ n@@ ici@@ an , re@@ p@@ air@@ ing and ma@@ int@@ aining the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o . And w@@ ow !"
"W@@ ay back machine . And I said to myself , oh y@@ eah !"
And it sent me back .
"S@@ o@@ on after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me ."
This guy over here of course is me .
"This man is R@@ ob@@ ert M@@ oo@@ g , the invent@@ or of the M@@ oo@@ g syn@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ er , who pass@@ ed away this past Au@@ g@@ ust ."
"R@@ ob@@ ert M@@ oo@@ g was a gener@@ ous , kind person , extraordin@@ ar@@ ily comp@@ et@@ ent engine@@ er ."
"A mus@@ ici@@ an who took time from his life to te@@ ach me , a s@@ op@@ hom@@ o@@ re , a f@@ res@@ h@@ man at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o ."
"He &apos;d come up from Tr@@ um@@ ans@@ bur@@ g to te@@ ach me not just about the M@@ oo@@ g syn@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ er , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics at the time . This is 19@@ 6@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 ."
"We &apos;re stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics , I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do ."
D@@ on &apos;t get cau@@ ght up in electr@@ on@@ ic music if you &apos;re doing phys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; M@@ ent@@ or@@ ing me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
He wr@@ ote a let@@ ter of re@@ comm@@ end@@ ation for me to get into grad@@ u@@ ate school .
"In the back@@ ground , my b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle ."
I realiz@@ e that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
Bo@@ b M@@ oo@@ g came by and hau@@ led a whole pi@@ le of e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment to show Gre@@ g F@@ lin@@ t and I things about this .
"We s@@ at around talking about F@@ ou@@ ri@@ er transform@@ s , B@@ es@@ se@@ l func@@ tions , mod@@ ul@@ ation trans@@ f@@ er func@@ tions , stuff like this ."
Bo@@ b &apos;s pass@@ ing this past sum@@ mer has been a lo@@ ss to all of us .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s a mus@@ ici@@ an has been prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly influ@@ enc@@ ed by R@@ ob@@ ert M@@ oo@@ g .
"( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recogni@@ ze that there &apos;s a dist@@ or@@ ted s@@ ine w@@ ave , almost a tri@@ ang@@ ular w@@ ave u@@ pon this H@@ e@@ w@@ let@@ t-@@ P@@ ack@@ ard o@@ sc@@ il@@ lo@@ sc@@ ope ."
"O@@ h , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?"
K@@ ids . K@@ ids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that o@@ kay ?
"It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about ."
"I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head ."
So I think loc@@ ally and I act loc@@ ally .
"I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very loc@@ ally ."
"So Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . this , and de@@ gre@@ e there , and the y@@ ad@@ d@@ a y@@ ad@@ d@@ a ."
I was talking about this stuff to some scho@@ ol@@ tea@@ chers about a year ago .
"And one of them , s@@ ever@@ al of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t tea@@ ching ? &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve t@@ au@@ ght grad@@ u@@ ate — I &apos;ve had grad@@ u@@ ate students , I &apos;ve t@@ au@@ ght under@@ grad@@ u@@ ate clas@@ ses . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front l@@ ines ?"
P@@ ut your money where you mou@@ th is . &quot; &quot; I@@ s true . I@@ s true . I te@@ ach ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gr@@ ade science four days a week .
N@@ ot just sho@@ wing up every now and then .
"N@@ o , no , no , no , no . I take attend@@ ance ."
"I take l@@ unch h@@ our . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not cl@@ ap@@ s ."
I str@@ ong@@ ly sugg@@ est that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
N@@ ot just show up to clas@@ s every now and then .
"T@@ each a so@@ li@@ d week . Okay , I &apos;m tea@@ ching thre@@ e-@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters time , but good enough ."
"One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I &apos;m going to te@@ ach you colle@@ ge@@ -@@ level phys@@ ics ."
"N@@ o calcul@@ us , I &apos;ll cut out that ."
You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
"But you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gr@@ ade al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , and we &apos;re going to do ser@@ ious experim@@ ents ."
N@@ one of this op@@ en-@@ to-@@ ch@@ ap@@ ter@@ -@@ s@@ ev@@ en-@@ and@@ -@@ do@@ -@@ all@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ o@@ dd@@ -@@ probl@@ em@@ -@@ se@@ ts .
We &apos;re going to be doing gen@@ u@@ ine phys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my clas@@ s — this is through the l@@ ens , and one of the things we used a l@@ ens for was to mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up o@@ sc@@ il@@ lo@@ sc@@ ope — mea@@ su@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many ei@@ gh@@ th grad@@ ers do you know of who have mea@@ su@@ red the spe@@ ed of light ?
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , we &apos;ve mea@@ su@@ red the spe@@ ed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to im@@ pose u@@ pon the po@@ w@@ ers that be , and mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !"
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light !"
"But me@@ an@@ while , let &apos;s mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound !"
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the e@@ ch@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of light using the w@@ ave equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the w@@ ave equ@@ ation is the fre@@ qu@@ ency times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of any w@@ ave ...
"@@ is a const@@ ant . Wh@@ en the fre@@ qu@@ ency goes up , the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th goes up , fre@@ qu@@ ency goes down . So , if we have a w@@ ave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the p@@ it@@ ch goes up , things get clo@@ ser , p@@ it@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out ."
Right ? This is simple phys@@ ics .
"A@@ ll of you know this from ei@@ gh@@ th gr@@ ade , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in phys@@ ics — in ei@@ gh@@ th@@ -@@ gr@@ ade phys@@ ics — but they should have , and I w@@ ish they had , was that if you multi@@ pl@@ y the fre@@ qu@@ ency times the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a const@@ ant ."
And that const@@ ant is the spe@@ ed of sound .
"So , in order to mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its fre@@ qu@@ ency . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a fre@@ qu@@ ency coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , abo@@ ve A , abo@@ ve A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
"Now , so I know the fre@@ qu@@ ency ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z . I mea@@ sure its w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th .
"A@@ ll I need now is to f@@ li@@ p on another b@@ ea@@ m , and the bot@@ tom b@@ ea@@ m is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll no@@ tice the spir@@ al ."
"The s@@ lin@@ ky mo@@ ves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the w@@ ave , coming out this way ."
"Th@@ ose of you who are phys@@ ic@@ ists , I hear you ro@@ l@@ ling your eyes , but b@@ ear with me . ( Laughter ) T@@ o mea@@ sure the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th , all I need to do is mea@@ sure the dist@@ ance from here — one full w@@ ave — over to here ."
F@@ ro@@ m here to here is the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound .
"So , I &apos;ll put a mea@@ sur@@ ing t@@ ape here , mea@@ sur@@ ing t@@ ape here , move it back over to here ."
I &apos;ve mo@@ ved the micro@@ phone 20 c@@ enti@@ met@@ ers .
"@@ 0@@ .@@ 2 met@@ ers from here , back to here , 20 c@@ enti@@ met@@ ers ."
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go back to M@@ r@@ . E@@ l@@ m@@ o ."
"And we &apos;ll say the fre@@ qu@@ ency is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 1@@ 7@@ 60 ."
The w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 met@@ ers .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 met@@ ers per second .
"If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 ."
"But , here with k@@ lu@@ d@@ gy material , and l@@ ous@@ y dr@@ ink — we &apos;ve been able to mea@@ sure the spe@@ ed of sound to — not bad . P@@ ret@@ ty good ."
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
G@@ o back to this picture of me a million years ago .
"It was 19@@ 7@@ 1 , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying phys@@ ics : L@@ and@@ au , Li@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , R@@ es@@ n@@ ick and H@@ al@@ li@@ day ."
I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ ter@@ m . A ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ p@@ us .
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot ! H@@ ey , E@@ l@@ m@@ o &apos;s done : off ."
"There &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on cam@@ p@@ us , and the police are ch@@ as@@ ing me , right ?"
"I &apos;m wal@@ king across cam@@ p@@ us . Co@@ p comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a stu@@ dent . &quot;"
P@@ ul@@ ls out a g@@ un . G@@ o@@ es bo@@ om !
And a t@@ ear g@@ as can@@ ister the size of a P@@ ep@@ si can goes by my head . Wh@@ o@@ os@@ h !
I get a bre@@ ath of t@@ ear g@@ as and I can &apos;t brea@@ the .
This co@@ p comes after me with a ri@@ f@@ le .
He w@@ ants to cl@@ un@@ k me over the head !
"I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go run@@ ning across cam@@ p@@ us qu@@ ick as I can . I duc@@ k into H@@ ay@@ es H@@ all ."
It &apos;s one of these b@@ ell@@ -@@ to@@ wer buil@@ dings .
The co@@ p &apos;s ch@@ as@@ ing me .
"Ch@@ as@@ ing me up the first flo@@ or , second flo@@ or , third flo@@ or ."
Ch@@ as@@ es me into this room .
The entr@@ an@@ ce@@ way to the b@@ ell to@@ wer .
"I sl@@ am the do@@ or behind me , clim@@ b up , go past this place where I see a pend@@ ul@@ um tic@@ king ."
"And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh y@@ eah , the squ@@ are ro@@ ot of the l@@ eng@@ th is pro@@ por@@ tional to its per@@ i@@ od . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep clim@@ b@@ ing up , go back ."
I go to a place where a do@@ w@@ el s@@ pl@@ its off .
"There &apos;s a c@@ loc@@ k , c@@ loc@@ k , c@@ loc@@ k , c@@ loc@@ k ."
The time &apos;s going back@@ wards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ or@@ en@@ z contr@@ actions and E@@ inst@@ e@@ in@@ ian rel@@ ativ@@ ity .
"I clim@@ b up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you clim@@ b up this w@@ oo@@ den l@@ ad@@ der ."
"I po@@ p up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ po@@ la ."
"A d@@ ome , one of these ten@@ -@@ fo@@ ot dom@@ es ."
"I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cop@@ s bas@@ h@@ ing students &apos; hea@@ ds , sho@@ ot@@ ing t@@ ear g@@ as , and wat@@ ching students thro@@ wing br@@ ic@@ ks ."
"And I &apos;m as@@ king , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Th@@ en I remember what my Engl@@ ish tea@@ cher in high school said ."
"N@@ am@@ ely , that when they c@@ ast bel@@ ls , they wr@@ ite ins@@ cri@@ p@@ tions on them ."
"So , I wi@@ pe the p@@ ig@@ e@@ on man@@ ure off one of the bel@@ ls , and I look at it ."
"I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words ins@@ cri@@ bed u@@ pon the H@@ ay@@ es H@@ all to@@ wer bel@@ ls : &quot; &quot; All tru@@ th is one ."
"In this light , may science and religion end@@ e@@ av@@ or here for the st@@ ea@@ dy evol@@ ution of man@@ kind , from dar@@ k@@ ness to light , from n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ness to bro@@ ad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , from pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance ."
"It is the vo@@ ice of life , which call@@ s us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much ."
"So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws , and they were loc@@ ked ti@@ ght ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neuro@@ scienti@@ st by tr@@ aining and I know a little bit about how the brain per@@ form@@ s under str@@ ess ."
"It re@@ le@@ as@@ es cor@@ ti@@ sol that rai@@ ses your heart r@@ ate , it mod@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine lev@@ els and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"I was having din@@ ner with my colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ ann@@ y K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an , the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what emb@@ arr@@ as@@ se@@ d@@ ly told him about having bro@@ ken my win@@ do@@ w , and , you know , for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten my pass@@ port , and D@@ ann@@ y shar@@ ed with me that he &apos;d been pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing something called pro@@ spec@@ tive h@@ ind@@ si@@ ght ."
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ ann@@ y expl@@ ained , you look a@@ head and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to pre@@ vent those things from happening , or to min@@ im@@ ize the dam@@ age ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ r@@ ound the home , design@@ ate a place for things that are eas@@ ily lost ."
"Now , this sou@@ nds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ ati@@ al mem@@ ory works ."
"There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us , that evol@@ ved over t@@ ens of thousands of years , to keep tr@@ ack of the loc@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that st@@ and of fr@@ u@@ it tre@@ es , where the fri@@ end@@ ly and en@@ em@@ y tri@@ bes live ."
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us is the part of the brain that in L@@ on@@ don ta@@ x@@ ic@@ a@@ b dri@@ vers be@@ comes en@@ larg@@ ed .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allo@@ ws squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their nu@@ ts .
"They wer@@ en &apos;t using sm@@ ell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely evol@@ ved me@@ chan@@ ism in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we lo@@ se car ke@@ ys and read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses and pass@@ ports .
"So in the home , design@@ ate a spo@@ t for your ke@@ ys — a ho@@ ok by the do@@ or , maybe a dec@@ or@@ ative bo@@ w@@ l ."
"For your pass@@ port , a particular dra@@ wer ."
"For your read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses , a particular table ."
"If you design@@ ate a spo@@ t and you &apos;re s@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about trav@@ el ?
"T@@ ake a cell phone picture of your cre@@ dit car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se , your pass@@ port , m@@ ail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cl@@ oud ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"R@@ em@@ ember , when you &apos;re under str@@ ess , the brain re@@ le@@ as@@ es cor@@ ti@@ sol ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ sol is to@@ x@@ ic , and it cau@@ ses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the pr@@ acti@@ ce of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recogni@@ ze that under str@@ ess you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place ."
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important dec@@ ision about the future of our medic@@ al care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a dec@@ ision ."
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medic@@ al condi@@ tion .
"So sup@@ pose you go to your doc@@ tor and the doc@@ tor says , &quot; I just got your la@@ b work back , your ch@@ ol@@ es@@ ter@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that high ch@@ ol@@ es@@ ter@@ ol is associ@@ ated with an increas@@ ed risk of car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar disease , heart att@@ ack , str@@ o@@ ke ."
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a dru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ g@@ ery or any medic@@ al pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re before one person is hel@@ ped .
We hav@@ en &apos;t figu@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most w@@ id@@ ely pres@@ cri@@ bed st@@ ati@@ n , what do you sup@@ pose it is ?"
I ran through the numbers myself .
"So for this particular dru@@ g , the side eff@@ ects occu@@ r in five percent of the patients ."
You &apos;re 15 times more lik@@ ely to be har@@ m@@ ed by the dru@@ g than you are to be hel@@ ped by the dru@@ g .
"Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pul@@ led this number out of the air for sh@@ oc@@ k value , but in fact it &apos;s rather ty@@ p@@ ical , this number needed to tre@@ at ."
"For the most w@@ id@@ ely per@@ form@@ ed sur@@ g@@ ery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the pro@@ state for cancer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ ped ."
And the side eff@@ ects in that case occu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
"They inclu@@ de im@@ po@@ t@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le dy@@ s@@ func@@ tion , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ t@@ al t@@ ear@@ ing , f@@ ec@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ ky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
So the idea of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think a@@ head of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will p@@ ush the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the spo@@ t .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
There &apos;s an evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , one of the things that goes out the win@@ do@@ w during those times of str@@ ess is r@@ ational , log@@ ical thinking , as D@@ ann@@ y K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an and his colle@@ ag@@ ues have sh@@ own ."
So we need to train ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ z@@ ing that all of us are fl@@ aw@@ ed .
We all are going to fai@@ l now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fai@@ lu@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help min@@ im@@ ize the dam@@ age , or to pre@@ vent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"@@ G@@ etting back to that s@@ no@@ w@@ y night in Mon@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my contr@@ act@@ or inst@@ all a combin@@ ation loc@@ k next to the do@@ or , with a key to the front do@@ or in it , an easy to remember combin@@ ation ."
"And I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I still have pi@@ les of m@@ ail that hav@@ en &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and pi@@ les of em@@ ails that I hav@@ en &apos;t gone through ."
Thank you very much .

"He looked at me str@@ ang@@ ely , thinking that he mis@@ heard ."
"&quot; &quot; Com@@ e , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the w@@ ai@@ ter ."
How could she spea@@ k that way ?
"A@@ t that moment , I started thinking ."
I &apos;m den@@ i@@ ed the right to spea@@ k my own language in my own country ?
How did we get here ?
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , int@@ ell@@ ect and all my mem@@ ories ?"
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , just to con@@ form ?"
"D@@ esp@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him ."
"So , when he started wr@@ iting in Engl@@ ish , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
This is a reality that developed soci@@ e@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
"The G@@ er@@ m@@ ans , F@@ ren@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Chin@@ ese , all these n@@ ations are aw@@ are of this ."
"That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to dev@@ el@@ op it ."
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produc@@ t .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ sum@@ ers , c@@ lu@@ el@@ ess con@@ sum@@ ers , like we are most of the time ."
"L@@ ang@@ u@@ age isn &apos;t just for convers@@ ing , just words coming out of our mou@@ ths ."
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ re@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , in@@ depend@@ ence ( Engl@@ ish ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you li@@ ved through the per@@ i@@ od of the fre@@ e@@ dom ( Engl@@ ish ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ ain ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a spec@@ ifi@@ c thing .
I have a fr@@ anc@@ oph@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ried to a F@@ ren@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"S@@ u@@ st@@ ain@@ ability repres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is cau@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my din@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I impact them .
I want to know how they impact me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they re@@ ly on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
Un@@ der@@ st@@ anding all of this en@@ ables us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of s@@ ea@@ food away from a com@@ mod@@ ity to an opportunity to res@@ to@@ re our ec@@ o@@ system .
It allo@@ ws for us to cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the s@@ ea@@ food that we &apos;re also so for@@ tun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it rest@@ or@@ ative s@@ ea@@ food .
"Wh@@ ere sust@@ ain@@ ability is the capac@@ ity to end@@ ure and ma@@ int@@ ain , rest@@ or@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and progr@@ ess ."
"R@@ est@@ or@@ ative s@@ ea@@ food allo@@ ws for an evol@@ ving and dy@@ nam@@ ic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a res@@ our@@ ce , sugg@@ es@@ ting that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to encour@@ age its res@@ ili@@ ency ."
"It is a more hop@@ e@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more us@@ e@@ ful way of understanding our environment ."
W@@ all@@ et gu@@ i@@ des — stand@@ ard issue by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very hand@@ y ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"@@ Gre@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red l@@ ists &#91; of &#93; s@@ ea@@ food species ."
"The associ@@ ation is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green l@@ ist ."
We can &apos;t sust@@ ain this without the mea@@ sure of our succ@@ ess really changing the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green l@@ ist ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le-@@ cau@@ ght y@@ el@@ low@@ fin tun@@ a here — comes from sust@@ ain@@ able st@@ oc@@ ks .
P@@ ole cau@@ ght — no b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for f@@ ish@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . Su@@ p@@ port@@ ing local econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a lion of the se@@ a . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the cont@@ ext of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a st@@ ea@@ k@@ house to a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
D@@ o I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green l@@ ist , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fav@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a cont@@ ext , a gau@@ ge for our actions in all this ."
Ex@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ants and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ ink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prot@@ ein problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ity when it regar@@ ds our food , and we are p@@ aying a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost bene@@ ath the w@@ aves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social accep@@ t@@ ance of exp@@ anding w@@ ai@@ st@@ l@@ ines .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ st@@ er prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of rest@@ or@@ ative s@@ ea@@ food is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"R@@ est@@ or@@ ative s@@ ea@@ food might best be repres@@ ented not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ p@@ per , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s f@@ ish@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ eg@@ et@@ ables : they might yet s@@ ave the oce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a li@@ kes to say that bl@@ ue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to resp@@ ect@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new bl@@ ue .
"We must continue to e@@ at the best s@@ ea@@ food possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ g@@ et@@ ables .
The best part about rest@@ or@@ ative s@@ ea@@ food though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and l@@ em@@ on we@@ d@@ ges .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of til@@ ap@@ ia bre@@ ad@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mu@@ st@@ ard and cr@@ is@@ p@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed bre@@ ad@@ cr@@ um@@ b@@ s and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of p@@ ec@@ an qu@@ in@@ o@@ a pil@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ ill@@ ed bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mo@@ ky on the outside with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i fl@@ ake ."
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an easy s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are av@@ ail@@ able to every family at the neigh@@ bor@@ hood W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ ie O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ning to s@@ ave America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ning to s@@ ave the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a pat@@ tern here .
F@@ or@@ get nuc@@ l@@ ear ho@@ loc@@ au@@ st ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have r@@ av@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ c@@ ed to h@@ an@@ dic@@ a@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we exp@@ ect from our food .
Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability is compl@@ ic@@ ated but din@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of mo@@ vement rec@@ ently in gre@@ en@@ ing our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are lea@@ ding pas@@ si@@ on@@ ately the green food D@@ el@@ ici@@ ous R@@ evol@@ ution .
But green fo@@ o@@ ds often repres@@ ent a way for us to dis@@ regar@@ d the respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity as e@@ at@@ ers .
J@@ ust because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ regar@@ d on the pl@@ ate .
We have ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy din@@ ner is a very important part of rest@@ or@@ ative s@@ ea@@ food .
"Wh@@ ile we try to man@@ age dec@@ lin@@ ing mar@@ ine popul@@ ations , the media &apos;s re@@ comm@@ ending increas@@ ed con@@ sum@@ ption of s@@ ea@@ food ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that t@@ ens of thousands of American grand@@ mo@@ thers , grand@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more s@@ ea@@ food ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not w@@ ill@@ ing to pas@@ s up .
But it &apos;s not all about the s@@ ea@@ food .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"As a che@@ f , I realiz@@ e the eas@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ du@@ ce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ eople started bu@@ ying ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers and sal@@ a@@ ds , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the entre@@ es alone ."
"P@@ eople spent more time engag@@ ing in their me@@ als , engag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ eople got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prot@@ ein ."
They got more cal@@ ories over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fi@@ ed me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ ier . I made more money .
This is great .
"En@@ vir@@ on@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was serv@@ ed with every pl@@ ate , but it was serv@@ ed with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interes@@ ts at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ f@@ y the species that we serv@@ ed — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vies , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common ."
"S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , oy@@ st@@ ers , cl@@ ams , til@@ ap@@ ia , ch@@ ar — these were the common species ."
"We were direc@@ ting t@@ as@@ tes to@@ wards more res@@ ili@@ ence , more rest@@ or@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fav@@ or .
This is what the green l@@ ist says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to res@@ to@@ re our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able species , that green l@@ ist tun@@ a that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ pe for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
St@@ art with a 1@@ 6@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ g@@ et@@ ables and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ un@@ dy you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ate the opportunity you have to e@@ at this .
"In@@ vite your friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I exp@@ ect a lot from food .
I exp@@ ect health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I exp@@ ect that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing dis@@ h@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the communi@@ on of human interes@@ ts ."
I was l@@ uc@@ ky enough that my father was a fantas@@ tic co@@ ok .
And he t@@ au@@ ght me very early on about the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge that e@@ ating repres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ hood .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prot@@ ein serv@@ ed with cop@@ ious quanti@@ ties of ve@@ g@@ et@@ ables and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , usu@@ ally ri@@ ce ."
This is still how I larg@@ ely e@@ at today .
I get s@@ ick when I go to st@@ ea@@ k@@ hou@@ ses .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prot@@ ein .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing .
"But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ for@@ tun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ g@@ et@@ ables .
It &apos;s pretty str@@ ai@@ gh@@ t@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ t@@ ter and sal@@ t and sex@@ y things that make things t@@ as@@ te less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ cip@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fl@@ ect to my own pers@@ onal hist@@ ories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global impact .
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to min@@ im@@ ize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our bl@@ ue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our res@@ ources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ y of the communi@@ on we call din@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate , we can beg@@ in to res@@ to@@ re ."
We need to sav@@ or ve@@ g@@ et@@ ables .
We need to sav@@ or sm@@ aller por@@ tions of s@@ ea@@ food .
And we need to s@@ ave din@@ ner .
Thank you .

This is the first tem@@ por@@ ary building made out of pap@@ er .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ bes , di@@ am@@ eter 5@@ 5 &#91; c@@ enti@@ met@@ ers &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ bes with a di@@ am@@ eter of 1@@ 20 c@@ enti@@ met@@ ers , or four feet , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the photo , inside is the to@@ il@@ et ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ ished with to@@ il@@ et pap@@ er , you can t@@ ear off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very us@@ e@@ ful ."
"@@ Y@@ ear 2@@ 000 , there was a big exp@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the them@@ e of the exp@@ o was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was cho@@ s@@ en to build the p@@ av@@ il@@ ion out of pap@@ er tu@@ bes , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able pap@@ er ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s complet@@ ed .
"My go@@ al was when the building was dem@@ ol@@ ished , because each country makes a lot of p@@ av@@ il@@ ions but after half a year , we create a lot of industri@@ al was@@ te , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very l@@ uc@@ ky to win the com@@ peti@@ tion to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ enter in Fr@@ ance in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an off@@ ice in Par@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t aff@@ or@@ d it , so I decided to bring my students to Par@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ enter in Par@@ is by ourselves ."
So we brought the pap@@ er tu@@ bes and the w@@ oo@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ met@@ er@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We st@@ ay@@ ed there for six years without p@@ aying any rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a tic@@ k@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I complet@@ ed the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou C@@ enter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very popul@@ ar mus@@ eu@@ m now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my prof@@ ession as an archit@@ ect , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed people , r@@ ich people , government , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ visible .
So they h@@ ire us to visu@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al architecture .
"That is our prof@@ ession , even hist@@ or@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their hou@@ ses by natural dis@@ as@@ ters ."
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes never k@@ ill people , but coll@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ dings k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity of archit@@ ects .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ por@@ ary hou@@ sing , but there are no archit@@ ects working there because we are too bus@@ y working for priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed people ."
"So I thought , even as archit@@ ects , we can be invol@@ ved in the re@@ construction of tem@@ por@@ ary hou@@ sing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in dis@@ as@@ ter areas .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big dis@@ as@@ ter in R@@ w@@ and@@ a , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ bes , H@@ u@@ tu and T@@ u@@ t@@ si , f@@ ought each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so sur@@ pris@@ ed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so poor , and they are fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing with blan@@ k@@ ets during the r@@ ain@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a plas@@ tic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to cut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people cut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ for@@ est@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ pes , al@@ um@@ in@@ um b@@ arr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ ery ex@@ pen@@ sive , they thro@@ w them out for money , then cu@@ tting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to impro@@ ve the situation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed pap@@ er tu@@ bes because this is so ch@@ ea@@ p and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.S. dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the dur@@ ability and mo@@ is@@ ture and ter@@ m@@ ites , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were kill@@ ed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ t , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fi@@ re after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es suff@@ ering and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ tho@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was tot@@ ally des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ es@@ ts , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of pap@@ er tu@@ bes ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you cr@@ az@@ y ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fi@@ re , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ st@@ ed me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started comm@@ u@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people ."
They were living like this with very poor plas@@ tic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I rais@@ ed — did fun@@ d@@ rais@@ ing .
"I made a pap@@ er tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to dem@@ ol@@ ish , I used be@@ er cr@@ ates as a f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ pose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their plas@@ tic be@@ er cr@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the colo@@ r of the pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
The colo@@ r co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were exp@@ ec@@ ting to have a be@@ er inside the plas@@ tic be@@ er cr@@ ate , but it came emp@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ st@@ ed me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you coll@@ ect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it st@@ ay@@ ed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to don@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we sent them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It st@@ ay@@ ed there in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ por@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in pap@@ er can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ por@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local material to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a , after the Su@@ ma@@ tr@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , I re@@ built Is@@ lam@@ ic f@@ ish@@ er@@ men &apos;s vill@@ ages ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ du , S@@ i@@ ch@@ u@@ an area in China , ne@@ arly 7@@ 0,000 people were kill@@ ed , and also esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally many of the scho@@ ols were des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed because of the cor@@ ru@@ ption between the auth@@ or@@ ity and the contr@@ act@@ or ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I brought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chin@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we complet@@ ed n@@ ine cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ oms , over 500 squ@@ are met@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the cur@@ rent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting photo : form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ ister ever year ."
"And they are very kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ por@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fam@@ ous for music and all the concer@@ t h@@ all@@ s were des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed , so mus@@ ici@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very l@@ uc@@ ky ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i brought G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our form@@ er pri@@ me min@@ ister came , so they hel@@ ped us to coll@@ ect money , and I got half a million eu@@ ro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Y@@ ear 20@@ 10 in H@@ ai@@ ti , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , n@@ ex@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ ai@@ ti with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local pap@@ er tu@@ bes ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a gy@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no priv@@ acy .
P@@ eople suff@@ er ment@@ ally and phys@@ ically .
"So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the stu@@ dent vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with pap@@ er tu@@ bes , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fr@@ ame and the cur@@ t@@ ain ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , some of the fac@@ il@@ ity auth@@ or@@ ity doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really nec@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at area to build stand@@ ard government sing@@ le-@@ story hou@@ sing like this one .
"L@@ o@@ ok at this . E@@ ven civi@@ l government is doing such poor construction of the tem@@ por@@ ary hou@@ sing , so den@@ se and so mess@@ y because there is no st@@ or@@ age , nothing , water is lea@@ king , so I thought , we have to make multi@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very com@@ for@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or while I was making parti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very ni@@ ce may@@ or in O@@ n@@ ag@@ aw@@ a village in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build thre@@ e-@@ story hou@@ sing on bas@@ e@@ ball &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ p@@ ping cont@@ ain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building fur@@ n@@ iture to make them com@@ for@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more com@@ for@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Chr@@ ist@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ bout 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also kill@@ ed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al of the city , the sym@@ bo@@ l of Chr@@ ist@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was tot@@ ally des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
So this is under construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ uments that are bel@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this bab@@ y &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding psycho@@ log@@ ists , would have said that this bab@@ y was ir@@ r@@ ational , il@@ log@@ ical , e@@ go@@ cen@@ tri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and eff@@ ect ."
"In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this bab@@ y &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most br@@ illi@@ ant scientists ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this bab@@ y could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ d@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling ."
And maybe the har@@ d@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s fol@@ lowed poli@@ tics can t@@ esti@@ f@@ y to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really prof@@ ound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ous@@ ness mon@@ olo@@ gue about po@@ ni@@ es and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of del@@ ici@@ ous g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ack@@ ers ."
"Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ ley , like the cr@@ ack@@ ers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little t@@ as@@ te of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ack@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a bab@@ y and any other san@@ e person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I t@@ as@@ ted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ack@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k , cr@@ ack@@ ers ."
"I t@@ as@@ ted the cr@@ ack@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uc@@ k . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the bab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the bab@@ y give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?"
"And the re@@ mark@@ able thing was that 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies , just bar@@ ely wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cr@@ ack@@ ers if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ack@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"On the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ack@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mark@@ able things about this .
"The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies have already disco@@ vered this really prof@@ ound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mark@@ ab@@ ly though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this sugg@@ es@@ ts that these 18 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this de@@ ep , prof@@ ound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually dem@@ on@@ str@@ ated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a sh@@ ort time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies super@@ fici@@ ally , they se@@ em pretty us@@ el@@ ess ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than us@@ el@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ e@@ ping them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to evol@@ ution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ el@@ ess bab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us prim@@ ates , but also inclu@@ ding other mam@@ m@@ als , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ ang@@ ar@@ o@@ os and w@@ omb@@ ats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ hood a species has and how big their br@@ ains are compar@@ ed to their bo@@ dies and how smar@@ t and fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
On one side is a New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w .
"And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ d@@ a@@ e , r@@ av@@ ens , ro@@ o@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly smar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as smar@@ t as ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ e@@ es in some resp@@ ects .
And this is a bir@@ d on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
"On the other hand , we have our friend the dom@@ es@@ tic ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as d@@ um@@ b as d@@ um@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at p@@ ec@@ king for gr@@ ain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the bab@@ ies , the New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w bab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They de@@ pen@@ d on their mom@@ s to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open mou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bir@@ d ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually mat@@ ure within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ hood is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the sou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ hood that seems to be conn@@ ected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the ch@@ ic@@ ken , se@@ em to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well ."
So they se@@ em to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to p@@ ec@@ king gr@@ ain in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ atures , like the cro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re ext@@ rem@@ ely good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the distribu@@ tion like the cro@@ ws ."
We have bigg@@ er br@@ ains rel@@ ative to our bo@@ dies by far than any other animal .
"We &apos;re smar@@ ter , we &apos;re more fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we sur@@ vi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we mi@@ gr@@ ated to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our bab@@ ies and children are depend@@ ent on us for much longer than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still po@@ p@@ ping those wor@@ ms into those little open mou@@ ths ."
"A@@ ll right , why would we see this cor@@ relation ?"
"Well an idea is that that strat@@ e@@ gy , that learning strat@@ e@@ gy , is an ext@@ rem@@ ely powerful , great strat@@ e@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ adv@@ antage ."
"And that one big dis@@ adv@@ antage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the mas@@ to@@ don ch@@ arg@@ ing at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ sho@@ t or maybe a sp@@ ear might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the mas@@ to@@ d@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evol@@ u@@ tions seems to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early per@@ i@@ od when we &apos;re completely prot@@ ected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as adul@@ ts , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develop@@ ment di@@ vision of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prot@@ ected bl@@ ue sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and mark@@ eting ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like def@@ ec@@ tive grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies — excep@@ t that they &apos;re actually the br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the gard@@ en and explor@@ ing , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our n@@ ar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , adul@@ t pat@@ h ."
"If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are design@@ ed to learn — and this evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might exp@@ ect that they would have really powerful learning me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the bab@@ y &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet ."
But real compu@@ ters are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a re@@ volution in our understanding of machine learning rec@@ ently .
"And it all depend@@ s on the ideas of this guy , the R@@ ever@@ end Th@@ om@@ as B@@ ay@@ es , who was a st@@ ati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and ma@@ them@@ ati@@ ci@@ an in the 18@@ th century ."
"And essenti@@ ally what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provi@@ de a ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al way using prob@@ ability the@@ ory to char@@ acter@@ ize , descri@@ be , the way that scientists find out about the world ."
So what scientists do is they have a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is that they think might be lik@@ ely to start with .
They go out and test it against the ev@@ id@@ ence .
The ev@@ id@@ ence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ ay@@ es sho@@ wed was a ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al way that you could do that .
And that ma@@ them@@ atic@@ s is at the core of the best machine learning program@@ s that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I sugg@@ es@@ ted that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is R@@ ever@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making compl@@ ic@@ ated calcul@@ ations with condi@@ tional prob@@ abil@@ ities that they &apos;re re@@ vis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
"A@@ ll right , now that might se@@ em like an even t@@ aller order to actually dem@@ on@@ str@@ ate ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about st@@ atis@@ tics , they look ext@@ rem@@ ely stu@@ pi@@ d ."
How could it be that children are doing st@@ atis@@ tics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ect@@ or .
This is a box that li@@ ghts up and pl@@ ays music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my la@@ b and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world ."
"L@@ et me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ma@@ r K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , my stu@@ dent ."
"If I sho@@ wed you this det@@ ect@@ or , you would be lik@@ ely to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the det@@ ect@@ or go would be to put a bloc@@ k on top of the det@@ ect@@ or ."
"But actually , this det@@ ect@@ or works in a bit of a str@@ ange way ."
"Because if you w@@ ave a bloc@@ k over the top of the det@@ ect@@ or , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the det@@ ect@@ or will actually activ@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the lik@@ ely thing , put the bloc@@ k on the det@@ ect@@ or , it will only activ@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is actually has str@@ ong@@ er ev@@ id@@ ence .
It looks as if the w@@ av@@ ing is a more effec@@ tive strat@@ e@@ gy than the other strat@@ e@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four year-@@ ol@@ ds this pat@@ tern of ev@@ id@@ ence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four year-@@ ol@@ ds used the ev@@ id@@ ence to w@@ ave the obj@@ ect on top of the det@@ ect@@ or ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite compl@@ ic@@ ated calcul@@ ations that will give them a condi@@ tional prob@@ ability mea@@ sure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that ev@@ id@@ ence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is about the world , that seems very un@@ lik@@ ely to beg@@ in with ."
"And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my la@@ b , simil@@ ar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four year-@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ lik@@ ely hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is than adul@@ ts are when we give them exactly the same t@@ ask ."
"So in these cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ances , the children are using st@@ atis@@ tics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
Wh@@ en children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; pl@@ aying . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a b@@ unch of interesting stu@@ dies rec@@ ently that have sh@@ own this pl@@ aying around is really a kind of experim@@ ent@@ al research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ r@@ ist@@ ine L@@ eg@@ are &apos;s la@@ b .
What C@@ r@@ ist@@ ine did was use our B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ect@@ ors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she sho@@ wed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) Bo@@ y : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ lis@@ on G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is has just been f@@ al@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ent@@ al not@@ e@@ book out ."
Bo@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will recogni@@ ze that ex@@ pression of des@@ p@@ air .
"( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : Okay , hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is two ."
Bo@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ enter to do this , to try pu@@ tting it out on@@ to the other loc@@ ation ."
N@@ ot working either .
"B@@ o@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bot@@ tom of this box has electr@@ ic@@ ity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electr@@ ic@@ ity ."
"A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a four@@ th hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is ."
Bo@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is ."
"Now that is a particul@@ arly — that is a particul@@ arly ad@@ or@@ able and arti@@ cul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ r@@ ist@@ ine disco@@ vered is this is actually quite ty@@ p@@ ical ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to expl@@ ain something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty ty@@ p@@ ical of four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who can test five hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ es in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those psycho@@ log@@ ists and phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were bar@@ ely consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as adul@@ ts .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adul@@ t consci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And adul@@ ts &apos; attention and consci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a spo@@ t@@ light .
"So what happens for adul@@ ts is we dec@@ ide that something &apos;s rel@@ ev@@ ant or important , we should pay attention to it ."
"O@@ ur consci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re attend@@ ing to be@@ comes ext@@ rem@@ ely b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dar@@ k ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we pay attention is that the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive part of our br@@ ains , s@@ ends a sign@@ al that makes a little part of our brain much more fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble , more plas@@ tic , better at learning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down activ@@ ity in all the rest of our br@@ ains ."
"So we have a very foc@@ used , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of attention ."
"If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think bab@@ ies and young children se@@ em to have more of a l@@ an@@ tern of consci@@ ous@@ ness than a spo@@ t@@ light of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sour@@ ces at once .
"And if you actually look in their br@@ ains , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and plas@@ tic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ory parts hav@@ en &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at p@@ aying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not p@@ aying attention ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might exp@@ ect from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who are design@@ ed to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a t@@ as@@ te of that kind of bab@@ y consci@@ ous@@ ness as adul@@ ts , I think the best thing is think about cas@@ es where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ous@@ ness contr@@ ac@@ ts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three days in Par@@ is se@@ em to be more full of consci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ attend@@ ing z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ ff@@ ee , that wonderful co@@ ff@@ ee you &apos;ve been dr@@ in@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ st@@ ai@@ rs , actually m@@ im@@ ics the eff@@ ect of those bab@@ y neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a bab@@ y ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Par@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three dou@@ b@@ le-@@ espr@@ ess@@ os .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantas@@ tic way to be , but it does ten@@ d to leave you w@@ a@@ king up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k in the morning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ aces and cro@@ ss the stre@@ et by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of eff@@ ort into making bab@@ ies think like adul@@ ts do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies , to have op@@ en-@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , imagin@@ ation , cre@@ ativ@@ ity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adul@@ ts to start thinking more like children ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ner .
And this is the name of my cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
"In No@@ v@@ ember of 200@@ 3 , I was inv@@ ited to take part in the l@@ aun@@ ch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ ela &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation — that is his H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ and@@ ela had when he was im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en Is@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ou@@ ss@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ stage , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the arti@@ sts were inv@@ ited to j@@ oin M@@ and@@ ela in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en Is@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s pr@@ ess , st@@ anding in front of his form@@ er pris@@ on cell ."
You can see the b@@ ars of the win@@ do@@ w there .
It was quite a mom@@ ent@@ ous oc@@ cas@@ ion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , M@@ and@@ ela told the world &apos;s pr@@ ess that there was a virtu@@ al gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that pos@@ t-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id R@@ ain@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thou@@ sand people were d@@ ying on a d@@ ai@@ ly bas@@ is and that the front line vic@@ ti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t realized that the H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S p@@ and@@ em@@ ic was direc@@ tly aff@@ ec@@ ting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left Sou@@ th Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ et@@ own , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ently I particip@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vie@@ ws , talking and using my plat@@ form as a mus@@ ici@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to M@@ and@@ ela — out of resp@@ ect for the t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ one in the world resp@@ ects N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ ela , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ ela ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in Sou@@ th Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ cid@@ ents of trans@@ mission of the virus ?"
"I think that if I went out into the stre@@ et now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sh@@ oc@@ ked ."
"I was very , very for@@ tun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ack@@ ie A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n , an incredible cam@@ pai@@ g@@ ner and acti@@ vis@@ t ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was w@@ ear@@ ing a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t like the one I w@@ ear now .
"This is a to@@ ol — this tel@@ ls you I am in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity with people who have H@@ I@@ V , people who are living with H@@ I@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the sti@@ g@@ ma , by w@@ ear@@ ing this t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a mem@@ ber of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n and I &apos;m very pr@@ oud to be a mem@@ ber of that incredible organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are H@@ I@@ V@@ -@@ positive ."
They work in the field .
They have t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living direc@@ tly with the eff@@ ects of the virus .
They have education program@@ s .
They bring out the issu@@ es of sti@@ g@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extraordin@@ ary what they do .
"And y@@ es , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n has sup@@ por@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n in the way that I have tried to rai@@ se aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess and to try to also rai@@ se fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fun@@ ding that I have man@@ ag@@ ed to rai@@ se has gone direc@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n and the incredible work that they do , and are still continu@@ ing to do in Sou@@ th Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pai@@ g@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
I &apos;ve trav@@ el@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"H@@ ere I am in O@@ sl@@ o in Nor@@ way , getting a ni@@ ce , f@@ at ch@@ ec@@ k ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to rai@@ se money ."
"In Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ bur@@ g , I had the opportunity to play to a main@@ ly white , midd@@ le-@@ clas@@ s Sou@@ th Afr@@ ican audience who ended up in t@@ ear@@ s because I use film cli@@ ps that really tou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this terri@@ ble tr@@ age@@ dy that is taking place , that people are tend@@ ing to av@@ o@@ id , because they are f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are ."
"A@@ ar@@ on M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the cur@@ rent health min@@ ister , attend@@ ed that concer@@ t and I had an opportunity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his absolu@@ te comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolu@@ tely nec@@ ess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ cot@@ tis@@ h Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ cot@@ land and H@@ I@@ V .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , rai@@ se aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ g@@ h with the wonderful Afr@@ ican Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Ch@@ oir who I simply ado@@ re ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being aff@@ ected by the A@@ I@@ D@@ S virus ."
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Mi@@ ch@@ el S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the direc@@ tor of U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very hon@@ o@@ red by the fact that Mi@@ ch@@ el inv@@ ited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ing my plat@@ form and bro@@ ad@@ en@@ ing my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The message that U@@ N@@ A@@ I@@ D@@ S are curr@@ ently s@@ ending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtu@@ al el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of the trans@@ mission of the virus from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very ambi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed with political will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant woman , who is H@@ I@@ V positive and we &apos;re s@@ mil@@ ing , both of us are s@@ mil@@ ing , because we &apos;re very confi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ext@@ ended to take care of the bab@@ y she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her bab@@ y will re@@ ce@@ ive P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that bab@@ y can be born free of the virus ."
Now that is pre@@ vention at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ vention with the A@@ I@@ D@@ S p@@ and@@ em@@ ic .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ v@@ eli@@ le ."
This is A@@ v@@ eli@@ le — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she repres@@ ents one of millions of H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ v@@ eli@@ le &apos;s mother had H@@ I@@ V virus — she died from A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ rel@@ ated ill@@ ness .
"A@@ v@@ eli@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus ."
"And here she is at seven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one year-@@ old bab@@ y ."
"A@@ t this point in her life , she &apos;s suff@@ ering with ful@@ l@@ -@@ blo@@ wn A@@ I@@ D@@ S and had p@@ neu@@ mon@@ ia ."
We met her in a hosp@@ ital in the E@@ as@@ tern C@@ ape and spent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very spec@@ ial nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hosp@@ ital — because we fil@@ m@@ ed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emo@@ tional en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feeling very res@@ on@@ ant with this direc@@ t experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ ive months later , we went back to Sou@@ th Africa to me@@ et A@@ v@@ eli@@ le again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the h@@ ai@@ rs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the h@@ ai@@ rs on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re st@@ anding up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transform@@ ation that took place .
Is@@ n &apos;t it extraordin@@ ary ?
( Applause ) That r@@ ound of appl@@ ause is actually for the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the hosp@@ ital who took care of A@@ v@@ eli@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate that kind of transform@@ ation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nu@@ tri@@ tion and good medic@@ al care , and you believe that the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ elop@@ ment G@@ o@@ als , spec@@ i@@ fic@@ ally five and six , should be absolu@@ tely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa — could you pl@@ ease st@@ and up ."
"I think that &apos;s fai@@ r to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old So@@ vi@@ et Uni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was sec@@ ret@@ ly moving a large obj@@ ect through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ ith it , they were hop@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ quer ou@@ ter space ."
The ro@@ ck@@ et was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its no@@ se was a sil@@ ver ball with two radi@@ os inside .
"On O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they l@@ aun@@ ched their ro@@ ck@@ et ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scientists wr@@ ote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ den days , explor@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o d@@ a G@@ ama and C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us had the good for@@ t@@ une to open up the ter@@ res@@ tri@@ al glo@@ be ."
Now we have the good for@@ t@@ une to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ v@@ y us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about complet@@ ed ."
"It tel@@ ls the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a resul@@ t ."
"For days after the l@@ aun@@ ch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful curi@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on visible by ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , it insp@@ i@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally l@@ aun@@ ched an obj@@ ect into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed Mon@@ day , the media and the poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our en@@ em@@ y had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now att@@ ack us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ omb@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ro@@ ck@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke loo@@ se .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sh@@ oc@@ ks to h@@ it America — hist@@ ori@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mis@@ si@@ le ga@@ p .
It explo@@ ded an ar@@ ms r@@ ace .
It began the space r@@ ace .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gr@@ ess fun@@ ded huge wea@@ pon@@ s increas@@ es , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 200 nuc@@ l@@ ear wea@@ pon@@ s to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ actions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ y@@ ond wea@@ pon@@ s increas@@ es .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ une 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vi@@ l De@@ f@@ en@@ se D@@ r@@ ill , where t@@ ens of millions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ all@@ up P@@ ol@@ l that sho@@ wed that seven in 10 Amer@@ ic@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a nuc@@ l@@ ear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be kill@@ ed ."
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k pro@@ vo@@ ked wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ up@@ port for engine@@ ering , mat@@ h and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f points out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , N@@ A@@ SA ."
My fe@@ ature doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary shows how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also shows how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad situation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"In clo@@ sing , I would like to take a moment to th@@ ank one of my inv@@ est@@ ors : long@@ time TE@@ D@@ st@@ er , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ ker ."
And I &apos;d like to th@@ ank you all .
( Applause ) .
"Th@@ ank you , Chr@@ is ."
"@@ G@@ ood morning . So mag@@ ic is an ex@@ cel@@ lent way for st@@ aying a@@ head of the reality cur@@ ve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tom@@ or@@ row ."
"As a cy@@ ber@@ -@@ mag@@ ici@@ an , I comb@@ ine el@@ ements of il@@ lu@@ sion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experi@@ enc@@ ed ."
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Pro@@ j@@ ect G@@ l@@ ass .

So these are my il@@ lu@@ sion gl@@ as@@ ses .
They &apos;re a little bigg@@ er . They &apos;re a prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
"And when you look through them , you get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se into the mind of the cy@@ ber@@ -@@ il@@ lu@@ si@@ on@@ ist ."

I &apos;ve been at M@@ I@@ T for 4@@ 4 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvi@@ ous .
"H@@ ave they all ag@@ re@@ ed ? No , not completely ."
"I have so much money , it takes me fore@@ ver ."
"I gre@@ w up in Bi@@ h@@ ar , India &apos;s po@@ or@@ est state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a car@@ t full of the most del@@ ici@@ ous s@@ we@@ ets at our do@@ or@@ step ."
"My bro@@ thers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home ."
"He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we cri@@ ed when that car@@ t with our hal@@ f-@@ e@@ at@@ en s@@ we@@ ets was pul@@ led away from us ."
"L@@ ater , I underst@@ ood why my father got so up@@ set ."
Th@@ ose s@@ we@@ ets were a bri@@ be from a contr@@ act@@ or who was trying to get my father to aw@@ ard him a government contr@@ act .
"My father was respon@@ sible for building ro@@ a@@ ds in Bi@@ h@@ ar , and he had developed a fir@@ m st@@ ance against cor@@ ru@@ ption , even though he was har@@ ass@@ ed and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ."
"H@@ is was a lon@@ ely stru@@ gg@@ le , because Bi@@ h@@ ar was also India &apos;s most cor@@ ru@@ pt state , where public off@@ ici@@ als were en@@ ri@@ ching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than ser@@ ving the poor who had no means to ex@@ pr@@ ess their ang@@ u@@ ish if their children had no food or no scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
And I experi@@ enc@@ ed this most vis@@ cer@@ ally when I trav@@ el@@ ed to rem@@ ote vill@@ ages to study po@@ ver@@ ty .
"And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was fam@@ ished and ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ed , and I was almost coll@@ ap@@ sing in a s@@ cor@@ ching he@@ at under a t@@ ree , and just at that time , one of the po@@ or@@ est men in that village inv@@ ited me into his h@@ ut and gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ously f@@ ed me ."
O@@ n@@ ly I later realized that what he f@@ ed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This prof@@ ound gi@@ ft of gener@@ os@@ ity chall@@ eng@@ ed and changed the very pur@@ pose of my life .
I res@@ ol@@ ved to give back .
"L@@ ater , I jo@@ in@@ ed the World B@@ ank , which sou@@ ght to fi@@ ght such po@@ ver@@ ty by trans@@ fer@@ r@@ ing aid from r@@ ich to poor countries ."
"My initi@@ al work foc@@ used on U@@ g@@ and@@ a , where I foc@@ used on ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating re@@ form@@ s with the F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ is@@ try of U@@ g@@ and@@ a so they could access our lo@@ ans ."
"But after we dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ed the lo@@ ans , I remember a tri@@ p in U@@ g@@ and@@ a where I found ne@@ w@@ ly built scho@@ ols without t@@ ext@@ books or tea@@ chers , new health clin@@ ics without dru@@ gs , and the poor once again without any vo@@ ice or re@@ course ."
It was Bi@@ h@@ ar all over again .
Bi@@ h@@ ar repres@@ ents the challenge of develop@@ ment : ab@@ j@@ ect po@@ ver@@ ty sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by cor@@ ru@@ ption .
"@@ G@@ lo@@ b@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ g@@ and@@ a repres@@ ents the tradi@@ tional appro@@ ach to these problems that has been pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ n@@ ers of World W@@ ar I@@ I , 500 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ ther@@ ed in New H@@ am@@ p@@ sh@@ ire , U@@ SA , to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish the B@@ ret@@ ton W@@ oo@@ ds institutions , inclu@@ ding the World B@@ ank ."
"And that tradi@@ tional appro@@ ach to develop@@ ment had three key el@@ ements . F@@ ir@@ st , trans@@ f@@ er of res@@ ources from r@@ ich countries in the Nor@@ th to po@@ orer countries in the Sou@@ th , ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by re@@ form pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions ."
"S@@ ec@@ ond , the develop@@ ment institutions that ch@@ ann@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers were op@@ aque , with little trans@@ par@@ ency of what they fin@@ anc@@ ed or what resul@@ ts they ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed ."
"And third , the engag@@ ement in develop@@ ing countries was with a n@@ ar@@ row set of government el@@ ites with little inter@@ action with the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , who are the ul@@ tim@@ ate bene@@ fici@@ ar@@ ies of develop@@ ment ass@@ ist@@ ance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , each of these el@@ ements is op@@ en@@ ing up du@@ e to dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c changes in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en knowledge , open aid , open govern@@ ance , and together , they repres@@ ent three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are transform@@ ing develop@@ ment and that also hold gre@@ ater hope for the problems I wit@@ n@@ essed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a and in Bi@@ h@@ ar ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open knowledge .
"You know , develop@@ ing countries today will not simply accep@@ t solutions that are hand@@ ed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World B@@ ank ."
"They get their inspir@@ ation , their hope , their pr@@ ac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from succ@@ ess@@ ful emer@@ g@@ ing econom@@ ies in the Sou@@ th ."
"They want to know how China li@@ f@@ ted 500 million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty in 30 years , how M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ d@@ ades program impro@@ ved scho@@ ol@@ ing and nu@@ tri@@ tion for millions of children ."
"This is the new ec@@ o@@ system of op@@ en-@@ knowledge flo@@ ws , not just trav@@ eling Nor@@ th to Sou@@ th , but Sou@@ th to Sou@@ th , and even Sou@@ th to Nor@@ th , with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ d@@ ades today inspir@@ ing New York C@@ ity ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to-@@ Sou@@ th trans@@ f@@ ers are op@@ en@@ ing up , so too are the develop@@ ment institutions that ch@@ ann@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
This is the second shi@@ ft : open aid .
"R@@ ec@@ ently , the World B@@ ank op@@ en@@ ed its v@@ au@@ l@@ t of data for public use , re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social in@@ dic@@ at@@ ors for 200 countries over 50 years , and it l@@ aun@@ ched a global com@@ peti@@ tion to cro@@ w@@ d@@ source innov@@ ative app@@ s using this data ."
D@@ ev@@ elop@@ ment institutions today are also op@@ en@@ ing for public s@@ cru@@ tiny the proj@@ ects they fin@@ ance .
"T@@ ake Ge@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ing . In this ma@@ p from Ken@@ y@@ a , the red d@@ ots show where all the scho@@ ols fin@@ anc@@ ed by don@@ ors are loc@@ ated , and the dar@@ ker the sh@@ ade of green , the more the number of ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ school children ."
"So this simple mas@@ h@@ up re@@ ve@@ als that don@@ ors have not fin@@ anc@@ ed any scho@@ ols in the areas with the most ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ vo@@ king new questions . I@@ s develop@@ ment ass@@ ist@@ ance t@@ arg@@ eting those who most need our help ?"
"In this man@@ ner , the World B@@ ank has now Ge@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ed 3@@ 0,000 project acti@@ vi@@ ties in 1@@ 4@@ 3 countries , and don@@ ors are using a common plat@@ form to ma@@ p all their proj@@ ects ."
This is a t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous lea@@ p forward in trans@@ par@@ ency and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability of aid .
"And this lea@@ ds me to the third , and in my view , the most signific@@ ant shi@@ ft in develop@@ ment : open govern@@ ance . G@@ o@@ vern@@ ments today are op@@ en@@ ing up just as ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are demand@@ ing vo@@ ice and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
"F@@ ro@@ m the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ n@@ a H@@ az@@ are mo@@ vement in India , using mo@@ bile phones and social media not just for political ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability but also for develop@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments deli@@ ver@@ ing services to the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens ?
"So for inst@@ ance , s@@ ever@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ as@@ tern Europe are op@@ en@@ ing their bu@@ d@@ gets to the public ."
"But , you know , there is a big difference between a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s public and a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble ."
"This is a public bu@@ d@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really acc@@ essi@@ ble or underst@@ and@@ able to an ordin@@ ary ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ ending its res@@ ources ."
"T@@ o t@@ ack@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new to@@ ols to visu@@ aliz@@ e the bu@@ d@@ get so it &apos;s more underst@@ and@@ able to the public ."
"In this ma@@ p from M@@ ol@@ do@@ va , the green colo@@ r shows those dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ ts that have low sp@@ ending on scho@@ ols but good e@@ duc@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red colo@@ r shows the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of ins@@ cru@@ table doc@@ uments into a public@@ ly underst@@ and@@ able visu@@ al , and what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that with this op@@ enn@@ ess , there are today new oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties for ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and eng@@ age with government ."
"So in the Ph@@ ili@@ p@@ p@@ ines today , parents and students can give re@@ al@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ site , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ my@@ scho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether tea@@ chers and t@@ ext@@ books are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ n@@ essed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a and in Bi@@ h@@ ar ."
"And the government is respon@@ sive . So for inst@@ ance , when it was re@@ por@@ ted on this we@@ b@@ site that 8@@ 00 students were at risk because school re@@ pai@@ rs had st@@ all@@ ed du@@ e to cor@@ ru@@ ption , the De@@ part@@ ment of E@@ ducation in the Ph@@ ili@@ p@@ p@@ ines took s@@ wi@@ ft action ."
"And you know what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that this innovation is now sp@@ read@@ ing Sou@@ th to Sou@@ th , from the Ph@@ ili@@ p@@ p@@ ines to In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , Ken@@ y@@ a , M@@ ol@@ do@@ va and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"In D@@ ar es S@@ al@@ a@@ am , T@@ anz@@ an@@ ia , even an im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished community was able to use these to@@ ols to vo@@ ice its as@@ pir@@ ations ."
"This is what the ma@@ p of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in Au@@ g@@ ust , 20@@ 11 . But within a few weeks , univers@@ ity students were able to use mo@@ bile phones and an op@@ en-@@ source plat@@ form to dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally ma@@ p the entire community infrastruc@@ ture ."
"And what is very exc@@ iting is that ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens were then able to give fe@@ ed@@ back as to which health or water points were not working , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated in the red bu@@ b@@ bles that you see , which together provi@@ des a graphi@@ c visu@@ al of the collec@@ tive vo@@ ices of the poor ."
"T@@ o@@ day , even Bi@@ h@@ ar is tur@@ ning around and op@@ en@@ ing up under a comm@@ it@@ ted lea@@ der@@ ship that is making government trans@@ par@@ ent , acc@@ essi@@ ble and respon@@ sive to the poor ."
"But , you know , in many parts of the world , govern@@ ments are not interested in op@@ en@@ ing up or in ser@@ ving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system ."
"These are the lon@@ ely w@@ arri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develop@@ ment work is to help these lon@@ ely w@@ arri@@ ors j@@ oin hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"So for inst@@ ance , today , in G@@ h@@ ana , cour@@ age@@ ous re@@ form@@ ers from civi@@ l society , Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent and government , have for@@ g@@ ed a co@@ ali@@ tion for trans@@ par@@ ent contr@@ ac@@ ts in the oil sec@@ tor , and , gal@@ v@@ an@@ iz@@ ed by this , re@@ form@@ ers in Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent are now investi@@ g@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous contr@@ ac@@ ts ."
"These exam@@ ples give new hope , new possibil@@ ity to the problems I wit@@ n@@ essed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in Bi@@ h@@ ar ."
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , on A@@ pr@@ il 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very l@@ ate at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ ping a 7@@ 0@@ -@@ page public inter@@ est li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation against cor@@ ru@@ ption in a ro@@ ad project ."
"Th@@ ough he was no la@@ w@@ y@@ er , he ar@@ gu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t h@@ im@@ self the next day . He won the r@@ ul@@ ing , but later that very even@@ ing , he f@@ ell , and he died ."
"He f@@ ought till the end , increas@@ ingly pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate that to comb@@ at cor@@ ru@@ ption and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government off@@ ici@@ als need to be hon@@ est , but ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens needed to j@@ oin together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"These became the two boo@@ k@@ ends of his life , and the jour@@ ney he trav@@ el@@ ed in between mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red the changing develop@@ ment land@@ s@@ cap@@ e ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m insp@@ i@@ red by these changes , and I &apos;m exc@@ ited that at the World B@@ ank , we are em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing these new direc@@ tions , a signific@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ g@@ and@@ a 20 years ago ."
"We need to radic@@ ally open up develop@@ ment so knowledge flo@@ ws in multi@@ ple direc@@ tions , inspir@@ ing pr@@ acti@@ tion@@ ers , so aid be@@ comes trans@@ par@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and effec@@ tive , so govern@@ ments open up and ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens are engag@@ ed and em@@ power@@ ed with re@@ form@@ ers in government ."
We need to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the collec@@ tive vo@@ ices of the poor will be heard in Bi@@ h@@ ar , in U@@ g@@ and@@ a , and be@@ y@@ ond ."
We will find that t@@ ext@@ books and tea@@ chers will show up in scho@@ ols for their children .
"We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of brea@@ king their way out of po@@ ver@@ ty ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
"So imagine that a plan@@ e is about to cr@@ ash with 2@@ 50 children and bab@@ ies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?"
Now imagine that 60 plan@@ es full of bab@@ ies under five cr@@ ash every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
"M@@ o@@ st of these d@@ ea@@ ths are pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able , and that doesn &apos;t just make me s@@ ad , it makes me an@@ gr@@ y , and it makes me det@@ er@@ min@@ ed ."
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ke@@ e@@ ps kids in school .
It st@@ op@@ s bab@@ ies from d@@ ying .
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p is one of the most co@@ st-@@ effec@@ tive ways of sav@@ ing children &apos;s lives .
"It can s@@ ave over 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent of st@@ op@@ ping 10 j@@ um@@ b@@ o j@@ ets full of bab@@ ies and children from cr@@ ash@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty us@@ e@@ ful public health inter@@ vention .
So now just take a minute .
"A@@ ll right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ il@@ et ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ ret@@ ty y@@ uc@@ ky , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
What is it ? I@@ s there no so@@ a@@ p ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ a@@ p is av@@ ail@@ able ."
"In 90 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in Ken@@ y@@ a , you will find so@@ a@@ p ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ a@@ p is the low@@ est , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why ar@@ en &apos;t people was@@ h@@ ing their hands ?
"Wh@@ y is it that M@@ ay@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t was@@ h@@ ing his hands ?"
"Well , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for b@@ a@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for l@@ aun@@ dr@@ y , so@@ a@@ p is used for was@@ h@@ ing dis@@ h@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a pre@@ ci@@ ous com@@ mod@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ bo@@ ard ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t was@@ te it .
What &apos;s the resul@@ t of that ?
"Ch@@ il@@ dren pic@@ k up disease in the place that &apos;s sup@@ posed to love them and prot@@ ect them the most , in their hom@@ es ."
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
"E@@ very second in A@@ si@@ a and Africa , 1@@ 11 mo@@ thers will buy this b@@ ar to prot@@ ect their family ."
"It &apos;s that beli@@ ef , plus the scale of Un@@ il@@ ever , that allo@@ ws us to keep talking about hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
Th@@ ink about it : Mar@@ k@@ et@@ e@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ elling mess@@ ages ."
But it &apos;s been happening for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and was l@@ aun@@ ched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an Engl@@ and to actually comb@@ at ch@@ ol@@ era .
"L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ h@@ ana with the min@@ ister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ brea@@ k in G@@ h@@ ana at the moment ."
"A hundre@@ d and ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from sp@@ read@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for prof@@ it is ext@@ rem@@ ely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most comm@@ it@@ ted char@@ ity or government ."

We &apos;ve re@@ ach@@ ed over 18@@ 3 million people in 16 countries .

It may be un@@ com@@ for@@ table for some to hear — business growth and lives sav@@ ed some@@ how equ@@ ated in the same sent@@ ence — but it is that business growth that allo@@ ws us to keep doing more .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we cannot ach@@ i@@ eve the change that we need ."
"L@@ ast week , my team and I spent time vis@@ iting mo@@ thers that have all experi@@ enc@@ ed the same thing : the death of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
I &apos;m a mo@@ m . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
"She had the most beautiful s@@ mi@@ le , the s@@ mi@@ le , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chance ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ y@@ o , is her second one ."
"And that &apos;s what insp@@ ires me , insp@@ ires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can e@@ qui@@ p her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing her ne@@ w@@ born ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her so@@ a@@ p ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful in@@ vention in public health .
"These are simple obj@@ ects : c@@ loc@@ ks , ke@@ ys , comb@@ s , gl@@ as@@ ses ."
And it is quite possi@@ bly the larg@@ est ever disco@@ vered .

G@@ en@@ o@@ ci@@ de is not only about the kill@@ ing ; it is about the den@@ i@@ ed identi@@ ty .

"M@@ any of them get des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of si@@ ght and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to photograp@@ h every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ em in order to create a visu@@ al arch@@ ive that sur@@ viv@@ ors could eas@@ ily bro@@ w@@ se .
"As a st@@ or@@ y@@ tel@@ ler , I like to give back to the community ."
I like to move be@@ y@@ ond rais@@ ing aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess .
"And in this case , someone may recogni@@ ze these it@@ ems or at least their photograp@@ h@@ s will rem@@ ain as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed and acc@@ ur@@ ate re@@ min@@ der of what happened ."
"P@@ h@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ y is about emp@@ ath@@ y , and the famil@@ i@@ ar@@ ity of these it@@ ems gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e emp@@ ath@@ y ."
"In this case , I am mer@@ ely a to@@ ol , a for@@ en@@ sic , if you like , and the resul@@ t is a photograp@@ h@@ y that is as close as possible of being a do@@ cu@@ ment ."
"In all their simpl@@ ic@@ ity , these it@@ ems are the last t@@ est@@ am@@ ent to the identi@@ ty of the vic@@ ti@@ ms , the last per@@ man@@ ent re@@ min@@ der that these people ever ex@@ is@@ ted ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for cho@@ col@@ ate don@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day chall@@ eng@@ es .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progr@@ ess ."
So I &apos;m going to try and descri@@ be some of the experi@@ ences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the I@@ m@@ per@@ ial Mon@@ o@@ ch@@ rom@@ es .
"A vie@@ wer sort of un@@ su@@ spec@@ t@@ ingly wal@@ ks into the room , and cat@@ ches a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of these pan@@ els in a mess@@ y com@@ position on the w@@ all ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in secon@@ ds , as if the pan@@ els have no@@ tic@@ ed the pres@@ ence of the vie@@ wer , they app@@ ear to pan@@ ic and sort of get into a str@@ ic@@ t sym@@ me@@ try ."
( Laughter ) So this is the sk@@ et@@ ch of the two st@@ ates .
One is tot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is absolu@@ te order .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ t@@ ori@@ al tradi@@ tions .
"One is the al@@ t@@ ar tab@@ le@@ ts of the 1@@ 5@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , M@@ al@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s ab@@ str@@ act com@@ posi@@ tions ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
That &apos;s about this much . And the sm@@ all@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vie@@ wer ent@@ ers the space , and they s@@ n@@ a@@ p to attention ."
"So this br@@ ings me to a qui@@ eter , small work called H@@ and@@ hel@@ d ."
So this inst@@ ability in the mo@@ vement very clo@@ sel@@ y res@@ em@@ bles the un@@ st@@ ea@@ dy nature of images seen through a hand@@ hel@@ d cam@@ era .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two t@@ an@@ de@@ m cli@@ ps .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ mo@@ ved the cam@@ era and trans@@ fer@@ red that mo@@ vement on@@ to the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
That sort of lik@@ ens it to the amount of str@@ ain to be at the service of the obser@@ ver and pres@@ ent this piece of pap@@ er very del@@ ic@@ ately to the vie@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is D@@ ec@@ o@@ y .
"It has a r@@ oun@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , hea@@ d-@@ like an@@ ten@@ n@@ a , and its so@@ le pur@@ pose is to attr@@ act attention to@@ wards itself ."
"So when a vie@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of til@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more fran@@ tic@@ ally as the person gets clo@@ ser ."
So here is the first test s@@ cen@@ ari@@ o .
"But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person wh@@ ose attention to get ."
It appe@@ ars to be m@@ ass@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ t@@ ory like v@@ ac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers and was@@ h@@ ing machines .
"The next work is an obj@@ ect , that &apos;s also a kind of sound in@@ stru@@ ment ."
In the sh@@ ape of an am@@ ph@@ i@@ the@@ ater that &apos;s sc@@ al@@ ed to the size of an audience as per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed from somebody from the stage .
They &apos;re me@@ chan@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to cl@@ a@@ p of their own free will .
"So when the vie@@ wer ste@@ ps in front of the audience , there will be a respon@@ se ."
So there &apos;s a sense of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment and ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ous@@ ness and un@@ eas@@ iness invol@@ ved .
It also has an all@@ ur@@ ing and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite exc@@ ited about the image of the head s@@ pl@@ itting to form the two hands .
So we can &apos;t w@@ ait to be eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ kay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Fr@@ am@@ er@@ un@@ n@@ ers ."
It comes out of the idea of a win@@ do@@ w .
"This is an actu@@ al win@@ do@@ w in our stu@@ di@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ick@@ n@@ esses of w@@ oo@@ den sec@@ tions ."
So we used the same win@@ do@@ w vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary to construc@@ t our own fr@@ ame or gri@@ d that &apos;s su@@ sp@@ ended in the room and that can be vie@@ wed from two si@@ des .
This gri@@ d is in@@ hab@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small figu@@ res .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ z@@ es , as if to sugg@@ est a kind of perspective or land@@ s@@ cap@@ e on the single pl@@ ain ."
E@@ ach of these figu@@ res can also run back@@ ward and forward in the tr@@ ack and hi@@ de behind two ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent tr@@ ac@@ ks .
"So in contr@@ ast to this very ti@@ ght gri@@ d , we wanted to give these figu@@ res a very com@@ ical and sl@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality , as if a pu@@ p@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ er has taken them and phys@@ ically anim@@ ated them down the pat@@ h ."
"So we like the idea of these figu@@ res sort of s@@ ki@@ p@@ ping along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and care@@ free and happ@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ l@@ uc@@ ky and cont@@ ent , until they sort of sense a mo@@ vement from the vie@@ wer and they will hi@@ de behind the fas@@ test w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion ."
"These figu@@ res are sort of entr@@ app@@ ed within this very str@@ ong gri@@ d , which is like a pris@@ on , but also a for@@ tr@@ ess , because it allo@@ ws them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and n@@ ai@@ ve and care@@ free and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the ex@@ tern@@ al world ."
"So all these real life qu@@ ali@@ ties that I talk about are sort of trans@@ l@@ ated to a very spec@@ ifi@@ c tech@@ n@@ ical confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , and we were very l@@ uc@@ ky to collabor@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ ur@@ ich to dev@@ el@@ op the first prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ."
So you see they extr@@ ac@@ ted the mo@@ tion co@@ gs from our anim@@ ations and created a w@@ ig@@ gle that in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated the hea@@ d-@@ bo@@ b@@ b@@ ing mo@@ vement and the back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ for@@ th mo@@ vement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can fit into the pal@@ m of my hand .
"So imagine our exc@@ it@@ ement when we saw it really working in the stu@@ di@@ o , and here it is ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a wr@@ it@@ er@@ -@@ blo@@ gg@@ er guy ."
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
"Now , in the animal world , that works f@@ ine ."
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ end@@ ar ."
We need to st@@ ay aw@@ are of the In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
S@@ ome@@ time so@@ on .
Thank you .
"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ t@@ ain W@@ illi@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who rec@@ ently was aw@@ ar@@ ded the con@@ gr@@ essi@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or for his actions on S@@ ep@@ t@@ ember 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"On that day , a col@@ um@@ n of American and Afgh@@ an tro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of Afgh@@ an@@ istan to help prot@@ ect a group of government off@@ ici@@ als , a group of Afgh@@ an government off@@ ici@@ als , who would be me@@ eting with some local village el@@ ders ."
"The col@@ um@@ n came under am@@ bus@@ h , and was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded on three si@@ des , and am@@ ong@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ t@@ ain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was recogni@@ zed for run@@ ning into live fi@@ re to res@@ cu@@ e the w@@ oun@@ ded and pul@@ l out the d@@ ead ."
"One of the people he res@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ a@@ c hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mark@@ able about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ cid@@ ence , one of the me@@ dev@@ a@@ c medic@@ s happened to have a G@@ o@@ P@@ r@@ o cam@@ era on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole s@@ cen@@ e on cam@@ era ."
It shows C@@ ap@@ t@@ ain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ ing@@ ing this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ed a g@@ un@@ sho@@ t to the nec@@ k .
"They put him in the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ t@@ ain S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to res@@ cu@@ e more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some de@@ ep , de@@ ep emo@@ tion , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the milit@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce themselves so that others may g@@ ain ."
"In business , we give bon@@ uses to people who are w@@ ill@@ ing to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce others so that we may g@@ ain ."
We have it back@@ wards . Right ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my initi@@ al conclu@@ sion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re attr@@ ac@@ ted to the milit@@ ary .
These better people are attr@@ ac@@ ted to this concept of service .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capac@@ ity to do these re@@ mark@@ able things , and more import@@ antly , others have that capac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to s@@ ave others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this de@@ ep sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
So tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation are really important here .
"The problem with concep@@ ts of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are fe@@ el@@ ings , they are not in@@ struc@@ tions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply in@@ struc@@ t two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
So where does that feeling come from ?
No@@ thing pers@@ onal .
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it was the wea@@ ther , l@@ ack of res@@ ources , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ du@@ ce our li@@ f@@ esp@@ an ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ ong@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent bene@@ f@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tr@@ ust that someone from within my tri@@ be will watch for d@@ anger .
B@@ ad system of sur@@ viv@@ al .
The moder@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is f@@ ill@@ ed with d@@ anger , things that are trying to fr@@ ustr@@ ate our lives or re@@ du@@ ce our succ@@ ess , re@@ du@@ ce our opportunity for succ@@ ess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the economy , the un@@ certain@@ ty of the st@@ oc@@ k market ."
It could be a new technology that rend@@ ers your business model ob@@ sol@@ e@@ te over@@ night .
O@@ r it could be your com@@ peti@@ tion that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to fr@@ ustr@@ ate your growth and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these forces .
"These are a const@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only vari@@ able are the conditions inside the organiz@@ ation , and that &apos;s where lea@@ der@@ ship mat@@ ters , because it &apos;s the lea@@ der that se@@ ts the t@@ one ."
"When a lea@@ der makes the cho@@ ice to put the s@@ af@@ ety and lives of the people inside the organiz@@ ation first , to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce their com@@ for@@ ts and sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the t@@ ang@@ i@@ ble resul@@ ts , so that the people rem@@ ain and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they bel@@ ong , re@@ mark@@ able things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was wit@@ ness to an in@@ cident where a pass@@ eng@@ er at@@ temp@@ ted to bo@@ ard before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had bro@@ ken the la@@ w , like a crimin@@ al ."
He was y@@ ell@@ ed at for at@@ temp@@ ting to bo@@ ard one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like cat@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"She said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the ru@@ les , I could get in trou@@ ble or lo@@ se my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was telling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her leaders .
The reason we like fl@@ ying Sou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines is not because they nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily h@@ ire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
"You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forc@@ ed to ex@@ pen@@ d our own time and energy to prot@@ ect ourselves from each other , and that in@@ her@@ ently wea@@ k@@ ens the organiz@@ ation ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organiz@@ ation , we will nat@@ ur@@ ally comb@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our str@@ eng@@ ths and work ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to face the d@@ ang@@ ers outside and se@@ ize the oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties ."
"The clo@@ s@@ est an@@ alo@@ gy I can give to what a great lea@@ der is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine them when nec@@ ess@@ ary , all so that they can grow up and ach@@ i@@ eve more than we could for ourselves ."
Gre@@ at leaders want exactly the same thing .
"C@@ har@@ lie K@@ i@@ m , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ext J@@ um@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a t@@ ech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consi@@ der l@@ aying off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we consi@@ der l@@ aying off people inside our organiz@@ ation ?
Ch@@ ar@@ lie impl@@ ement@@ ed a poli@@ cy of li@@ fe@@ time employ@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ext J@@ um@@ p , you cannot get fi@@ red for performan@@ ce issu@@ es ."
"In fact , if you have issu@@ es , they will co@@ ach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school ."
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vis@@ cer@@ al h@@ at@@ red , anger , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate sal@@ ar@@ ies and bon@@ us struc@@ tures ."
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very defin@@ ition of lea@@ der@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this de@@ ep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social contr@@ act .
"We know that they al@@ lowed their people to be sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed so they could prot@@ ect their own interes@@ ts , or wor@@ se , they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed their people to prot@@ ect their own interes@@ ts ."
"This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers ."
W@@ ould any@@ body be off@@ ended if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million bon@@ us to G@@ and@@ h@@ i ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million bon@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
D@@ o we have an issue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at leaders would never sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce
the people to s@@ ave the numbers .
They would so@@ on@@ er sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the numbers to s@@ ave the people .
"B@@ o@@ b Ch@@ ap@@ man , who r@@ uns a large man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing company in the M@@ id@@ w@@ est called B@@ arr@@ y-@@ W@@ e@@ h@@ m@@ ill@@ er , in 200@@ 8 was h@@ it very hard by the rec@@ ession , and they lost 30 percent of their or@@ ders over@@ night ."
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer aff@@ or@@ d their lab@@ or po@@ ol ."
"They needed to s@@ ave 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the bo@@ ard got together and discus@@ s@@ ed l@@ ay@@ off@@ s ."
And Bo@@ b re@@ f@@ used .
"You see , Bo@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ du@@ ce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough program .
"E@@ very employ@@ ee , from sec@@ ret@@ ary to C@@ E@@ O , was re@@ qui@@ red to take four weeks of un@@ p@@ aid v@@ ac@@ ation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ sec@@ u@@ tiv@@ ely ."
But it was how Bo@@ b ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ed the program that mat@@ ter@@ ed so much .
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suff@@ er a little than any of us should have to suff@@ er a lot , and mor@@ ale went up ."
"And quite s@@ pon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body exp@@ ected , people started tr@@ ad@@ ing with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could aff@@ or@@ d it more would tra@@ de with those who could aff@@ or@@ d it less .
P@@ eople would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
L@@ ea@@ der@@ ship is a cho@@ ice . It is not a r@@ ank .
I know many people at the sen@@ i@@ or@@ most lev@@ els of organiz@@ ations who are absolu@@ tely not leaders .
"They are auth@@ ori@@ ties , and we do what they say because they have auth@@ or@@ ity over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ t@@ oms of organiz@@ ations who have no auth@@ or@@ ity and they are absolu@@ tely leaders , and this is because they have cho@@ s@@ en to look after the person to the left of them , and they have cho@@ s@@ en to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a lea@@ der is .
"I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the off@@ ic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them leaders because they go first .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before any@@ body else does .
"We call them leaders because they will cho@@ ose to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce so that their people may be sa@@ fe and prot@@ ected and so their people may g@@ ain , and when we do , the natural respon@@ se is that our people will sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce for us ."
"They will give us their bloo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s to see that their lea@@ der &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your bloo@@ d and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organiz@@ ation we would all like to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"The most complex problems in our time can be sol@@ ved with simple techni@@ ques , if we are able to dre@@ am ."
"As a child , I disco@@ vered that cre@@ ativ@@ ity is the key to cro@@ ss from dre@@ ams to reality ."
"I learned this from my grand@@ mother , D@@ r@@ . R@@ u@@ th T@@ i@@ chau@@ er , a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e that s@@ et@@ t@@ led in the heart of the An@@ des ."
That is how I gre@@ w up : encour@@ ag@@ ed to see be@@ y@@ ond any lim@@ itation .
"So part of my education inclu@@ ded hel@@ ping her in rem@@ ote , indi@@ gen@@ ous communi@@ ties ."
"I cher@@ ish those mem@@ ories , because they hel@@ ped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibil@@ ities , without b@@ arri@@ ers , as language or culture ."
"D@@ ur@@ ing those tri@@ ps , my grand@@ mother used to rec@@ ite a K@@ i@@ pl@@ ing po@@ em : &quot; &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing hi@@ dd@@ en . G@@ o and find it ."
G@@ o and look behind the M@@ oun@@ t@@ ains .
S@@ ome@@ thing lost behind the m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains .
"L@@ o@@ st and w@@ ai@@ ting for you . G@@ o ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medic@@ al stu@@ dent ."
One of every hundre@@ d children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can sol@@ ve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y .
The fe@@ tu@@ s needs to sur@@ vi@@ ve inside the mother .
S@@ ur@@ viv@@ al depend@@ s on communication between the syst@@ em@@ ic and the pul@@ mon@@ ary bloo@@ d .
"A@@ t the moment of bir@@ th , this communication needs to stop ."
"If it doesn &apos;t close , the bab@@ y has a ho@@ le in the heart ."
It is caus@@ ed by pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ity and gen@@ e@@ tic conditions .
But what we know today is that a l@@ ack of oxy@@ g@@ en is also one of the cau@@ ses .
"As you can see in the ch@@ art , the fre@@ qu@@ ency of this kind of ho@@ le dr@@ am@@ atic@@ ally increas@@ es with al@@ titu@@ de ."
"@@ V@@ ide@@ o : ( B@@ ab@@ y cr@@ ying ) Wh@@ en you look at patients with this condi@@ tion , they se@@ em des@@ per@@ ate to brea@@ the ."
"T@@ o close the ho@@ le , maj@@ or sur@@ g@@ ery used to be the only solution ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on re@@ gion ."
The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fi@@ re was a green av@@ oc@@ a@@ do br@@ an@@ ch .
Th@@ en came a moment of inspir@@ ation .
So we used the br@@ an@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first in@@ vention .
The ho@@ les in children &apos;s hear@@ ts can be clo@@ s@@ ed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of w@@ ire wr@@ app@@ ed on@@ to itself .
"It maybe doesn &apos;t look so f@@ anc@@ y to you now , but that was our first succ@@ ess@@ ful at@@ temp@@ t to create a dev@@ ice for this maj@@ or problem ."
"In this video , we can see how a very tiny ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clo@@ ses the ho@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of inspir@@ ation , there came a very long time of eff@@ ort develop@@ ing a prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ."
In vi@@ tr@@ o and in viv@@ o stu@@ dies took thousands of hours of work in the la@@ b .
"The co@@ il , if it works , can s@@ ave lives ."
"I re@@ turned from G@@ er@@ many to Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ a , thinking that wh@@ er@@ ever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference ."
"W@@ ith my wi@@ fe and part@@ ner , D@@ r@@ . Al@@ ex@@ and@@ ra H@@ e@@ ath , we started to see patients ."
"A@@ f@@ ter succ@@ ess@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic ."
"But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 feet high ."
"M@@ o@@ st patients cannot aff@@ or@@ d to be tre@@ ated on time , and they die ."
The first co@@ il could succ@@ ess@@ fully tre@@ at only half of the patients in Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ a .
The se@@ ar@@ ch started again .
We went back to the dra@@ wing bo@@ ard .
"A@@ f@@ ter many tri@@ als , and with the help of my grand@@ mother &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous friends in the m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains , we ob@@ t@@ ained a new dev@@ ice ."
We take this tradi@@ tional me@@ th@@ od of we@@ av@@ ing and make a design made by a smar@@ t material that re@@ cor@@ ds sh@@ ape .
"It seems this time , the we@@ av@@ ing allo@@ ws us to create a se@@ am@@ less dev@@ ice that doesn &apos;t r@@ ust because it &apos;s made of only one piece ."
It can change by itself into very complex struc@@ tures by a pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re that took dec@@ ades to dev@@ el@@ op .
"As you can see , the dev@@ ice ent@@ ers the body through the natural ch@@ ann@@ els ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the ho@@ le .
"O@@ ur dev@@ ice exp@@ ands , places itself and clo@@ ses the ho@@ le ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .

"As you can see — ( Applause ) A@@ s you can see , once the dev@@ ice is in place , the patient is 100 percent heal@@ ed ."
"F@@ ro@@ m start to fin@@ ish , the whole pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re takes only 30 minutes ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medic@@ al and human point of view .
"We are so pr@@ oud that some of our form@@ er patients are part of our team — a team , th@@ an@@ ks to ad@@ ded close inter@@ action with patients that work with us ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple ."

We will give one dev@@ ice for free to make sure that every child is tre@@ ated .

"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o and M@@ pu@@ mal@@ ang@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ et@@ em@@ a ."
"W@@ ater and electr@@ ic@@ ity suppl@@ y are as un@@ predic@@ table as the wea@@ ther , and growing up in these tou@@ g@@ h situ@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rel@@ ax@@ ing with a couple of friends of mine in win@@ ter , and we were su@@ n@@ b@@ a@@ thing ."
The L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o su@@ n gets really ho@@ t in win@@ ter .
"So as we were su@@ n@@ b@@ a@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody in@@ vent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to b@@ a@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would buy that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sh@@ oc@@ king st@@ atis@@ tics ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per access to water and san@@ itation .
"F@@ our hundre@@ d and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in Sou@@ th Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ari@@ ous dis@@ eas@@ es th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dr@@ as@@ tic of which is called tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a ."
T@@ ra@@ ch@@ om@@ a is an inf@@ ection of the ey@@ e du@@ e to dir@@ t getting into your ey@@ e . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple inf@@ ec@@ tions of tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind .
"The disease le@@ aves eight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind each and every year . The sh@@ oc@@ king part about it is that to av@@ o@@ id being inf@@ ected with tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no medic@@ ine , no p@@ ills , no in@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"So after seeing these sh@@ oc@@ king st@@ atis@@ tics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to b@@ a@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to s@@ ave the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my No@@ ki@@ a 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a l@@ ap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , excep@@ t for the 20@@ -@@ r@@ and@@ -@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , on Google , about lo@@ tions , cre@@ ams , the com@@ posi@@ tions , the m@@ el@@ ting points , the to@@ x@@ ici@@ ties — I did high school science — and I wr@@ ote down a little form@@ u@@ la on a piece of pap@@ er ,"
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C spec@@ ial sp@@ ice , you know ?"
"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the form@@ u@@ la ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into pr@@ acti@@ ce .
"F@@ ast forward four years later , after having wr@@ it@@ ten a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ page business plan on the cell phone , having wr@@ it@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ g@@ est pat@@ ent-@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more b@@ a@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invent@@ ed D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first b@@ ath@@ -@@ sub@@ stitu@@ ting lo@@ tion ."
"You literally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to b@@ a@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the lim@@ ited res@@ ources I had , I went to univers@@ ity , met a few people , got it into pr@@ acti@@ ce , and we have a fully func@@ tion@@ ing produc@@ t that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually av@@ ail@@ able on the market ."
So we learned a few l@@ ess@@ ons in commer@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath av@@ ail@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that poor communi@@ ties don &apos;t buy produc@@ ts in bul@@ k .
"They buy produc@@ ts on dem@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t buy a box of ci@@ gar@@ ettes . They buy one ci@@ gar@@ ette each day , even though it &apos;s more ex@@ pen@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ed D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these innov@@ ative little s@@ ach@@ ets .
"You just s@@ n@@ a@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the cool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ tes one bat@@ h for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter cre@@ ating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of impl@@ ement@@ ing the produc@@ t ."
We realized that even r@@ ich kids from the sub@@ urb@@ s really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we realized that we could s@@ ave 80 million lit@@ ers of water on average each time they s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped a bat@@ h , and also we would s@@ ave two hours a day for kids who are in r@@ ural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for hom@@ e@@ work , two hours more to just be a ki@@ d ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global impact , we n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key value pro@@ position , which was cle@@ an@@ l@@ iness and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a r@@ ich man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a poor man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ av@@ er .
"H@@ av@@ ing put the produc@@ t into pr@@ acti@@ ce , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t on@@ to a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the ret@@ ail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the grav@@ el ro@@ a@@ ds of L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o , with an al@@ low@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to b@@ a@@ the ."
What &apos;s st@@ op@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Google nam@@ ed me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also curr@@ ently the best stu@@ dent entrepren@@ eur in the world , the first Afr@@ ican to get that acc@@ ol@@ ade , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to b@@ a@@ the . Thank you ."
( Applause . )
"F@@ ive years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ b@@ atic@@ al , and I re@@ turned to the medic@@ al univers@@ ity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real patients and I w@@ o@@ re the white co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a man@@ ag@@ ement con@@ sul@@ tant ."
There were two things that sur@@ pris@@ ed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common them@@ e of the discus@@ sions we had were hosp@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and co@@ st-@@ cu@@ tting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that s@@ ever@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I met , form@@ er friends from medic@@ al school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most mo@@ tiv@@ ated , engag@@ ed and pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ n@@ ical , dis@@ engag@@ ed , or had dist@@ anc@@ ed themselves from hosp@@ ital man@@ ag@@ ement ."
"So with this foc@@ us on co@@ st-@@ cu@@ tting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patient ?"
M@@ any countries that you repres@@ ent and where I come from stru@@ gg@@ le with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ form@@ s ai@@ m at hol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long w@@ ai@@ ting times for patients for sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"In other countries , new dru@@ gs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In s@@ ever@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ tent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the co@@ st@@ ly dec@@ is@@ ions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an ex@@ pen@@ sive la@@ b test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and f@@ rai@@ l patient ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom of phys@@ ici@@ ans , this is a way to hold co@@ sts down ."
"And ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , some phys@@ ici@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are fr@@ ustr@@ ated .
"A@@ t B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ ag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to ach@@ i@@ eve ? &quot;"
"@@ U@@ l@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re aim@@ ing at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a lim@@ ited , or aff@@ or@@ d@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"On the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by value : out@@ comes that matter to patients rel@@ ative to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by Mi@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"On this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the co@@ sts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascin@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are hosp@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are ext@@ rem@@ ely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vas@@ tly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he suff@@ ers from pro@@ state cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"Now living in Europe , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the average hosp@@ ital , he will have the risk of be@@ coming in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start w@@ ear@@ ing di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a clin@@ ic called the Mar@@ tin@@ i-@@ K@@ lin@@ i@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a s@@ ev@@ en-@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many hosp@@ it@@ als for many different dis@@ eas@@ es , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
No@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the hosp@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their ann@@ u@@ al me@@ eting , and they were discus@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"T@@ o the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of met@@ al pi@@ ec@@ es , arti@@ fici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individual way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My techni@@ que is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to mea@@ sure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should mea@@ sure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should mea@@ sure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started mea@@ sur@@ ing , and started shar@@ ing the data ."
"@@ V@@ ery quickly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the bone of the patient before you put the met@@ al sh@@ af@@ t in , it actually l@@ as@@ ted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They pu@@ bl@@ ished the data , and it actually transform@@ ed clin@@ ical pr@@ acti@@ ce in the country ."
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ in@@ ce then , they pu@@ bl@@ ish every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they pu@@ bl@@ ish the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bot@@ tom ?"
"And they vis@@ it each other to try to learn , so a continu@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ vement ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best resul@@ ts in the world , at least for those who actually were mea@@ sur@@ ing , and many were not ."
Now I found this prin@@ ci@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the phys@@ ici@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start mea@@ sur@@ ing , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ vement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have foc@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the low@@ est co@@ sts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ pose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compar@@ ed the U.S. and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ g@@ ery .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies , and so much un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary suff@@ ering for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year per@@ i@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sav@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the mem@@ ber countries ."
"The United States has , for many dis@@ eas@@ es , actually a qu@@ ality which is bel@@ ow the average in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would foc@@ us a lot more on mea@@ sur@@ ing qu@@ ality , and rai@@ se qu@@ ality just to the level of average O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would s@@ ave the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these numbers are fantas@@ tic , and it &apos;s all log@@ ical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a par@@ adi@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ gue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my pr@@ acti@@ ce as a con@@ sul@@ tant , I me@@ et probably a hundre@@ d or more than a hundre@@ d doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other hosp@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care st@@ af@@ f every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they ach@@ i@@ eve in terms of qu@@ ality for their patients .
"P@@ hy@@ s@@ ici@@ ans are , like most of you in the audience , very com@@ peti@@ tive ."
They were always best in clas@@ s .
We were always best in clas@@ s .
"And if somebody can show them that the resul@@ t they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But phys@@ ici@@ ans have another char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er recogni@@ tion .
"If a car@@ di@@ olo@@ g@@ ist call@@ s another car@@ di@@ olo@@ g@@ ist in a comp@@ eting hosp@@ ital and discus@@ ses why that other hosp@@ ital has so much better resul@@ ts , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to impro@@ ve .
"So it is , by mea@@ sur@@ ing and cre@@ ating trans@@ par@@ ency , you get a cy@@ cle of continu@@ ous impro@@ vement , which is what this sli@@ de shows ."
"Now , you may say this is a ni@@ ce idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re cre@@ ating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to mea@@ sure and comp@@ are what we ach@@ i@@ eve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic institutions , Mi@@ cha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ cho@@ ol , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has form@@ ed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ."
It st@@ ands for the Intern@@ ational Con@@ sorti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ u@@ t@@ come M@@ ea@@ su@@ rement .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together lea@@ ding phys@@ ici@@ ans and patients to discus@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we mea@@ sure , and to make those stand@@ ards global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : cat@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back pain , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for inst@@ ance , heart att@@ ack , and pro@@ state cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will pu@@ bl@@ ish their data in No@@ v@@ ember of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be compar@@ ing app@@ les to app@@ les , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ext year , we &apos;re pl@@ ann@@ ing to do eight dis@@ eas@@ es , the year after , 16 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we plan to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
Com@@ p@@ are app@@ les to app@@ les . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ ive months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the larg@@ est univers@@ ity hosp@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Europe ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big institu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with phys@@ ici@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other st@@ af@@ f , discus@@ sing l@@ eu@@ k@@ em@@ ia in children ."
"The group discus@@ s@@ ed , how do we mea@@ sure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we mea@@ sure it better than we do ?
"We discus@@ s@@ ed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ v@@ ements ?"
"And we discus@@ s@@ ed what are the co@@ sts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more eff@@ ici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ orm@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m ."
"A@@ t the end of the me@@ eting , the ch@@ air@@ man of the de@@ part@@ ment , he sto@@ od up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he rais@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he rais@@ ed his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his f@@ ist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally discus@@ sing what this hosp@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y mea@@ sur@@ ing value in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only co@@ sts but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make st@@ af@@ f in hosp@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solution ."
"I believe mea@@ sur@@ ing value in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a re@@ volution , and I &apos;m conv@@ inc@@ ed that the f@@ oun@@ der of moder@@ n medic@@ ine , the Gre@@ e@@ k H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ cr@@ ates , who always put the patient at the c@@ enter , he would s@@ mi@@ le in his gr@@ ave ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the gre@@ at@@ est form@@ s to make the world a better place .
You get them to ach@@ i@@ eve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p succ@@ ess .
"And I wanted to try to be syst@@ em@@ ati@@ c about it , av@@ o@@ id some of my inst@@ inc@@ ts and maybe mis@@ per@@ cep@@ tions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
We learned a lot from those fai@@ lu@@ res .
So I tried to look across what fac@@ tors ac@@ coun@@ ted the most for company succ@@ ess and fai@@ lu@@ re .
So I looked at these five .
"F@@ ir@@ st , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ ec@@ ution , adap@@ t@@ ability , that mat@@ ter@@ ed even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er Mi@@ ke T@@ y@@ son on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ body has a plan , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
The cu@@ st@@ om@@ er is the true reality .
Th@@ en I started looking at the business model .
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very clear pat@@ h gener@@ ating cu@@ st@@ om@@ er reven@@ ues ?
M@@ ay@@ be that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then for non-@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , I looked at w@@ il@@ d succ@@ esses , like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b and In@@ st@@ ag@@ ra@@ m and U@@ ber and Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be and L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In ."
"And some fai@@ lu@@ res : W@@ e@@ b@@ v@@ an , K@@ o@@ z@@ m@@ o , P@@ et@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m F@@ loo@@ z and F@@ ri@@ end@@ st@@ er ."
The number one thing was tim@@ ing .
T@@ im@@ ing ac@@ coun@@ ted for 4@@ 2 percent of the difference between succ@@ ess and fai@@ lu@@ re .
"S@@ ome of our early succ@@ esses , C@@ it@@ y@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , came out when people needed web p@@ ages ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ T@@ o@@ .@@ co@@ m , which we ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ed actually at TED in 199@@ 8 , was when companies were looking for co@@ st-@@ effec@@ tive ways to get tra@@ ff@@ ic ."
"J@@ ust two years later , when the co@@ de@@ c problem was sol@@ ved by A@@ do@@ be F@@ l@@ ash and when bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ation cro@@ ss@@ ed 50 percent in America , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be was perf@@ ect@@ ly tim@@ ed ."
"@@ Gre@@ at idea , but un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able tim@@ ing ."
"In fact , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started ."
"I &apos;d done well at school . Ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully ent@@ ered the stu@@ dent life of lec@@ tures , parties and tra@@ ff@@ ic con@@ e the@@ ft ."
"@@ Un@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually de@@ e@@ pl@@ y un@@ happy , insec@@ ure and fundament@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fai@@ lu@@ re and of the emp@@ tin@@ ess that I felt was within me ."
"I was le@@ av@@ ing a sem@@ in@@ ar when it started , hum@@ m@@ ing to myself , f@@ um@@ bl@@ ing with my b@@ a@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hundre@@ d times before , when sudd@@ en@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly obser@@ ve , &quot; She is le@@ av@@ ing the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the cl@@ ar@@ ity and dec@@ is@@ i@@ ven@@ ess of the comment was un@@ mis@@ ta@@ k@@ able ."
&quot; She is op@@ en@@ ing the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had arri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice pers@@ is@@ ted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , n@@ arr@@ ating everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a lec@@ ture . &quot;
"It was neu@@ tr@@ al , im@@ pas@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ ang@@ ely compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did no@@ tice that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sometimes sli@@ p@@ ped and that it oc@@ cas@@ i@@ on@@ ally mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ ex@@ pr@@ essed emo@@ tion ."
"So , for example , if I was an@@ gr@@ y and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ de@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound fr@@ ustr@@ ated ."
"A sub@@ tle condi@@ tion@@ ing process had beg@@ un , the impl@@ ication that normal people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very ser@@ i@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fai@@ r , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my str@@ ange comm@@ ent@@ ator ."
"For example , I was part of a stu@@ dent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news bul@@ let@@ ins around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment which was run@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to rapid@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A hosp@@ ital ad@@ mission fol@@ lowed , the first of many , a diagno@@ s@@ is of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , tor@@ ment@@ ing sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hum@@ ili@@ ation and des@@ p@@ air about myself and my pro@@ spec@@ ts ."
"But having been encour@@ ag@@ ed to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sym@@ p@@ tom , my fear and res@@ ist@@ ance to@@ wards it inten@@ si@@ fi@@ ed ."
"Now essenti@@ ally , this repres@@ ented taking an ag@@ gr@@ es@@ sive st@@ ance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of psy@@ ch@@ ic civi@@ l war , and in turn this caus@@ ed the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow progr@@ essi@@ v@@ ely ho@@ sti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that gl@@ ass of water ?
"In eff@@ ect , a v@@ ici@@ ous cy@@ cle of fear , av@@ o@@ id@@ ance , mis@@ tr@@ ust and mis@@ understanding had been est@@ ab@@ l@@ ished , and this was a bat@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ capable of est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish@@ ing any kind of p@@ ea@@ ce or re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the det@@ er@@ i@@ or@@ ation was dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole fr@@ en@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : terri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que vis@@ ions , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , in@@ tr@@ act@@ able del@@ u@@ sions ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age and des@@ p@@ air of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sav@@ ed ."
"A bro@@ ken and hau@@ n@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who emer@@ g@@ ed was a sur@@ viv@@ or and would ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely grow into the person I was des@@ tin@@ ed to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ m@@ ed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ ories grow p@@ ale and f@@ ain@@ t in compar@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as l@@ ate as M@@ ay , but sum@@ mer always comes even@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ dit those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ought with me and for me and who w@@ ai@@ ted to w@@ el@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ed , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ar@@ ed so ho@@ sti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this resp@@ ect , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to att@@ ack my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fear and insec@@ ur@@ ity in the world , rather than an actu@@ al , objec@@ tive d@@ anger ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prot@@ ect them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t m@@ ess with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a plas@@ tic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ c ."
"It was arm@@ ed with this knowledge that ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely I would ga@@ ther together my sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed self , each fr@@ ag@@ ment repres@@ ented by a different vo@@ ice , grad@@ u@@ ally with@@ dra@@ w from all my medic@@ ation , and re@@ turn to psy@@ chi@@ a@@ try , only this time from the other side ."
"I &apos;m now very pr@@ oud to be a part of In@@ ter@@ vo@@ ice , the organiz@@ ational body of the Intern@@ ational H@@ ear@@ ing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement , an initi@@ ative insp@@ i@@ red by the work of Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or M@@ ari@@ us R@@ om@@ me and D@@ r@@ .

"This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way ."

I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ h@@ y .
O@@ r is it photograp@@ h@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photograp@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ era ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photograp@@ h@@ y started as I got my first dig@@ ital cam@@ era at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ era , the process was in the pl@@ ann@@ ing instead ."
"And when you take a photograp@@ h with a cam@@ era , the process ends when you pr@@ ess the tr@@ ig@@ ger ."
So to me it felt like photograp@@ h@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like any@@ one could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you pr@@ ess the tr@@ ig@@ ger ."
Ph@@ ot@@ os like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ exp@@ ected tw@@ ist .
"And des@@ p@@ ite that , it ret@@ ains a level of re@@ alis@@ m ."
"O@@ r photos like these — both dar@@ k and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of ret@@ aining the level of re@@ alis@@ m ."
"When I say re@@ alis@@ m , I mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alis@@ m ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photograp@@ h ."
Ph@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the tr@@ ick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tr@@ ick that makes it look re@@ alis@@ tic ?
I@@ s it something about the det@@ ails or the col@@ ors ?
I@@ s it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the il@@ lu@@ sion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the perspective is the il@@ lu@@ sion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is re@@ alis@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks re@@ alis@@ tic really ."
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different pi@@ ec@@ es of reality and put it together to create al@@ tern@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"H@@ ere we have three perf@@ ect@@ ly imagin@@ able physical obj@@ ects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal world ."
"But combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tr@@ ick our br@@ ains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accep@@ t the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with combin@@ ing photograp@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different re@@ ali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photograp@@ h look re@@ alis@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our d@@ ai@@ ly lives ."
"But when combin@@ ing photograp@@ h@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple ru@@ les to fol@@ low to ach@@ i@@ eve a re@@ alis@@ tic resul@@ t .
"As you can see , these images ar@@ en &apos;t really spec@@ ial ."
"But combin@@ ed , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that photos combin@@ ed should have the same perspective .
"S@@ ec@@ ond@@ ly , photos combin@@ ed should have the same type of light ."
And these two images both ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qui@@ rem@@ ents — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to dis@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
"So by mat@@ ching colo@@ r , contr@@ ast and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hi@@ c def@@ ects like de@@ p@@ th of field , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that one image can cont@@ ain hundreds of l@@ ay@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a land@@ s@@ cap@@ e and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
But this image is actually enti@@ re@@ ly com@@ posed of photograp@@ h@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
"I pers@@ on@@ ally think that it &apos;s eas@@ ier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ prom@@ ise with the ideas in your head ."
But it does re@@ qu@@ ire a lot of pl@@ ann@@ ing .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had s@@ ever@@ al months to plan it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the pi@@ ec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a f@@ ish@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sh@@ or@@ es are from a different loc@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And y@@ eah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to ach@@ i@@ eve a re@@ alis@@ tic resul@@ t , I think it comes down to pl@@ ann@@ ing ."
"It always star@@ ts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photograp@@ h@@ s .
And here every piece is very well pl@@ ann@@ ed .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the photos , the resul@@ t can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ alis@@ tic ."
"So all the to@@ ols are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagin@@ ation ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Now , this has already started to have pretty im@@ medi@@ ate re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions ."
"There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tr@@ ail that lea@@ ds back to P@@ res@@ id@@ ent V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir P@@ uti@@ n of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ hood friend , who happens to be a top cel@@ l@@ ist ."
And there will be a lot of r@@ ich individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ vous about the next set of stories and the next set of lea@@ ked doc@@ uments .
"Now , this sou@@ nds like the pl@@ ot of a sp@@ y thr@@ ill@@ er or a John G@@ ris@@ h@@ am nov@@ el ."
"It seems very dis@@ tant from you , me , ordin@@ ary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
And that aff@@ ects all of us .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world b@@ aff@@ ling and conf@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sho@@ re world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an d@@ ol@@ l .
"So you can have one company st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , st@@ ac@@ ked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these struc@@ tures ."
"And that &apos;s perhaps because some prom@@ in@@ ent U@@ S people just hav@@ en &apos;t figu@@ red in this ex@@ posé , in this sc@@ and@@ al ."
"Now , that &apos;s not because there are no r@@ ich Amer@@ ic@@ ans who are st@@ ash@@ ing their as@@ se@@ ts off@@ sho@@ re ."
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sho@@ re works , Mo@@ ss@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fe@@ wer American cli@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw lea@@ ks from the C@@ ay@@ man Is@@ l@@ ands or even from D@@ el@@ aw@@ are or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a , you would see many more cas@@ es and exam@@ ples lin@@ king back to Amer@@ ic@@ ans ."
"In fact , in a number of U@@ S st@@ ates you need less information , you need to provi@@ de less information to get a company than you do to get a li@@ br@@ ary car@@ d ."
That sort of sec@@ rec@@ y in America has al@@ lowed employ@@ e@@ es of school dis@@ tr@@ ic@@ ts to ri@@ p off scho@@ ol@@ children .
It has al@@ lowed sc@@ am@@ m@@ ers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able inv@@ est@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavior that aff@@ ects all of us .
"Now , at G@@ lo@@ b@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in pr@@ acti@@ ce ."
How does this actually work ?
"O@@ ur investi@@ g@@ ator posed as an Afr@@ ican min@@ ister who wanted to move su@@ sp@@ ect fun@@ ds into the United States to buy a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"But as a natural opti@@ mis@@ t , I do see that we are starting to get some change ."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real p@@ ush to@@ wards gre@@ ater trans@@ par@@ ency when it comes to company ow@@ ner@@ ship ."
This issue was put on the political ag@@ end@@ a by the U@@ K P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ister D@@ av@@ id C@@ am@@ er@@ on at a big G@@ 8 S@@ um@@ m@@ it that was hel@@ d in Nor@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and in 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ ama lea@@ ks , this huge pe@@ e@@ k into the off@@ sho@@ re world , be used as a way of op@@ en@@ ing up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lo@@ b@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
We need ordin@@ ary people to get an@@ gr@@ y at the way in which people can hi@@ de their identi@@ ty behind secre@@ t companies .
"We need business leaders to st@@ and up and say , &quot; S@@ ec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need political leaders to recogni@@ ze the problem , and to comm@@ it to changing the la@@ w to open up this sort of sec@@ rec@@ y ."
"Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Ju@@ li@@ an , w@@ el@@ come ."
"It &apos;s been re@@ por@@ ted that W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks , your bab@@ y , has , in the last few years has re@@ le@@ as@@ ed more clas@@ si@@ fi@@ ed doc@@ uments than the rest of the world &apos;s media combin@@ ed ."
C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ ss@@ ange : Yeah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of acti@@ vis@@ ts is able to rel@@ ease more of that type of information than the rest of the world pr@@ ess combin@@ ed .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people rel@@ ease the doc@@ uments ?
And how do you sec@@ ure their priv@@ acy ?
"J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — cl@@ ass@@ ical wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art en@@ cr@@ y@@ ption to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de trai@@ ls , pas@@ s it through leg@@ al j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those leg@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tions ."
"We get information in the m@@ ail , the reg@@ ular pos@@ t@@ al m@@ ail , en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a reg@@ ular news organiz@@ ation , form@@ at it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant dat@@ ab@@ as@@ es of information — rel@@ ease it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ itable leg@@ al and political att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an eff@@ ort to en@@ sure the doc@@ uments are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate , but you actually almost never know who the identi@@ ty of the source is ?"
"J@@ A : That &apos;s right , y@@ eah . V@@ ery r@@ ar@@ ely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we des@@ tro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."

"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this do@@ cu@@ ment up ...
So this was a story in Ken@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ port .
This was a secre@@ t intelligence re@@ port comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the Ken@@ y@@ an government after its el@@ ection in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , Ken@@ y@@ a was r@@ ul@@ ed by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p M@@ oi for about 18 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ tat@@ or of Ken@@ y@@ a .
"And when K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ ption in Ken@@ y@@ a — they comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ ed this re@@ port , spent about two million pou@@ nds on this and an associ@@ ated re@@ port ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for political l@@ ever@@ age on M@@ oi , who was the ri@@ ch@@ est man — still is the ri@@ ch@@ est man — in Ken@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ rai@@ l of Ken@@ y@@ an journ@@ alis@@ m .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we man@@ ag@@ ed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the el@@ ection — the national el@@ ection , D@@ ec@@ ember 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed that re@@ port , we did so three days after the new pres@@ id@@ ent , K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p M@@ oi , so this re@@ port then became a d@@ ead al@@ b@@ a@@ tro@@ ss around P@@ res@@ id@@ ent K@@ i@@ b@@ ak@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to cut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the re@@ port lea@@ ked into Ken@@ y@@ a , not from the off@@ ici@@ al media , but indi@@ rec@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ ion , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the el@@ ection ."
"J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front page of the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding countries of Ken@@ y@@ a , in T@@ anz@@ an@@ ian and Sou@@ th Afr@@ ican pr@@ ess ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ y@@ an pr@@ ess feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts str@@ ai@@ ght on Ken@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a Ken@@ y@@ an intelligence re@@ port , which changed the resul@@ t of the el@@ ection ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your lea@@ k really sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort cli@@ p from this B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad air@@ str@@ i@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort cli@@ p ."
"This is — this is inten@@ se material , I should war@@ n you ."
"R@@ adi@@ o : ... just f@@ uc@@ k@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up ."
"I see your el@@ ement , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ..."

"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"@@ God dam@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , h@@ ah@@ ah@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; em ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the impact of that ?"
J@@ A : The impact on the people who worked on it was s@@ ev@@ ere .
We ended up s@@ ending two people to B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad to fur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three att@@ ac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that s@@ cen@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that att@@ ack , right , inclu@@ ding two R@@ eu@@ ters employ@@ e@@ es ?"
"J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ w@@ o R@@ eu@@ ters employ@@ e@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 18 and 2@@ 6 people kill@@ ed all together .
CA : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this caus@@ ed wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tr@@ age .
"What was the key el@@ ement of this that actually caus@@ ed the ou@@ tr@@ age , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gro@@ ss dispar@@ ity in force .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a rel@@ ax@@ ed way down the stre@@ et , and then an A@@ pa@@ che hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter sitting up at one kilom@@ eter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0@@ -@@ milli@@ met@@ er c@@ ann@@ on sh@@ el@@ ls on everyone — looking for any ex@@ cu@@ se to do so — and kill@@ ing people res@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two journ@@ alis@@ ts invol@@ ved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analy@@ st , Br@@ ad@@ ley M@@ ann@@ ing , ar@@ res@@ ted , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he conf@@ essed in a ch@@ at room to have lea@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 clas@@ si@@ fi@@ ed U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y c@@ ables ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have den@@ i@@ ed re@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing those c@@ ables .
"He has been ch@@ arg@@ ed , about five days ago , with ob@@ t@@ aining 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 c@@ ables and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had re@@ le@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ i@@ k U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y , but this is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily conn@@ ected ."
"I mean , I was a known vis@@ it@@ or of that emb@@ ass@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ ce@@ ive thousands of U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y di@@ pl@@ om@@ ati@@ c c@@ ables ..."
"J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true human@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ uses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at dec@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fi@@ ed c@@ ables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there ."
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your phil@@ os@@ oph@@ y ?"
Why is it right to encour@@ age lea@@ king of secre@@ t information ?
"J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can ach@@ i@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ ending economic eff@@ ort into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sign@@ al that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ ending work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in pr@@ acti@@ ce , and that &apos;s what the history of journ@@ alis@@ m is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , either to the individu@@ als concer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ int@@ ended conse@@ qu@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ uni@@ z@@ ation poli@@ cy ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of pers@@ onal — pers@@ on@@ ally identi@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate secre@@ ts — you know , your re@@ cor@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate secre@@ t — but we deal with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers that are coming forward that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ated ."
CA : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S. milit@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an inc@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It shows a U.S. sol@@ di@@ er l@@ augh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in Afgh@@ an@@ istan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ ion . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ ion of the people who are p@@ aying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
CA : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of dar@@ k secre@@ ts in companies and in government .
Li@@ ght is good .
"But do you see any ir@@ on@@ y in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sour@@ ces ?"
"J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks dis@@ si@@ dents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sour@@ ces who are dis@@ si@@ dents on other sour@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come forward , that would be a tr@@ ick@@ y situation for us , but we &apos;re pres@@ um@@ ab@@ ly ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ ell@@ ed to continue our mission , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curi@@ ous as to the op@@ in@@ ion in the TED audience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vie@@ ws of W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks and of Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ anger@@ ous trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the danger@@ ous trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er view ?
"J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft cro@@ w@@ d , Ju@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft cro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you hav@@ en &apos;t yet lea@@ ked , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tr@@ ig@@ u@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a s@@ am@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in No@@ v@@ ember last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well b@@ low@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ port — a sort of engine@@ ering analy@@ s@@ is into what happened — saying that , in fact , sec@@ ur@@ ity gu@@ ards from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous comp@@ eting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked truc@@ ks there and blo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ port had nothing on the top of it , so it was an ext@@ rem@@ ely difficult do@@ cu@@ ment for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it because we didn &apos;t know who wr@@ ote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a comp@@ eting oil fir@@ m just sort of pl@@ aying the issue up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The material looks good , it fe@@ els right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ f@@ y it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a let@@ ter just this week from the company who wr@@ ote it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What do@@ cu@@ ment is it , pre@@ cis@@ ely , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had leg@@ al auth@@ or@@ ity over that do@@ cu@@ ment ?
I@@ s it really y@@ ou@@ rs ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the auth@@ or in the M@@ icro@@ so@@ ft Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ tho@@ ds of identi@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to wr@@ ite let@@ ters ."
CA : Yeah . H@@ ave you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of ser@@ ious fun@@ d@@ rais@@ ing and engine@@ ering eff@@ ort ."
So our public@@ ation r@@ ate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ im@@ iz@@ ed while we &apos;re re-@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ orm@@ ous quanti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ su@@ res of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k , basically journ@@ alis@@ tic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fun@@ ding of journ@@ alis@@ tic sal@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ st@@ ed people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to res@@ truc@@ ture in order to have people who will deal with the high@@ est national sec@@ ur@@ ity stuff , and then lo@@ wer sec@@ ur@@ ity cas@@ es ."
CA : So help us understand a bit about you pers@@ on@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a ki@@ d you went to 3@@ 7 different scho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the mo@@ vie business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the combin@@ ation between the two ..."
"( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psycho@@ log@@ ist might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"J@@ A : What , the mo@@ vie business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ack@@ er at an early age and ran into the auth@@ ori@@ ties early on ."
"J@@ A : Well , I was a journ@@ alis@@ t ."
"You know , I was a very young journ@@ alis@@ t acti@@ vis@@ t at an early age ."
"I wr@@ ote a mag@@ az@@ ine , was pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ager ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with h@@ ack@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be de@@ pl@@ oy@@ ed for vari@@ ous things .
"@@ Un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , at the moment , it &apos;s mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ pl@@ oy@@ ed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ ra@@ se is not , not as ni@@ ce as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Yeah , well , I certain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing any@@ one &apos;s grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your core val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ cident in your life that hel@@ ped det@@ er@@ mine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ cident .
"But the core val@@ ues : well , capable , gener@@ ous men do not create vic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture vic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create vic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture vic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing vic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to police per@@ pe@@ tr@@ at@@ ors of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my char@@ ac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?"
"You basically pu@@ bl@@ ished something there , ran into trou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news service there was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted from run@@ ning the story ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
"J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ cel@@ and went through this financi@@ al cr@@ is@@ is .
It was the har@@ d@@ est h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sec@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the economy .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so we rel@@ ease this re@@ port in Ju@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a mo@@ vie : in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion land@@ ed on the news des@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ site instead , for all that time , as a f@@ ill@@ er , and we became very fam@@ ous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and spo@@ ke about this issue ."
"And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a resul@@ t , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans and some other intern@@ ational leg@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ack@@ age of leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sho@@ re hav@@ en for the free pr@@ ess , with the str@@ ong@@ est journ@@ alis@@ tic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ech ."
"I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pass@@ ed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ anim@@ ously ."
CA : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , Ju@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more lik@@ ely to be Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us wat@@ ching Bi@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be play@@ ed for either way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ orm@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize fre@@ e@@ dom of spe@@ ech leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation and trans@@ par@@ ency leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of eff@@ ort , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting the audience &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion to say , Ju@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"J@@ A : Thank you , Chr@@ is . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
I feel incredi@@ bly l@@ uc@@ ky to be from a country that &apos;s gener@@ ally consi@@ der@@ ed to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
"In 19@@ 7@@ 5 , when I was seven years old , women in I@@ cel@@ and went on a str@@ i@@ ke ."
"They did no work that day , whether they hel@@ d professi@@ onal j@@ ob@@ s or had the work of the home ."
They mar@@ ched into the c@@ enter of R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k — 90 percent of women particip@@ ated — and pe@@ ace@@ fully and in so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity asked for equ@@ ality .
"N@@ o@@ thing worked in I@@ cel@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work ."
"( Applause ) F@@ ive years later , I@@ cel@@ and@@ ers had the cour@@ age to be the first country in the world to demo@@ crati@@ c@@ ally el@@ ect a woman as their pres@@ id@@ ent ."
"I will never for@@ get this day , that P@@ res@@ id@@ ent V@@ ig@@ d@@ í@@ s , as we know her by her first name , st@@ ep@@ ped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mo@@ m with her d@@ aughter by her side as she had won ."
"( Applause ) This woman was an incredible ro@@ le model for me and everyone growing up at that time , inclu@@ ding bo@@ ys ."
"She fre@@ qu@@ ently shar@@ es the story of how a young bo@@ y appro@@ ach@@ ed her after a couple of terms in off@@ ice and asked , &quot; &quot; C@@ an bo@@ ys really grow up to be pres@@ id@@ ent ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ole mod@@ els really matter , but even with such str@@ ong ro@@ le mod@@ els who I am so gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful for , when I was encour@@ ag@@ ed to run for pres@@ id@@ ent , my first re@@ action was , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o am I to run for pres@@ id@@ ent ?"
Wh@@ o am I to be pres@@ id@@ ent ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less lik@@ ely to consi@@ der run@@ ning than men .
"So a study done in the U@@ S in 20@@ 11 sho@@ wed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had consi@@ der@@ ed run@@ ning for off@@ ice , but 4@@ 5 percent of women ."
"That &apos;s ga@@ p of 16 per@@ cent@@ age points , and it &apos;s the same ga@@ p that ex@@ is@@ ted a dec@@ ade ear@@ li@@ er ."
"And it really is a sh@@ ame , because I am so conv@@ inc@@ ed that the world is in real need for women leaders and more prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ e-@@ based lea@@ der@@ ship in gener@@ al ."
"So my dec@@ ision to run ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no political experience , to step up and try to be part of cre@@ ating the world that will make sense and be sust@@ ain@@ able for our kids , and a world where we tru@@ ly al@@ low both our bo@@ ys and gir@@ ls to be all they can be ."
And it was the jour@@ ney of my life .
It was amazing .
The jour@@ ney started with potenti@@ ally as many as 20 can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
"It bo@@ il@@ ed down to n@@ ine can@@ di@@ dat@@ es qu@@ ali@@ f@@ ying , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely the r@@ ace came down to four of us , three men and me ."
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dr@@ ama yet .
"So our sitting pres@@ id@@ ent of 20 years ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ed initi@@ ally that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave r@@ ise to so many can@@ di@@ dat@@ es consi@@ der@@ ing run@@ ning ."
Th@@ en later he changed his mind when our pri@@ me min@@ ister res@@ ign@@ ed fol@@ lo@@ wing the in@@ fam@@ ous P@@ an@@ ama P@@ ap@@ ers that impl@@ ic@@ ated him and his family .
"And there was a popul@@ ar prot@@ est in I@@ cel@@ and , so the sitting pres@@ id@@ ent thought they needed a tru@@ st@@ ed lea@@ der ."
"A few days later , rel@@ ations to his wi@@ fe and her family &apos;s companies were also disco@@ vered in the P@@ an@@ ama P@@ ap@@ ers , and so he with@@ dre@@ w from the r@@ ace again ."
"B@@ e@@ fore doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ed men who he felt could f@@ ill his sho@@ es run@@ ning for off@@ ice ."
"So on M@@ ay 9 , 4@@ 5 days before el@@ ection day , it was not looking too good for me ."
I did not even make the grap@@ h in the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .
"The pol@@ ls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the high@@ est that any woman ann@@ oun@@ c@@ ing her can@@ di@@ d@@ acy had ear@@ ned ."
"So it would be an underst@@ at@@ ement to say that I had to work ext@@ rem@@ ely hard to get my se@@ at at the table and access to tel@@ ev@@ ision , because the net@@ work decided that they would only inclu@@ de those with 2@@ .@@ 5 percent or more in the pol@@ ls in the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"I found out on the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate that I would particip@@ ate along with the three men , and I found out on live T@@ V that I came in at exactly 2@@ .@@ 5 percent on the day of the first T@@ V de@@ b@@ ate ."
"( Applause ) So , chall@@ eng@@ es ."
"The fore@@ most chall@@ eng@@ es I had to face and over@@ come on this jour@@ ney had to do with media , mus@@ cle and money ."
Let &apos;s start with media .
There are those who say g@@ end@@ er doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and poli@@ tics .
I can &apos;t say that I ag@@ ree .
It pro@@ ved har@@ der for me to both get access and air@@ time in media .
"As a matter of fact , the lea@@ ding can@@ di@@ d@@ ate appe@@ ar@@ ed in bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast media 8@@ 7 times in the months lea@@ ding up to the el@@ ec@@ tions , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I appe@@ ar@@ ed 3@@ 1 times ."
And I am not saying media is doing this consci@@ ously .
"When I finally got access to T@@ V , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you going to qu@@ it ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one ."
"But of course , with 1 percent to 2@@ .@@ 5 percent in the pol@@ ls , maybe it &apos;s underst@@ and@@ able ."
"But media really mat@@ ters , and every time I appe@@ ar@@ ed on T@@ V , we saw and experi@@ enc@@ ed a r@@ ise in the pol@@ ls , so I know fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this mat@@ ters and why we have to talk about it ."
I was the only one out of the final four can@@ di@@ dat@@ es that never got a front page inter@@ view .
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other can@@ di@@ dat@@ es and out of co@@ ver@@ age about the el@@ ec@@ tions .
"So I did face this , but I will say this to compl@@ im@@ ent the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c media ."
I got few if any comm@@ ents about my h@@ air and p@@ ant@@ su@@ it .
( Applause ) So k@@ u@@ do@@ s to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
"I ran as an in@@ depend@@ ent can@@ di@@ d@@ ate , not with any political par@@ ty or mus@@ cle behind me ."
"That l@@ ack of experience and l@@ ack of access to res@@ ources probably came at a cost to our cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , but it also al@@ lowed us to innov@@ ate and do poli@@ tics differ@@ ently ."
"We ran a positive cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , and we probably changed the t@@ one of the el@@ ection for others by doing that ."
"It may be the reason why I had less air@@ time on T@@ V , because I wanted to show other cont@@ end@@ ers resp@@ ect ."
"When access to media pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we ran our own media ."
I ran live F@@ ace@@ book s@@ es@@ sions where I took questions from v@@ ot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the spo@@ t .
And we put all the questions I got and all the ans@@ w@@ ers on an open F@@ ace@@ book because we thought trans@@ par@@ ency is important if you want to est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish tr@@ ust .
"I got young people to te@@ ach me how to do that , and I used every fil@@ ter on S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at during the last part of the cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n ."
"And I actually had to use a lot of hu@@ mo@@ r and hum@@ il@@ ity , as I was very bad at it ."
But we gre@@ w the fol@@ lo@@ wing am@@ ong@@ st young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
"But un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely , one cannot talk about poli@@ tics without m@@ enti@@ on@@ ing money ."
"I am s@@ ad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financi@@ al res@@ ources than the other can@@ di@@ dat@@ es ."
This probably was part@@ ly du@@ e to the fact that I think I had a har@@ der time as@@ king for financi@@ al support .
And maybe I also had the ambi@@ tion to do more with less .
S@@ ome would call that very wom@@ an@@ ly of me .
"But even with one third the media , one third the financi@@ al res@@ ources , and only an entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al team , but an amazing team , we man@@ ag@@ ed to sur@@ prise everyone on el@@ ection night , when the first numbers came in ."
"I sur@@ pris@@ ed myself , as you may see in that photo ."
"( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in nec@@ k to nec@@ k to the lea@@ ding can@@ di@@ d@@ ate ."
"S@@ ome people call me the real win@@ ner of the el@@ ection because of this , and there are many people who encour@@ ag@@ ed me to run again ."
"But what really makes me pr@@ oud is to know that I ear@@ ned pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately high@@ er per@@ cent@@ age support from the young people , and a lot of people encour@@ ag@@ ed my d@@ aughter to run in 20@@ 40 ."
"( Applause ) She is 1@@ 3 , and she had never been on T@@ V before ."
"And on el@@ ection day , I observ@@ ed her on T@@ V re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , and she was smar@@ t , she was self-@@ confi@@ dent , she was s@@ inc@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother ."
This was probably the high@@ light of my cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
"These are pres@@ cho@@ ol gir@@ ls out on a walk , and they found a pos@@ ter of me on a b@@ us stop , and they saw the need to k@@ is@@ s it ."
Au@@ di@@ ence : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a win for me .
"What we see , we can be ."
So scre@@ w fear and chall@@ eng@@ es .
"( Applause ) It mat@@ ters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for off@@ ice , be it the off@@ ice of the C@@ E@@ O or the off@@ ice of the pres@@ id@@ ent ."
"I also man@@ ag@@ ed to put an impression on your very own &quot; &quot; New Yor@@ ker . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new ti@@ tle , &quot; &quot; A living emo@@ j@@ i of sin@@ cer@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Ch@@ e@@ ers ) It is possi@@ bly my pr@@ ou@@ d@@ est ti@@ tle yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ aliz@@ ed for using what I call their emo@@ tional cap@@ ital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that ."
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
"We cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated as if we had won on el@@ ection night , because that &apos;s how we felt ."
So you don &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily have to re@@ ach that off@@ ice .
"You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow be@@ y@@ ond anything you will experience before ."
"So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this jour@@ ney , probably more l@@ ess@@ ons than I can share here in the time we have today ."
"But rest as@@ su@@ red , it was hard work ."
I lost a lot of s@@ le@@ ep during those months .
"It took res@@ ili@@ ence and pers@@ ever@@ ance to not qu@@ it , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are tru@@ ly , auth@@ enti@@ c@@ ally lis@@ ten@@ ing to your own vo@@ ice and working in al@@ ign@@ ment with that ."
"As a good s@@ ister of mine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your in@@ tu@@ ition , but your in@@ tu@@ ition never che@@ ats on you ."
"I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any jour@@ ney you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along ."
"It &apos;s having people around you who share your val@@ ues , your vision , but are different in every other way ."
"That &apos;s the form@@ u@@ la for succ@@ ess for me , and I am bl@@ essed with an amazing h@@ us@@ b@@ and , here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entrepren@@ eurs in the political ar@@ en@@ a , and pul@@ led something off that everyone said would be impossible ."
"As a matter of fact , the lea@@ ding P@@ R exper@@ t told me before I made my dec@@ ision that I would do well to get seven percent ."
"I ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on val@@ u@@ able experience ."
"But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong ."
"It &apos;s very important to men@@ tion this , because I did lo@@ se a lot of s@@ le@@ ep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me ."
We can never go the dist@@ ance if we for@@ get to take care of ourselves .
"And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding yourself with people and pr@@ acti@@ ces that nour@@ ish you , but it &apos;s equ@@ ally important , maybe even more important , to have the cour@@ age to get ri@@ d of people and pr@@ acti@@ ces that take away your energy , inclu@@ ding the wonderful blo@@ gg@@ ers and comm@@ ent@@ at@@ ors ."
"I took a lot of support from others in doing this , and I made the dec@@ ision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s part@@ ly how I ke@@ pt my energy going thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out all of this ."
"And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own r@@ ace ."
"I called it a 4@@ G cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , the G &apos;s repres@@ ent@@ ing the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c words ."

"When I was a stu@@ dent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , the future of the world was bl@@ ea@@ k ."
The population explo@@ sion was un@@ st@@ op@@ p@@ able .
G@@ lo@@ b@@ al fam@@ ine was in@@ ev@@ itable .
A cancer e@@ pi@@ dem@@ ic caus@@ ed by chem@@ ic@@ als in the environment was going to sh@@ or@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id r@@ ain was fall@@ ing on the for@@ es@@ ts .
The des@@ ert was adv@@ anc@@ ing by a mi@@ le or two a year .
"The oil was run@@ ning out , and a nuc@@ l@@ ear win@@ ter would fin@@ ish us off ."
"N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , if you look at what actually happened in my li@@ fe@@ time , the average per@@ -@@ capit@@ a in@@ come of the average person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ed for in@@ fl@@ ation , has tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
Li@@ f@@ esp@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
Ch@@ il@@ d mor@@ tal@@ ity is down by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds .
P@@ er@@ -@@ capit@@ a food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has dou@@ bl@@ ed .
"H@@ ow did we ach@@ i@@ eve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we ach@@ i@@ eve that ?
How did we become the only species that be@@ comes more pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous as it be@@ comes more popul@@ ous ?
"The size of the blo@@ b in this grap@@ h repres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the grap@@ h repres@@ ents G@@ D@@ P per capit@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their br@@ ains and en@@ able their ideas to comb@@ ine and re@@ comb@@ ine , to me@@ et and , in@@ de@@ ed , to m@@ ate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have se@@ x ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making obj@@ ects like this to making obj@@ ects like this .
These are both real obj@@ ects .
One is an A@@ ch@@ eu@@ le@@ an hand ax@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s .
The other is obvi@@ ously a computer mou@@ se .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and sh@@ ape to an un@@ c@@ ann@@ y de@@ gre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigg@@ er , and it &apos;s almost impossible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both design@@ ed to fit the human hand .
"They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their simil@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just tel@@ ls you they were both design@@ ed to fit the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 3@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but to@@ ols changed s@@ lo@@ wer than sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no progr@@ ess , no innovation ."
"It &apos;s an extraordin@@ ary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the obj@@ ect on the right is ob@@ sol@@ e@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the obj@@ ect on the left is made from one sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"The obj@@ ect on the right is made from a conf@@ ection of different sub@@ st@@ ances , from sil@@ ic@@ on and met@@ al and plas@@ tic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ection of different ideas , the idea of plas@@ tic , the idea of a l@@ as@@ er , the idea of trans@@ ist@@ ors ."
They &apos;ve all been combin@@ ed together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this combin@@ ation , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tr@@ ig@@ ues me , because I think it &apos;s the secre@@ t to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"H@@ ow does evol@@ ution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it uses sex@@ u@@ al re@@ production ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ u@@ al species , if you get two different mu@@ t@@ ations in different cre@@ atures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ext@@ inc@@ t for the other to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
"But if you have a sex@@ u@@ al species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ t@@ ations from different lin@@ e@@ ages ."
So what se@@ x does is it en@@ ables the individual to dra@@ w u@@ pon the gen@@ e@@ tic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same eff@@ ect in cul@@ tural evol@@ ution as se@@ x is having in biolo@@ gical evol@@ ution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the hab@@ it of ex@@ changing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a unique human fe@@ ature .
No other animal does it .
You can te@@ ach them in the labor@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ity in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one obj@@ ect for another never happens .
"As A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fai@@ r ex@@ change of a bone with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ u@@ al culture ."
"Ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ e@@ es , kill@@ er wh@@ ales , these kinds of cre@@ atures , they have culture ."
They te@@ ach each other tradi@@ tions which are hand@@ ed down from par@@ ent to off@@ s@@ pr@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ e@@ es tea@@ ching each other how to cr@@ ack nu@@ ts with ro@@ c@@ ks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never grow , never acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no se@@ x , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ imp@@ anz@@ ee tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change rai@@ se living stand@@ ards ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ av@@ id R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge version of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ d@@ am takes four hours to make a sp@@ ear and three hours to make an ax@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a sp@@ ear and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than A@@ d@@ am .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ d@@ am .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ d@@ am make two ax@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sav@@ ed an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ d@@ am is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the g@@ ains from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ d@@ am and O@@ z both sav@@ ed an h@@ our of time .
"That is pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity , the sav@@ ing of time in s@@ atis@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to provi@@ de for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this even@@ ing to read a book by .
"If you had to start from s@@ cr@@ at@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You rend@@ er it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Qu@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the average w@@ age in Br@@ it@@ ain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight secon@@ ds on the average w@@ age to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve g@@ ained since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or service ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the average w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the average person on the average w@@ age could not aff@@ or@@ d a c@@ and@@ le in 18@@ 00 ."
"@@ G@@ o back to this image of the ax@@ e and the mou@@ se , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one ax@@ e was made by someone for h@@ im@@ self ."
It was self-@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the obj@@ ect on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ sands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ ff@@ ee , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was dr@@ ill@@ ing for oil , which was going to be made into the plas@@ tic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a mou@@ se for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were r@@ ich , you literally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be r@@ ich ; you employ@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly h@@ air@@ st@@ y@@ les , or whatever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his din@@ ner every night .
"But a moder@@ n tour@@ ist going around the pal@@ ace of V@@ ers@@ ail@@ les and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his din@@ ner t@@ on@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in b@@ is@@ tro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and rest@@ aur@@ ants and sh@@ op@@ s all over Par@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s no@@ tice with an ex@@ cel@@ lent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w u@@ pon spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to rai@@ se each other &apos;s living stand@@ ards .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a clas@@ sic example ; wor@@ kers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ kers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ on@@ y ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ e with resp@@ ect to re@@ production ."
The qu@@ e@@ en does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we ins@@ ist on doing for ourselves , is re@@ production ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in Engl@@ and , we don &apos;t leave re@@ production to the Qu@@ e@@ en ."
( Applause ) So when did this hab@@ it start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est version of this is probably the sex@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no ev@@ id@@ ence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work ma@@ le for fem@@ ale and fem@@ ale for ma@@ le .
"In all hun@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er soci@@ e@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing di@@ vision of lab@@ or between , on the whole , hun@@ ting mal@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing fem@@ ales ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ tion between spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for mal@@ es and fem@@ ales ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it bene@@ f@@ its both si@@ des .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get access to prot@@ ein is to di@@ g some extr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ing hun@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ tho@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kill@@ s a war@@ tho@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des rai@@ se each other &apos;s stand@@ ards of living through the sex@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a high@@ ly intellig@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir br@@ ains on average , by the end , were bigg@@ er than y@@ ou@@ rs and mine in this room today ."
They were imagin@@ ative . They bu@@ ried their d@@ ead .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was disco@@ vered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ ills .
They were br@@ illi@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no ev@@ id@@ ence of a sex@@ u@@ al di@@ vision of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no ev@@ id@@ ence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavior by fem@@ ales .
It looks like the fem@@ ales were co@@ oper@@ ative hun@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no ev@@ id@@ ence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the obj@@ ects that you find in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al re@@ mains , the to@@ ols they made , are always made from local mater@@ i@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ auc@@ a@@ sus there &apos;s a site where you find local Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al to@@ ols ."
They &apos;re always made from local cher@@ t .
"In the same val@@ ley there are moder@@ n human re@@ mains from about the same d@@ ate , 3@@ 0,000 years ago , and some of those are from local cher@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving obj@@ ects around like this , it was ev@@ id@@ ence that they were ex@@ changing between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as f@@ arm@@ ing .
P@@ eople for@@ get that . P@@ eople think of tra@@ de as a moder@@ n thing .
Ex@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hundre@@ d thou@@ sand years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est ev@@ id@@ ence for it cro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long dist@@ ances in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ as@@ hel@@ ls — as disco@@ vered by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 1@@ 25 miles in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ g@@ er@@ ia .
And that &apos;s ev@@ id@@ ence that people have started ex@@ changing between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that long@@ -@@ dist@@ ance mo@@ vement means tra@@ de rather than mi@@ gr@@ ation ?
"Well , you look at moder@@ n hun@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like abor@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ arri@@ ed for st@@ one ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ arr@@ y ow@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ ado@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tr@@ ad@@ ed them with their neigh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gr@@ ay bar@@ b@@ s , and the conse@@ qu@@ ence was that st@@ one ax@@ es ended up over a large part of A@@ ustr@@ ali@@ a ."
"So long@@ -@@ dist@@ ance mo@@ vement of to@@ ols is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not mi@@ gr@@ ation ."
"What happens when you cut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ e ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down technolo@@ gical progr@@ ess , you can actually thro@@ w it into re@@ verse ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ mani@@ a .
"When the se@@ a level ro@@ se and T@@ as@@ mani@@ a became an is@@ land 1@@ 0,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ enc@@ ed s@@ lo@@ wer progr@@ ess than people on the main@@ land , they actually experi@@ enc@@ ed re@@ gr@@ ess ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one to@@ ols and f@@ ish@@ ing e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment and clo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ int@@ ain the spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ ills nec@@ ess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ ert is@@ land .
"H@@ ow many of the things in our po@@ ck@@ ets could we continue to make after 1@@ 0,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ ra del F@@ u@@ e@@ go — simil@@ ar is@@ land , simil@@ ar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ ra del F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ par@@ ated from Sou@@ th America by a much n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer str@@ ai@@ ght , and there was tr@@ ad@@ ing cont@@ act across that str@@ ai@@ ght thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out 1@@ 0,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ mani@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"@@ G@@ o back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one ax@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer mou@@ se ?
"N@@ o@@ body , literally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer mou@@ se .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pres@@ id@@ ent of the computer mou@@ se company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the ass@@ em@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dr@@ ill an oil well to get oil out to make plas@@ tic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous ess@@ ay by Le@@ on@@ ard R@@ ead , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ enc@@ il &quot; &quot; in which he wr@@ ote about how a pen@@ c@@ il came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ c@@ il , because the people who ass@@ emble it don &apos;t know how to mine graph@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and spec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ f@@ er ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ ond our cap@@ abil@@ ities ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ y@@ ond the capac@@ ity of the human mind to an extraordin@@ ary de@@ gre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons that I &apos;m not interested in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
"What &apos;s rel@@ ev@@ ant to a society is how well people are commun@@ ic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cl@@ ever the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the collec@@ tive brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the net@@ work .
We &apos;re the neur@@ ons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ eting and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is caus@@ ing technolo@@ gical progr@@ ess , incre@@ ment@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ ow@@ ever , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terri@@ ble things ."
There will be w@@ ars ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolu@@ tely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connec@@ tions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and ther@@ e@@ fore living stand@@ ards will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ oud , through cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ c@@ ing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ ites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ re@@ ly ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the r@@ ate of innovation ."
Thank you .

My name is Am@@ it .
"And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I p@@ it@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ eu@@ ms and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she al@@ lowed me to do it ."
And it took 18 months .
"A lot of f@@ un , ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mus@@ eu@@ ms from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to foc@@ us on the dem@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my pers@@ onal story is expl@@ ained very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s access ."
And I gre@@ w up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not compl@@ aining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mus@@ eu@@ ms and these ar@@ t@@ works .
"And so when I started trav@@ eling and going to these mus@@ eu@@ ms , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Google , I tried to put this des@@ ire to make it more acc@@ essi@@ ble with technology together ."
"So we form@@ ed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since l@@ aun@@ ch .
"So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mus@@ eu@@ ms here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ M@@ A , the H@@ er@@ m@@ it@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an G@@ o@@ g@@ h ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the M@@ e@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an M@@ us@@ eu@@ m of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ w@@ o ways of going in — very simple .
"C@@ lic@@ k and , ban@@ g , you &apos;re in this mus@@ eu@@ m ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ omb@@ ay , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."
"You move around , you have f@@ un ."
You want to n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate around the mus@@ eu@@ m ?
"O@@ p@@ en the plan up , and , in one cli@@ ck , j@@ um@@ p ."
"You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or ."
K@@ e@@ ep going . H@@ ave f@@ un .
Ex@@ pl@@ o@@ re .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks . I hav@@ en &apos;t come to the best part .
"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favor@@ ite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ v@@ es@@ ters &quot; &quot; by P@@ i@@ eter B@@ ru@@ eg@@ el at the M@@ et ."
I see this plus sig@@ n .
"If the mus@@ eu@@ m has given us the image , you cli@@ ck on it ."
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the met@@ a-@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interested in art , you can cli@@ ck this — but I &apos;m going to cli@@ ck this off right now ."
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people as@@ king me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ o@@ om around very simply .
You see some f@@ un stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pression is pr@@ ic@@ el@@ ess .
But then you really want to go de@@ ep .
"And so I started pl@@ aying around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That sou@@ nds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started no@@ tic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , spo@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ ac@@ ts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a s@@ tic@@ k on Sh@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And appar@@ ently it was quite popul@@ ar .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really de@@ ep in , you can really get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to z@@ o@@ om out so you really see what you get ."
"H@@ ere is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly j@@ um@@ p into the Mo@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; &quot; The St@@ arr@@ y N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I sho@@ wed you was all about fin@@ ding det@@ ails ."
But what if you want to see br@@ ush str@@ o@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ o@@ g@@ h actually created this mas@@ ter@@ piece ?
You z@@ o@@ om in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my favor@@ ite parts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The St@@ arr@@ y N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other favor@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called C@@ oll@@ ec@@ tions .
"A@@ n@@ y one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re r@@ ich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ anc@@ y house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mus@@ eu@@ m on@@ line — create your own coll@@ ection across all these images .
"@@ V@@ ery simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ o@@ wer of Z@@ o@@ om — you can just z@@ o@@ om around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ all@@ ery ."
"You can ann@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , s@@ end it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these mas@@ ter@@ pi@@ ec@@ es ."
"So I think , in conclu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ ion , even come from the mus@@ eu@@ ms ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bl@@ ing experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this dig@@ ital medi@@ um that we do justice to their ar@@ t@@ work and repres@@ ent it pro@@ per@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the bigg@@ est question I get asked no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ pl@@ ic@@ ate the experience of going to a mus@@ eu@@ m ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to suppl@@ ement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a st@@ or@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , wr@@ iting nov@@ els — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of st@@ or@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural cre@@ atures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni ."
"But before I go there , pl@@ ease al@@ low me to share with you g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of my pers@@ onal story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical sh@@ ape , the cir@@ cle , so thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out my talk , you will come across s@@ ever@@ al cir@@ cles ."
"I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fr@@ ance to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ par@@ ated , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ ro@@ m then on , I was rais@@ ed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0s , in An@@ k@@ ar@@ a , that was a bit un@@ usu@@ al ."
"O@@ ur neigh@@ bor@@ hood was full of large famil@@ ies , where fa@@ thers were the hea@@ ds of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pa@@ tri@@ arch@@ al environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood ."
"On the one hand was my mother , a w@@ ell@@ -@@ e@@ duc@@ ated , sec@@ ular , moder@@ n , w@@ es@@ ter@@ ni@@ zed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"On the other hand was my grand@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more spir@@ itu@@ al , less e@@ duc@@ ated and defin@@ it@@ ely less r@@ ational ."
This was a woman who read co@@ ff@@ ee gr@@ oun@@ ds to see the future and m@@ el@@ ted l@@ ead into my@@ st@@ er@@ ious sh@@ ap@@ es to f@@ end off the ev@@ il ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people vis@@ ited my grand@@ mother , people with s@@ ev@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their hands ."
"E@@ ach time , my grand@@ mother would u@@ t@@ ter some words in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , take a red app@@ le and st@@ a@@ b it with as many ro@@ se th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would en@@ cir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with dar@@ k ink ."
"A week later , the patient would come back for a fol@@ low@@ -@@ up exam@@ in@@ ation ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scientists , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who vis@@ ited my grand@@ mother for their sk@@ in conditions , I did not see any@@ one go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of pr@@ aying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pr@@ aying is effec@@ tive , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ cles . &quot; &quot; F@@ ro@@ m her , I learned , am@@ ong@@ st many other things , one very pre@@ ci@@ ous l@@ ess@@ on — that if you want to des@@ tro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a bl@@ em@@ ish or the human sou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ r@@ ound it with th@@ ick w@@ all@@ s ."
It will dr@@ y up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tural cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , clas@@ s ."
"But if we have no conn@@ ection what@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the one we take for gran@@ ted , then we too run the risk of dr@@ ying up inside ."
"O@@ ur imagin@@ ation might sh@@ r@@ ink ; our hear@@ ts might d@@ w@@ ind@@ le , and our hum@@ ann@@ ess might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long inside our cul@@ tural co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , neigh@@ b@@ ors , colle@@ ag@@ ues , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle res@@ emble us , it means we are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded with our mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors with v@@ el@@ v@@ et or to h@@ an@@ g them on the w@@ all@@ s with their b@@ ac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ as@@ tern tradi@@ tion based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not heal@@ thy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fl@@ ection .
"I@@ ron@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; communi@@ ties of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ at@@ est d@@ ang@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , am@@ ong liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ atives , agno@@ s@@ tics and beli@@ ev@@ ers , the r@@ ich and the poor , E@@ ast and W@@ est ali@@ ke ."
"We ten@@ d to form c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers based on simil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produce st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes about other c@@ lu@@ st@@ ers of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ ion , one way of trans@@ c@@ ending these cul@@ tural gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of st@@ or@@ y@@ telling ."
"S@@ t@@ ories cannot dem@@ ol@@ ish fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ unch ho@@ les in our mental w@@ all@@ s ."
"And through those ho@@ les , we can get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in ke@@ e@@ ping a pers@@ onal journ@@ al .
"In re@@ tro@@ sp@@ ect , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ried about my san@@ ity ."
"I was const@@ antly telling stories at home , which was good , excep@@ t I told this to imagin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an intro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of commun@@ ic@@ ating with colo@@ red cr@@ ay@@ ons and a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ing to obj@@ ects when I b@@ um@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to wr@@ ite down my d@@ ay@@ -@@ to-@@ day experi@@ ences and emo@@ tions ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to wr@@ ite about myself ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , I began to wr@@ ite about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long pas@@ sion for wr@@ iting fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ to@@ bi@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical mani@@ f@@ est@@ ation than a trans@@ c@@ end@@ ent@@ al jour@@ ney into other lives , other possibil@@ ities ."
And pl@@ ease b@@ ear with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
"So from this small , su@@ pers@@ ti@@ ti@@ ous , midd@@ le-@@ clas@@ s neigh@@ bor@@ hood of my grand@@ mother , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , intern@@ ational school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; repres@@ ent@@ ative fore@@ ign@@ er . &quot; &quot; In our cl@@ ass@@ room , there were children from all n@@ ation@@ ali@@ ties , yet this di@@ versity did not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily l@@ ead to a co@@ s@@ mo@@ po@@ lit@@ an , e@@ gal@@ it@@ ari@@ an cl@@ ass@@ room demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"In@@ st@@ ead , it gener@@ ated an atmosp@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the repres@@ ent@@ ative of something larg@@ er ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was f@@ un , excep@@ t wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ g@@ ative , with regar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a religion , took place ."
"The child who repres@@ ented it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed and bul@@ li@@ ed end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I attend@@ ed that school , a milit@@ ary ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my n@@ ation@@ ality ne@@ arly kill@@ ed the P@@ ope , and T@@ ur@@ key got z@@ er@@ o points in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of be@@ coming a s@@ ai@@ lo@@ r during those days .
I also had my first t@@ as@@ te of cul@@ tural st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes there .
"The other children asked me about the mo@@ vie &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night Ex@@ pr@@ ess , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inqui@@ red how many ci@@ gar@@ ettes a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ kers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my h@@ air ."
"I came to learn that these were the three main st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes about my country : poli@@ tics , ci@@ gar@@ ettes and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pain , we went to J@@ or@@ d@@ an , G@@ er@@ many and An@@ k@@ ar@@ a again ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ where I went , I felt like my imagin@@ ation was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ t@@ ories gave me a sense of c@@ enter , continu@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mi@@ d-@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I mo@@ ved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I ado@@ re ."
"I li@@ ved in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ verse neigh@@ bor@@ hood where I wr@@ ote s@@ ever@@ al of my nov@@ els ."
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that st@@ op@@ ped me in my tr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"There was the local gro@@ c@@ er there — a gr@@ um@@ p@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t s@@ ell al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t spea@@ k to mar@@ g@@ in@@ als ."
He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a run@@ ning down her che@@ e@@ ks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ ettes with t@@ rem@@ bl@@ ing hands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ serv@@ ative gro@@ c@@ er and a cr@@ ying trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk ."
"In the face of death and des@@ truc@@ tion , our m@@ un@@ d@@ ane differ@@ ences ev@@ a@@ por@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a simil@@ ar eff@@ ect on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are read@@ ing a good nov@@ el , we leave our small , co@@ z@@ y ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in Bo@@ st@@ on , then Mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an ."
"I experi@@ enc@@ ed this , not so much as a ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical shi@@ ft , as a lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tic one ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion in Engl@@ ish .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the comm@@ u@@ te between langu@@ ages gi@@ ves me the chance to re@@ create myself ."
"I love wr@@ iting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emo@@ tional , and I love wr@@ iting in Engl@@ ish , which to me is very ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al and cer@@ e@@ br@@ al ."
So I feel conn@@ ected to each language in a different way .
"For me , like millions of other people around the world today , Engl@@ ish is an ac@@ qui@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a l@@ at@@ e@@ com@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a continu@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al fr@@ ustr@@ ation ."
"As l@@ at@@ e@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cr@@ ack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the t@@ on@@ gue ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ating .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ mul@@ ating ."
And this is what I disco@@ vered in Bo@@ st@@ on — that fr@@ ustr@@ ation was very sti@@ mul@@ ating .
"A@@ t this stage , my grand@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with increas@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , started to inclu@@ de in her d@@ ai@@ ly pr@@ ay@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get mar@@ ried so that I could s@@ et@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ried ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of s@@ et@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started comm@@ u@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a nom@@ ad , phys@@ ically and spir@@ itu@@ ally ."
"S@@ t@@ ories ac@@ company me , ke@@ e@@ ping my pi@@ ec@@ es and mem@@ ories together , like an ex@@ is@@ tenti@@ al g@@ lu@@ e ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , rec@@ ently , I &apos;ve also beg@@ un to think that they lo@@ se their mag@@ ic if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a subj@@ ect that I would love to think about together .
"When my first nov@@ el wr@@ it@@ ten in Engl@@ ish came out in America , I heard an interesting remar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"&quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I w@@ ish you had wr@@ it@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic char@@ ac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish char@@ ac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the nov@@ el took place on a univers@@ ity cam@@ p@@ us in Bo@@ st@@ on , so to me , it was normal that there be more intern@@ ational char@@ ac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish char@@ ac@@ ters , but I underst@@ ood what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also underst@@ ood that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the mani@@ f@@ est@@ ation of my identi@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identi@@ ty poli@@ tics aff@@ ects the way stories are being cir@@ cul@@ ated , read and re@@ vie@@ wed ."
"M@@ any auth@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but non-@@ W@@ es@@ tern auth@@ ors feel it more he@@ av@@ ily ."
"If you &apos;re a woman wr@@ iter from the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are exp@@ ected to wr@@ ite the stories of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ab@@ ly , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re exp@@ ected to wr@@ ite inform@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic stories and leave the experim@@ ent@@ al and av@@ an@@ t-@@ gar@@ de to your W@@ es@@ tern colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
What I experi@@ enc@@ ed as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are not seen as cre@@ ative individu@@ als on their own , but as the repres@@ ent@@ atives of their resp@@ ec@@ tive cul@@ tures : a few auth@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very dist@@ inc@@ tive , if not p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ."
The wr@@ iter and comm@@ u@@ ter J@@ am@@ es B@@ al@@ d@@ win gave an inter@@ view in 19@@ 8@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly asked about his hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vie@@ wer tried to p@@ ig@@ e@@ on@@ ho@@ le him as a g@@ ay wr@@ iter , B@@ al@@ d@@ win st@@ op@@ ped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en identi@@ ty poli@@ tics tries to put lab@@ els on us , it is our fre@@ e@@ dom of imagin@@ ation that is in d@@ anger ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ z@@ y cat@@ eg@@ ory called multi@@ cul@@ tural liter@@ ature in which all auth@@ ors from outside the W@@ es@@ tern world are l@@ um@@ ped together .
"I never for@@ get my first multi@@ cul@@ tural read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three wr@@ it@@ ers , one from the Ph@@ ili@@ p@@ p@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ es@@ ian — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shar@@ ed an arti@@ sti@@ c st@@ y@@ le or a liter@@ ary t@@ as@@ te .
It was only because of our pass@@ ports .
"M@@ ul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tural wr@@ it@@ ers are exp@@ ected to tell real stories , not so much the imagin@@ ary ."
A func@@ tion is at@@ tribu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the wr@@ it@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional char@@ ac@@ ters become the repres@@ ent@@ atives of something larg@@ er ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this tend@@ ency to see a story as more than a story does not sol@@ ely come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ enc@@ ed this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ tional char@@ ac@@ ters u@@ t@@ ter@@ ed in a nov@@ el .
"I had int@@ ended to wr@@ ite a construc@@ tive , multi@@ -@@ l@@ ay@@ ered nov@@ el about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My m@@ ic@@ r@@ o story became a m@@ ac@@ r@@ o issue when I was pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , others pr@@ ais@@ ed me for wr@@ iting about the T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian conf@@ lic@@ t ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both si@@ des that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to bel@@ it@@ tle my work ."
"I want to love and cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are enti@@ t@@ led to their political op@@ in@@ ions , and there are good political nov@@ els out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of d@@ ai@@ ly poli@@ tics ."
"C@@ he@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correc@@ t way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the l@@ at@@ ter is an arti@@ st &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity . &quot; &quot; I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics di@@ vi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion conn@@ ects .
One is interested in s@@ wee@@ ping gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
"The other , in nu@@ ances ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
The other recogni@@ z@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics is made of so@@ li@@ d br@@ ic@@ ks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ dd@@ ah . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ ff@@ ee hou@@ ses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often impro@@ vis@@ ing ."
"W@@ ith each new person in the story , the me@@ dd@@ ah would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ pers@@ on@@ ating that char@@ ac@@ ter ."
"E@@ ver@@ y@@ body could go and l@@ ist@@ en , you know — ordin@@ ary people , even the sul@@ t@@ an , M@@ us@@ lim@@ s and non-@@ M@@ us@@ lim@@ s ."
"S@@ t@@ ories cut across all b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ ales of N@@ as@@ re@@ dd@@ in H@@ od@@ j@@ a , &quot; &quot; which were very popul@@ ar thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans and A@@ si@@ a ."
"T@@ o@@ day , stories continue to trans@@ c@@ end bor@@ ders ."
"When P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian and Is@@ ra@@ el@@ i poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans talk , they usu@@ ally don &apos;t l@@ ist@@ en to each other , but a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian read@@ er still re@@ a@@ ds a nov@@ el by a J@@ e@@ w@@ ish auth@@ or , and vi@@ ce vers@@ a , connec@@ ting and emp@@ ath@@ iz@@ ing with the n@@ arr@@ ator ."
L@@ it@@ er@@ ature has to take us be@@ y@@ ond .
"If it cannot take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature ."
"B@@ oo@@ ks have sav@@ ed the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the d@@ anger of fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ iz@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ sti@@ c , R@@ um@@ i , met his spir@@ itu@@ al compan@@ ion , Sh@@ ams of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the l@@ at@@ ter did was to to@@ ss R@@ um@@ i &apos;s books into water and watch the let@@ ters dis@@ sol@@ ve ."
"The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ y@@ ond yourself is far wor@@ se than ign@@ or@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tural gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not l@@ ack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not be@@ y@@ ond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , dis@@ tant and dis@@ conn@@ ected ."
There &apos;s a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing compas@@ s .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the compas@@ s is st@@ ati@@ c , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , const@@ antly moving ."
"L@@ i@@ ke that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , with str@@ ong T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part trav@@ els the world , connec@@ ting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and univers@@ al , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the res@@ id@@ ence of O@@ t@@ tom@@ an sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 4@@ 00 years ."
"In the pal@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the favor@@ ite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ dings .
I &apos;m in@@ tr@@ ig@@ u@@ ed by this concept .
We usu@@ ally dis@@ tr@@ ust those areas that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the dom@@ ain of super@@ natural cre@@ atures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of s@@ mo@@ k@@ el@@ ess fi@@ re and are the sym@@ bo@@ l of el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ u@@ sive space is what wr@@ it@@ ers and arti@@ sts need most .
Wh@@ en I wr@@ ite fic@@ tion I cher@@ ish el@@ u@@ si@@ ven@@ ess and chang@@ e@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 p@@ ages later .
I like it when my char@@ ac@@ ters sur@@ prise me .
"I might wr@@ ite about a M@@ us@@ li@@ m woman in one nov@@ el , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might wr@@ ite about a hand@@ some , g@@ ay profess@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can wr@@ ite about anything and everything ."
"Au@@ dre L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fa@@ thers t@@ au@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She sugg@@ es@@ ted , &quot; &quot; I feel , ther@@ e@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful par@@ adi@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in cre@@ ative wr@@ iting cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we te@@ ach students is &quot; &quot; wr@@ ite what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
P@@ er@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ative liter@@ ature is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily about wr@@ iting who we are or what we know or what our identi@@ ty is about .
We should te@@ ach young people and ourselves to exp@@ and our hear@@ ts and wr@@ ite what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tural gh@@ et@@ to and go vis@@ it the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vis@@ h@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ cles be@@ y@@ ond cir@@ cles ."
"They conn@@ ect all human@@ ity , regard@@ less of identi@@ ty poli@@ tics , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ ish with an old Su@@ f@@ i po@@ em : &quot; &quot; Com@@ e , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ vers and lo@@ ved ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game design@@ er .
We do ach@@ i@@ eve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , collec@@ tiv@@ ely all the World of W@@ ar@@ cr@@ af@@ t gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtu@@ al problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing ."
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build str@@ ong@@ er social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t .
F@@ ive million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
H@@ is work is br@@ illi@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"B@@ e@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game contr@@ oll@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les ."
P@@ eople were suff@@ ering . P@@ eople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game ."
"We want to imagine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ach@@ i@@ eve the e@@ pi@@ c win ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a graphi@@ c nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in sk@@ ills like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sust@@ ain@@ ability , vision and res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do , called C@@ rai@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en squ@@ are miles . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies .
And the job in question was sh@@ e@@ ep ran@@ cher .
"My ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who hav@@ en &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an appr@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ities are to simply try and keep up and give an hon@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ e@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ rai@@ g and we ch@@ ec@@ k in to a h@@ ot@@ el and I realiz@@ e the next day that cas@@ tr@@ ation is going to be an absolu@@ te part of this work .
"So , nor@@ m@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y subj@@ ect , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tr@@ ay acc@@ ur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we certain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of resp@@ ect for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ um@@ ane So@@ ci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I &apos;m going to be cas@@ tr@@ ating some lam@@ b@@ s , C@@ an you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty str@@ ai@@ gh@@ t@@ forward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little sm@@ aller ."
"This one was actually around the pl@@ aying car@@ ds I got y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , but it had a certain famil@@ i@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is appl@@ i@@ ed to the t@@ ail , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is appl@@ i@@ ed to the s@@ cr@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ loo@@ d f@@ low is s@@ low@@ ly ret@@ ar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for f@@ un , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the lam@@ b@@ s and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of animal h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ ie is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b — two hands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the pos@@ t , she op@@ ens it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
"B@@ e@@ ing an appr@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ ck@@ et to pul@@ l out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that cau@@ ght the su@@ n that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ til@@ age of the t@@ ail , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the lam@@ b , and very quickly the t@@ ail was gone and in the b@@ uc@@ k@@ et that I was hol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well call@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ fin@@ ger , he had the s@@ cr@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gr@@ as@@ p ."
"And he pul@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Mi@@ cha@@ el — you don &apos;t , OK ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , thro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his sh@@ oul@@ der , and then gr@@ ab@@ s the s@@ cr@@ ot@@ um and p@@ us@@ h@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ ing my view , but what I hear is a sl@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a no@@ ise that sou@@ nds like V@@ el@@ cr@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a s@@ tic@@ ky w@@ all and I am not even k@@ id@@ ding ."
C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sho@@ ot , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ i@@ me out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no wr@@ iting , there &apos;s no s@@ cri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no n@@ on@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t fo@@ ol around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we sho@@ ot what we get !"
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is nu@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is cr@@ az@@ y .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are tes@@ tic@@ les in this b@@ uc@@ k@@ et and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him expl@@ ain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke the H@@ um@@ ane So@@ ci@@ ety ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the H@@ um@@ ane So@@ ci@@ ety ."
"L@@ et &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lam@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on tw@@ ice a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pul@@ ls out a b@@ a@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber ban@@ ds ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up another lam@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the pos@@ t , b@@ and goes on the t@@ ail , b@@ and goes on the s@@ cr@@ ot@@ um ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , lam@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , fall@@ s down , gets up , sh@@ a@@ kes a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , fall@@ s down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this lam@@ b , at all ."
"@@ G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qui@@ ver@@ ing , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvi@@ ous dis@@ tr@@ ess ."
"And I &apos;m looking at the lam@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ber@@ t , how long ?"
"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;"
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the lam@@ b that he had just did his little pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ anc@@ ing around , b@@ le@@ e@@ ding st@@ op@@ ped ."
"He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ bl@@ ing on some gr@@ ass , fro@@ lic@@ king ."
"And I was just so blo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second ."
"And I was re@@ min@@ ded how u@@ t@@ ter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time ."
"( Laughter ) And I was esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously sh@@ ort str@@ a@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these lam@@ b@@ s in the p@@ en , and sudd@@ en@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a G@@ er@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) M@@ el@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the pos@@ t , op@@ ens it up ."
Al@@ ber@@ t hands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .
"I go in , t@@ ail comes off ."
"I go in , I gr@@ a@@ b the s@@ cr@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ p comes off ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t in@@ struc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ ush it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do ."
&quot; P@@ ush it fur@@ ther . &quot;

"J@@ ust b@@ ite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words ."
"( Laughter ) Li@@ ke , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and sudd@@ en@@ ly , I &apos;m st@@ anding there , in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , and all I can think of is the Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ eli@@ an defin@@ ition of a tr@@ age@@ dy ."
"You know , Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le says a tr@@ age@@ dy is that moment when the her@@ o comes face to face with his true identi@@ ty ."
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this j@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ?"
"I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my si@@ ght , so I did what I had to do ."
I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding there with two tes@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t sh@@ ake the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; P@@ o@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come cr@@ ash@@ ing into my head that I hav@@ en &apos;t heard since my cl@@ ass@@ ics profess@@ or in colle@@ ge dr@@ ill@@ ed them there ."
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and per@@ i@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia .

An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the Gre@@ e@@ k word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the tran@@ si@@ tion from ign@@ or@@ ance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is ."
It &apos;s what our net@@ work does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my nec@@ k in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ es every single day .
Gre@@ at .
"The other word , per@@ i@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tr@@ age@@ dies , you know — Eu@@ ri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ oph@@ oc@@ les — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he sudd@@ en@@ ly realiz@@ es that ho@@ t ch@@ ick he &apos;s been s@@ le@@ e@@ ping with and having bab@@ ies with is his mother . OK ."
That &apos;s per@@ i@@ p@@ ety or per@@ i@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia .
And this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and per@@ i@@ peti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great dev@@ ice though ."
"When you start to look for per@@ i@@ peti@@ a , you find it every@@ where ."
"I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ ill@@ is in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"S@@ pend@@ s the whole mo@@ vie trying to help the little ki@@ d who se@@ es d@@ ead people , and then , bo@@ om — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m d@@ ead &quot; &quot; — per@@ i@@ peti@@ a ."
You know ?
It &apos;s cr@@ us@@ h@@ ing when the audience se@@ es it the right way .
"N@@ e@@ o in &quot; &quot; The M@@ atri@@ x , &quot; &quot; you know ?"
"&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s we@@ ird ."
"These disco@@ ver@@ ies that l@@ ead to sudd@@ en realiz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dir@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dr@@ ill@@ ed something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for ."
"And , as I sto@@ od there , looking at the happy lam@@ b that I had just de@@ fil@@ ed — but it looked OK ."
"L@@ oo@@ king at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struc@@ k by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other per@@ i@@ pat@@ e@@ tic mis@@ concep@@ tions might I be able to comment u@@ pon ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ thro@@ po@@ log@@ ist but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey Mi@@ ke ."
"L@@ o@@ ok , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realiz@@ e you &apos;ve sho@@ t in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in f@@ ish@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every maj@@ or indus@@ try ."
"You &apos;ve had your back sh@@ oul@@ der to sh@@ oul@@ der with these guys that our poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans are des@@ per@@ ate to rel@@ ate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ ill@@ ary doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ y@@ e , dri@@ b@@ bl@@ ing down her ch@@ in , with the ste@@ el wor@@ kers ."
"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , collec@@ tiv@@ ely , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , tes@@ tic@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ c@@ ing around ."
"And , after that sho@@ ot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , pers@@ on@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ sum@@ ing are s@@ acro@@ s@@ anc@@ t , and they &apos;re not ."
P@@ eople with dir@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are happ@@ ier than you think .
"As a group , they &apos;re the happ@@ i@@ est people I know ."
"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok for the Uni@@ on L@@ ab@@ el , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ ker cr@@ a@@ p ."
I &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ anc@@ ed people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
R@@ o@@ ad@@ k@@ ill pic@@ k@@ er@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I s@@ w@@ ear to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sym@@ me@@ try to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we chall@@ eng@@ ed some of these sac@@ red co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — what could possi@@ bly be wrong with that ?
Pro@@ bab@@ ly the wor@@ st ad@@ vi@@ ce I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ ams and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — Bo@@ b C@@ omb@@ s , the pi@@ g far@@ mer in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as who coll@@ ects the un@@ e@@ at@@ en s@@ cr@@ ap@@ s of food from the cas@@ in@@ os and fe@@ e@@ ds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prot@@ ein in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his p@@ ig@@ s grow at tw@@ ice the normal spe@@ ed , and he is one r@@ ich pi@@ g far@@ mer , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ ends his days doing this incredible service , and he sm@@ el@@ ls like h@@ ell , but God bl@@ ess him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d l@@ aug@@ h at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got off@@ ered like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ eg@@ as ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his pas@@ sion .
He st@@ ep@@ ped back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a d@@ ai@@ ry far@@ mer in New C@@ an@@ a@@ an , C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut , who w@@ o@@ ke up one day and realized the cr@@ a@@ p from his co@@ ws was wor@@ th more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bio@@ de@@ grad@@ able flo@@ wer po@@ ts ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his pas@@ sion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at pas@@ sion , I started to look at eff@@ ici@@ ency ver@@ sus effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess — as T@@ i@@ m tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge dist@@ inc@@ tion ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and det@@ er@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; succ@@ ess@@ ories &quot; &quot; that h@@ an@@ g with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ z@@ y art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s sudd@@ en@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ af@@ ety — s@@ af@@ ety first ?
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ um@@ ane So@@ ci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really s@@ af@@ ety third ?"
Right ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I value my s@@ af@@ ety on these cr@@ az@@ y j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about s@@ af@@ ety first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ ering S@@ e@@ a , I was on a cr@@ a@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; D@@ ea@@ d@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 miles off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 5@@ 0@@ -@@ fo@@ ot se@@ as , big w@@ aves , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"M@@ o@@ st h@@ az@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , l@@ ash@@ ing the po@@ ts down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the dec@@ k , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean ."
Un@@ spea@@ k@@ ab@@ ly danger@@ ous .
"I sc@@ am@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ d@@ ul@@ ity , &quot; C@@ ap@@ t@@ ain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ ce@@ an . &quot; &quot; And he points out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ t@@ ory flo@@ or or any construction site .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he call@@ s me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ t@@ ain of a cr@@ a@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"My respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity is to get you home r@@ ich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , s@@ af@@ ety first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this f@@ al@@ se — this sense of compl@@ ac@@ ency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity as though it &apos;s our own , and vi@@ ce vers@@ a ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at l@@ eng@@ th about the many little dist@@ inc@@ tions we made and the end@@ less l@@ ist of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I form@@ ed a the@@ ory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ main@@ ing two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a civi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a c@@ old war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ st@@ a@@ che in some M@@ ach@@ i@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on at least four fron@@ ts , certain@@ ly in H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood ."
The way we por@@ tr@@ ay working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s l@@ augh@@ able .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 3@@ 00 pou@@ nds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cr@@ ack . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ unch l@@ ines ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on M@@ a@@ dis@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the commer@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little fas@@ ter , if you could p@@ unch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that aff@@ ect the bot@@ tom line reality of the av@@ ail@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ il@@ ic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , I mean — how many people have an i@@ Ph@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re plu@@ gg@@ ed in ; we &apos;re conn@@ ected .
I would never sugg@@ est for a second that something bad has come out of the t@@ ech re@@ volution .
"@@ G@@ ood gri@@ ef , not to this cro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would sugg@@ est that innovation without im@@ itation is a comple@@ te was@@ te of time .
And no@@ body cel@@ e@@ br@@ ates im@@ itation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our i@@ Ph@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try , the same bo@@ ard , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the gen@@ i@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know ."
O@@ ur to@@ ols today don &apos;t look like sho@@ v@@ els and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the collec@@ tive eff@@ ect of all of that has been this mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too l@@ ate in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the tes@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n for work , man@@ u@@ al lab@@ or , sk@@ ill@@ ed lab@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten bene@@ f@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about grand@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
B@@ ar@@ ack w@@ ants to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The infrastruc@@ ture is a huge deal .
"This war on work , that I sup@@ pose ex@@ ists , has ca@@ su@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The infrastruc@@ ture &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ lin@@ ing tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electr@@ ici@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers , fe@@ wer pl@@ um@@ bers , fe@@ wer w@@ el@@ ders , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The infrastruc@@ ture j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about cre@@ ating are those guys — the ones that have been in dec@@ line , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tr@@ il@@ lion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American So@@ ci@@ ety of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l En@@ g@@ ine@@ ers — that we need to ex@@ pen@@ d to even make a dent in the infrastruc@@ ture , which is curr@@ ently r@@ ated at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were run@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to s@@ tic@@ k un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate things that are n@@ ear and d@@ ear to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and dir@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ pos@@ ites ."
"They &apos;re two si@@ des of the same co@@ in , just like innovation and im@@ itation , like risk and respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity , like per@@ i@@ peti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that poor little lam@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ orm@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ priv@@ ed women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ w@@ o-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half years ago , I f@@ ain@@ ted from ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ e@@ k@@ bone , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the value of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with medic@@ al doc@@ tors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more insp@@ i@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to l@@ ead the way in this new re@@ volution , this new fem@@ in@@ ist issue ."
"We are literally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , literally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tu@@ nat@@ ely for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation has become a vir@@ il@@ ity sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who br@@ ag@@ g@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ spec@@ i@@ ally here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a bre@@ ak@@ fast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ illi@@ ant leaders in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making terri@@ ble dec@@ is@@ ions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lea@@ der , because the ess@@ ence of lea@@ der@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ itting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ is@@ ters , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ conn@@ ected 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a s@@ ister would have no@@ tic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ o@@ ken up from a s@@ ev@@ en-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple cr@@ is@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a pers@@ onal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gr@@ ati@@ tu@@ de , effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that lie inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Chr@@ is poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the func@@ tions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this ent@@ ails .
"H@@ ere is this mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ pou@@ nd mas@@ s of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can cont@@ empl@@ ate the vas@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space ."
It can cont@@ empl@@ ate the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can cont@@ empl@@ ate itself cont@@ empl@@ ating on the me@@ an@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gr@@ ail of neuro@@ science , of neuro@@ lo@@ gy , and hop@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ er@@ ious org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little w@@ is@@ ps of prot@@ o@@ plas@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this activ@@ ity emer@@ ges the whole spec@@ tru@@ m of abil@@ ities that we call human nature and human consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the func@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with sust@@ ained dam@@ age to a small re@@ gion of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gen@@ e@@ tic change in a small re@@ gion of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental capac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cogni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive lo@@ ss of one func@@ tion , with other func@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some confi@@ d@@ ence in ass@@ er@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how invol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that func@@ tion ."
"So you can then ma@@ p func@@ tion on@@ to structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular func@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few str@@ i@@ king exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extraordin@@ ary syn@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as syn@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ por@@ al lo@@ bes , fron@@ t@@ al lo@@ bes , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lo@@ bes , OK — the lo@@ bes that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ c@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the tem@@ por@@ al lo@@ bes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , you can no longer recogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogni@@ ze them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh y@@ eah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogni@@ ze yourself in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
OK . Now that syn@@ dr@@ ome is well known as caus@@ ed by dam@@ age to the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are syn@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phys@@ ici@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ log@@ ists ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as del@@ u@@ sion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely normal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pret@@ ending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is perf@@ ect@@ ly lu@@ ci@@ d and intellig@@ ent in all other resp@@ ects , but when he se@@ es his mother , his del@@ u@@ sion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ a@@ try t@@ ext@@ books , is a F@@ reu@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ gu@@ ment appl@@ ies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little bab@@ y , a young bab@@ y , you had a str@@ ong sex@@ u@@ al attr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us complex of F@@ reu@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stand@@ ard F@@ reu@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent sex@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be sex@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dam@@ ag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent sex@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the surface , and sudd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ expl@@ ic@@ ab@@ ly you find yourself being sex@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being sex@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pret@@ ation that makes sense to your dam@@ ag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ gu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ ious , as all F@@ reu@@ di@@ an arg@@ uments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same del@@ u@@ sion , a patient having the same del@@ u@@ sion , about his p@@ et po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ reu@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent bes@@ ti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to expl@@ ain this curi@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the structure and func@@ tions of the normal visu@@ al p@@ ath@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ orm@@ ally , visu@@ al sign@@ als come in , into the ey@@ e@@ b@@ all@@ s , go to the visu@@ al areas in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concer@@ ned with just vision , and after proc@@ ess@@ ing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , you lo@@ se the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the message cas@@ c@@ ades into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional core of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ aug@@ es the emo@@ tional signific@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something absolu@@ tely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ no@@ re .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then cas@@ c@@ ade into the aut@@ onom@@ ic ner@@ vous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fas@@ ter .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cul@@ ar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tun@@ ate , because we can put two el@@ ec@@ tro@@ des on your pal@@ m and mea@@ sure the change in sk@@ in res@@ ist@@ ance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can det@@ er@@ mine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an obj@@ ect , when he looks at his — any obj@@ ect for that matter , it goes to the visu@@ al areas and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ essed in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , and you recogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the message cas@@ c@@ ades into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the aut@@ onom@@ ic ner@@ vous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional core of the brain , is cut by the ac@@ cident ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh y@@ eah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is cut to the emo@@ tional cent@@ ers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a w@@ arm@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? Right ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ expl@@ ic@@ able l@@ ack of emo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some str@@ ange woman pret@@ ending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and mea@@ sure your gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can mea@@ sure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an obj@@ ect , like a table or an um@@ b@@ rel@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ w@@ ish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?"
You take the patient and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and mea@@ sure his gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ables and ch@@ ai@@ rs and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the visu@@ al areas to the emo@@ tional cent@@ ers is cut ."
"So his vision is normal because the visu@@ al areas are normal , his emo@@ tions are normal — he &apos;ll l@@ aug@@ h , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vision to emo@@ tions is cut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this del@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ v@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ingly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , neur@@ al psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c syn@@ dr@@ ome and say that the stand@@ ard F@@ reu@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a pre@@ c@@ ise ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known neur@@ al an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — phones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no del@@ u@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate p@@ ath@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cent@@ ers in the brain to the emo@@ tional cent@@ ers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the ac@@ cident ."
"So this expl@@ ains why through the phone he recogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this complex cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another curi@@ ous syn@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you lo@@ se it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ ious problem — you continue to vi@@ vi@@ d@@ ly feel the pres@@ ence of that m@@ iss@@ ing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with intern@@ al vis@@ cer@@ a ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ect@@ om@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ stru@@ al cr@@ am@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stu@@ dent asked me the other day , &quot; D@@ o they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A subj@@ ect ri@@ pe for scientifi@@ c en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we hav@@ en &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s cl@@ ai@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ oul@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll w@@ ave go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"These are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sens@@ ations ."
The patient &apos;s not del@@ u@@ si@@ onal .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ sor@@ y experience for the patient ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ aly@@ zed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ aly@@ zed ?"
It sou@@ nds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ aly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b@@ s , the origin@@ al ar@@ m was par@@ aly@@ zed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ur@@ y ."
"The actu@@ al ner@@ ve suppl@@ ying the ar@@ m was s@@ ever@@ ed , was cut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ cident ."
"So the patient had an actu@@ al ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ided at@@ temp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pain in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ tat@@ es the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same p@@ ains , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ ious clin@@ ical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pr@@ essed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , OK ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this syn@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ aly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an actu@@ al ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves suppl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been cut , and the actu@@ al ar@@ m had been par@@ aly@@ zed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for s@@ ever@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pain then gets car@@ ried over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ aly@@ zed , the brain s@@ ends comm@@ ands to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visu@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ i@@ try of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , OK ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , associ@@ ative lin@@ k , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sens@@ ation of a par@@ aly@@ zed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ aly@@ s@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"H@@ ow do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him visu@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pain , the ph@@ an@@ tom cr@@ am@@ p ."
"H@@ ow do you do that ? Well , virtu@@ al reality ."
But that co@@ sts millions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fun@@ ding ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ard box with a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first patient , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ ach@@ ial av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the ar@@ m was par@@ aly@@ zed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , ex@@ cru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ aly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the patient pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and the normal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ection of the normal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fin@@ g@@ ers , or move your real fin@@ g@@ ers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visu@@ al impression that the ph@@ an@@ tom is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the as@@ t@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again , and the pain , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ fl@@ ection of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ g@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sor@@ y experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !"
And my pain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lo@@ se your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes ."
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a c@@ and@@ y sto@@ re ."
"So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my the@@ ory about learned par@@ aly@@ s@@ is and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of visu@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ aly@@ s@@ is that you see in neuro@@ lo@@ gy , like str@@ o@@ ke , foc@@ al dy@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned com@@ pon@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple dev@@ ice of using a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and pr@@ acti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ ay@@ be , after a per@@ i@@ od of pr@@ acti@@ ce , you can dis@@ pense with the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , and start moving your par@@ aly@@ zed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subj@@ ects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ ar@@ m pain , all those p@@ ains are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ oul@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and el@@ im@@ in@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom fin@@ g@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous sen@@ sor@@ y conf@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"On the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sign@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this conf@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ ial — it g@@ ates the sign@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the bon@@ us is , the pain dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died pain flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us ."
"Now , this techni@@ que has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ sin@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pain , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for str@@ o@@ ke re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you nor@@ m@@ ally think of as dam@@ age to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some com@@ pon@@ ent of str@@ o@@ ke par@@ aly@@ s@@ is is also learned par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , and maybe that com@@ pon@@ ent can be over@@ come using mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also gone through clin@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curi@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
This was disco@@ vered by Fr@@ anc@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ in@@ et@@ e@@ ent@@ h century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ win .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ w@@ ise completely normal , had the fol@@ lo@@ wing p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colo@@ red ."
"F@@ ive is bl@@ ue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is indi@@ go , OK ?"
"B@@ ear in mind , these people are completely normal in other resp@@ ects ."
"O@@ r C shar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke colo@@ r ."
"@@ C shar@@ p is bl@@ ue , F shar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia . G@@ al@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ inc@@ t ."
These people mu@@ dd@@ le up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two asp@@ ects of this problem are very in@@ tr@@ ig@@ u@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia r@@ uns in famil@@ ies , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gen@@ e@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ ec@@ ond@@ ly , syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main them@@ e of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ativ@@ ity — syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia is eight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , nov@@ el@@ ists and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ? What cau@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One the@@ ory is they &apos;re just cr@@ az@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scientifi@@ c the@@ ory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther the@@ ory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third the@@ ory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia . All right ?"
"So , we found that the colo@@ r area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ cid@@ ent@@ al cro@@ ss w@@ ir@@ ing between colo@@ r and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding colo@@ r , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cro@@ ss@@ ed wi@@ res in some people ?
R@@ em@@ ember I said it r@@ uns in famil@@ ies ?
That gi@@ ves you the c@@ lu@@ e .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ normal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that cau@@ ses this ab@@ normal cro@@ ss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain re@@ gion is wi@@ red to every other re@@ gion , and these are tr@@ im@@ m@@ ed down to create the char@@ acter@@ is@@ tic mod@@ ular architecture of the adul@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e caus@@ ing this tr@@ im@@ m@@ ing and if that gen@@ e mu@@ tat@@ es , then you get de@@ fici@@ ent tr@@ im@@ m@@ ing between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain areas ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and colo@@ r , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ colo@@ r syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and colo@@ r , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ colo@@ r syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pr@@ essed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cro@@ ss@@ -@@ conn@@ ected ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , nov@@ el@@ ists and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king se@@ em@@ ingly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the S@@ un . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a glo@@ wing ball of fi@@ re ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater cro@@ ss w@@ ir@@ ing and concep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pens@@ ity to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ ativ@@ ity in people with syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ cid@@ ence of syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and nov@@ el@@ ists ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ olo@@ gical view of syn@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ ia ."
The last dem@@ on@@ str@@ ation — can I take one minute ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ es@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in den@@ ial about it ."
"H@@ ere &apos;s what I call M@@ arti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et . J@@ ust like your al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent sh@@ ap@@ es for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"H@@ ere , you &apos;ve got M@@ arti@@ an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et ."
"One of them is K@@ i@@ k@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
Wh@@ ich one is K@@ i@@ k@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ aise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ t@@ ants ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i ? R@@ aise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a M@@ arti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cro@@ ss@@ -@@ model syn@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ action , me@@ an@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ection — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the h@@ air cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ i@@ k@@ i , m@@ im@@ ics the visu@@ al in@@ fl@@ ection , sudd@@ en in@@ fl@@ ection of that j@@ ag@@ g@@ ed sh@@ ape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engag@@ ing in a prim@@ i@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly il@@ lu@@ sion , but these phot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sh@@ ape , and h@@ air cells in your ear are exc@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory pat@@ tern , but the brain is able to extr@@ act the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a prim@@ i@@ tive form of ab@@ str@@ action , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , these people lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ i@@ k@@ i , but they also lo@@ se the ability to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not g@@ old , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s met@@ al@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s g@@ old ."
"You have to mea@@ sure its spec@@ ifi@@ c grav@@ ity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical me@@ an@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about eight times the size in high@@ er — esp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in humans — as in lo@@ wer prim@@ ates ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ular gy@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cro@@ ss@@ ro@@ a@@ ds between hear@@ ing , vision and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ orm@@ ous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ quel@@ y human abil@@ ities like ab@@ str@@ action , met@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ ativ@@ ity ."
"A@@ ll of these questions that phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ers have been stu@@ d@@ ying for m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a , we scientists can beg@@ in to explo@@ re by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stu@@ d@@ ying patients and as@@ king the right questions ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) S@@ or@@ ry about that .

This story is about taking imagin@@ ation ser@@ i@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this ordin@@ ary material , f@@ ish@@ n@@ et , used the same way for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , bil@@ lo@@ wing , volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous form@@ s the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ g@@ ed buil@@ dings in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ lik@@ ely person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ died s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or architecture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I appl@@ i@@ ed to seven art scho@@ ols and was re@@ j@@ ected by all seven ."
"I went off on my own to become an arti@@ st , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was off@@ ered a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"P@@ rom@@ is@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pain@@ t@@ ings , I shi@@ p@@ ped my pain@@ ts and arri@@ ved in M@@ a@@ hab@@ ali@@ pu@@ ra@@ m ."
The d@@ ea@@ d@@ line for the show arri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This f@@ ish@@ ing village was fam@@ ous for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tried br@@ on@@ ze cas@@ ting .
But to make large form@@ s was too he@@ av@@ y and ex@@ pen@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the f@@ ish@@ er@@ men b@@ un@@ d@@ le their ne@@ ts into m@@ oun@@ ds on the sand ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make vol@@ um@@ e@@ tri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d mater@@ i@@ als ."
My first s@@ atis@@ f@@ ying s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture was made in collabor@@ ation with these f@@ ish@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tr@@ ait ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ ide H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ is@@ ted them on po@@ les to photograp@@ h .
I disco@@ vered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ p@@ ple of w@@ ind in const@@ antly changing pat@@ tern@@ s .
I was mes@@ mer@@ iz@@ ed .
"I continu@@ ed stu@@ d@@ ying cr@@ af@@ t tradi@@ tions and collabor@@ ating with arti@@ sans , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace ma@@ kers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine det@@ ail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larg@@ er — to shi@@ ft from being an obj@@ ect you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to India to work with those f@@ ish@@ er@@ men , we made a n@@ et of a million and a half hand@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — inst@@ all@@ ed bri@@ e@@ fly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ou@@ sands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist M@@ an@@ u@@ al S@@ ol@@ a-@@ M@@ or@@ ales who was re@@ design@@ ing the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pres@@ er@@ ve my art .
"D@@ ur@@ able , engine@@ ered , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ position to i@@ di@@ o@@ syn@@ crati@@ c , del@@ ic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al ."
"For two years , I se@@ arch@@ ed for a fi@@ ber that could sur@@ vi@@ ve ul@@ trav@@ i@@ ol@@ et r@@ ays , sal@@ t , air , pol@@ lu@@ tion , and at the same time rem@@ ain so@@ ft enough to move flu@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to hold the n@@ et up out there in the middle of the tra@@ ff@@ ic cir@@ cle .
"So we rais@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ pou@@ nd ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an average bre@@ e@@ ze and sur@@ vi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a br@@ illi@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who design@@ s s@@ ails for America &apos;s C@@ up rac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts nam@@ ed P@@ eter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me t@@ ack@@ le the tw@@ in chall@@ eng@@ es of pre@@ c@@ ise sh@@ ape and g@@ ent@@ le mo@@ vement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ st@@ and a h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane .
"So I developed a relation@@ ship with an industri@@ al f@@ ish@@ n@@ et fac@@ t@@ ory , learned the vari@@ ables of their machines , and figu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ l@@ ate this anci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ o@@ syn@@ crati@@ c hand@@ cr@@ af@@ t into something machine oper@@ at@@ ors could produce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we rais@@ ed this 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ fo@@ ot l@@ ace n@@ et ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had imagin@@ ed was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ l@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ sec@@ tion had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ograp@@ h@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , conn@@ ected to lim@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ as@@ es of s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ aces of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ ist@@ or@@ ic Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia C@@ ity H@@ all : its pl@@ az@@ a , I felt , needed a material for s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than n@@ etting ."
"So we experim@@ ented with tiny at@@ om@@ iz@@ ed water parti@@ cles to create a dr@@ y mis@@ t that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in tes@@ ting , disco@@ vered that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture material to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tr@@ ains abo@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ r@@ ay of the city &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ext challenge , the Bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Amer@@ ic@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I repres@@ ent the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ es@@ tern h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere and their inter@@ connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said y@@ es ."
I read about the rec@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in C@@ hi@@ le and the t@@ su@@ nam@@ i that ri@@ ppl@@ ed across the entire P@@ ac@@ ifi@@ c O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ect@@ on@@ ic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s r@@ ot@@ ation and literally sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed the l@@ eng@@ th of the day ."
"So I cont@@ ac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , and trans@@ l@@ ated it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of micro@@ secon@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sh@@ ape was too complex now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the met@@ al ar@@ mat@@ ure with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine mes@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times str@@ ong@@ er than ste@@ el ."
"The s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ re@@ ly so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to ex@@ is@@ ting buil@@ dings — literally be@@ coming part of the fabri@@ c of the city ."
There was no so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex n@@ et form@@ s and model them with grav@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity as@@ king if I could adap@@ t these concep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ igh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tural me@@ th@@ od en@@ ables me to model these and build these s@@ cul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ s@@ cr@@ ap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fun@@ ding yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I se@@ arch@@ ed for beau@@ ty in the tradi@@ tional things , in cr@@ af@@ t form@@ s ."
"Now I comb@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ t@@ ech mater@@ i@@ als and engine@@ ering to create volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lo@@ wing form@@ s the scale of buil@@ dings ."
My arti@@ sti@@ c hor@@ iz@@ ons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ ix .
"A@@ n att@@ or@@ ney in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interested in art , never vis@@ ited the local art mus@@ eu@@ m , dr@@ ag@@ g@@ ed everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down under@@ ne@@ ath the s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , l@@ aying in the gr@@ ass , no@@ tic@@ ing the changing pat@@ tern@@ s of w@@ ind bes@@ ide people they didn &apos;t know , shar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al ax@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pu@@ ber@@ ty , we f@@ all off the ma@@ p ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
So when I was a ki@@ d ...
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve hea@@ ded in this direction .
So let &apos;s look though at the four cho@@ ices we are making right now .
M@@ any people don &apos;t know this but tun@@ a are w@@ arm@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded .
"There are over 3@@ ,000 dam@@ s in the state of C@@ onn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut ."
I essenti@@ ally became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvi@@ ous that the two h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ er@@ es are completely se@@ par@@ ate from one another ."
Ex@@ cu@@ se me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a jo@@ y .
"In@@ form@@ ation , in the form of energy , stre@@ ams in simul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously through all of our sen@@ sor@@ y systems and then it explo@@ des into this en@@ orm@@ ous coll@@ age of what this pres@@ ent moment looks like , what this pres@@ ent moment sm@@ el@@ ls like and t@@ as@@ tes like , what it fe@@ els like and what it sou@@ nds like ."
I am an ener@@ gy@@ -@@ being conn@@ ected to the energy all around me through the consci@@ ous@@ ness of my right h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere .
"And in this moment we are perf@@ ect , we are whole and we are beautiful ."
"My left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere , our left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere , is a very different place ."
O@@ ur left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere thin@@ ks lin@@ early and me@@ tho@@ dic@@ ally .
And our left h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ ere thin@@ ks in language .
And all I could det@@ ect was this energy — energy .
"And I &apos;m as@@ king myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?"
And I felt li@@ gh@@ ter in my body .
