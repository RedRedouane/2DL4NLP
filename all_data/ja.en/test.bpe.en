"B@@ y the end of this year , there &apos;ll be ne@@ arly a billion people on this planet that ac@@ tively use social net@@ working sit@@ es ."
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
"Wh@@ ile that might be a some@@ what mor@@ b@@ id thought , I think it has some really pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations that are wor@@ th expl@@ or@@ ing ."
"What first got me thinking about this was a b@@ lo@@ g p@@ ost au@@ th@@ o@@ red ear@@ li@@ er this year by D@@ er@@ e@@ k K@@ . M@@ ill@@ er , who was a science and technology jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist who died of cancer ."
And what M@@ ill@@ er did was have his family and friends write a p@@ ost that went out sh@@ or@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m de@@ ad , and this is my last p@@ ost to my b@@ lo@@ g ."
"In adv@@ ance , I asked that once my body finally sh@@ ut down from the p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publi@@ sh this pre@@ par@@ ed message I wrote — the first part of the process of tur@@ ning this from an ac@@ tive we@@ b@@ site to an arch@@ ive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist , M@@ ill@@ er &apos;s arch@@ ive may have been better writ@@ ten and more care@@ fully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an arch@@ ive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any pre@@ vi@@ ous generation ."
Con@@ si@@ der a few st@@ ats for a moment .
Right now there are 4@@ 8 hours of video being up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be every single minut@@ e .
There are 20@@ 0 million T@@ wee@@ ts being pos@@ ted every day .
And the average F@@ ace@@ book us@@ er is creating 9@@ 0 piec@@ es of cont@@ ent each mon@@ th .
"So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some phot@@ os or home vide@@ os , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box some@@ where ."
"But today we &apos;re all creating this incredi@@ bly r@@ ich digital arch@@ ive that &apos;s going to live in the cl@@ ou@@ d in@@ defin@@ it@@ ely , years after we &apos;re gone ."
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredi@@ bly in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing opport@@ unities for techno@@ logi@@ sts .
"Now to be clear , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist and not a techno@@ log@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do bri@@ e@@ fly is pa@@ int a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like ."
Now we &apos;re already seeing some serv@@ ices that are designed to let us deci@@ de what happens to our on@@ line pro@@ fi@@ le and our social media ac@@ coun@@ ts after we die .
"One of them actually , f@@ it@@ t@@ ingly enough , found me when I ch@@ ec@@ ked into a d@@ el@@ i at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in New York on f@@ our@@ squ@@ are ."
( R@@ ec@@ or@@ ding ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ st@@ row : H@@ ell@@ o .
D@@ e@@ ath : A@@ d@@ am ?
A@@ O : Yeah .
"D@@ e@@ ath : D@@ e@@ ath can cat@@ ch you any@@ where , any@@ time , even at the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ ic ."
A@@ O : Wh@@ o is this ?
D@@ e@@ ath : G@@ o to i@@ fi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too l@@ ate .
"( Laughter ) A@@ d@@ am O@@ st@@ row : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?"
"So what that serv@@ ice does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be pos@@ ted to F@@ ace@@ book after you die ."
"A@@ no@@ ther serv@@ ice right now is called 1@@ ,000 M@@ em@@ ories ."
"And what this le@@ ts you do is create an on@@ line tri@@ bu@@ te to your lo@@ ved ones , comple@@ te with phot@@ os and vide@@ os and stories that they can p@@ ost after you die ."
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
"Now a lot of you are probably famili@@ ar with D@@ e@@ b R@@ o@@ y who , back in M@@ ar@@ ch , de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated how he was able to anal@@ y@@ ze more than 9@@ 0@@ ,000 hours of home video ."
"I think as mach@@ ines &apos; ability to understand human language and process v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of data contin@@ ues to impro@@ ve , it &apos;s going to become possible to anal@@ y@@ ze an entire life &apos;s wor@@ th of cont@@ ent — the T@@ wee@@ ts , the phot@@ os , the vide@@ os , the b@@ lo@@ g pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re produc@@ ing in such mas@@ sive numbers ."
"And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital person@@ as to contin@@ ue to inter@@ act in the real world long after we &apos;re gone th@@ an@@ ks to the v@@ ast@@ ness of the amount of cont@@ ent we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all ."
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experim@@ ents here .
"One serv@@ ice called My N@@ ext T@@ we@@ et anal@@ y@@ z@@ es your entire T@@ wit@@ ter stre@@ am , everything you &apos;ve pos@@ ted onto T@@ wit@@ ter , to make some predic@@ tions as to what you might say next ."
"Well right now , as you can see , the res@@ ults can be some@@ what com@@ ical ."
"You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our tech@@ n@@ ical cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties impro@@ ve ."
"T@@ a@@ king it a step fur@@ ther , M@@ I@@ T &apos;s media lab is working on ro@@ bot@@ s that can inter@@ act more like humans ."
But what if those ro@@ bot@@ s were able to inter@@ act based on the uni@@ que charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of a speci@@ fic person based on the hundreds of thousands of piec@@ es of cont@@ ent that person produc@@ es in their li@@ fe@@ time ?
"F@@ in@@ ally , think back to this fam@@ ous sc@@ en@@ e from elec@@ tion night 200@@ 8 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ am@@ ed a live ho@@ lo@@ gra@@ m of hi@@ p h@@ op arti@@ st w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their stu@@ di@@ o for an inter@@ view with An@@ der@@ son C@@ o@@ op@@ er ."
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to be@@ am a re@@ pres@@ en@@ tation of our lo@@ ved ones into our living ro@@ oms — inter@@ ac@@ ting in a very li@@ fe@@ like way based on all the cont@@ ent they created while they were ali@@ ve ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re produc@@ ing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both exp@@ and exp@@ on@@ entially .
"Now in clos@@ ing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a defin@@ i@@ tion of life and everything that comes after it ."
Thank you very much .

Pe@@ ople re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak : I call them rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers .
"These are people who have taken care@@ er brea@@ ks for el@@ der care , for chil@@ d@@ care reasons , pur@@ su@@ ing a personal inter@@ est or a personal health issue ."
"C@@ l@@ os@@ ely rel@@ ated are care@@ er tran@@ si@@ tion@@ ers of all kinds : ve@@ ter@@ ans , mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ous@@ es , re@@ ti@@ re@@ es coming out of re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment or re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ating exp@@ ats ."
This dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
"Now , success@@ ful rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are every@@ where and in every field ."
He &apos;s a nuclear phys@@ ic@@ ist in the U@@ K who took a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak to be home with his five children .
"And spea@@ king of long care@@ er brea@@ ks , this is M@@ im@@ i K@@ a@@ h@@ n ."
"She &apos;s a social wor@@ ker in O@@ ran@@ ge C@@ oun@@ ty , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , who re@@ turned to work in a social serv@@ ices organiz@@ ation after a 25@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
That &apos;s the lon@@ gest care@@ er bre@@ ak that I &apos;m aw@@ are of .
"And this is T@@ r@@ acy S@@ h@@ ap@@ ir@@ o , who took a 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year care@@ er bre@@ ak ."
"T@@ r@@ acy wrote in that she was a mo@@ m of five who lo@@ ved her time at home , but she had gone through a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and needed to re@@ turn to work , pl@@ us she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she lo@@ ved working ."
T@@ r@@ acy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
"She was looking for a fin@@ ance or ac@@ coun@@ ting ro@@ le , and she had just spent the last n@@ ine months very di@@ lig@@ ently re@@ sear@@ ching companies on@@ line and ap@@ pl@@ ying for j@@ ob@@ s with no res@@ ults ."
"I met T@@ r@@ acy in J@@ un@@ e of 20@@ 11 , when the T@@ o@@ day S@@ how asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around ."
The first thing I told T@@ r@@ acy was she had to get out of the house .
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her inter@@ est in re@@ tur@@ ning to work .
"I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversa@@ tions that don &apos;t go any@@ where ."
"E@@ x@@ p@@ ect that , and don &apos;t be di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged by it ."
"And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is f@@ ro@@ z@@ en in time ."
"And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has di@@ min@@ i@@ shed over time , as happens with so many of us the far@@ ther re@@ moved we are from our prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al identi@@ ties ."
"So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this ."
And that was that I har@@ dly ke@@ pt up with the business news .
"I believe rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are a ge@@ m of the wor@@ k@@ force , and here &apos;s why ."
We have fe@@ wer sp@@ ous@@ al or part@@ ner job re@@ loc@@ ations .
We &apos;re in a more se@@ t@@ t@@ led time of life .
We have great work experience .
We have a more mat@@ ure per@@ spec@@ tive .
We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er &apos;s exp@@ en@@ se .
"P@@ l@@ us we have an energy , an en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m about re@@ tur@@ ning to work preci@@ se@@ ly because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while ."
"O@@ n the f@@ li@@ p side , I speak with emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers , and here are two con@@ cer@@ ns that emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers have about h@@ ir@@ ing rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers ."
"The first one is , emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers are wor@@ ried that rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers are techno@@ log@@ ically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te ."
I had done my fin@@ anci@@ al anal@@ ys@@ is so long ago that I used L@@ ot@@ us 1@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3 .
"I don &apos;t know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to re@@ learn it on E@@ x@@ c@@ el ."
I tell rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers that emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers exp@@ ect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of bas@@ ic off@@ ice manag@@ ement sof@@ tw@@ are .
"And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their respon@@ si@@ bility to get there ."
And they do .
That &apos;s not the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er &apos;s job .
B@@ ack in 20@@ 10 I started no@@ tic@@ ing something .
I saw G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s and S@@ ar@@ a Le@@ e start cor@@ por@@ ate re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship progra@@ ms .
"And at this point , hundreds of people have par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated ."
"This te@@ sting out peri@@ od re@@ mo@@ ves the per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved risk that some manag@@ ers att@@ ach to h@@ ir@@ ing rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers , and they are at@@ trac@@ ting exc@@ ell@@ ent can@@ di@@ d@@ ates who are tur@@ ning into great hi@@ res ."
And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a re@@ ti@@ ree inter@@ n@@ ship program .
"D@@ i@@ ff@@ er@@ ent po@@ ol , same con@@ cept ."
But it was a tem@@ p job .
This was in the f@@ all of 20@@ 11 .
"F@@ ast forward to 20@@ 15 , T@@ r@@ acy &apos;s been prom@@ ot@@ ed ."
"T@@ r@@ acy &apos;s tem@@ p job was a tr@@ y@@ out , just like an inter@@ n@@ ship , and it en@@ ded up being a w@@ in for both T@@ r@@ acy and her emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er ."
"Now , my go@@ al is to bring the re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship con@@ cept to more and more emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers ."
"But in the mean@@ time , if you are re@@ tur@@ ning to work after a care@@ er bre@@ ak , don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to su@@ ggest an inter@@ n@@ ship or an inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p@@ -@@ like ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ement to an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er that does not have a form@@ al re@@ en@@ try inter@@ n@@ ship program ."
"B@@ e their first suc@@ cess story , and you can be the example for more rela@@ un@@ ch@@ ers to come ."
T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ exp@@ ected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by p@@ ay@@ ing attention to ...

It was an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on in the f@@ all of 200@@ 5 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organiz@@ ation &apos;s science ad@@ vi@@ s@@ or .
"I really , really lo@@ ved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit di@@ sc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged ."
So I w@@ and@@ ered down the h@@ all@@ way to my colle@@ ag@@ ue Ch@@ r@@ is H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s off@@ ice .
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had deep institu@@ tional knowledge and in@@ si@@ ghts ."
I expl@@ ain@@ ed to Ch@@ r@@ is that I was feeling a little bit st@@ uck .
I had been inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating a number of issu@@ es at the inter@@ sec@@ tion of science and civi@@ l li@@ ber@@ ties — sup@@ er interesting .
"But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to eng@@ age these issu@@ es in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference ."
"So Ch@@ r@@ is cut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issu@@ es you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s gene@@ tic di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation , and re@@ produc@@ tive technologies , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , there &apos;s this really c@@ ool issue , func@@ tional M@@ R@@ I and using it for li@@ e de@@ t@@ ection , and ..@@ ."
"@@ o@@ h , and of course , there &apos;s gen@@ e pat@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents ? &quot;"
"&quot; Yes , you know , pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the U@@ S government has been issu@@ ing pat@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my off@@ ice and s@@ ent Ch@@ r@@ is three ar@@ tic@@ les .
"And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my off@@ ice ."
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Wh@@ o can we su@@ e ? &quot;
"( Laughter ) Now Ch@@ r@@ is is a really br@@ illi@@ ant la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but he knew almost nothing about pat@@ ent la@@ w and cer@@ tain@@ ly nothing about gene@@ tics ."
"I knew something about gene@@ tics , but I wasn &apos;t even a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , let alone a pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ er ."
So c@@ lear@@ ly we had a lot to learn before we could fi@@ le a la@@ w@@ su@@ it .
"F@@ irst , we needed to understand exactly what was pat@@ ented when someone pat@@ ented a gen@@ e ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally con@@ tain do@@ z@@ ens of cl@@ a@@ im@@ s , but the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al of these are to so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; is@@ ol@@ ated DNA &quot; &quot; — na@@ me@@ ly , a piece of DNA that has been re@@ moved from a cell ."
"@@ G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ent pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; S@@ e@@ e ? We didn &apos;t pat@@ ent the gen@@ e in your body , we pat@@ ented an is@@ ol@@ ated gen@@ e . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gen@@ e requ@@ i@@ res that it be is@@ ol@@ ated ."
"And the pat@@ ents wer@@ en &apos;t just to a particular gen@@ e that they is@@ ol@@ ated , but on every possible ver@@ sion of that gen@@ e ."
So what does that mean ?
"That means that you can &apos;t give your gen@@ e to your doc@@ tor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mu@@ ta@@ tions , without per@@ mis@@ sion of the pat@@ ent hol@@ der ."
It also means that the pat@@ ent hol@@ der has the right to stop anyone from using that gen@@ e in research or cl@@ in@@ ical te@@ sting .
"A@@ l@@ lo@@ wing pat@@ ent hol@@ d@@ ers , often priv@@ ate companies , to loc@@ k up stre@@ t@@ ches of the human gen@@ ome was har@@ ming patients ."
"C@@ on@@ si@@ der A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , a 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old with long Q@@ T syn@@ dr@@ ome , a ser@@ ious heart condi@@ tion that , if left un@@ tre@@ ated , can result in sudd@@ en death ."
The company that ob@@ ta@@ ined a pat@@ ent on two gen@@ es as@@ soci@@ ated with this condi@@ tion developed a test to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the syn@@ dr@@ ome .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never off@@ ered it .
"So another lab tried to off@@ er the test , but the company that hel@@ d the pat@@ ents thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to su@@ e the lab for pat@@ ent in@@ fr@@ ing@@ ement ."
"So as a result , for 2 years , no test was avail@@ able ."
"D@@ uring that time , A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il died of un@@ di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed long Q@@ T ."
G@@ en@@ e pat@@ ents c@@ lear@@ ly were a problem and were har@@ ming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
"T@@ ur@@ ns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made clear through a long line of c@@ ases , that certain things are not pat@@ ent e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble ."
"You can &apos;t pat@@ ent produc@@ ts of nature — the air , the water , min@@ er@@ als , el@@ em@@ ents of the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table ."
"And you can &apos;t pat@@ ent la@@ ws of nature — the la@@ w of gra@@ v@@ ity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 ."
These things are just too fundam@@ ental and must re@@ main free to all and re@@ ser@@ ved ex@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ v@@ ely to n@@ one .
"It se@@ em@@ ed to us that DNA , the most fundam@@ ental structure of life , that co@@ des for the produc@@ tion of all of our prot@@ e@@ ins , is both a produc@@ t of nature and a la@@ w of nature , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether it &apos;s in our bo@@ dies or sitting in the bottom of a test tu@@ be ."
"As we d@@ el@@ ved into this issue , we trav@@ el@@ ed all over the country to speak with many different exper@@ ts — scientists , me@@ dical prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , pat@@ ent la@@ w@@ y@@ ers ."
"M@@ ost of them ag@@ re@@ ed that we were right as a matter of po@@ lic@@ y , and , at least in theory , as a matter of la@@ w ."
All of them thought our chan@@ ces of win@@ ning a gen@@ e-@@ pat@@ ent challenge were about z@@ er@@ o .
Why is that ?
"Well , the pat@@ ent off@@ ice had been issu@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years ."
There were literally thousands of pat@@ ents on human gen@@ es .
"The pat@@ ent b@@ ar was deep@@ ly en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched in the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o , the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry had gro@@ wn up around this prac@@ tice , and leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation to ban gen@@ e pat@@ ents had been int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed year after year in Con@@ gre@@ ss , and had gone absolutely no@@ where ."
So the bottom line : cour@@ ts just wer@@ en &apos;t going to be w@@ illing to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
"Now , ne@@ i@@ ther Ch@@ r@@ is n@@ or I were the type to sh@@ y away from a challenge , and hear@@ ing , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ ing right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; se@@ em@@ ed all the more reason to take on this fi@@ ght ."
So we set out to build our case .
"Now , pat@@ ent c@@ ases t@@ end to be : C@@ om@@ p@@ any A su@@ es C@@ om@@ p@@ any B over some really n@@ ar@@ row , ob@@ sc@@ ure tech@@ n@@ ical issue ."
"We wer@@ en &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bigger than that ."
"This was about scienti@@ fic free@@ dom , me@@ dical pro@@ gre@@ ss , the ri@@ ghts of patients ."
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad hel@@ d pat@@ ents on two gen@@ es , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 gen@@ es ."
W@@ om@@ en with certain mu@@ ta@@ tions along these gen@@ es are consi@@ der@@ ed to be at a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ antly incre@@ as@@ ed risk of develop@@ ing bre@@ ast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had used its pat@@ ents to ma@@ in@@ tain a comple@@ te mon@@ op@@ o@@ ly on B@@ R@@ CA te@@ sting in the United States .
It had for@@ c@@ ed multi@@ ple lab@@ s that were off@@ ering B@@ R@@ CA te@@ sting to stop .
"It char@@ ged a lot of money for its test — over 3@@ ,000 dollars ."
It had stop@@ ped sh@@ ar@@ ing its cl@@ in@@ ical data with the inter@@ national scienti@@ fic community .
"And perhaps wor@@ st of all , for a peri@@ od of sever@@ al years , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad re@@ f@@ used to up@@ d@@ ate its test to inclu@@ de ad@@ di@@ tional mu@@ ta@@ tions that had been identi@@ fied by a team of re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers in Fr@@ ance ."
"It has been es@@ tim@@ ated that during that peri@@ od , for sever@@ al years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going te@@ sting re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved the wrong answer — a ne@@ ga@@ tive test result that should have been posi@@ tive ."
This is K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en Ma@@ x@@ ian .
K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster E@@ il@@ een developed bre@@ ast cancer at age 40 and she was te@@ sted by M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was ne@@ ga@@ tive .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
"That me@@ ant that E@@ il@@ een &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other mem@@ bers of her family didn &apos;t need to be te@@ sted ."
"But two years later , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en was di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed with adv@@ an@@ ce@@ d-@@ stage o@@ vari@@ an cancer ."
It turned out that K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en &apos;s si@@ ster was am@@ ong the 12 percent who re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a f@@ al@@ se@@ -@@ ne@@ ga@@ tive test result .
"H@@ ad E@@ il@@ een re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved the pro@@ per result , K@@ a@@ th@@ le@@ en would have then been te@@ sted , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
One of the major challeng@@ es we had in pre@@ par@@ ing the case was fig@@ uring out how best to communic@@ ate the science .
"So in order to ar@@ gu@@ e that what M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did was not an inv@@ en@@ tion , and that is@@ ol@@ ated B@@ R@@ CA gen@@ es were produc@@ ts of nature , we had to explain a couple of bas@@ ic con@@ cep@@ ts , like : What &apos;s a gen@@ e ? What &apos;s DNA ?"
"@@ How is DNA is@@ ol@@ ated , and why isn &apos;t that an inv@@ en@@ tion ?"
"We spent hours and hours with our pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff@@ s and exper@@ ts , trying to come up with ways of expl@@ ain@@ ing these con@@ cep@@ ts simply yet ac@@ cur@@ ately ."
"And we en@@ ded up rel@@ ying he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly on the use of met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors , like go@@ ld ."
So is@@ ol@@ ating DNA — it &apos;s like ex@@ trac@@ ting go@@ ld from a m@@ oun@@ tain or taking it out of a stre@@ am bed .
"You might be able to pat@@ ent the process for min@@ ing the go@@ ld , but you can &apos;t pat@@ ent the go@@ ld itself ."
"It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and eff@@ ort to di@@ g the go@@ ld out of the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you still can &apos;t pat@@ ent it , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"And the go@@ ld , once it &apos;s ex@@ trac@@ ted , can c@@ lear@@ ly be used for all sor@@ ts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the m@@ oun@@ tain ; you can make j@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t pat@@ ent the go@@ ld , it &apos;s still go@@ ld ."
"So now it &apos;s 200@@ 9 , and we &apos;re ready to fi@@ le our case ."
"We fil@@ ed in fe@@ der@@ al cour@@ t in the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n D@@ i@@ str@@ ic@@ t of New York , and the case was r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned to J@@ u@@ dge R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ we@@ et ."
"In M@@ ar@@ ch 20@@ 10 , J@@ u@@ dge S@@ we@@ et issu@@ ed his op@@ in@@ ion — 15@@ 2 p@@ ages — and a comple@@ te v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory for our side ."
"In read@@ ing the op@@ in@@ ion , we could not get over how el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently he descri@@ bed the science in the case ."
"I mean , our bri@@ ef — it was pretty good , but not this good ."
How did he devel@@ op such a deep understanding of this issue in such a sh@@ ort time ?
We just could not com@@ pre@@ h@@ end how this had happened .
"So it turned out , J@@ u@@ dge S@@ we@@ et &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a la@@ w@@ y@@ er — he was a scienti@@ st ."
He was not just a scienti@@ st — he had a P@@ h@@ D in molec@@ ular bio@@ logy .
( Laughter ) What an incredible st@@ ro@@ ke of l@@ uck !
M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ S C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
"F@@ irst , in a pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al moment of this case , the U@@ S government s@@ wit@@ ched si@@ des ."
So in the di@@ str@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t the government sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ ef on M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
"But now in direc@@ t op@@ position to its own pat@@ ent off@@ ice , the U@@ S government fil@@ es a bri@@ ef that st@@ ates that is has re@@ consi@@ der@@ ed this issue in light of the di@@ str@@ ic@@ t cour@@ t &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion , and has con@@ clu@@ ded that is@@ ol@@ ated DNA is not pat@@ ent e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble ."
"This was a really big deal , tot@@ ally un@@ exp@@ ected ."
"The C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the F@@ e@@ der@@ al C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it hear@@ s all pat@@ ent c@@ ases , and it has a re@@ pu@@ tation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ pat@@ ent ."
"So even with this re@@ mark@@ able develop@@ ment , we exp@@ ected to l@@ ose ."
And we did .
S@@ ort of .
"E@@ n@@ ds up s@@ pl@@ it deci@@ sion , 2 to 1 ."
"But the two ju@@ d@@ g@@ es who r@@ ul@@ ed against us , did so for completely different reasons ."
"The first one , J@@ u@@ dge L@@ ou@@ ri@@ e , made up his own nov@@ el , bio@@ logical theory — tot@@ ally wrong ."
( Laughter ) He decided M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had created a new chem@@ ical — made absolutely no sense .
"M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even ar@@ gu@@ e this , so it came out of the blue ."
"The other , J@@ u@@ dge Mo@@ ore , said she basically ag@@ re@@ ed with us that is@@ ol@@ ated DNA is a produc@@ t of nature ."
"But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to sha@@ ke up the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , J@@ u@@ dge B@@ r@@ y@@ son , ag@@ re@@ ed with us ."
So now we s@@ ou@@ ght re@@ view by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
"And when you pe@@ ti@@ tion the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to present a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer ."
"@@ U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a super@@ -@@ long par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h , like a whole p@@ age long with lots and lots of cl@@ a@@ uses , &quot; wh@@ er@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; ther@@ e@@ fore that . &quot;"
We sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted perhaps the sh@@ or@@ test question pres@@ ented ever .
F@@ our words : A@@ re human gen@@ es pat@@ ent@@ able ?
"Now when Ch@@ r@@ is first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know ."
"I think you have to say , &apos; Is is@@ ol@@ ated DNA pat@@ ent@@ able ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ op@@ e ."
"I want the j@@ us@@ tic@@ es to have the very same re@@ action that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly couldn &apos;t ar@@ gu@@ e with that ."
"The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only hear@@ s about one percent of the c@@ ases that it re@@ ce@@ i@@ ves , and it ag@@ re@@ ed to hear ours ."
"The day of the or@@ al ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ar@@ ri@@ ves , and it was really , really exc@@ iting — long line of people outside , people had been st@@ anding in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se ."
"T@@ w@@ o bre@@ ast cancer organiz@@ ations , B@@ re@@ ast C@@ ancer A@@ c@@ tion and F@@ O@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organiz@@ ed a de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion on the cour@@ thou@@ se ste@@ ps ."
I was c@@ lear@@ ly more ner@@ v@@ ous than he was .
"But any re@@ ma@@ ining pan@@ ic sub@@ si@@ ded as I wal@@ ked into the cour@@ t@@ room and looked around at a sea of fri@@ end@@ ly fac@@ es : our individual women c@@ li@@ ents who had sh@@ ared their deep@@ ly personal stories , the gene@@ tici@@ sts who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their bus@@ y care@@ ers to de@@ dic@@ ate themselves to this fi@@ ght and re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves from a di@@ ver@@ se ar@@ r@@ ay of me@@ dical , patient adv@@ oc@@ acy , environ@@ mental and religi@@ ous organiz@@ ations , who had sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted friend of the cour@@ t bri@@ e@@ f@@ s in the case ."
"A@@ l@@ so in the room were three lead@@ ers of the H@@ um@@ an G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject , inclu@@ ding the co@@ -@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of DNA h@@ im@@ self , J@@ ames W@@ at@@ son , who had sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted a bri@@ ef to the cour@@ t , where he re@@ fer@@ red to gen@@ e pat@@ en@@ ting as &quot; &quot; l@@ un@@ acy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The di@@ versity of the comm@@ unities re@@ pres@@ ented in this room and the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality sp@@ o@@ ke vol@@ um@@ es to what was at sta@@ ke ."
The ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Ch@@ r@@ is ar@@ gu@@ ed br@@ illi@@ antly .
"But for me , the most th@@ r@@ illing as@@ p@@ ect was wat@@ ching the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t j@@ us@@ tic@@ es gr@@ app@@ le with is@@ ol@@ ated DNA , through a ser@@ ies of col@@ or@@ ful anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es and fe@@ ist@@ y ex@@ changes , very much the same way as our leg@@ al team had done for the past seven years ."
J@@ us@@ tice K@@ ag@@ an li@@ k@@ en@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ating DNA to ex@@ trac@@ ting a medic@@ inal plant from the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on .

"And in one of my absolutely fav@@ or@@ ite mom@@ ents , J@@ us@@ tice S@@ ot@@ om@@ ay@@ or pro@@ cl@@ a@@ im@@ ed is@@ ol@@ ated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty con@@ fi@@ dent lea@@ ving the cour@@ t@@ room that day , but I could never have an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated the out@@ come : n@@ ine to z@@ er@@ o ."
"&quot; &quot; A nat@@ ur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing DNA se@@ g@@ ment is a produc@@ t of nature , and not pat@@ ent@@ -@@ e@@ li@@ gi@@ ble mer@@ ely because it has been is@@ ol@@ ated ."
"And fur@@ ther@@ more , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ th@@ in 2@@ 4 hours of the deci@@ sion , five lab@@ s had an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed that they would beg@@ in to off@@ er te@@ sting for the B@@ R@@ CA gen@@ es ."

I open@@ ed it up to find a small stu@@ ff@@ ed animal .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
P@@ art of what gave us the cou@@ ra@@ ge to take that risk was kno@@ wing that we were doing the right thing .
"The process took ne@@ arly eight years from the start to fin@@ ish , with many tw@@ ists and turns along the way ."
"A little l@@ uck cer@@ tain@@ ly hel@@ ped , but it was the comm@@ unities that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ ances that we created , that made pi@@ gs fly ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The second quot@@ e is from the head of the U@@ K F@@ in@@ anci@@ al S@@ er@@ v@@ ices Au@@ th@@ ority .
"@@ Un@@ fortun@@ ately , the answer is yes ."
"Th@@ en , predic@@ tions can be made and te@@ sted ."
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is literally more than the su@@ m of its parts .
Wh@@ ere are economic net@@ works ?
What we looked at in de@@ ta@@ il was o@@ w@@ ner@@ ship net@@ works .
And we also as@@ sig@@ n a value to the company given by the oper@@ ating re@@ ven@@ ue .
How are they organiz@@ ed ? A@@ re they is@@ ol@@ ated ?
"These are companies that oper@@ ate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3@@ ,000 ."
Let me explain by giving you this anal@@ o@@ gy .
"H@@ i . T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to take you through g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of about eight of my pro@@ jects , done in coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation with D@@ an@@ ish arti@@ st S@@ ore@@ n P@@ ors ."
"We call ourselves P@@ ors and R@@ a@@ o , and we live and work in India ."
"I &apos;d like to beg@@ in with my very first ob@@ ject , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspi@@ red by my un@@ cle &apos;s p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ha@@ bit of con@@ st@@ antly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an ex@@ ten@@ sion of his body — to turn on the li@@ ghts or to bring him a gl@@ ass of water , a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ t@@ es ."
"And as I gre@@ w up , it became wor@@ se and wor@@ se , And I started to think of it as a form of control ."
"But of course , I could never say anything , because the un@@ cle is a re@@ spec@@ ted figure in the In@@ di@@ an family ."
And the situ@@ ation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a l@@ and@@ line t@@ ele@@ phone .
He would hold on to the re@@ ce@@ i@@ ver and exp@@ ect me to di@@ al a number for him .
"And so as a respon@@ se and as a gi@@ ft to my un@@ cle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle P@@ h@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requ@@ i@@ res two people to use it ."
It &apos;s exactly the way my un@@ cle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
"But the problem is that , when I left home and went to colle@@ ge , I started mis@@ sing his comm@@ ands ."
And so I made him a go@@ l@@ den t@@ y@@ pe@@ writ@@ er through which he could di@@ sp@@ en@@ se his comm@@ ands to ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , ro@@ ll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , type his e@@ ma@@ il or comm@@ and and pul@@ l the paper out ."
This device would au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically s@@ end the inten@@ ded person the le@@ tter as an e@@ ma@@ il .
"So here you can see , we em@@ be@@ d@@ ded a lot of electr@@ on@@ ics that underst@@ ands all of the mechan@@ ical ac@@ tions and conver@@ ts it to digital ."
So my un@@ cle is only de@@ al@@ ing with a mechan@@ ical inter@@ face .
"And of course , the ob@@ ject had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of rit@@ u@@ al@@ ism , the way my un@@ cle li@@ kes it ."
"The next work is a s@@ ound@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive inst@@ all@@ ation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ m@@ ies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a no@@ tion of being sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sen@@ si@@ tive and s@@ we@@ et cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the w@@ all , and behind them , we have these little cre@@ at@@ ures which hi@@ de ."
"And as so@@ on as it &apos;s sil@@ ent , they sort of cre@@ ep out ."
"And if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ t@@ ch their nec@@ ks out ."
"And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again ."
So we had these pan@@ els on three w@@ alls of a room .
And we had over 50@@ 0 of these little p@@ y@@ g@@ m@@ ies hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"So when it &apos;s qu@@ i@@ et , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els ."
"And they hear like humans do , or real cre@@ at@@ ures do ."
So they get im@@ m@@ un@@ e to s@@ ounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t re@@ act to back@@ ground s@@ ounds .
You &apos;ll hear a tra@@ in in moment that they don &apos;t re@@ act to .
( No@@ ise ) But they re@@ act to fore@@ ground s@@ ounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Wh@@ ist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as li@@ fe@@ like as possible .
"So each p@@ y@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psy@@ ch@@ e , mo@@ od s@@ w@@ ings , person@@ ali@@ ties and so on ."
So this is a very early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ f course , it got much better after that ."
"And we made them re@@ act to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and chil@@ d@@ like with them ."
This is a video inst@@ all@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The M@@ is@@ sing P@@ er@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with playing with the no@@ tion of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility ?
"So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in cam@@ era sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and we asked them to devel@@ op a piece of sof@@ tw@@ are with us , using a cam@@ era that could look at people in the room , tr@@ ack them and re@@ place one person with the back@@ ground , r@@ en@@ der@@ ing them in@@ vi@@ sible ."
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
"O@@ n the right side you can see my colle@@ ag@@ ue S@@ ore@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space ."
"And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the pro@@ cess@@ ed video where the cam@@ era has made him in@@ vi@@ sible ."
S@@ ore@@ n en@@ ters the room . P@@ op ! He goes in@@ vi@@ sible .
And you can see that the cam@@ era is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing .
"It &apos;s a very early video , so we ha@@ ven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty so@@ on , later ."
"So how we used it was in a room where we had a cam@@ era looking into the space , and we had one mon@@ it@@ or , one on each w@@ all ."
"And as people wal@@ ked into the room , they would see themselves in the mon@@ it@@ or , ex@@ cept with one difference : one person was con@@ st@@ antly in@@ vi@@ sible wh@@ er@@ ever they moved in the room ."
"So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Su@@ n S@@ ha@@ d@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sh@@ e@@ et of paper , like a c@@ ut@@ out of a chil@@ d@@ like dra@@ wing of an oil sp@@ ill or a su@@ n ."
"And from the front , this ob@@ ject appe@@ ared to be very str@@ ong and ro@@ b@@ ust , and from the side , it almost se@@ em@@ ed very we@@ ak ."
"So people would wal@@ king into the room and they &apos;d almost ig@@ n@@ ore it , thinking it was some cra@@ p l@@ ay@@ ing around ."
"But as so@@ on as they pas@@ sed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the w@@ all in j@@ er@@ ky fas@@ hi@@ on ."
"And it would get ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted , and it would coll@@ ap@@ se every time ."
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
"H@@ is head is so he@@ av@@ y , full of he@@ av@@ y thou@@ ghts , that it &apos;s sort of f@@ all@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s gro@@ wn out of him almost like a plant ."
Well what he does is he mo@@ ves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fas@@ hi@@ on on his head in a very un@@ predic@@ table and extre@@ me@@ ly s@@ low movement .
And it &apos;s kind of con@@ stra@@ ined by that cir@@ cle .
"Because if that cir@@ cle wer@@ en &apos;t there , and the flo@@ or was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space ."
And there &apos;s no wi@@ res .
"So I &apos;ll just show you an inst@@ ance — so when people en@@ ter the room , it ac@@ tiv@@ ates this ob@@ ject ."
"And it very s@@ low@@ ly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it ga@@ ins mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to f@@ all ."
"And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an inst@@ inc@@ t to almost go and help , or sa@@ ve the sub@@ ject ."
"But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pul@@ l itself up ."
"So this work was a real tech@@ n@@ ical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechan@@ ics right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
"And it was very important for us to est@@ ab@@ lish the ex@@ act moment that it would f@@ all , because if we made it in a way that it would t@@ op@@ ple over , then it would d@@ ama@@ ge itself , and if it didn &apos;t f@@ all enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that f@@ at@@ al@@ ism , or that sense of wan@@ ting to go and help it ."
So I &apos;m going to show you a very qu@@ ick video where we are doing a test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o — it &apos;s much fa@@ ster .
That &apos;s my colle@@ ag@@ ue . He &apos;s let it go .
"Now he &apos;s getting ner@@ v@@ ous , so he &apos;s going to go cat@@ ch it ."
"But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to li@@ ft itself up on its own ."
"So this is a work that we were very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic of fu@@ r em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with thousands of tiny different si@@ z@@ es of fi@@ ber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ k@@ le like the night sk@@ y ."
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sk@@ y .
"So we wr@@ app@@ ed this around a b@@ lob@@ -@@ like form , which is in the sh@@ ape of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which was h@@ ang@@ ing from the ce@@ il@@ ing ."
"And the idea was to sort of con@@ tr@@ ast something very co@@ ld and dist@@ ant and ab@@ str@@ act like the universe into the famili@@ ar form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar , which is very comfor@@ ting and in@@ tim@@ ate ."
"And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy be@@ ar and you would almost per@@ ce@@ ive it to be a h@@ ole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sk@@ y ."
"So this is the last work , and a work in pro@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ace F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big st@@ anding in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ach@@ ed it , it tried to in@@ tim@@ id@@ ate you by growing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s tw@@ ice its he@@ ight and &#91; eight &#93; times its vol@@ u@@ me ."
And so this ob@@ ject is con@@ st@@ antly exp@@ anding and con@@ trac@@ ting to create a d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a secre@@ t within its se@@ am@@ s or something .
"So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gi@@ ves us a lot of pa@@ in in our work over years and years ."
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to ex@@ press the emo@@ tions and behavi@@ or@@ al patter@@ ns in these cre@@ at@@ ures that we create .
"And once a cre@@ ature pop@@ s into our min@@ ds , it &apos;s almost like the process of cre@@ ation is to disco@@ ver the way this cre@@ ature really wan@@ ts to ex@@ ist and what form it wan@@ ts to take and what way it wan@@ ts to move ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"O@@ K , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love ."
"And speci@@ f@@ ically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love ."
"M@@ ost of us will probably f@@ all in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the Eng@@ lish language , this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , f@@ all@@ ing , is really the main way that we talk about that experience ."
"I don &apos;t know about you , but when I con@@ cep@@ tu@@ aliz@@ e this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or , what I picture is stra@@ ight out of a car@@ to@@ on — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s wal@@ king down the si@@ de@@ walk , without realiz@@ ing it , he cr@@ os@@ ses over an open man@@ h@@ ole , and he just pl@@ um@@ me@@ ts into the se@@ wer bel@@ ow ."
And I picture it this way because f@@ all@@ ing is not j@@ um@@ ping .
"F@@ all@@ ing is ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental , it &apos;s un@@ contro@@ l@@ l@@ able ."
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our con@@ s@@ ent .
And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relation@@ ship .
"I am a writ@@ er and I &apos;m also an Eng@@ lish te@@ ac@@ her , which means I think about words for a living ."
"You could say that I get pa@@ id to ar@@ gu@@ e that the language we use mat@@ ters , and I would like to ar@@ gu@@ e that many of the met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem ."
"So , in love , we f@@ all ."
We &apos;re struc@@ k .
We are cr@@ ush@@ ed .
We s@@ w@@ o@@ on .
We bur@@ n with pas@@ sion .
"L@@ o@@ ve makes us cra@@ zy , and it makes us s@@ ick ."
"O@@ ur hear@@ ts ac@@ he , and then they bre@@ ak ."
So our met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors equ@@ ate the experience of lo@@ ving someone to extre@@ me violence or ill@@ ness .
( Laughter ) They do .
And they position us as the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of un@@ fore@@ seen and tot@@ ally un@@ av@@ o@@ id@@ able cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ances .
"My fav@@ or@@ ite one of these is &quot; &quot; sm@@ it@@ ten , &quot; &quot; which is the past par@@ tici@@ ple of the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dic@@ tion@@ ary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defin@@ ed as both &quot; &quot; g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I t@@ end to as@@ soci@@ ate the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite &quot; &quot; with a very particular cont@@ ext , which is the O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent ."
"In the B@@ ook of E@@ x@@ od@@ us alone , there are 1@@ 6 re@@ fer@@ ences to sm@@ iting , which is the word that the B@@ i@@ ble uses for the ven@@ ge@@ ance of an an@@ gr@@ y God ."
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a pl@@ ag@@ ue of loc@@ u@@ sts . ( Laughter )
Right ?
"So , how did this happen ?"
How have we come to as@@ soci@@ ate love with great pa@@ in and suff@@ ering ?
And why do we talk about this os@@ ten@@ si@@ bly good experience as if we are v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?
"These are difficult questions , but I have some the@@ ories ."
"And to think this through , I want to foc@@ us on one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or in particular , which is the idea of love as ma@@ d@@ ness ."
"When I first started re@@ sear@@ ching r@@ om@@ an@@ tic love , I found these ma@@ d@@ ness met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors every@@ where ."
The history of W@@ ester@@ n culture is full of language that equ@@ ates love to mental ill@@ ness .
These are just a few exam@@ ples .
"W@@ illi@@ am S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are : &quot; L@@ o@@ ve is mer@@ ely a ma@@ d@@ ness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; A@@ s You Li@@ ke It . &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ed@@ r@@ ich N@@ i@@ et@@ z@@ sch@@ e : &quot; There is always some ma@@ d@@ ness in love . &quot;"
"&quot; G@@ ot me looking , got me looking so cra@@ zy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her , B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é K@@ no@@ w@@ les . ( Laughter )"
"I f@@ ell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty tur@@ b@@ ul@@ ent relation@@ ship right from the start ."
"And it was long dist@@ ance for the first couple of years , so for me that me@@ ant very high high@@ s and very low lo@@ ws ."
I can remember one moment in particular .
"I was sitting on a bed in a h@@ os@@ te@@ l in S@@ outh America , and I was wat@@ ching the person I love walk out the do@@ or ."
"And it was l@@ ate , it was ne@@ arly mid@@ night , we &apos;d g@@ ot@@ ten into an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent over d@@ in@@ ner , and when we got back to our room , he thre@@ w his things in the ba@@ g and stor@@ med out ."
"Wh@@ ile I can no longer remember what that ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent was about , I very c@@ lear@@ ly remember how I felt wat@@ ching him leave ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , it was my first time in the develop@@ ing world , and I was tot@@ ally alone ."
"I had another week until my f@@ light home , and I knew the name of the to@@ wn that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around ."
"I had no gu@@ ide@@ book and very little money , and I sp@@ o@@ ke no S@@ pan@@ ish ."
"S@@ ome@@ one more adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just f@@ ro@@ ze ."
I just s@@ at there .
And then I bur@@ st into t@@ ear@@ s .
"But des@@ p@@ ite my pan@@ ic , some small vo@@ ice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow . That was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel mis@@ er@@ able in love .
"And it s@@ ounds so str@@ an@@ ge to me now , but at 2@@ 2 , I lon@@ ged to have dra@@ ma@@ tic experi@@ ences , and in that moment , I was ir@@ ra@@ tional and fur@@ ious and dev@@ ast@@ ated , and we@@ ir@@ dly enough , I thought that this some@@ how le@@ gi@@ tim@@ iz@@ ed the fe@@ el@@ ings I had for the guy who had just left me ."
"I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit cra@@ zy , because I thought that that was how lo@@ ved worked ."
"This really should not be surpri@@ sing , consi@@ der@@ ing that ac@@ cor@@ ding to W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , there are eight fil@@ ms , 1@@ 4 son@@ gs , two al@@ b@@ um@@ s and one nov@@ el with the ti@@ tle &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ zy L@@ o@@ ve . &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ out half an h@@ our later , he came back to our room ."
We made up .
We spent another mos@@ tly happy week trav@@ eling together .
"And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terri@@ ble and so great ."
"This must be a real r@@ om@@ ance . &quot; &quot; I exp@@ ected my first love to feel like ma@@ d@@ ness , and of course , it met that exp@@ ec@@ tation very well ."
But lo@@ ving someone like that — as if my entire w@@ ell@@ -@@ being dep@@ en@@ ded on him lo@@ ving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect this experience of love is not that un@@ us@@ ual .
M@@ ost of us do feel a bit ma@@ d in the early st@@ ages of r@@ om@@ an@@ tic love .
"In fact , there is research to con@@ fir@@ m that this is some@@ what normal , because , ne@@ u@@ ro@@ chem@@ ically spea@@ king , r@@ om@@ an@@ tic love and mental ill@@ ness are not that eas@@ ily dist@@ in@@ gu@@ i@@ shed ."
This is true .
This study from 199@@ 9 used blood te@@ sts to con@@ fir@@ m that the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in lev@@ els of the ne@@ w@@ ly in love very clos@@ ely re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ed the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in lev@@ els of people who had been di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ed with ob@@ s@@ es@@ si@@ ve@@ -@@ comp@@ ul@@ sive dis@@ order .
"( Laughter ) Yes , and low lev@@ els of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in are also as@@ soci@@ ated with se@@ as@@ on@@ al aff@@ ective dis@@ order and de@@ pression ."
So there is some evidence that love is as@@ soci@@ ated with changes to our mo@@ o@@ ds and our behavi@@ ors .
And there are other stu@@ dies to con@@ fir@@ m that most relation@@ ships beg@@ in this way .
"@@ R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers believe that the low lev@@ els of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in is cor@@ rel@@ ated with ob@@ s@@ es@@ sive thinking about the ob@@ ject of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up cam@@ p in your brain ."
And most of us feel this way when we first f@@ all in love .
"But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — us@@ u@@ ally from a few months to a couple of years ."
"When I got back from my tri@@ p to S@@ outh America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , ch@@ ec@@ king my e@@ ma@@ il , des@@ per@@ ate to hear from the guy I lo@@ ved ."
"I decided that if my friends could not understand my g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , then I did not need their fri@@ end@@ ship ."
So I stop@@ ped h@@ ang@@ ing out with most of them .
And it was probably the most un@@ happy year of my life .
"But I think I felt like it was my job to be mis@@ er@@ able , because if I could be mis@@ er@@ able , then I would pro@@ ve how much I lo@@ ved him ."
"And if I could pro@@ ve it , then we would have to end up together ev@@ en@@ tually ."
"This is the real ma@@ d@@ ness , because there is no cos@@ m@@ ic ru@@ le that says that great suff@@ ering equ@@ als great re@@ ward , but we talk about love as if this is true ."
O@@ ur experi@@ ences of love are both bio@@ logical and cul@@ tural .
"O@@ ur bio@@ logy t@@ ells us that love is good by ac@@ tiv@@ ating these re@@ ward cir@@ cu@@ its in our brain , and it t@@ ells us that love is pain@@ ful when , after a fi@@ ght or a brea@@ k@@ up , that ne@@ u@@ ro@@ chem@@ ical re@@ ward is with@@ dra@@ wn ."
"And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — ne@@ u@@ ro@@ chem@@ ically spea@@ king , going through a brea@@ k@@ up is a lot like going through co@@ ca@@ ine with@@ dra@@ w@@ al , which I find reas@@ sur@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to sh@@ ape and re@@ infor@@ ce these ideas about love .
"In this case , we &apos;re talking about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors about pa@@ in and ad@@ dic@@ tion and ma@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s kind of an interesting fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ p .
"L@@ o@@ ve is powerful and at times pain@@ ful , and we ex@@ press this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories pri@@ me us to exp@@ ect love to be powerful and pain@@ ful ."
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that val@@ ues li@@ fel@@ ong mon@@ o@@ ga@@ my .
"It seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like ma@@ d@@ ness , and we want it to last an entire li@@ fe@@ time ."
That s@@ ounds terri@@ ble .
"( Laughter ) T@@ o re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this , we need to either change our culture or change our exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions ."
"So , imagine if we were all less pas@@ sive in love ."
"If we were more as@@ ser@@ tive , more open@@ -@@ min@@ ded , more gener@@ ous and instead of f@@ all@@ ing in love , we ste@@ p@@ ped into love ."
"I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to su@@ ggest this ."
"In their book , &quot; &quot; M@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ors We L@@ ive B@@ y , &quot; &quot; l@@ in@@ gu@@ ists M@@ ark Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son and G@@ e@@ or@@ ge L@@ a@@ k@@ off su@@ ggest a really interesting solution to this di@@ le@@ m@@ ma , which is to change our met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors ."
"They ar@@ gu@@ e that met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors really do sh@@ ape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a gu@@ i@@ de for future ac@@ tions , like self-@@ ful@@ f@@ illing pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies ."
Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son and L@@ a@@ k@@ off su@@ ggest a new met@@ ap@@ h@@ or for love : love as a coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
"L@@ in@@ gu@@ ists talk about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors as having en@@ ta@@ il@@ ments , which is ess@@ entially a way of consi@@ der@@ ing all the imp@@ lic@@ ations of , or ideas con@@ ta@@ ined within , a given met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"And Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son and L@@ a@@ k@@ off talk about everything that coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ating on a work of art en@@ ta@@ ils : eff@@ ort , comp@@ r@@ om@@ ise , pati@@ ence , sh@@ ared go@@ als ."
"These ideas al@@ ign n@@ ic@@ ely with our cul@@ tural invest@@ ment in lon@@ g@@ -@@ term r@@ om@@ an@@ tic comm@@ it@@ ment , but they also work well for other kinds of relation@@ ships — sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term , c@@ as@@ ual , pol@@ y@@ am@@ or@@ ous , non@@ -@@ mon@@ o@@ g@@ am@@ ous , as@@ ex@@ ual — because this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or br@@ ings much more complex ideas to the experience of lo@@ ving someone ."
"So if love is a coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative work of art , then love is an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience ."
"L@@ o@@ ve is un@@ predic@@ table , love is cre@@ ative , love requ@@ i@@ res communic@@ ation and dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , it is f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and emo@@ tion@@ ally de@@ man@@ ding ."
And love invol@@ ves both jo@@ y and pa@@ in .
"@@ U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately , each experience of love is different ."
"When I was youn@@ ger , it never oc@@ cur@@ red to me that I was allo@@ wed to dem@@ and more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just ac@@ cept whatever love off@@ ered ."
"When 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old J@@ u@@ li@@ et first me@@ ets — or , when 1@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ old J@@ u@@ li@@ et cannot be with R@@ ome@@ o , wh@@ om she has met four days ago , she does not feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted or ang@@ st@@ y ."
Wh@@ ere is she ?
She wan@@ ts to die .
Right ?
"And just as a re@@ f@@ re@@ sh@@ er , at this point in the play , act three of five , R@@ ome@@ o is not de@@ ad ."
"He &apos;s ali@@ ve , he &apos;s heal@@ thy , he &apos;s just been ban@@ i@@ shed from the city ."
"I understand that 16@@ th@@ -@@ century V@@ er@@ on@@ a is un@@ like cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary Nor@@ th America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 1@@ 4 , J@@ u@@ li@@ et &apos;s suff@@ ering made sense to me ."
"@@ Re@@ fra@@ ming love as something I get to create with someone I ad@@ m@@ ire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or con@@ s@@ ent , is em@@ power@@ ing ."
It &apos;s still hard .
"L@@ o@@ ve still fe@@ els tot@@ ally ma@@ dd@@ ening and cr@@ ush@@ ing some days , and when I feel really f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated , I have to re@@ mind myself : my job in this relation@@ ship is to talk to my part@@ ner about what I want to make together ."
"This isn &apos;t easy , either ."
"But it &apos;s just so much better than the al@@ ter@@ na@@ tive , which is that thing that fe@@ els like ma@@ d@@ ness ."
This ver@@ sion of love is not about win@@ ning or l@@ os@@ ing someone &apos;s aff@@ ection .
"In@@ stead , it requ@@ i@@ res that you tr@@ ust your part@@ ner and talk about things when tru@@ sting fe@@ els difficult , which s@@ ounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary , ra@@ dical act ."
"This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re ga@@ ining or l@@ os@@ ing in your relation@@ ship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to off@@ er ."
"This ver@@ sion of love allo@@ ws us to say things like , &quot; H@@ ey , we &apos;re not very good coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ators . M@@ ay@@ be this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;"
"O@@ r , &quot; &quot; That relation@@ ship was sh@@ or@@ ter than I had plan@@ ned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative work of art is that it will not pa@@ int or dra@@ w or sc@@ ul@@ pt itself ."
This ver@@ sion of love allo@@ ws us to deci@@ de what it looks like .
Thank you .

I &apos;m gl@@ ad we &apos;re all here .
"And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here ."
"And not f@@ ro@@ z@@ en water , and not water in a g@@ as@@ e@@ ous state , but li@@ qu@@ id water ."
So that lea@@ ves a few bo@@ dies that we should think about .
So let &apos;s make the problem sim@@ pl@@ er for ourselves .
You have to be very care@@ ful with that at@@ m@@ osp@@ here .
They &apos;re not sta@@ tic things . They change .
They v@@ ary . They evol@@ ve .
And at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ es do the same .
"Well , one idea is it es@@ cap@@ ed away to space ."
C@@ ome@@ ts have ta@@ ils that are incredi@@ bly vi@@ sible re@@ min@@ d@@ ers of at@@ mos@@ ph@@ er@@ ic es@@ cap@@ e .
A second way they can get energy is from the solar w@@ ind .
"This is something that I &apos;m interested in , because it rel@@ ates to ha@@ bit@@ ability ."
"And of course , dist@@ ance of a planet from the su@@ n de@@ ter@@ min@@ es its tem@@ per@@ ature ."
This has to play into ha@@ bit@@ ability .
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
"If you have a comp@@ ass , you know which way nor@@ th is ."
The sa@@ ils may ga@@ ther energy from the solar w@@ ind .
"If you &apos;ve ever experi@@ enc@@ ed them , it &apos;s mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
"O@@ n@@ ce we have that answer , why should you care ?"
"And fin@@ anci@@ ally as well , but deep@@ ly ."
"We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from kno@@ wing of z@@ er@@ o plan@@ ets outside of our solar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate first ."
"You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet ."
"In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red sp@@ ot , right here ."
"This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s ha@@ bit@@ able , al@@ though very so@@ on we may come to know of more ."
"But for now , this is the only ha@@ bit@@ able planet , and this is our red sp@@ ot ."

I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Th@@ ink about everything it has brought us .
"Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we use , all the connec@@ tivity , all the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment , all the business , all the comm@@ er@@ ce ."
And it &apos;s happening during our li@@ fe@@ times .
"I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be wr@@ iting history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed as the generation that got on@@ line , the generation that built something really and tru@@ ly global ."
"But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very ser@@ ious problems , problems with sec@@ urity and problems with priv@@ acy ."
I &apos;ve spent my care@@ er fi@@ gh@@ ting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is B@@ ra@@ in .
This is a flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k — five and a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ ch flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k inf@@ ected by B@@ ra@@ in@@ .@@ A@@ .
It &apos;s the first vir@@ us we ever found for P@@ C computers .
And we actually know where B@@ ra@@ in came from .
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
"That &apos;s the bo@@ ot sec@@ tor of an inf@@ ected flo@@ p@@ p@@ y , and if we take a clos@@ er look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it contin@@ ues , saying , 198@@ 6 , B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ."
"And B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad are first nam@@ es , P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an@@ i first nam@@ es ."
"In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an ad@@ dre@@ ss in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) Now , 198@@ 6 ."
Now it &apos;s 20@@ 11 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The P@@ C vir@@ us problem is 25 years old now .
"So half a year ago , I decided to go to P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an myself ."
"So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of phot@@ os I took while I was in P@@ a@@ ki@@ st@@ an ."
"This is from the city of L@@ a@@ h@@ ore , which is around 30@@ 0 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters s@@ outh from A@@ b@@ bot@@ t@@ ab@@ ad , where B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en was c@@ au@@ ght ."
Here &apos;s a typ@@ ical street view .
"And here &apos;s the street or ro@@ ad lead@@ ing to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am b@@ loc@@ k at Al@@ l@@ am@@ a I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own ."
And I kno@@ c@@ ked on the do@@ or .
( Laughter ) You want to gu@@ ess who open@@ ed the do@@ or ?
B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here st@@ anding up is B@@ as@@ it .
S@@ it@@ ting down is his bro@@ ther A@@ m@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wrote the first P@@ C vir@@ us .
"Now of course , we had a very interesting di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion from learning that both B@@ as@@ it and A@@ m@@ j@@ ad had had their computers inf@@ ected do@@ z@@ ens of times by completely un@@ rel@@ ated other vir@@ uses over these years .
So there is some sort of j@@ us@@ tice in the world after all .
"Now , the vir@@ uses that we used to see in the 198@@ 0s and 199@@ 0s obvi@@ ously are not a problem any more ."
So let me just show you a couple of exam@@ ples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m run@@ ning here is a system that en@@ ab@@ les me to run ag@@ e-@@ old progra@@ ms on a moder@@ n computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some dri@@ ves . G@@ o over there .
What we have here is a li@@ st of old vir@@ uses .
So let me just run some vir@@ uses on my computer .
"For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de vir@@ us first ."
"And you can see at the top of the scre@@ en , there &apos;s a c@@ enti@@ pe@@ de sc@@ ro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get inf@@ ected by this one ."
You know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected because it actually shows up .
"Here &apos;s another one . This is the vir@@ us called C@@ r@@ ash , inv@@ ented in R@@ us@@ si@@ a in 199@@ 2 ."
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
"( S@@ i@@ re@@ n no@@ ise ) And the last example , gu@@ ess what the W@@ al@@ ker vir@@ us does ?"
"@@ Yes , there &apos;s a guy wal@@ king across your scre@@ en once you get inf@@ ected ."
"So it used to be fa@@ ir@@ ly easy to know that you &apos;re inf@@ ected by a vir@@ us , when the vir@@ uses were writ@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , they are no longer being writ@@ ten by h@@ ob@@ b@@ y@@ ists and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ."
"T@@ o@@ day , vir@@ uses are a global problem ."
"What we have here in the back@@ ground is an example of our systems that we run in our lab@@ s , where we tr@@ ack vir@@ us inf@@ ec@@ tions wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just b@@ loc@@ ked vir@@ uses in S@@ we@@ den and T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an and R@@ us@@ si@@ a and el@@ se@@ where .
"In fact , if I just con@@ n@@ ect back to our lab systems through the W@@ e@@ b , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many vir@@ uses , how many new exam@@ ples of m@@ al@@ w@@ are we find every single day ."
"Here &apos;s the l@@ at@@ est vir@@ us we &apos;ve found , in a fi@@ le called S@@ er@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e@@ ."
"And we found it right over here three secon@@ ds ago — the pre@@ vi@@ ous one , six secon@@ ds ago ."
"And if we just sc@@ ro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just mas@@ sive ."
"We find ten@@ s of thousands , even hundreds of thousands ."
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of m@@ al@@ w@@ are every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
"Well today , it &apos;s the organiz@@ ed cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs wr@@ iting these vir@@ uses because they make money with their vir@@ uses ."
It &apos;s g@@ an@@ gs like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ sta@@ B@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a we@@ b@@ site oper@@ ating in M@@ os@@ c@@ ow where these guys are bu@@ ying inf@@ ected computers .
"So if you are a vir@@ us writ@@ er and you &apos;re cap@@ able of inf@@ ec@@ ting W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can s@@ ell those inf@@ ected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys ."
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those inf@@ ected computers ?
"Well there &apos;s multi@@ ple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your on@@ line ban@@ king ac@@ coun@@ ts when you do on@@ line ban@@ king , or ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers ."
"@@ K@@ ey@@ log@@ g@@ ers sil@@ ently sit on your computer , hi@@ dd@@ en from view , and they rec@@ ord everything you type ."
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google sear@@ ches .
E@@ very single Google search you type is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
E@@ very single e@@ ma@@ il you write is sa@@ ved and s@@ ent to the cri@@ min@@ als .
S@@ ame thing with every single pas@@ s@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ es@@ sions where you go on@@ line and do on@@ line pur@@ cha@@ ses in any on@@ line st@@ ore .
"Because when you do pur@@ cha@@ ses in on@@ line st@@ o@@ res , you will be typ@@ ing in your name , the deli@@ very ad@@ dre@@ ss , your cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number and the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard sec@@ urity co@@ des ."
And here &apos;s an example of a fi@@ le we found from a ser@@ ver a couple of weeks ago .
"That &apos;s the cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pi@@ ra@@ tion d@@ ate , that &apos;s the sec@@ urity co@@ de , and that &apos;s the name of the o@@ w@@ ner of the c@@ ard ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you g@@ ain access to other people &apos;s cre@@ d@@ it c@@ ard information , you can just go on@@ line and buy whatever you want with this information ."
"And that , obvi@@ ously , is a problem ."
We now have a whole under@@ ground mar@@ ke@@ t@@ place and business ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem built around on@@ line cri@@ me .
One example of how these guys actually are cap@@ able of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing their oper@@ ations : we go and have a look at the p@@ ages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted per@@ s@@ ons .
"We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in , orig@@ in@@ ally from S@@ we@@ den , and his part@@ ner in cri@@ me , also list@@ ed on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted p@@ ages , M@@ r@@ . S@@ ha@@ il@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ ma@@ r J@@ ain , a U.S. ci@@ tiz@@ en ."
"These guys were run@@ ning an oper@@ ation called I@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ me oper@@ ation through which they net@@ ted millions ."
They are both right now on the run .
No@@ body kno@@ ws where they are .
"@@ U.S. off@@ ici@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , f@@ ro@@ ze a S@@ w@@ is@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t bel@@ on@@ ging to M@@ r@@ . J@@ ain , and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it ."
So the amount of money on@@ line cri@@ me gener@@ ates is sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant .
And that means that the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als can actually aff@@ ord to inv@@ est into their att@@ ac@@ ks .
"We know that on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are h@@ ir@@ ing progra@@ m@@ m@@ ers , h@@ ir@@ ing te@@ sting people , te@@ sting their co@@ de , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L dat@@ ab@@ ases ."
And they can aff@@ ord to watch how we work — like how sec@@ urity people work — and try to work their way around any sec@@ urity pre@@ c@@ au@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their adv@@ ant@@ age .
"I mean , the Internet is inter@@ national ."
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
"And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the on@@ line world , here &apos;s a video built by C@@ lar@@ i@@ fied N@@ et@@ works , which ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates how one single m@@ al@@ w@@ are family is able to move around the world ."
"This oper@@ ation , beli@@ ev@@ ed to be orig@@ in@@ ally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , mo@@ ves around from one country to another as so@@ on as the we@@ b@@ site is tried to sh@@ ut down ."
So you just can &apos;t sh@@ ut these guys down .
"They will s@@ wit@@ ch from one country to another , from one j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally poli@@ ce oper@@ ations like this ."
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plan@@ e tic@@ kets to all the on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als of the world .
"Now , cri@@ min@@ als who wer@@ en &apos;t cap@@ able of re@@ ach@@ ing us before can re@@ ach us ."
So how do you actually go around fin@@ ding on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als ?
How do you actually tr@@ ack them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exp@@ lo@@ it fi@@ le .
"Here , I &apos;m looking at the H@@ e@@ x d@@ um@@ p of an image fi@@ le , which con@@ ta@@ ins an exp@@ lo@@ it ."
"And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image fi@@ le on your W@@ in@@ do@@ ws computer , it actually takes over your computer and run@@ s co@@ de ."
"Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image fi@@ le — well there &apos;s the image head@@ er , and there the ac@@ tual co@@ de of the att@@ ack star@@ ts ."
"And that co@@ de has been enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t it ."
It has been enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R func@@ tion 9@@ 7 .
"You just have to believe me , it is , it is ."
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting it .
Well the y@@ el@@ low part of the co@@ de is now dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ted .
"And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the orig@@ inal ."
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a W@@ e@@ b ad@@ dre@@ ss : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .@@ co@@ m / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad and run that program .
And that &apos;s a back@@ do@@ or which will take over your computer .
"But even more interest@@ ingly , if we contin@@ ue dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous str@@ ing , which says O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
That co@@ de is there under@@ ne@@ ath the enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion as some sort of a sig@@ nature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
"And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means ."
So obvi@@ ously I Goog@@ led for it .
I got z@@ er@@ o h@@ its ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I sp@@ o@@ ke with the guys at the lab .
"And we have a couple of R@@ us@@ si@@ an guys in our lab@@ s , and one of them men@@ tion@@ ed , well , it ends in R@@ U@@ S like R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
And 7@@ 8 is the city co@@ de for the city of St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
"For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car lic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ates and stuff like that ."
"So I went looking for cont@@ ac@@ ts in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , and through a long ro@@ ad , we ev@@ en@@ tually found this one particular we@@ b@@ site ."
"Here &apos;s this R@@ us@@ si@@ an guy who &apos;s been oper@@ ating on@@ line for a number of years who run@@ s his own we@@ b@@ site , and he run@@ s a b@@ lo@@ g under the pop@@ ular L@@ ive J@@ our@@ nal ."
"And on this b@@ lo@@ g , he b@@ lo@@ gs about his life , about his life in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his c@@ at , about his gir@@ l@@ friend ."
And he dri@@ ves a very nice car .
"In fact , this guy dri@@ ves a M@@ er@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ B@@ en@@ z S@@ 60@@ 0 V@@ 12 with a si@@ x@@ -@@ lit@@ er eng@@ ine with more than 40@@ 0 hor@@ se@@ power ."
Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-@@ old kid in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he b@@ log@@ ged about the car .
He actually had a car ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"In do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , he actually cr@@ ash@@ ed his car into another car ."
And he put b@@ log@@ ged images about the car ac@@ ci@@ dent — that &apos;s his M@@ er@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ad@@ a S@@ am@@ ar@@ a he cr@@ ash@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the lic@@ en@@ se pl@@ ate of the S@@ am@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S .
"And if you actually take a look at the sc@@ en@@ e picture , you can see that the pl@@ ate of the M@@ er@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ U@@ S ."
"Now I &apos;m not a la@@ w@@ y@@ er , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als are c@@ au@@ ght ?"
Well in most c@@ ases it never gets this far .
"The v@@ ast maj@@ ority of the on@@ line cri@@ me c@@ ases , we don &apos;t even know which contin@@ ent the att@@ ac@@ ks are coming from ."
"And even if we are able to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ als , quite often there is no out@@ come ."
"The local poli@@ ce don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down ."
I wish it would be eas@@ i@@ er ; un@@ fortun@@ ately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very r@@ ap@@ id p@@ ace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like S@@ tu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what S@@ tu@@ x@@ net did is that it inf@@ ected these .
"That &apos;s a S@@ i@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 40@@ 0 P@@ L@@ C , progra@@ m@@ m@@ able logi@@ c &#91; contro@@ l@@ l@@ er &#93; ."
And this is what run@@ s our in@@ fra@@ structure .
This is what run@@ s everything around us .
"P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small bo@@ x@@ es which have no dis@@ play , no ke@@ y@@ board , which are progra@@ m@@ med , are put in place , and they do their job ."
"For example , the el@@ ev@@ ators in this building most likely are contro@@ l@@ led by one of these ."
"And when S@@ tu@@ x@@ net inf@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a mas@@ sive revol@@ ution on the kinds of ris@@ ks we have to wor@@ ry about ."
Because everything around us is being run by these .
"I mean , we have cri@@ tical in@@ fra@@ structure ."
"You go to any fac@@ t@@ ory , any power plant , any chem@@ ical plant , any food pro@@ cess@@ ing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers ."
E@@ very@@ thing is being run by computers .
E@@ very@@ thing is reli@@ ant on these computers working .
"We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on bas@@ ic things like electr@@ ic@@ ity , obvi@@ ously , on computers working ."
And this really is something which cre@@ ates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of contin@@ u@@ ing to work even if computers fa@@ il .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So pre@@ par@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gr@@ an@@ ted ar@@ en &apos;t there .
"It &apos;s actually very bas@@ ic stuff — thinking about contin@@ u@@ ity , thinking about back@@ u@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter ."
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Th@@ ink about all the serv@@ ices we have on@@ line .
"Th@@ ink about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another ."
"I see beau@@ ty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we might not see that ."
I &apos;m wor@@ ried that we are run@@ ning into problems because of on@@ line cri@@ me .
O@@ n@@ line cri@@ me is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
"( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life def@@ ending the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fi@@ ght on@@ line cri@@ me , we are run@@ ning a risk of l@@ os@@ ing it all ."
"We have to do this glob@@ ally , and we have to do it right now ."
"What we need is more global , inter@@ national la@@ w en@@ for@@ c@@ ement work to find on@@ line cri@@ min@@ al g@@ an@@ gs — these organiz@@ ed g@@ an@@ gs that are making millions out of their att@@ ac@@ ks ."
That &apos;s much more important than run@@ ning anti@@ -@@ vir@@ uses or run@@ ning fi@@ re@@ w@@ alls .
"What actually mat@@ ters is actually fin@@ ding the people behind these att@@ ac@@ ks , and even more import@@ antly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this on@@ line world of cri@@ me , but ha@@ ven &apos;t yet done it ."
"We have to find the people with the sk@@ ills , but without the opport@@ unities and give them the opport@@ unities to use their sk@@ ills for good ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing with really re@@ mark@@ able speed .
"If you look at the ch@@ art at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ j@@ ec@@ tions su@@ ggest that the Chin@@ ese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
"And if you look at the ch@@ art for 20@@ 50 , it &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ected that the Chin@@ ese economy will be tw@@ ice the size of the American economy , and the In@@ di@@ an economy will be almost the same size as the American economy ."
And we should be@@ ar in mind here that these pro@@ j@@ ec@@ tions were dra@@ wn up before the W@@ ester@@ n fin@@ anci@@ al cri@@ sis .
"A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the l@@ at@@ est pro@@ j@@ ection by B@@ N@@ P P@@ ari@@ b@@ as for when China will have a lar@@ ger economy than the United States ."
G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s pro@@ j@@ ected 20@@ 2@@ 7 .
The pos@@ t-@@ cri@@ sis pro@@ j@@ ection is 20@@ 20 .
That &apos;s just a dec@@ ade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundam@@ ental re@@ spec@@ ts .
"F@@ irst of all , it &apos;s a huge develop@@ ing country with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year ."
"And within a dec@@ ade , it will have the lar@@ gest economy in the world ."
"N@@ ever before in the moder@@ n era has the lar@@ gest economy in the world been that of a develop@@ ing country , rather than a developed country ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , for the first time in the moder@@ n era , the dom@@ in@@ ant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the W@@ est and from very , very different civi@@ li@@ z@@ ational ro@@ ots ."
"Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad as@@ sum@@ ption in the W@@ est that as countries moder@@ n@@ ize , they also we@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ ize ."
This is an ill@@ us@@ ion .
"It &apos;s an as@@ sum@@ ption that moder@@ n@@ ity is a produc@@ t simply of compe@@ ti@@ tion , mar@@ kets and technology ."
It is not . It is also sh@@ ap@@ ed equ@@ ally by history and culture .
"@@ China is not like the W@@ est , and it will not become like the W@@ est ."
It will re@@ main in very fundam@@ ental re@@ spec@@ ts very different .
"Now the big question here is obvi@@ ously , how do we make sense of China ?"
How do we try to understand what China is ?
"And the problem we have in the W@@ est at the moment , by and large , is that the con@@ ven@@ tional appro@@ ach is that we understand it really in W@@ ester@@ n terms , using W@@ ester@@ n ideas ."
We can &apos;t .
"Now I want to off@@ er you three building b@@ loc@@ ks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning ."
The first is this : that China is not really a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"O@@ kay , it &apos;s called itself a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state for the last hund@@ red years , but everyone who kno@@ ws anything about China kno@@ ws it &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than this ."
This was what China looked like with the v@@ ic@@ t@@ ory of the Q@@ in D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y in 2@@ 2@@ 1 B@@ .@@ C@@ . at the end of the war@@ r@@ ing@@ -@@ state peri@@ od — the bir@@ th of moder@@ n China .
And you can see it against the b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies of moder@@ n China .
"O@@ r im@@ medi@@ ately af@@ ter@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ y@@ na@@ st@@ y , still 2@@ ,000 years ago ."
"And you can see already it oc@@ c@@ up@@ ies most of what we now know as E@@ ast@@ er@@ n China , which is where the v@@ ast maj@@ ority of Chin@@ ese lived then and live now ."
"Now what is extra@@ ordinary about this is , what gi@@ ves China its sense of being China , what gi@@ ves the Chin@@ ese the sense of what it is to be Chin@@ ese , comes not from the last hund@@ red years , not from the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state peri@@ od , which is what happened in the W@@ est , but from the peri@@ od , if you like , of the civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ oms like an@@ ce@@ str@@ al wor@@ ship , of a very dist@@ inc@@ tive no@@ tion of the state , like@@ wi@@ se , a very dist@@ inc@@ tive no@@ tion of the family , social relation@@ ships like gu@@ an@@ x@@ i , Con@@ f@@ uc@@ ian val@@ ues and so on ."
These are all things that come from the peri@@ od of the civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state .
"In other words , China , un@@ like the W@@ ester@@ n st@@ ates and most countries in the world , is sh@@ ap@@ ed by its sense of civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , its exist@@ ence as a civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , rather than as a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"And there &apos;s one other thing to ad@@ d to this , and that is this : O@@ f course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demo@@ grap@@ h@@ ically and ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ically , with a population of 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people ."
"What we often ar@@ en &apos;t really aw@@ are of is the fact that China is extre@@ me@@ ly di@@ ver@@ se and very pl@@ ur@@ al@@ is@@ tic , and in many ways very dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed ."
"You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case ."
It &apos;s never been the case .
"So this is China , a civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , rather than a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think it has all sor@@ ts of pro@@ found imp@@ lic@@ ations ."
I &apos;ll give you two qu@@ ick ones .
"The first is that the most important political value for the Chin@@ ese is unity , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of Chin@@ ese civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation ."
"You know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , Europe : brea@@ k@@ down — the fra@@ g@@ men@@ tation of the H@@ o@@ ly R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ p@@ ire ."
"It divi@@ ded , and it &apos;s re@@ ma@@ ined divi@@ ded ever since ."
"@@ China , over the same time peri@@ od , went in exactly the op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tion , very pain@@ fully hol@@ ding this huge civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , together ."
"The second is maybe more pr@@ os@@ a@@ ic , which is H@@ ong K@@ ong ."
Do you remember the h@@ an@@ do@@ ver of H@@ ong K@@ ong by B@@ rit@@ ain to China in 199@@ 7 ?
You may remember what the Chin@@ ese con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ position was .
"One country , two systems ."
And I &apos;ll l@@ ay a w@@ ag@@ er that bar@@ ely anyone in the W@@ est beli@@ ev@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; W@@ in@@ d@@ ow dre@@ s@@ sing .
"When China gets its hands on H@@ ong K@@ ong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and leg@@ al system in H@@ ong K@@ ong is as different now as it was in 199@@ 7 ."
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
"We were wrong because we thought , nat@@ ur@@ ally enough , in na@@ tion@@ -@@ state ways ."
"Th@@ ink of G@@ er@@ man uni@@ fic@@ ation , 199@@ 0 ."
What happened ?
"Well , basically the E@@ ast was s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed by the W@@ est ."
"One n@@ ation , one system ."
That is the na@@ tion@@ -@@ state m@@ ent@@ ality .
"But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , on the bas@@ is of one civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , one system ."
It doesn &apos;t work .
"So actually the respon@@ se of China to the question of H@@ ong K@@ ong — as it will be to the question of T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an — was a natural respon@@ se : one civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , many systems ."
Let me off@@ er you another building b@@ loc@@ k to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfor@@ table one .
"The Chin@@ ese have a very , very different con@@ cep@@ tion of r@@ ace to most other countries ."
"D@@ o you know , of the 1@@ .@@ 3 billion Chin@@ ese , over 9@@ 0 percent of them think they bel@@ ong to the same r@@ ace , the H@@ an ?"
"Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most pop@@ ul@@ ous countries ."
"In@@ dia , the United States , In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia , B@@ ra@@ z@@ il — all of them are multi@@ r@@ ac@@ ial ."
The Chin@@ ese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multi@@ r@@ ac@@ ial really at the mar@@ g@@ ins .
"So the question is , why ?"
"Well the reason , I think , ess@@ entially is , again , back to the civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
"A history of at least 2@@ ,000 years , a history of con@@ qu@@ est , oc@@ c@@ up@@ ation , ab@@ sor@@ ption , as@@ simil@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this no@@ tion of the H@@ an emer@@ ged — of course , n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red by a growing and very powerful sense of cul@@ tural identi@@ ty ."
"Now the great adv@@ ant@@ age of this hi@@ stor@@ ical experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have hel@@ d together ."
The H@@ an identi@@ ty has been the c@@ ement which has hel@@ d this country together .
The great di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age of it is that the H@@ an have a very we@@ ak con@@ cep@@ tion of cul@@ tural difference .
"They really believe in their own su@@ peri@@ ority , and they are dis@@ re@@ spec@@ t@@ ful of those who are not ."
"H@@ ence their at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur@@ s and to the T@@ i@@ be@@ t@@ ans ."
"O@@ r let me give you my third building b@@ loc@@ k , the Chin@@ ese state ."
Now the relation@@ ship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the W@@ est .
Now we in the W@@ est over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly see@@ m to think — in these days at least — that the au@@ th@@ ority and le@@ gi@@ tim@@ acy of the state is a func@@ tion of demo@@ cr@@ acy .
The problem with this pro@@ position is that the Chin@@ ese state en@@ jo@@ ys more le@@ gi@@ tim@@ acy and more au@@ th@@ ority am@@ on@@ g@@ st the Chin@@ ese than is true with any W@@ ester@@ n state .
"And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think ."
"And it &apos;s obvi@@ ously got nothing to do with demo@@ cr@@ acy , because in our terms the Chin@@ ese cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t have a demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"And the reason for this is , fir@@ st@@ ly , because the state in China is given a very special — it en@@ jo@@ ys a very special sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance as the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of Chin@@ ese civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , of the civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state ."
This is as close as China gets to a kind of sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual ro@@ le .
"And the second reason is because , wh@@ er@@ e@@ as in Europe and Nor@@ th America , the state &apos;s power is contin@@ u@@ ously challeng@@ ed — I mean in the Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ an tradi@@ tion , hi@@ stor@@ ically against the ch@@ ur@@ ch , against other sec@@ tors of the ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cr@@ acy , against mer@@ chan@@ ts and so on — for 1@@ ,000 years , the power of the Chin@@ ese state has not been challeng@@ ed ."
It &apos;s had no ser@@ ious ri@@ v@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been con@@ struc@@ ted in China is very different from our experience in W@@ ester@@ n history .
"The result , by the way , is that the Chin@@ ese have a very different view of the state ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as we t@@ end to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a str@@ an@@ ger , cer@@ tain@@ ly an org@@ an wh@@ ose po@@ wers need to be lim@@ ited or defin@@ ed and con@@ stra@@ ined , the Chin@@ ese don &apos;t see the state like that at all ."
"The Chin@@ ese view the state as an in@@ tim@@ ate — not just as an in@@ tim@@ ate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch of the family ."
"This is the Chin@@ ese view of the state — very , very different to ours ."
It &apos;s em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the W@@ est .
"And I would su@@ ggest to you that actually what we are de@@ al@@ ing with here , in the Chin@@ ese cont@@ ext , is a new kind of par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past ."
K@@ now that China beli@@ ev@@ es in the market and the state .
"I mean , A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith , already wr@@ iting in the l@@ ate 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chin@@ ese market is lar@@ ger and more developed and more s@@ oph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , ap@@ art from the Ma@@ o peri@@ od , that has re@@ ma@@ ined more or less the case ever since ."
But this is comb@@ ined with an extre@@ me@@ ly str@@ ong and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous state .
The state is every@@ where in China .
"I mean , it &apos;s lead@@ ing fir@@ ms — many of them are still pub@@ lic@@ ly o@@ w@@ ned ."
"P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , ho@@ we@@ ver large they are , like L@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ o , dep@@ end in many ways on state pat@@ r@@ on@@ age ."
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
"And the state , of course , its au@@ th@@ ority flo@@ ws into lots of other areas — as we are famili@@ ar with — with something like the on@@ e-@@ child po@@ lic@@ y ."
"M@@ ore@@ over , this is a very old state tradi@@ tion , a very old tradi@@ tion of st@@ at@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
"I mean , if you want an ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion of this , the Gre@@ at W@@ all is one ."
"But this is another , this is the G@@ r@@ and C@@ an@@ al , which was con@@ struc@@ ted in the first inst@@ ance in the fi@@ f@@ th century B@@ .@@ C@@ ."
and was finally comple@@ ted in the se@@ ven@@ th century A@@ .@@ D@@ .
"It went for 1@@ ,@@ 11@@ 4 miles , l@@ in@@ king B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i ."
"So there &apos;s a long history of extra@@ ordinary state in@@ fra@@ struc@@ tural pro@@ jects in China , which I sup@@ pose hel@@ ps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Th@@ ree G@@ org@@ es D@@ am and many other ex@@ pres@@ sions of state compe@@ t@@ ence within China ."
"So there we have three building b@@ loc@@ ks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the no@@ tion of r@@ ace and the nature of the state and its relation@@ ship to society ."
"And yet we still in@@ si@@ st , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply dra@@ wing on W@@ ester@@ n experience , looking at it through W@@ ester@@ n eyes , using W@@ ester@@ n con@@ cep@@ ts ."
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ingly see@@ m to get China wrong — our predic@@ tions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ cor@@ rec@@ t — this is the reason .
"@@ Un@@ fortun@@ ately , I think , I have to say that I think at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de to@@ wards China is that of a kind of little W@@ ester@@ ner m@@ ent@@ ality ."
It &apos;s kind of ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
"It &apos;s ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and ther@@ e@@ fore we have the univer@@ s@@ al meas@@ ure ."
"And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ig@@ nor@@ ant ."
We re@@ f@@ use to really ad@@ dre@@ ss the issue of difference .
"You know , there &apos;s a very interesting pas@@ s@@ age in a book by P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ h@@ en , the American hi@@ stor@@ ian ."
And P@@ au@@ l C@@ o@@ h@@ en ar@@ gu@@ es that the W@@ est thin@@ ks of itself as probably the most cos@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an of all cul@@ tures .
But it &apos;s not .
"In many ways , it &apos;s the most par@@ o@@ ch@@ ial , because for 20@@ 0 years , the W@@ est has been so dom@@ in@@ ant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cul@@ tures , other civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations ."
"Because , at the end of the day , it could , if nec@@ ess@@ ary by force , get its own way ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as those cul@@ tures — vir@@ tually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far we@@ a@@ ker position , vi@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ v@@ is the W@@ est — have been ther@@ e@@ by for@@ c@@ ed to understand the W@@ est , because of the W@@ est &apos;s pres@@ ence in those soci@@ e@@ ties ."
"And ther@@ e@@ fore , they are , as a result , more cos@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an in many ways than the W@@ est ."
"I mean , take the question of E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a : J@@ ap@@ an , K@@ ore@@ a , China , et@@ c . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there ."
Now the lar@@ gest economic regi@@ on in the world .
"And I &apos;ll tell you now , that E@@ ast A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the W@@ est than the W@@ est is about E@@ ast A@@ si@@ a ."
"Now this point is very g@@ er@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id , to the present ."
"Because what &apos;s happening ? B@@ ack to that ch@@ art at the beginning , the G@@ ol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ch@@ art ."
"What is happening is that , very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly in hi@@ stor@@ ical terms , the world is being dri@@ ven and sh@@ ap@@ ed , not by the old developed countries , but by the develop@@ ing world ."
"We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ ping very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly the position of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 ."
And there are two con@@ sequ@@ ences of this .
"F@@ irst , the W@@ est is r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly l@@ os@@ ing its in@@ flu@@ ence in the world ."
"There was a dra@@ ma@@ tic ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion of this actually a year ago — C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en , climate change con@@ fer@@ ence ."
Europe was not at the fin@@ al ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ag@@ er it was probably about 20@@ 0 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
"And the second imp@@ lic@@ ation is that the world will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence , become incre@@ as@@ ingly un@@ famili@@ ar to us , because it &apos;ll be sh@@ ap@@ ed by cul@@ tures and experi@@ ences and hi@@ stories that we are not really famili@@ ar with , or conver@@ s@@ ant with ."
"And at last , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id — take Europe ; America is sli@@ gh@@ tly different — but Eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ig@@ nor@@ ant , are un@@ aw@@ are about the way the world is changing ."
"S@@ ome people — I &apos;ve got an Eng@@ lish friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The contin@@ ent is sle@@ ep@@ wal@@ king into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation ."
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is incre@@ as@@ ingly out of tou@@ ch with the world — and that is a sort of l@@ oss of a sense of the future .
"I mean , Europe once , of course , once comm@@ an@@ ded the future in its con@@ fi@@ dence ."
"T@@ ake the 19@@ th century , for example ."
"But this , al@@ as , is no longer true ."
"If you want to feel the future , if you want to ta@@ st@@ e the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ f@@ uc@@ i@@ us ."
This is a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation the li@@ kes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; ra@@ il@@ way st@@ ation for the high@@ -@@ speed tra@@ ins .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will so@@ on have more than all the rest of the world put together .
"O@@ r take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out sh@@ or@@ tly in a sub@@ ur@@ b of B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing ."
"Here you have a me@@ g@@ ab@@ us , on the up@@ per dec@@ k car@@ ri@@ es about 2@@ ,000 people ."
"It trav@@ els on ra@@ ils down a sub@@ ur@@ ban ro@@ ad , and the cars trav@@ el under@@ ne@@ ath it ."
And it does spe@@ e@@ ds of up to about 100 miles an h@@ our .
"Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very speci@@ fic problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space ."
"So this is a solution to a situ@@ ation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people ."
"O@@ kay , so how would I like to fin@@ ish ?"
"Well , what should our at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de be to@@ wards this world that we see very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly develop@@ ing before us ?"
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
"But I want to ar@@ gu@@ e , abo@@ ve all , a bi@@ g@@ -@@ picture posi@@ tive for this world ."
"For 20@@ 0 years , the world was ess@@ entially go@@ ver@@ ned by a fra@@ g@@ ment of the human population ."
That &apos;s what Europe and Nor@@ th America re@@ pres@@ ented .
"The ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 3@@ 8 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia and B@@ ra@@ z@@ il and so on , re@@ present the most important single act of demo@@ cra@@ tiz@@ ation in the last 20@@ 0 years ."
"C@@ i@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and cul@@ tures , which had been ig@@ no@@ red , which had no vo@@ ice , which were not list@@ en@@ ed to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of re@@ pres@@ en@@ tation in this world ."
"As human@@ ists , we must w@@ el@@ come , su@@ rely , this trans@@ for@@ mation , and we will have to learn about these civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations ."
"This big ship here was the one sa@@ il@@ ed in by Z@@ h@@ en@@ g He in the early 15@@ th century on his great vo@@ y@@ ages around the S@@ outh China S@@ e@@ a , the E@@ ast China S@@ e@@ a and across the In@@ di@@ an O@@ ce@@ an to E@@ ast Africa ."
"The little bo@@ at in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Ch@@ ri@@ stop@@ her C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us cr@@ os@@ sed the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ r , look care@@ fully at this sil@@ k sc@@ ro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 8 ."
I think they &apos;re playing go@@ l@@ f .
"@@ Ch@@ ri@@ st , the Chin@@ ese even inv@@ ented go@@ l@@ f ."
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revol@@ ution .
"Now before you get up in ar@@ ms , or you bre@@ ak into s@@ ong , or you pic@@ k a fav@@ or@@ ite color , I want to def@@ ine what I mean by revol@@ ution ."
"B@@ y revol@@ ution , I mean a dr@@ astic and far@@ -@@ re@@ ach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have — the way we think and the way we be@@ have ."
"Now why , S@@ te@@ ve , why do we need a revol@@ ution ?"
We need a revol@@ ution because things ar@@ en &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sa@@ d because I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of things not working .
"You know , I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us not living up to our pot@@ ential ."
I &apos;m s@@ ick and ti@@ red of us being last .
"And we are last place in so many things — for example , social fac@@ tors ."
We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
"There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation ."
"We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being ."
"And there we are , not just last in the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom ."
"And wor@@ st of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The E@@ con@@ om@@ ist ."
"We &apos;re the sa@@ dd@@ est place on Earth , rela@@ tive to G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a — the sa@@ dd@@ est place on Earth ."
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Wh@@ ere do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another re@@ port by the O@@ E@@ C@@ D ?
"L@@ ast in read@@ ing , mat@@ h and science . L@@ ast ."
B@@ us@@ iness : The low@@ est per@@ cep@@ tion in the E@@ .@@ U@@ .
that ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s provi@@ de bene@@ f@@ its to society .
"Wh@@ y as a result , what happens ?"
The low@@ est per@@ cent@@ age of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ s starting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es .
And this is des@@ p@@ ite the fact that everybody kno@@ ws that small business is the eng@@ ine of econom@@ ies .
We h@@ ire the most people ; we create the most ta@@ x@@ es .
"So if our eng@@ ine &apos;s bro@@ ken , gu@@ ess what ?"
L@@ ast in Europe G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a .
L@@ ast .
"So it &apos;s no surpri@@ se , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans are not op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic about the future ."
"We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the wor@@ st bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es ."
"And these are fac@@ ts , guys ."
This isn &apos;t story tal@@ e ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy I have got against B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia . These are fac@@ ts .
"So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is bro@@ ken ."
"The way we think , the way we be@@ have , our oper@@ ating system of be@@ having is bro@@ ken ."
"We need a dr@@ astic change in the way we think and be@@ have to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future ."
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be posi@@ tive now . We &apos;re going to get posi@@ tive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ astic to some of you — because we are hand@@ ic@@ app@@ ing ourselves .
We &apos;re hol@@ ding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
"I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right ."
"In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like ."
"B@@ ab@@ ies play , kids play , ad@@ ults play ."
We don &apos;t value play .
"In fact , we dev@@ al@@ ue play ."
And we dev@@ al@@ ue it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al : 4@@ 5 years of what ?
"O@@ f commun@@ ism — of val@@ u@@ ing the society and the state over the individual and squ@@ ash@@ ing , in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently , cre@@ a@@ tivity , individual self-@@ ex@@ pression and innovation ."
"And instead , what do we value ?"
"Because it &apos;s sho@@ wn the way we app@@ ly , gener@@ ate and use knowledge is aff@@ ected by our social and institu@@ tional cont@@ ext , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?"
T@@ o be ser@@ ious .
"T@@ o be really , really ser@@ ious ."
It did .
( Applause ) B@@ e ser@@ ious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the par@@ k for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
"H@@ ea@@ ven for@@ b@@ id they play in the di@@ r@@ t , the k@@ al , or even wor@@ se , lo@@ k@@ v@@ i , water — that will k@@ ill them ."
I have been told by bab@@ as and d@@ y@@ a@@ do@@ s that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is ser@@ ious and we need to tra@@ in them for the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of life .
We have a ser@@ ious me@@ me run@@ ning through .
It &apos;s a social gen@@ e run@@ ning through us .
It &apos;s a ser@@ ious gen@@ e .
It &apos;s 4@@ 5 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a fac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
"S@@ te@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . I@@ sk@@ am baby . &quot; &quot; S@@ te@@ p two : we get the baby . W@@ oo@@ ho@@ o !@@ "
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to fur@@ ther my care@@ er or I just want to go have co@@ ff@@ e@@ es .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ k@@ o to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been inf@@ ected by the ser@@ ious me@@ me for 4@@ 5 years .
So what happens ?
"She pas@@ ses that vir@@ us on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the re@@ d@@ w@@ ood tre@@ es — for that ser@@ ious me@@ me to get out of our oper@@ ating system ."
What happens then ?
"It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that val@@ ues r@@ ote learning , mem@@ or@@ iz@@ ation and stand@@ ar@@ di@@ z@@ ation , and dev@@ al@@ ues self-@@ ex@@ pression , self-@@ expl@@ or@@ ation , ques@@ tion@@ ing , cre@@ a@@ tivity and play ."
It &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
T@@ ru@@ e story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
We went to this pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study mat@@ h 10 times a week and science eight times a week and read@@ ing five times a day and all this stuff .
"And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and rec@@ ess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the sch@@ e@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a cri@@ me . What a cri@@ me ."
"And it &apos;s a cri@@ me that our education system is so ser@@ ious because education is ser@@ ious that we &apos;re creating min@@ d@@ less , robo@@ tic wor@@ kers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre@@ -@@ dr@@ illed hol@@ es ."
"But I &apos;m sor@@ ry , the problems of today are not the problems of the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evolution ."
"We need ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ability , the ability to learn how to be cre@@ ative and innov@@ ative ."
We don &apos;t need mechan@@ iz@@ ed wor@@ kers .
"But no , now our me@@ me goes into work where we don &apos;t value play ."
"We create robo@@ tic wor@@ kers that we tre@@ at like as@@ se@@ ts , to le@@ ver and just th@@ row away ."
What are qu@@ ali@@ ties of a B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ an work ?
Au@@ to@@ cra@@ tic — do what I say because I &apos;m the che@@ f .
I &apos;m the b@@ oss and I know better than you .
"@@ Un@@ tru@@ sting — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously a cri@@ min@@ al , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all cam@@ er@@ as ."
"( Laughter ) Con@@ tro@@ l@@ ling — you &apos;re obvi@@ ously an i@@ di@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ illion little pro@@ cess@@ es for you to fol@@ low so you don &apos;t step out of the box ."
"So they &apos;re re@@ str@@ ic@@ tive — don &apos;t use your mo@@ bi@@ le phone , don &apos;t use your l@@ ap@@ top , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I@@ .@@ M@@ ."
That &apos;s some@@ how un@@ prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al and bad .
"And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ f@@ illing because you &apos;re contro@@ l@@ led , you &apos;re re@@ str@@ ic@@ ted , you &apos;re not val@@ u@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fun ."
"In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play ."
"And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous , S@@ te@@ ve . What a d@@ um@@ b idea ."
It can &apos;t be because of play .
"@@ Just play , that &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id thing . &quot; &quot; We have the ser@@ ious me@@ me in us ."
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
"And I will pro@@ ve it to you in the next part of the spe@@ ech — that play is the cat@@ al@@ y@@ st , it is the revol@@ ution , that we can use to trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
P@@ l@@ ay : our bra@@ ins are har@@ d@@ wi@@ red for play .
"E@@ vol@@ ution has sel@@ ected , over millions and b@@ illions of years , for play in animals and in humans ."
And you know what ?
"E@@ vol@@ ution does a really , really good job of des@@ elec@@ ting tra@@ its that ar@@ en &apos;t adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ e@@ ous to us and sel@@ ec@@ ting tra@@ its for compe@@ ti@@ tive adv@@ ant@@ age ."
"N@@ ature isn &apos;t stu@@ p@@ id , and it sel@@ ected for play ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , for example : ants . An@@ ts play ."
M@@ ay@@ be you didn &apos;t know that .
"But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics of things ."
"@@ R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that r@@ ats that play more have bigger bra@@ ins and they learn t@@ as@@ ks better , sk@@ ills ."
K@@ it@@ ten@@ s play . We all know k@@ it@@ ten@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ ten@@ s de@@ pri@@ ved of play are un@@ able to inter@@ act soci@@ ally .
"They can still h@@ un@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social ."
B@@ ear@@ s play .
But what you may not know is that be@@ ars that play more survi@@ ve longer .
It &apos;s not the be@@ ars that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
"And a fin@@ al really interesting study — it &apos;s been sho@@ wn , a cor@@ rel@@ ation between play and brain size ."
"The more you play , the bigger the bra@@ ins there are ."
"D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins , pretty big bra@@ ins , play a lot ."
But who do you think with the bi@@ ggest bra@@ ins are the bi@@ ggest play@@ ers ?
Y@@ ours tru@@ ly : humans .
"@@ K@@ i@@ ds play , we play — of every na@@ tion@@ ality , of every r@@ ace , of every color , of every religi@@ on ."
It &apos;s a univer@@ s@@ al thing — we play .
"And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s ad@@ ults too ."
Re@@ ally c@@ ool term : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in ad@@ ults .
And who are the bi@@ ggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
H@@ um@@ ans . We play sp@@ or@@ ts .
"We do it for fun , or as O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ ans , or as prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als ."
We play mus@@ ical in@@ str@@ um@@ ents .
"We d@@ ance , we k@@ is@@ s , we sing , we just go@@ of around ."
We &apos;re designed by nature to play from bir@@ th to old age .
We &apos;re designed to do that contin@@ u@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
It is a huge bene@@ fit .
"@@ Just like there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its to animals , there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its to humans ."
"For example , it &apos;s been sho@@ wn to sti@@ mul@@ ate ne@@ ural growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , in the area where it contro@@ ls emo@@ tions ."
It &apos;s been sho@@ wn to prom@@ ote pre@@ -@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ ment where a lot of co@@ g@@ ni@@ tion is happening .
"As a result , what happens ?"
We devel@@ op more emo@@ tional mat@@ urity if we play more .
We devel@@ op better deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are fac@@ ts .
"It &apos;s not fic@@ tion , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s co@@ ld , hard science ."
These are the bene@@ f@@ its to play .
"It is a gene@@ tic bir@@ th@@ right that we have , like wal@@ king or spea@@ king or seeing ."
"And if we hand@@ ic@@ a@@ p ourselves with play , we hand@@ ic@@ a@@ p ourselves as if we would with any other bir@@ th@@ right that we have ."
We hold ourselves back .
L@@ it@@ tle ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
"I@@ mag@@ ine a world without the@@ ater , without the ar@@ ts , without s@@ ong , without d@@ anc@@ ing , without so@@ c@@ c@@ er , without fo@@ ot@@ ball , without l@@ aughter ."
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty b@@ lea@@ k .
It &apos;s pretty gl@@ um .
Now imagine your wor@@ k@@ place .
Is it fun ? Is it play@@ ful ?
O@@ r maybe the wor@@ k@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
Is it fun ? Is it play@@ ful ?
"O@@ r is it cra@@ p ? Is it au@@ to@@ cra@@ tic , contro@@ l@@ ling , re@@ str@@ ic@@ tive and un@@ tru@@ sting and un@@ ful@@ f@@ illing ?"
We have this con@@ cept that the op@@ pos@@ ite of play is work .
We even feel gu@@ il@@ ty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
"&quot; Oh , my colle@@ ag@@ ues see me l@@ augh@@ ing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hi@@ de because my b@@ oss might see me ."
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is back@@ wards .
The op@@ pos@@ ite of play is not work . The op@@ pos@@ ite of play
is de@@ pression . It &apos;s de@@ pression .
"In fact , play impro@@ ves our work ."
"@@ Just like there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its for humans and animals , there &apos;s bene@@ f@@ its for play at work ."
"For example , it sti@@ mul@@ ates cre@@ a@@ tivity ."
It incre@@ ases our open@@ ness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
"It provi@@ des a sense of pur@@ pose and ma@@ st@@ ery — two key mo@@ tiv@@ ational things that incre@@ ase produc@@ tivity , through play ."
"So before you start thinking of play as just not ser@@ ious , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous ."
"You know , the prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al a@@ th@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves s@@ ki@@ ing , he &apos;s ser@@ ious about it , but he lo@@ ves it ."
"He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the f@@ low ."
"A doc@@ tor might be ser@@ ious , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medic@@ ine ."
O@@ ur thinking is back@@ wards .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be feeling gu@@ il@@ ty .
We should be c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating play .
Q@@ u@@ ick example from the cor@@ por@@ ate world .
"F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy m@@ ot@@ to : people , serv@@ ice , prof@@ it ."
"If you tre@@ at your people like people , if you tre@@ at them great , they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er , they &apos;re ful@@ f@@ illed , they have a sense of ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ pose ."
"What happens ? They give better serv@@ ice — not wor@@ se , but better ."
"And when cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers call for serv@@ ice and they &apos;re de@@ al@@ ing with happy people that can make deci@@ sions and are ful@@ f@@ illed , how do the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers feel ? They feel great ."
"And what do great cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers do , gre@@ at@@ -@@ feeling cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ?"
"They buy more of your serv@@ ice and they tell more of their friends , which lea@@ ds to more prof@@ it ."
"P@@ e@@ ople , serv@@ ice , prof@@ it ."
"P@@ l@@ ay incre@@ ases produc@@ tivity , not dec@@ reas@@ es ."
"And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; G@@ e@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia ."
"@@ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia , you guys . T@@ w@@ o reasons ."
"One , play is univer@@ s@@ al ."
"There &apos;s nothing we@@ ird about B@@ ul@@ g@@ ari@@ ans that we can &apos;t play , b@@ es@@ id@@ es the ser@@ ious me@@ me that we have to k@@ ick out ."
"T@@ w@@ o , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at S@@ ci@@ ant ."
"When I got there , we had z@@ er@@ o happy cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ."
N@@ ot one cu@@ st@@ om@@ er would re@@ f@@ er us .
I asked them all .
We had mar@@ g@@ inal prof@@ it — I did .
"We had mar@@ g@@ inal prof@@ its , and we had un@@ happy sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ d@@ ers ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh some bas@@ ic change , change like impro@@ ving transp@@ ar@@ ency , change like prom@@ ot@@ ing self-@@ direc@@ tion and coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ging coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , not au@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , the things like having a res@@ ul@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ foc@@ us ."
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your cu@@ st@@ om@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organiz@@ ed with that .
Why do I care if you get in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ?
B@@ as@@ ically prom@@ ot@@ ing fun .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh prom@@ ot@@ ing fun and a great environment , we were able to trans@@ form S@@ ci@@ ant and , in just three sh@@ ort years — s@@ ounds like a long time , but change is s@@ low — every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , from z@@ er@@ o to every cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing us , abo@@ ve average prof@@ its for the industry and happy sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ d@@ ers ."
"And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did w@@ in , every year that we en@@ ter@@ ed , one of the ran@@ k@@ ings for best emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er for small business ."
In@@ depend@@ ent anal@@ ys@@ is from an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es on their sur@@ ve@@ ys .
"It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia ."
"There &apos;s nothing hol@@ ding us back , ex@@ cept our own m@@ ent@@ ality about play ."
So some ste@@ ps that we can take — to fin@@ ish up — how to make this revol@@ ution through play .
"F@@ irst of all , you have to believe me ."
"If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something ."
"S@@ econ@@ d of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to re@@ disco@@ ver play ."
"Wh@@ at@@ ever it was that as a kid you used to en@@ jo@@ y , that you en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that prom@@ o@@ tion you can &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y , because you feel like you have to be ser@@ ious , re@@ disco@@ ver it ."
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s m@@ oun@@ tain bi@@ king or read@@ ing a book or playing a game .
"@@ Re@@ disco@@ ver that because you &apos;re the lead@@ ers , the innovation lead@@ ers , the thought lead@@ ers ."
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the off@@ ice or talk to your friends and ig@@ n@@ ite the fir@@ e of change in the play revol@@ ution .
"You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colle@@ ag@@ ues , your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , ar@@ en &apos;t going to feel it ."
"You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m going to tr@@ ust you . &quot; &quot; W@@ e@@ ird con@@ cept : I hi@@ red you ; I should tr@@ ust you ."
"I &apos;m going to let you make deci@@ sions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to d@@ ele@@ g@@ ate to the low@@ est level , rather than the top ."
I &apos;m going to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge con@@ struc@@ tive cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge au@@ th@@ ority .
Because it &apos;s by challeng@@ ing the way things are always done is that we are able to bre@@ ak out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create innov@@ ative solu@@ tions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as lead@@ ers .
We &apos;re going to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate fear .
F@@ e@@ ar is the ene@@ my of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like e@@ li@@ min@@ ate re@@ str@@ ic@@ tions .
"You know what , let them use their mo@@ bi@@ le phone for personal call@@ s — he@@ a@@ ven for@@ b@@ id ."
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on inst@@ ant mess@@ eng@@ ers .
Let them take long l@@ un@@ ches .
L@@ unch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
"It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ char@@ ge your brain , you me@@ et your friends , you have a be@@ er , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before ."
"L@@ et them do it . G@@ ive them some free@@ dom , and in gener@@ al , let them play . Let them have fun at the wor@@ k@@ place ."
"We spend so much of our lives at the wor@@ k@@ place , and it &apos;s sup@@ posed to be , what , a mis@@ er@@ able gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wa@@ ke up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?"
Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ ac@@ cep@@ table . N@@ e@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
"( Laughter ) So in sum@@ mar@@ y , we need a dr@@ astic change in the way we think and be@@ have , but we don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; revol@@ ution ."
We don &apos;t need a wor@@ kers &apos; revol@@ ution .
What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing . What we need is a play@@ ers &apos; u@@ pri@@ sing .
"S@@ eri@@ ously , we need to b@@ and together . T@@ o@@ day is the start of the u@@ pri@@ sing . But what you need to do is f@@ an the fl@@ ames of the revol@@ ution . You need to go and share your ideas and your suc@@ cess stor@@ i@@ es@@ "
"@@ of what worked about re@@ in@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ating our lives , our s@@ cho@@ ols , and our work with play ; about how play prom@@ ot@@ es a sense of prom@@ ise and self-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ; of how play prom@@ ot@@ es innovation and produc@@ tivity , and , ul@@ tim@@ ately , how play cre@@ ates mean@@ ing ."
"Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can trans@@ form B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no@@ -@@ t@@ ech life h@@ ack , and all it requ@@ i@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ all@@ er ?
S@@ ome@@ times we hold onto our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ ome@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated with body language , and we &apos;re partic@@ ularly interested in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a sm@@ ile , or a cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a hand@@ sha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ um@@ ber 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New York T@@ im@@ es .
"So obvi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communic@@ ation ."
"When we think about communic@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really mean@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we h@@ ire or prom@@ ote , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i A@@ m@@ b@@ ad@@ y , a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ versity , shows that when people watch 30@@ -@@ second s@@ ound@@ less c@@ li@@ ps of real phys@@ ici@@ an@@ -@@ patient inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the phys@@ ici@@ an &apos;s n@@ ic@@ en@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that phys@@ ici@@ an will be su@@ ed ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . Right ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our fe@@ el@@ ings and our ph@@ y@@ si@@ o@@ logy ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist . I study pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice , and I teach at a compe@@ ti@@ tive business school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interested in power d@@ y@@ nam@@ ics ."
I became esp@@ eci@@ ally interested in non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ b@@ al ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about exp@@ anding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ ening up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ ening up .
"This ex@@ pression , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ ess@@ ica T@@ r@@ acy has stu@@ died ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really powerful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sm@@ all@@ er . We don &apos;t m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavior in the cl@@ ass@@ room , and what do I no@@ tice ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vir@@ tually coll@@ ap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I no@@ tice a couple of things about this .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ r@@ on@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cl@@ ass@@ room , because par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation coun@@ ts for half the gra@@ de ."
So business s@@ cho@@ ols have been str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , o@@ kay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we sm@@ ile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ c@@ ed to sm@@ ile by hol@@ ding a p@@ en in our te@@ e@@ th like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ dies , but is it also true that our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the powerful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So powerful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to w@@ in even at g@@ ames of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differ@@ ences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to st@@ res@@ s ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really st@@ res@@ s re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can sh@@ ape the mind , at least at the fac@@ ial level , and also that ro@@ le changes can sh@@ ape the mind ."
"So what happens , o@@ kay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ im@@ al level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be st@@ anding or you can be sitting .
And here are the low@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experim@@ ent .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
"So it seems that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ dies change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative situ@@ ations , like social thre@@ at situ@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is wor@@ se than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
Pe@@ ople h@@ ate this .
"We then have these co@@ d@@ ers look at these t@@ ap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the condi@@ tions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing to the spe@@ ech .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect ."
"So I said , fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad car ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a car , ro@@ l@@ led sever@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the car .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had identi@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of colle@@ ge , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish colle@@ ge ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to st@@ ay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feeling ."
"L@@ i@@ ke , she can fa@@ ke it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ e .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ ea@@ ks can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ w@@ o minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that situ@@ ation feeling like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"@@ Gre@@ at cre@@ a@@ tivity . In times of need , we need great cre@@ a@@ tivity ."

"( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : You know , rather than dri@@ ve today , I &apos;m going to walk ."
"N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator : And so he wal@@ ked , and as he wal@@ ked he saw things ."

"S@@ ure , she had ag@@ ed a little ."
"In fact , she had ag@@ ed a lot ."
But he felt all his old pas@@ sion for her re@@ turn .

"B@@ ea@@ u L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple ."
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
"So , I &apos;m going to coun@@ t to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together ."
"O@@ kay , one , two , th@@ ree@@ .@@ Au@@ dience : C@@ an you read this ?"
"B@@ L : A@@ ma@@ zing . What about this one ? One , two , th@@ ree@@ .@@ Au@@ dience : You are not read@@ ing this ."
"B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three ."
Au@@ dience : What are you read@@ ing ?
B@@ L : What are you read@@ ing ? There are no words there .
"I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?"
"It literally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?"
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our experience .
"@@ Right ? The brain takes mean@@ ing@@ less information and makes mean@@ ing out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was us@@ e@@ ful to see in the past ."
"All right ? Wh@@ ich means , when it comes to per@@ cep@@ tion , we &apos;re all like this f@@ ro@@ g ."
"( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s us@@ e@@ ful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) M@@ an : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ y@@ ed , right ?"
"But we &apos;re talking about per@@ cep@@ tion here , right ?"
"And per@@ cep@@ tion under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dre@@ am@@ s , the c@@ lo@@ th@@ es we we@@ ar , f@@ all@@ ing in love , everything beg@@ ins with per@@ cep@@ tion ."
"Now if per@@ cep@@ tion is gr@@ oun@@ ded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding ac@@ cor@@ ding to what we &apos;ve done before ."
"But actually , it &apos;s a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous problem , because how can we ever see differ@@ ently ?"
"Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differ@@ ently , and all new per@@ cep@@ tions beg@@ in in the same way ."
They beg@@ in with a question .
The problem with questions is they create un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"Now , un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a pre@@ dat@@ or , it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
Okay ? ( Laughter ) E@@ ven se@@ as@@ ick@@ ness is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
"@@ Right ? If you go down bel@@ ow on a bo@@ at , your in@@ ner ear@@ s are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Y@@ our eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the bo@@ at , say I &apos;m st@@ anding still ."
"@@ Y@@ our brain cannot deal with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of that information , and it gets ill ."
"The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous things you can do , because it takes you into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ."
"And yet , the ir@@ ony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space ."
"So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortun@@ ately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?"
And it en@@ ab@@ les us to ad@@ dre@@ ss even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
"It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life beg@@ in , or what ex@@ ten@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ p@@ ping into that space ."
So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . E@@ x@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
P@@ l@@ ay is one of the only human en@@ de@@ av@@ ors where un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is actually c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated . Un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty is what makes play fun .
"@@ Right ? It &apos;s ad@@ ap@@ table to change . Right ? It op@@ ens possi@@ bility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social b@@ on@@ ding , and it &apos;s in@@ tr@@ in@@ s@@ ically mo@@ tiv@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . P@@ l@@ ay is its own re@@ ward ."
"Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the ex@@ act same ways of being you need in order to be a good scienti@@ st ."
S@@ ci@@ ence is not defin@@ ed by the me@@ th@@ od sec@@ tion of a paper .
"It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is cre@@ ative ."
"So if you ad@@ d rules to play , you have a game ."
That &apos;s actually what an experim@@ ent is .
"So ar@@ med with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experim@@ ents are play , we asked , can anyone become a scienti@@ st ?"
And who better to ask than 25 e@@ igh@@ t@@ - to 10@@ -@@ year-@@ old children ?
"Because they &apos;re exper@@ ts in play . So I took my be@@ e ar@@ en@@ a down to a small school in D@@ ev@@ on , and the a@@ i@@ m of this was to not just get the kids to see science differ@@ ently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differ@@ ently . Right ?"
The first step was to ask a question .
"Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get fund@@ ing for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a us@@ e@@ ful con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to science , and the teach@@ ers said kids couldn &apos;t do it ."
So we did it any@@ way . Right ? O@@ f course .
"So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small pr@@ int so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther read@@ ing it . P@@ o@@ int is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the bas@@ is of science pub@@ lic@@ ation the last five to 15 years . Right ?"
So they were asking questions that were sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant to exper@@ t scientists .
"Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?"
"She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youn@@ gest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?"
"Now , science and asking questions is about cou@@ ra@@ ge ."
"Now she is the person@@ i@@ fic@@ ation of cou@@ ra@@ ge , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all ."
"So A@@ my , would you ple@@ ase come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton B@@ e@@ es P@@ ro@@ ject , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go a@@ head , A@@ my ."
"A@@ my O &apos;@@ T@@ oo@@ le : Thank you , B@@ ea@@ u . We thought that it was easy to see the l@@ ink between humans and ap@@ es in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke ."
"But we wonder@@ ed if there &apos;s a possible l@@ ink with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and be@@ es thought similar , since they see@@ m so different from us ."
So we asked if humans and be@@ es might solve complex problems in the same way .
"@@ Re@@ ally , we wanted to know if be@@ es can also ad@@ ap@@ t themselves to new situ@@ ations using pre@@ vi@@ ously learned rules and condi@@ tions . So what if be@@ es can think like us ?"
"Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an in@@ s@@ ect with only one million brain cells ."
"But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because be@@ es , like us , can recogn@@ ize a good flo@@ wer reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the time of day , the light , the we@@ a@@ ther , or from any ang@@ le they appro@@ ach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experim@@ ent , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experim@@ ent , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le that you set the be@@ es ?"
A@@ O : The pu@@ z@@ z@@ le we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then ru@@ le .
"We asked the be@@ es to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flo@@ wer only when it &apos;s in a certain patter@@ n ."
"They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ wers if the y@@ el@@ low flo@@ wers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the blue , or if the blue flo@@ wers were sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by the y@@ el@@ low ."
"Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the be@@ es can learn to solve this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le . The interesting question is , which ?"
"What was really exc@@ iting about this project was we , and B@@ ea@@ u , had no idea whether it would work ."
"It was completely new , and no one had done it before , inclu@@ ding ad@@ ults . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teach@@ ers , and that was really hard for the teach@@ ers ."
"It &apos;s easy for a scienti@@ st to go in and not have a cl@@ ue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a te@@ ac@@ her not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the cre@@ d@@ it goes to D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick , who was the coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ator on this project . Okay ?"
"So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole de@@ ta@@ ils of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is ob@@ serv@@ ation . So here are some of the students doing the ob@@ serv@@ ations . They &apos;re rec@@ or@@ ding the data of where the be@@ es fly ."
( V@@ ide@@ o ) D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — S@@ tu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : Is she still going up here ? S@@ tu@@ dent : Yeah .
"D@@ a@@ ve S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So you keep tr@@ ack of e@@ ach@@ .@@ S@@ tu@@ dent : H@@ en@@ ry , can you help me here ?"
"B@@ L : &quot; &quot; C@@ an you help me , H@@ en@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; What good scienti@@ st says that , right ?"
S@@ tu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our ob@@ serv@@ ations . We &apos;ve got our data .
"They do the simple mathema@@ tics , a@@ ver@@ ag@@ ing , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ m@@ it this for pub@@ lic@@ ation . Right ? So we have to write it up .
"So we go , of course , to the pu@@ b . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , o@@ kay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sec@@ tions : an int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , a me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , a res@@ ults , a di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion ."
"The int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion says , what &apos;s the question and why ?"
"M@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ds , what did you do ? R@@ es@@ ults , what was the ob@@ serv@@ ation ?"
"And the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion is , who car@@ es ? Right ?"
"That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive , which means that this paper is writ@@ ten in k@@ id@@ speak ."
"It &apos;s not writ@@ ten by me . It &apos;s writ@@ ten by A@@ my and the other students in the class . A@@ s a con@@ sequ@@ ence , this science paper beg@@ ins , &quot; &quot; O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The res@@ ults sec@@ tion , it says : &quot; &quot; T@@ ra@@ ining p@@ ha@@ se , the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the me@@ th@@ o@@ ds , it says , &quot; &quot; Th@@ en we put the be@@ es into the fri@@ dge ( and made be@@ e pi@@ e ) , &quot; &quot; sm@@ il@@ ey face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it publi@@ shed ."
So here &apos;s the ti@@ tle p@@ age . We have a number of au@@ th@@ ors there .
All the ones in bo@@ ld are eight to 10 years old .
"The first au@@ th@@ or is B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton P@@ ri@@ mar@@ y S@@ ch@@ ool , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ed , it would be &quot; &quot; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we sub@@ m@@ it it to a public access jour@@ nal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this ."
"&quot; &quot; I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id the paper fail@@ s our in@@ i@@ ti@@ al qu@@ ality control ch@@ ec@@ ks in sever@@ al different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it star@@ ts off &quot; &quot; once up@@ on a time , &quot; &quot; the fi@@ gu@@ res are in cra@@ y@@ on , et@@ c . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ vie@@ wed . So I s@@ ent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the N@@ ational A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of S@@ ci@@ ence , one of the lead@@ ing neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most orig@@ inal science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it cer@@ tain@@ ly des@@ er@@ ves wi@@ de ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;"
"L@@ ar@@ ry M@@ al@@ on@@ ey , exper@@ t in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent ."
The work would be publi@@ sha@@ ble if done by ad@@ ults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We s@@ end it back to the ed@@ it@@ or .
They say no .
"So we asked L@@ ar@@ ry and N@@ at@@ ali@@ e H@@ em@@ pe@@ l to write a comm@@ ent@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ d@@ ings for scientists , right , p@@ utting in the re@@ fer@@ ences , and we sub@@ m@@ it it to B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters ."
"And there , it was re@@ vie@@ wed by five in@@ depend@@ ent re@@ fer@@ e@@ es , and it was publi@@ shed . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it publi@@ shed . ( Laughter ) T@@ yp@@ ical science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ gest publi@@ shed scientists in the world ."
What was the fe@@ ed@@ back like ?
"Well , it was publi@@ shed two days before Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed 30@@ ,000 times in the first day , right ?"
"It was the E@@ d@@ it@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ o@@ ice in S@@ ci@@ ence , which is a top science mag@@ az@@ ine ."
It &apos;s fore@@ ver f@@ re@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be f@@ re@@ ely acc@@ es@@ sible by this jour@@ nal .
"L@@ ast year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed paper by B@@ i@@ o@@ logy L@@ et@@ ters , and the fe@@ ed@@ back from not just scientists and teach@@ ers but the public as well ."
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton B@@ e@@ es &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
"What you guys have done is real , true and amazing ."
"C@@ ur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , inter@@ est , in@@ no@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most bas@@ ic and most important things to do science ."
Wh@@ o else can have these qu@@ ali@@ ties more than children ?
P@@ le@@ ase con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to con@@ clu@@ de with a physical met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"C@@ an I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah , come on . Yeah ye@@ ah . Okay ."
"Now , science is about taking ris@@ ks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) F@@ or me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?"
"S@@ h@@ im@@ on S@@ cho@@ c@@ ken : Right , but I like myself ."
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . Right . Okay .
"Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , right ?"
"You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ app@@ ing . All right ?"
"( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) ( C@@ l@@ app@@ ing ) Okay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ ou@@ ts . One , two , three ?"
"A@@ u@@ dience : ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) B@@ r@@ illi@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time ."
E@@ very@@ one over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ h@@ ou@@ ts ) Wh@@ ere &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
"@@ Right ? We norm@@ ally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty . When he open@@ ed his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way ."
"That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the possi@@ bility to step on un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty through the process of play , right ?"
"Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a vo@@ ice and en@@ ab@@ ling to ex@@ press that vo@@ ice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last vo@@ ice in this sh@@ ort story ."
"So , A@@ my ?"
"A@@ O : This project was really exc@@ iting for me , because it brought the process of disco@@ very to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the pot@@ ential to disco@@ ver something new , and that a small question can le@@ ad into a big disco@@ very ."
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thin@@ ks about something can be easy or hard . It all dep@@ ends on the way the person fe@@ els about change .
"But changing the way I thought about science was surpri@@ sing@@ ly easy . O@@ n@@ ce we play@@ ed the g@@ ames and then started to think about the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a bor@@ ing sub@@ ject , and that anyone can disco@@ ver something new ."
"You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of B@@ ea@@ u , and the B@@ l@@ ack@@ aw@@ ton B@@ e@@ e P@@ ro@@ ject ."
Thank y@@ ou@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the bi@@ ggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ viron@@ m@@ ent@@ al@@ ist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
"And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that ."
So get out your p@@ en and paper .
"B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world ."
I &apos;m just going to li@@ st some of them .
There are 8@@ 0@@ 0 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water .
T@@ w@@ o billion people without s@@ an@@ it@@ ation .
There are sever@@ al million people d@@ ying of HI@@ V and AI@@ D@@ S .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two b@@ illions of people who will be sever@@ ely aff@@ ected by climate change — so on .
"There are many , many problems out there ."
"In an ide@@ al world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t ."
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
"And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy s@@ es@@ sion — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?"
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
"If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?"
"We identi@@ fied 10 of the bi@@ ggest challeng@@ es in the world , and I will just bri@@ e@@ fly read them : climate change , communic@@ able dise@@ ases , conf@@ lic@@ ts , education , fin@@ anci@@ al inst@@ ability , govern@@ ance and cor@@ ru@@ ption , m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and h@@ un@@ ger , population m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and tra@@ de bar@@ ri@@ ers ."
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ ass the bi@@ ggest problems in the world .
"The obvi@@ ous question would be to ask , what do you think are the bi@@ ggest things ?"
Wh@@ ere should we start on sol@@ ving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ av@@ os in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
"But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to foc@@ us on problems ."
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Su@@ rely the bi@@ ggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
"But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?"
"So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solu@@ tions to problems ."
And that would be — of course that gets a little more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
T@@ o climate change that would be like K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
"T@@ o communic@@ able dise@@ ases , it might be health cl@@ in@@ ics or mos@@ qu@@ i@@ to ne@@ ts ."
"T@@ o conf@@ lic@@ ts , it would be U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s pe@@ ace@@ ke@@ ep@@ ing for@@ ces , and so on ."
"The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 secon@@ ds — and I know this is in a sense an im@@ possible t@@ ask — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
"And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where econom@@ ics gets evi@@ l — to put down what are the things we should not do , first ."
What should be at the bottom of the li@@ st ?
"P@@ le@@ ase , just take 30 secon@@ ds , perhaps talk to your neigh@@ b@@ or , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ ori@@ ties and the bottom pri@@ ori@@ ties of the solu@@ tions that we have to the world &apos;s bi@@ ggest issu@@ es ."
"The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 1@@ 8 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of my time , right ?"
"I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did ."
"And I also str@@ on@@ g@@ ly enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions af@@ ter@@ wards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?"
"O@@ f course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a li@@ st never done before ?"
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation is incredi@@ bly un@@ comfor@@ table .
No@@ body wan@@ ts to do this .
"O@@ f course , every organiz@@ ation would love to be on the top of such a li@@ st ."
But every organiz@@ ation would also h@@ ate to be not on the top of the li@@ st .
"And since there are many more n@@ ot@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one sp@@ ots on the li@@ st than there is number ones , it makes perf@@ ect sense not to want to do such a li@@ st ."
"We &apos;ve had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundam@@ ental li@@ st of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?"
"So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing — any deci@@ sion is a pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing , if only imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s un@@ likely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation , and went in and tal@@ ked about it ."
"So what I &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situ@@ ation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of cho@@ ices ."
"There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pr@@ ices , n@@ or the si@@ z@@ es ."
We have not had an idea .
"I@@ mag@@ ine going into a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant and getting this big men@@ u c@@ ard , but you have no idea what the pr@@ ice is ."
"You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ z@@ a ; you &apos;ve no idea what the pr@@ ice is ."
"It could be at one dol@@ l@@ ar ; it could be 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"It could be a fam@@ il@@ y-@@ size p@@ iz@@ z@@ a ; it could be a very individu@@ al@@ -@@ size p@@ iz@@ z@@ a , right ?"
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s is really trying to do — to try to put pr@@ ices on these issu@@ es .
"And so basically , this has been the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s &apos; process ."
"We got 30 of the world &apos;s best econom@@ ists , three in each area ."
So we have three of world &apos;s top econom@@ ists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the bene@@ fit of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se in communic@@ able dise@@ ases .
"Th@@ ree of the world &apos;s top exper@@ ts saying , what can we do ?"
What would be the pr@@ ice ?
"What should we do about it , and what will be the out@@ come ?"
And so on .
"Th@@ en we had some of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ists , eight of the world &apos;s top econom@@ ists , inclu@@ ding three No@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , me@@ et in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en in M@@ ay 200@@ 4 ."
We called them the &quot; &quot; dre@@ am team . &quot; &quot; The C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ versity pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d of econom@@ ics .
"That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here ."
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed li@@ st .
"And then you ask , why econom@@ ists ?"
"And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question ."
"The point is , of course , if you want to know about m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia , you ask a m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia exper@@ t ."
"If you want to know about climate , you ask a c@@ li@@ mat@@ o@@ log@@ ist ."
"But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do ."
That is what econom@@ ists do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
"They make that in some ways dis@@ gu@@ sting t@@ ask of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do af@@ ter@@ wards ?"
"So this is the li@@ st , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you ."
"O@@ f course , you can also see it on the we@@ b@@ site , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on ."
"They basically came up with a li@@ st where they said there were bad pro@@ jects — basically , pro@@ jects where if you inv@@ est a dol@@ l@@ ar , you get less than a dol@@ l@@ ar back ."
"Th@@ en there &apos;s fa@@ ir pro@@ jects , good pro@@ jects and very good pro@@ jects ."
"And of course , it &apos;s the very good pro@@ jects we should start doing ."
I &apos;m going to go from back@@ wards so that we end up with the best pro@@ jects .
These were the bad pro@@ jects .
A@@ s you might see the bottom of the li@@ st was climate change .
"This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t come back , either ."
"And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really cur@@ ious ."
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ ag@@ ree with on the li@@ st that you wrote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ y@@ o@@ to — or doing something more than K@@ y@@ o@@ to — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ effici@@ ent .
It &apos;s not saying that global war@@ ming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
"But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost ."
"What they basically show us , the average of all m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic mod@@ els , is that K@@ y@@ o@@ to , if everyone ag@@ re@@ ed , would cost about 1@@ 50 billion dollars a year ."
That &apos;s a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global develop@@ ment a@@ id that we give the Th@@ ird World every year .
Y@@ et it would do very little good .
All mod@@ els show it will pos@@ t@@ p@@ one war@@ ming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h who gets a f@@ loo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wa@@ it until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
"Wh@@ ich is a little good , but not very much good ."
"So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good ."
"And just to give you a sense of re@@ fer@@ ence , the U.@@ N@@ . actually es@@ tim@@ ate that for half that amount , for about 7@@ 5 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major bas@@ ic problems in the world ."
"We could give cle@@ an dr@@ in@@ king water , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation , bas@@ ic heal@@ th@@ care and education to every single human being on the planet ."
"So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend tw@@ ice the amount on doing very little good ?"
O@@ r half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
"It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it ."
"But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ ority ."
"The fa@@ ir pro@@ jects — no@@ tice I &apos;m not going to com@@ ment on all these — but communic@@ able dise@@ ases , scale of bas@@ ic health serv@@ ices — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of bas@@ ic health serv@@ ices is a great thing ."
"It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cos@@ tly ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , what it t@@ ells us is sudd@@ en@@ ly we start thinking about both si@@ des of the equ@@ ation ."
"If you look at the good pro@@ jects , a lot of s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water pro@@ jects came in ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and water is incredi@@ bly important , but it also cos@@ ts a lot of in@@ fra@@ structure ."
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ ori@@ ties which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The f@@ our@@ th best problem is m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia — de@@ al@@ ing with m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia .
The in@@ ci@@ dence of m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get inf@@ ected every year .
It might even cost up to@@ wards a per@@ cent@@ age point of G@@ D@@ P every year for aff@@ ected n@@ ations .
"If we invest@@ ed about 1@@ 3 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that in@@ ci@@ dence down to half ."
"We could av@@ o@@ id about 500@@ ,000 people d@@ ying , but perhaps more import@@ antly , we could av@@ o@@ id about a &#91; million &#93; people getting inf@@ ected every year ."
"We would sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ antly incre@@ ase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global war@@ ming ."
This third best one was free tra@@ de .
"B@@ as@@ ically , the model showed that if we could get free tra@@ de , and esp@@ eci@@ ally cut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an ast@@ oun@@ ding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 40@@ 0 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Th@@ ird World ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , the point is to say that we could actually pul@@ l two to three hund@@ red million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty , very ra@@ dic@@ ally fast , in about two to five years ."
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to foc@@ us on m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion .
"N@@ ot just m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion in gener@@ al , but there &apos;s a very ch@@ ea@@ p way of de@@ al@@ ing with m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion , na@@ me@@ ly , the l@@ ack of mic@@ r@@ on@@ u@@ tri@@ ents ."
"B@@ as@@ ically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ ac@@ king in ir@@ on , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and v@@ it@@ am@@ in A@@ ."
"If we inv@@ est about 12 billion dollars , we could make a se@@ v@@ ere in@@ ro@@ ad into that problem ."
That would be the second best invest@@ ment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to foc@@ us on HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S .
"B@@ as@@ ically , if we inv@@ est 2@@ 7 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could av@@ o@@ id 2@@ 8 new million c@@ ases of HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , what this does and what it foc@@ uses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S ."
One is tre@@ at@@ ment ; the other one is pre@@ ven@@ tion .
"And again , in an ide@@ al world , we would do both ."
"But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we inv@@ est first ."
"And tre@@ at@@ ment is much , much more exp@@ en@@ sive than pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So basically , what this foc@@ uses on is saying , we can do a lot more by invest@@ ing in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"B@@ as@@ ically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in tre@@ at@@ ment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion ."
"So again , what we foc@@ us on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than tre@@ at@@ ment , at first rate ."
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ ority li@@ st and say , did you get it right ?"
O@@ r did you get close to what we came up with here ?
"Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again ."
"I find a lot of people find it very , very un@@ likely that we should do that ."
"We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem ."
"But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems ."
There are many problems out there in the world .
"And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually foc@@ us on problems , that we foc@@ us on the right ones ."
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
"And I think , actually — Th@@ om@@ as S@@ ch@@ elling , one of the par@@ tici@@ p@@ ants in the dre@@ am team , he put it very , very well ."
"One of things that people for@@ get , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change imp@@ ac@@ ts will be , people will be much , much ric@@ her ."
E@@ ven the most p@@ es@@ sim@@ is@@ tic imp@@ act sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os of the U.@@ N@@ .
es@@ tim@@ ate that the average person in the develop@@ ing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as r@@ ich as we are today .
"M@@ uch more likely , they will be two to four times ric@@ her than we are ."
"And of course , we &apos;ll be even ric@@ her than that ."
"But the point is to say , when we talk about sa@@ ving people , or hel@@ ping people in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a po@@ or B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h@@ i ."
We &apos;re actually talking about a fa@@ ir@@ ly r@@ ich D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
"And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money hel@@ ping a little , 100 years from now , a fa@@ ir@@ ly r@@ ich D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?"
"O@@ r do we want to help real po@@ or people , right now , in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , who really need the help , and wh@@ om we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?"
"O@@ r as S@@ ch@@ elling put it , imagine if you were a r@@ ich — as you will be — a r@@ ich Chin@@ ese , a r@@ ich B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a r@@ ich Con@@ go@@ l@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 200@@ 5 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How od@@ d that they car@@ ed so much about hel@@ ping me a little bit through climate change , and car@@ ed so fa@@ ir@@ ly little about hel@@ ping my grand@@ father and my great grand@@ father , wh@@ om they could have hel@@ ped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ ori@@ ties stra@@ ight ."
E@@ ven if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cor@@ d to the typ@@ ical way we see this problem .
"O@@ f course , that &apos;s ma@@ in@@ ly because climate change has good pic@@ tures ."
"We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The D@@ ay A@@ f@@ ter T@@ om@@ or@@ row &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?"
"It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I cer@@ tain@@ ly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t exp@@ ect E@@ m@@ mer@@ ich to c@@ ast B@@ ra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movie di@@ gg@@ ing l@@ at@@ r@@ ines in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie ."
"So in many ways , I think of the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s and the whole di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of pri@@ ori@@ ties as a def@@ en@@ se for bor@@ ing problems ."
T@@ o make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
"It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good ."
"The other ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m some@@ how — or we are some@@ how — pos@@ iting a f@@ al@@ se choice ."
"O@@ f course , we should do all things , in an ide@@ al world — I would cer@@ tain@@ ly ag@@ ree ."
"I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t ."
"In 197@@ 0 , the developed world decided we were going to spend tw@@ ice as much as we did , right now , than in 197@@ 0 , on the develop@@ ing world ."
S@@ ince then our a@@ id has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the p@@ ath of sudd@@ en@@ ly sol@@ ving all big problems .
"L@@ i@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , people are also saying , but what about the I@@ ra@@ q war ?"
"You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?"
I &apos;m all for that .
"If any one of you guys can talk B@@ ush into doing that , that &apos;s f@@ ine ."
"But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?"
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ ori@@ ties .
"I should just men@@ tion bri@@ e@@ fly , is this really the right li@@ st that we got out ?"
"You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best econom@@ ists , you in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably end up asking old , white American men ."
"And they &apos;re not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world ."
So we actually inv@@ ited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
"The only two requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments were that they were stud@@ ying at the univer@@ sity , and they sp@@ o@@ ke Eng@@ lish ."
"The maj@@ ority of them were , first , from develop@@ ing countries ."
"They had all the same material but they could go v@@ ast@@ ly outside the sc@@ op@@ e of di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion , and they cer@@ tain@@ ly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts ."
And the surpri@@ sing thing was that the li@@ st was very similar — with m@@ al@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion and dise@@ ases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
"There &apos;s been many other se@@ min@@ ars and univer@@ sity students , and different things ."
They all come out with very much the same li@@ st .
"And that gi@@ ves me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a p@@ ath a@@ head to get us to start thinking about pri@@ ori@@ ties , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?"
"O@@ f course , in an ide@@ al world , again we &apos;d love to do everything ."
"But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?"
I see the C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s as a process .
"We did it in 200@@ 4 , and we hope to as@@ se@@ m@@ ble many more people , getting much better information for 200@@ 8 , 20@@ 12 ."
Ma@@ p out the right p@@ ath for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
"T@@ o start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; A@@ t the end of the day , you can dis@@ ag@@ ree with the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be hon@@ est and fr@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do ."
"If we wor@@ ry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ r@@ ying about other things ."
"So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ ori@@ ties , and think about how we better work for the world ."
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 0@@ 0 .
A cur@@ ious little inv@@ en@@ tion is being tal@@ ked about .
It &apos;s called a mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e .
What it allo@@ ws you to do is see tiny little li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms that are in@@ vi@@ sible to the na@@ ked ey@@ e .
S@@ o@@ on comes the me@@ dical disco@@ very that many of these li@@ fe@@ for@@ ms are actually ca@@ uses of terri@@ ble human dise@@ ases .
"I@@ mag@@ ine what happened to the society when they realized that an Eng@@ lish mo@@ m in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was dr@@ in@@ king a mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from L@@ on@@ don ."
F@@ ast forward 20@@ 0 years .
"We still have this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the develop@@ ing countries around the t@@ rop@@ ical bel@@ t ."
"@@ Just for m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia itself , there are a million de@@ a@@ ths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be te@@ sted because they are at risk for different species of m@@ al@@ ari@@ al inf@@ ec@@ tions ."
Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these mon@@ st@@ ers .
"You take a st@@ ain , like ac@@ ri@@ d@@ ine or@@ an@@ ge or a flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent st@@ ain or G@@ i@@ em@@ s@@ a , and a mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , and you look at them ."
They all have fac@@ es .
"Wh@@ y is that so , that A@@ le@@ x in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , F@@ a@@ tim@@ a in B@@ ang@@ l@@ ad@@ es@@ h , N@@ av@@ j@@ oot in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i , and J@@ u@@ li@@ e and M@@ ary in U@@ g@@ and@@ a still wa@@ it months to be able to di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose why they are s@@ ick ?"
And that &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ ily because sc@@ al@@ ability of the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics is completely out of re@@ ach .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e itself .
"E@@ ven though the p@@ in@@ n@@ ac@@ le of moder@@ n science , research mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es are not designed for field te@@ sting ."
N@@ either were they first designed for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics at all .
"They are he@@ av@@ y , b@@ ul@@ ky , really hard to ma@@ in@@ tain , and cost a lot of money ."
This picture is Ma@@ h@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i in the &apos; 40@@ s using the ex@@ act same se@@ tu@@ p that we actually use today for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing T@@ .@@ B@@ . in his ash@@ ra@@ m in S@@ ev@@ ag@@ ra@@ m in India .
"T@@ w@@ o of my students , J@@ i@@ m and J@@ ames , trav@@ el@@ ed around India and T@@ ha@@ il@@ and , starting to think about this problem a lot ."
We saw all kinds of d@@ on@@ ated equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
We saw fun@@ g@@ us growing on mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e l@@ en@@ ses .
And we saw people who had a func@@ tional mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
What gre@@ w out of that work and that tri@@ p was actually the idea of what we call F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e ?
"A F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e is a completely func@@ tional mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , a pl@@ at@@ form for flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence , bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field , pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation , pro@@ j@@ ection , all kinds of adv@@ anc@@ ed mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ y built pu@@ rely by fol@@ ding paper ."
"So , now you think , how is that possible ?"
"I &apos;m going to show you some exam@@ ples here , and we will run through some of them ."
It star@@ ts with a single sh@@ e@@ et of paper .
What you see here is all the possible comp@@ on@@ ents to build a func@@ tional bri@@ gh@@ t-@@ field and flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ence mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e .
"So , there are three st@@ ages : There is the op@@ tical stage , the ill@@ um@@ ination stage and the mas@@ k@@ -@@ hol@@ ding stage ."
And there are mic@@ r@@ o op@@ tics at the bottom that &apos;s actually em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the paper itself .
"What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a to@@ y , which it is , I ta@@ b it off , and I bre@@ ak it off ."
This paper has no in@@ struc@@ tions and no langu@@ ages .
"There is a co@@ de , a color co@@ de em@@ be@@ d@@ ded , that t@@ ells you exactly how to f@@ old that speci@@ fic mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e ."
"When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the func@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties of a stand@@ ard mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e , just like an X@@ Y stage , a place where a sa@@ m@@ ple sli@@ de could go , for example right here ."
"We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the stand@@ ard that &apos;s been op@@ tim@@ iz@@ ed for over the years , and many health wor@@ kers are actually used to this ."
"So this is what changes , but the stand@@ ard sta@@ ins all re@@ main the same for many different dise@@ ases ."
You po@@ p this in .
"There is an X@@ Y stage , and then there is a foc@@ using stage , which is a f@@ le@@ x@@ ure mechan@@ ism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allo@@ ws us to move and foc@@ us the l@@ en@@ ses by mic@@ r@@ on ste@@ ps ."
"So what &apos;s really interesting about this ob@@ ject , and my students h@@ ate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this any@@ way , is these are ru@@ gg@@ ed dev@@ ices ."
I can turn it on and th@@ row it on the flo@@ or and really try to st@@ om@@ p on it .
"And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble material , like paper ."
"A@@ no@@ ther fun fact is , this is what we actually s@@ end out there as a stand@@ ard di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic to@@ ol , but here in this en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e I have 30 different fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es of different con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ations all in a single fol@@ der ."
And I &apos;m going to pic@@ k one r@@ and@@ om@@ ly .
"This one , it turns out , is actually designed speci@@ f@@ ically for m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia , because it has the flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent fil@@ ters built speci@@ f@@ ically for di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia ."
So the idea of very speci@@ fic di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es comes out of this .
"So up ti@@ ll now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps ."
"So what I would like to do is , if we could di@@ m the li@@ ghts , ple@@ ase , it turns out fol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ es are also pro@@ j@@ ection mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es ."
"I have these two mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the w@@ all — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see ."
"What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion of a comp@@ ound ey@@ e , and when I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m in clos@@ er , right there , I am going through the z@@ -@@ a@@ x@@ is ."
You actually see how the l@@ en@@ ses are cut together in the cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ sec@@ tion patter@@ n .
"A@@ no@@ ther example , one of my fav@@ or@@ ite in@@ sec@@ ts , I love to h@@ ate this one , is a mos@@ qu@@ i@@ to , and you &apos;re seeing the an@@ ten@@ n@@ a of a cu@@ le@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens ."
Right there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually descri@@ bed .
So my wi@@ fe has been field te@@ sting some of our mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es by was@@ h@@ ing my c@@ lo@@ th@@ es wh@@ en@@ ever I for@@ get them in the dr@@ y@@ er .
"So it turns out they &apos;re wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this ."
This also shows you how the pro@@ j@@ ection sc@@ op@@ e works .
You get to see the be@@ am the way it &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ected and b@@ ent .
C@@ an we get the li@@ ghts back on again ?
"So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time , in terms of how much it cos@@ ts for us to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture , the bi@@ ggest idea was ro@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ ro@@ ll man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing , so we built this out of 50 c@@ ents of parts and cos@@ ts ."
"( Applause ) And what this allo@@ ws us to do is to think about a new par@@ a@@ dig@@ m in mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ y , which we call us@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ th@@ row mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ y ."
I &apos;m going to give you a qu@@ ick s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sh@@ e@@ et of paper .
This is when we were thinking about the idea .
This is an A@@ 4 sh@@ e@@ et of paper .
These are the three st@@ ages that you actually see .
"And the op@@ tical comp@@ on@@ ents , if you look at the in@@ set up on the right , we had to figure out a way to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture l@@ en@@ ses in paper itself at really high throu@@ gh@@ pu@@ ts , so it uses a process of self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and surface ten@@ sion to build ach@@ r@@ om@@ a@@ tic l@@ en@@ ses in the paper itself ."
So that &apos;s where the l@@ en@@ ses go .
There are some light sour@@ ces .
"And ess@@ entially , in the end , all the parts line up because of orig@@ am@@ i , because of the fact that orig@@ am@@ i allo@@ ws us mic@@ r@@ on@@ -@@ scale preci@@ sion of op@@ tical al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment ."
"So even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the as@@ p@@ ects of engine@@ ering that go in something like this are fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ oph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ."
"So here is another obvi@@ ous thing that we would do , t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally , if I was going to show that these mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es are ro@@ b@@ ust , is go to the third flo@@ or and dro@@ p it from the flo@@ or itself ."
"There it is , and it survi@@ ves ."
"So for us , the next step actually is really fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ing our field tri@@ als ."
We are starting at the end of the sum@@ mer .
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es .
That would be the first time where we would be doing field tri@@ als with the high@@ est den@@ sity of mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ es ever at a given place .
"We &apos;ve started coll@@ ec@@ ting data for m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia , C@@ ha@@ g@@ as disease and gi@@ ar@@ dia from patients themselves ."
And I want to leave you with this picture .
"I had not an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated this before , but a really interesting l@@ ink between hand@@ s@@ -@@ on science education and global health ."
What are the tools that we &apos;re actually provi@@ ding the kids who are going to fi@@ ght this mon@@ ster s@@ ou@@ p for tom@@ or@@ row ?
I would love for them to be able to just pr@@ int out a F@@ ol@@ d@@ sc@@ op@@ e and car@@ ry them around in their po@@ c@@ kets .
Thank you .
( Applause )
But they have the wor@@ st of all super@@ po@@ wers : in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility .
"Here in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , they coll@@ ect 9@@ 0 percent of all the wa@@ st@@ e that &apos;s actually rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"They may coll@@ ect over 30@@ 0 ki@@ lo@@ s in their b@@ ag@@ s , sh@@ op@@ ping car@@ ts , b@@ ic@@ y@@ cl@@ es and car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as ."
"But at this time , giving vo@@ ice to the cat@@ a@@ do@@ res ."
"B@@ y ad@@ ding art and hum@@ or to the c@@ ause , it became more appe@@ al@@ ing , which hel@@ ped call attention to the cat@@ a@@ do@@ res and impro@@ ve their self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m ."
"So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not stop@@ ped working since ."
"And then I realized that cat@@ a@@ do@@ res , in their in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility , are not ex@@ cl@@ us@@ ive to B@@ ra@@ z@@ il ."
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people jo@@ in the c@@ ause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ fund@@ ed ev@@ ent to help cat@@ a@@ do@@ res and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
"Th@@ en , finally , pain@@ ted by a street arti@@ st and become part of part of this huge , amazing mo@@ bi@@ le art ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion ."
"P@@ im@@ p My C@@ ar@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ ã@@ o P@@ a@@ ul@@ o , R@@ i@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ ur@@ i@@ ti@@ b@@ a ."
So now everybody can jo@@ in .
So cat@@ a@@ do@@ res are lea@@ ving in@@ vi@@ si@@ bility behind and bec@@ om@@ ing incre@@ as@@ ingly re@@ spec@@ ted and val@@ u@@ ed .
"Because of their p@@ im@@ ped car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fi@@ ght back to pre@@ ju@@ d@@ ice , incre@@ ase their in@@ come and their inter@@ action with society ."
"So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the cat@@ a@@ do@@ res and other in@@ vi@@ sible super@@ her@@ o@@ es from your city ."
"T@@ ry to see the world as one , without b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies or fron@@ ti@@ ers ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ a@@ do@@ res wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ."
"So next time you see one , recogn@@ ize them as a v@@ ital part of our society ."
"M@@ u@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , th@@ ank you ."
( Applause ) .
"A@@ b@@ out a year and a half ago , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er , who also gave a talk here at TED in 200@@ 7 on V@@ ir@@ tual Earth , brought me over to become the archit@@ ect of B@@ ing M@@ aps , which is M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ o@@ ft &apos;s on@@ l@@ ine@@ -@@ m@@ app@@ ing eff@@ ort ."
"In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way m@@ aps work on@@ line ."
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of m@@ app@@ ing and direc@@ tion site that one is used to .
"So , the first thing that you might no@@ tice about the m@@ app@@ ing site is just the flu@@ id@@ ity of the z@@ o@@ om@@ ing and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re famili@@ ar at all with S@@ e@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from ."
"M@@ app@@ ing is , of course , not just about car@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ y , it &apos;s also about imag@@ ery ."
"So , as we z@@ o@@ om@@ -@@ in be@@ y@@ ond a certain level this re@@ sol@@ ves into a kind of S@@ i@@ m C@@ it@@ y-@@ like vir@@ tual view at 4@@ 5 degre@@ es ."
"This can be vie@@ wed from any of the car@@ d@@ inal direc@@ tions to show you the 3@@ D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ades ."
"Now , we see this space , this th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al environment , as being a can@@ v@@ as on which all sor@@ ts of app@@ lic@@ ations can play out , and map &apos;s direc@@ tions are really just one of them ."
"If you c@@ lic@@ k on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve la@@ un@@ ched ."
"So , for example , a couple of days after the di@@ sa@@ ster in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , we had an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake map that showed before and after pic@@ tures from the sk@@ y ."
"This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hy@@ per@@ -@@ local b@@ lo@@ gs in real time and m@@ app@@ ing those stories , those ent@@ ri@@ es to the places that are re@@ fer@@ red to on the b@@ lo@@ gs ."
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more can@@ dy sort of stuff .
"So , we see the imag@@ ery , of course , not stop@@ ping at the sk@@ y ."
These little green bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es re@@ present phot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths that us@@ ers have made .
"I &apos;m not going to di@@ ve into them either , but phot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ ths are in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the map ."
E@@ very@@ thing that &apos;s c@@ as@@ ed in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imag@@ ery on the ground as well .
"And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ery , the first thing that you might no@@ tice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al understanding of this environment as there is of the th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al city from abo@@ ve , so if I c@@ lic@@ k on something to get a clos@@ er view of it , then , the fact that that tran@@ si@@ tion looks as it does , is a func@@ tion of all of that ge@@ ome@@ try , all of that 3@@ D understanding behind this model ."
"Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that — we &apos;ve been working on a coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation with our friends at F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ."
"This takes F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , ge@@ o@@ regi@@ st@@ ered imag@@ ery and uses phot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ -@@ like pro@@ cess@@ es to con@@ n@@ ect that imag@@ ery to our imag@@ ery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually me@@ ant to pul@@ l up , but — ( Laughter ) But no@@ tice — this is , of course , a pop@@ ular tou@@ ri@@ st site , and there are lots of phot@@ os around here , and these phot@@ os are all taken at different times ."
So this one was taken around five .
"So that &apos;s the F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ph@@ o@@ to , that &apos;s our imag@@ ery ."
"So you really see how this kind of c@@ ro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ed imag@@ ery is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating , in a very deep way , into the map itself ."
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"There are sever@@ al reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time trav@@ el ."
"And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful hi@@ stor@@ ic imag@@ ery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well ."
"But what &apos;s c@@ ool about this is that , not only is it au@@ g@@ men@@ ting this visu@@ al re@@ pres@@ en@@ tation of the world with things that are coming in from us@@ ers , but it also is the f@@ ound@@ ation for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be sho@@ wing you more of in just a moment ."
Now I just made a tran@@ si@@ tion in@@ do@@ ors . That &apos;s also interesting .
"O@@ K , no@@ tice there &apos;s now a ro@@ of abo@@ ve us ."
We &apos;re inside the P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace M@@ ar@@ k@@ et .
"And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a back@@ p@@ ack cam@@ era , so , we &apos;re now not only imag@@ ing in the street with this cam@@ era on t@@ op@@ s of cars , but we &apos;re also imag@@ ing inside ."
"And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sor@@ ts of regi@@ stra@@ tion , not only of still images , but also of video ."
"So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , tru@@ ly , very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) OK .
"( R@@ ing@@ ing ) All right , guys , are you there ?"
( No@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m h@@ it@@ ting it . I &apos;m p@@ un@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
"So , these are our friends in P@@ i@@ ke P@@ l@@ ace M@@ ar@@ k@@ et , the lab ."
( Applause ) So they &apos;re bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting this live .
"O@@ K , G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , can you p@@ an back over to the cor@@ ner market ?"
Because I want to show poin@@ ts of inter@@ est .
"@@ No , no . The other way ."
"@@ Yeah , ye@@ ah , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
"O@@ K , OK , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner , back to the cor@@ ner ."
"O@@ K , never mind ."
"What I wanted to show you was these poin@@ ts of inter@@ est over here on top of the image because what that gi@@ ves you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the sp@@ ot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in ad@@ di@@ tion to au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"What the h@@ ell are you guys — o@@ h , sor@@ ry ."
"( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing up now ."
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
"( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and th@@ ank the team ."
They &apos;ve done a f@@ ant@@ astic job of pul@@ ling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to ab@@ an@@ don them now and walk back outside .
"And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just men@@ tion that here we &apos;re using this for t@@ ele@@ pres@@ ence , but you can equ@@ ally well use this on the sp@@ ot , for au@@ g@@ men@@ ted reality ."
"When you use it on the sp@@ ot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that me@@ ta@@ data and information about the world to you ."
"So here , we &apos;re taking the ex@@ tr@@ a step of also bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting it ."
"That was being bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast , by the way , on a 4@@ G network from the market ."
"All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ o@@ ft has given in the past sever@@ al years ."
"And that &apos;s C@@ ur@@ t@@ is W@@ ong , Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ i@@ de T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e ."
"So , we &apos;re going to head over to the d@@ um@@ p@@ st@@ ers , where it &apos;s tradi@@ tional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a bre@@ ak , but also st@@ are up at the sk@@ y ."
This is the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of Wor@@ l@@ d@@ W@@ i@@ de T@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e into our m@@ aps .
"( Applause ) This is the curr@@ ent — th@@ ank you — this is the curr@@ ent time . If we sc@@ ru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sk@@ y will look at different times , and we can get all of this very de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed information about different times , different d@@ ates : Let &apos;s move the mo@@ on a little high@@ er in the sk@@ y , maybe change the d@@ ate ."
I would like to kind of z@@ oo@@ m in on the mo@@ on .
"So , this is an a@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ ically comple@@ te re@@ pres@@ en@@ tation of the sk@@ y in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated right into the Earth ."
"All right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop ."
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
"I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back ."
And let me start with this .
"This is my bas@@ el@@ ine : This is the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast with no fish , b@@ are roc@@ k and lots of sea ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
S@@ ome@@ thing like this is what I first saw when I j@@ um@@ ped in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an co@@ ast off S@@ pa@@ in .
"Now , if an ali@@ en came to ear@@ th — let &apos;s call him Jo@@ e — what would Jo@@ e see ?"
"If Jo@@ e j@@ um@@ ped in a cor@@ al ree@@ f , there are many things the ali@@ en could see ."
"@@ V@@ ery un@@ likely , Jo@@ e would j@@ um@@ p on a pri@@ st@@ ine cor@@ al ree@@ f , a vir@@ g@@ in cor@@ al ree@@ f with lots of cor@@ al , sh@@ ar@@ ks , c@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ les , man@@ ate@@ es , grou@@ per@@ s , tur@@ t@@ les , et@@ c ."
"So , probably , what Jo@@ e would see would be in this part , in the gre@@ en@@ ish part of the picture ."
"Here we have the extre@@ me with de@@ ad cor@@ als , micro@@ bi@@ al s@@ ou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish ."
"And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the ree@@ f@@ s of the world are now , with very few cor@@ als , al@@ ga@@ e over@@ growing the cor@@ als , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone ."
And this is what most mar@@ ine scientists have seen too .
This is their bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what they think is natural because we started moder@@ n science with sc@@ u@@ b@@ a di@@ ving long after we started de@@ gra@@ ding mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems .
"So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like ."
"This sea is an arch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago bel@@ on@@ ging to K@@ i@@ ri@@ b@@ at@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has sever@@ al un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited , un@@ fi@@ shed , pri@@ st@@ ine is@@ l@@ ands and a few in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited is@@ l@@ ands ."
"So let &apos;s start with the first one : Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as Is@@ land , over 5@@ ,000 people ."
"M@@ ost of the ree@@ f@@ s are de@@ ad , most of the cor@@ als are de@@ ad — over@@ gro@@ wn by al@@ ga@@ e — and most of the fish are sm@@ all@@ er than the p@@ enc@@ ils we use to coun@@ t them ."
We did 2@@ 50 hours of di@@ ving here in 200@@ 5 .
We didn &apos;t see a single sh@@ ark .
This is the place that C@@ ap@@ tain C@@ ook discovered in 17@@ 7@@ 7 and he descri@@ bed a huge ab@@ und@@ ance of sh@@ ar@@ ks b@@ iting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going ash@@ ore .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
"F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , 2@@ ,@@ 50@@ 0 people ."
The cor@@ als are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many di@@ ver@@ s would consi@@ der par@@ a@@ di@@ se .
This is where you can see most of the F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a K@@ e@@ ys N@@ ational M@@ ar@@ ine S@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
"And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine ."
"If we go back to a place like P@@ al@@ my@@ r@@ a A@@ t@@ ol@@ l , where I was with J@@ er@@ e@@ my J@@ ack@@ son a few years ago , the cor@@ als are doing better and there are sh@@ ar@@ ks ."
You can see sh@@ ar@@ ks in every single di@@ ve .
And this is something that is very un@@ us@@ ual in today &apos;s cor@@ al ree@@ f@@ s .
"But then , if we shi@@ ft the di@@ al 20@@ 0 , 50@@ 0 years back , then we get to the places where the cor@@ als are absolutely heal@@ thy and g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , form@@ ing spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular struc@@ tures , and where the pre@@ dat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sh@@ ar@@ ks per di@@ ve ."
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the bi@@ om@@ ass p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id .
"If we get all of the fish of a cor@@ al ree@@ f together and we@@ i@@ gh them , this is what we would exp@@ ect ."
"M@@ ost of the bi@@ om@@ ass is low on the food cha@@ in , the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ r@@ ot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that e@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e ."
"Th@@ en the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ ed@@ ers , these little d@@ am@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals flo@@ ating in the water ."
"And then we have a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ ass of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , and a lo@@ wer bi@@ om@@ ass of top head , or the sh@@ ar@@ ks , the large s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , the large grou@@ per@@ s ."
But this is a con@@ sequ@@ ence .
This view of the world is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having stu@@ died de@@ gra@@ ded ree@@ f@@ s .
"When we went to pri@@ st@@ ine ree@@ f@@ s , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id was in@@ ver@@ ted ."
"The top head does ac@@ coun@@ t for most of the bi@@ om@@ ass , in some places up to 8@@ 5 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ ef , which is now prot@@ ected ."
"The good news is that , in ad@@ di@@ tion to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything ."
The size of these bo@@ x@@ es is bigger .
"We have more sh@@ ar@@ ks , more bi@@ om@@ ass of s@@ n@@ ap@@ per@@ s , more bi@@ om@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like mar@@ ine go@@ ats ."
"They cle@@ an the ree@@ f ; everything that gro@@ ws enough to be seen , they e@@ at , and they keep the ree@@ f cle@@ an and allow the cor@@ als to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish ."
"N@@ ot only do these places — these anci@@ ent , pri@@ st@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important comp@@ on@@ ents of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem like the gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s ; pa@@ v@@ em@@ ents of gi@@ ant cl@@ am@@ s in the la@@ go@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per squ@@ are me@@ ter ."
"But still , now we have global war@@ ming ."
"If we don &apos;t have fi@@ sh@@ ing because these ree@@ f@@ s are prot@@ ected by la@@ w or their re@@ m@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great ."
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the cor@@ als die .
"So how are these fish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?"
"In Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , where the food we@@ b is really tri@@ m@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not reco@@ vered ."
"In F@@ an@@ ning Is@@ land , the cor@@ als are not reco@@ vered ."
But you see here a big table cor@@ al that died and coll@@ ap@@ sed .
"And the fish have gra@@ zed the al@@ ga@@ e , so the tur@@ f of al@@ ga@@ e is a little lo@@ wer ."
"Th@@ en you go to P@@ al@@ my@@ r@@ a A@@ t@@ ol@@ l that has more bi@@ om@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , and the de@@ ad cor@@ als are cle@@ an , and the cor@@ als are coming back ."
"And when you go to the pri@@ st@@ ine side , did this ever b@@ le@@ ach ?"
"These places b@@ le@@ ach@@ ed too , but they reco@@ vered fa@@ ster ."
"The more int@@ act , the more comple@@ te , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food we@@ b , the high@@ er the resi@@ li@@ ence , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to reco@@ ver from the sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term imp@@ ac@@ ts of war@@ ming ev@@ ents ."
"And that &apos;s good news , so we need to reco@@ ver that structure ."
We need to make sure that all of the piec@@ es of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem are there so the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem can ad@@ ap@@ t to the eff@@ ects of global war@@ ming .
"So if we have to re@@ set the bas@@ el@@ ine , if we have to p@@ ush the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem back to the left , how can we do it ?"
"Well , there are sever@@ al ways ."
"One very clear way is the mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas , esp@@ eci@@ ally no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that we set as@@ i@@ de to allow for the reco@@ very for mar@@ ine life ."
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
This was my bas@@ el@@ ine . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
"And at the same time I was wat@@ ching J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u &apos;s shows on T@@ V , with all this ric@@ h@@ ness and ab@@ und@@ ance and di@@ versity ."
"And I thought that this ric@@ h@@ ness bel@@ on@@ ged to t@@ rop@@ ical se@@ as , and that the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an was a nat@@ ur@@ ally po@@ or sea ."
"But , little did I know , until I j@@ um@@ ped for the first time in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
"And this is what I saw , lots of fish ."
"A@@ f@@ ter a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they e@@ at the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again ."
"So you have this little al@@ g@@ al fore@@ st , and in the size of a l@@ ap@@ top you can find more than 100 species of al@@ ga@@ e , mos@@ tly mic@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ ic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then fe@@ ed the fish , so that the system reco@@ ver@@ s ."
"And this particular place , the M@@ e@@ des Is@@ l@@ ands M@@ ar@@ ine R@@ es@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 h@@ ec@@ tar@@ es , and it br@@ ings 6 million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s to the local economy , 20 times more than fi@@ sh@@ ing , and it re@@ pres@@ ents 8@@ 8 percent of all the tou@@ ri@@ st re@@ ven@@ ue ."
So these places not only help the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem but also help the people who can bene@@ fit from the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .
So let me just give you a sum@@ mar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves do .
"These places , when we prot@@ ect them , if we comp@@ are them to un@@ prot@@ ected areas ne@@ ar@@ by , this is what happens ."
"The number of species incre@@ ases 2@@ 1 percent ; so if you have 1@@ ,000 species you would exp@@ ect 20@@ 0 more in a mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve ."
This is very sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al .
"The size of organ@@ is@@ ms incre@@ ases a third , so your fish are now this big ."
"The ab@@ und@@ ance , how many fish you have per squ@@ are me@@ ter , incre@@ ases almost 17@@ 0 percent ."
"And the bi@@ om@@ ass — this is the most spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times gre@@ ater bi@@ om@@ ass on average , just after five to seven years ."
In some places up to 10 times lar@@ ger bi@@ om@@ ass inside the re@@ ser@@ ves .
"So we have all these things inside the re@@ ser@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?"
They re@@ produce . That &apos;s population bio@@ logy 10@@ 1 .
"If you don &apos;t k@@ ill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow lar@@ ger and they re@@ produce a lot ."
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
"These are e@@ g@@ g c@@ ases la@@ id by a s@@ na@@ il off the co@@ ast of C@@ hi@@ le , and this is how many e@@ g@@ gs they l@@ ay on the bottom ."
"O@@ ut@@ side the re@@ ser@@ ve , you cannot even de@@ t@@ ect this ."
One point three million e@@ g@@ gs per squ@@ are me@@ ter inside the mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ve where these s@@ na@@ ils are very ab@@ und@@ ant .
"So these organ@@ is@@ ms re@@ produce , the little lar@@ v@@ a@@ e ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can bene@@ fit from them outside too ."
This is in the B@@ a@@ ha@@ m@@ as : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per .
"H@@ u@@ ge ab@@ und@@ ance of grou@@ per@@ s inside the re@@ ser@@ ve , and the clos@@ er you get to the re@@ ser@@ ve , the more fish you have ."
So the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
You can see where the lim@@ its of the re@@ ser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats l@@ ined up .
"So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are bene@@ f@@ its be@@ y@@ ond the b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies of these re@@ ser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the re@@ ser@@ ve is prot@@ ec@@ ting the entire ha@@ bit@@ at . It is building resi@@ li@@ ence ."
So what we have now — or a world without re@@ ser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ t where we with@@ dra@@ w all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
R@@ es@@ er@@ ves are like sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts .
"We have this princi@@ p@@ al that we don &apos;t tou@@ ch ; that produc@@ es re@@ turns , social , economic and ec@@ o@@ logical ."
"And if we think about the incre@@ ase of bi@@ om@@ ass inside the re@@ ser@@ ves , this is like comp@@ ound inter@@ est ."
"T@@ w@@ o exam@@ ples , again , of how these re@@ ser@@ ves can bene@@ fit people ."
"This is how much fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men get every@@ day in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , fi@@ sh@@ ing over a ser@@ ies of years , in a place where there is no prot@@ ection ; it &apos;s a free@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ all ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the most de@@ gra@@ ding fi@@ sh@@ ing ge@@ ar , se@@ ine ne@@ ts , were re@@ moved , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were cat@@ ching more ."
"If you fish less , you &apos;re actually cat@@ ching more ."
"But if we ad@@ d the no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ve on top of that , the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fi@@ sh@@ ing less around an area that is prot@@ ected ."
A@@ no@@ ther example : N@@ as@@ sa@@ u grou@@ per@@ s in B@@ e@@ li@@ ze in the M@@ es@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ican Re@@ ef .
"This is grou@@ per sex , and the grou@@ per@@ s ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate around the full mo@@ ons of D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a week ."
"They used to ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate up to the ten@@ s of thousands , 30@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s about this big in one h@@ ec@@ t@@ are , in one ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ation ."
"F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they c@@ au@@ ght them , and they dep@@ le@@ ted them ."
"When I went there for the first time in 200@@ 0 , there were only 3@@ ,000 grou@@ per@@ s left ."
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men were au@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ed to cat@@ ch 30 percent of the entire sp@@ aw@@ ning population every year .
"So we did a simple anal@@ ys@@ is , and it doesn &apos;t take roc@@ k@@ et science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fi@@ sh@@ ery is going to coll@@ ap@@ se very quickly ."
"And with the fi@@ sh@@ ery , the entire re@@ produc@@ tive ability of the species goes ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t ."
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
"And they would make 4@@ ,000 dollars per year , tot@@ al , for the entire fi@@ sh@@ ery , sever@@ al fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ ats ."
"Now , if you do an economic anal@@ ys@@ is and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 di@@ ver@@ s one mon@@ th per year , the re@@ ven@@ ue would be more than 20 times high@@ er and that would be sust@@ ain@@ able over time ."
So how much of this do we have ?
"We &apos;re getting clos@@ er to one percent now , th@@ an@@ ks to the prot@@ ec@@ tions of the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago , and only a fr@@ action of this is fully prot@@ ected from fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
S@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic stu@@ dies re@@ comm@@ end that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be prot@@ ected .
The es@@ tim@@ ated ran@@ ge is between 20 and 50 percent for a ser@@ ies of go@@ als of bio@@ di@@ versity and fi@@ sh@@ ery en@@ h@@ anc@@ ement and resi@@ li@@ ence .
"Now , is this possible ? Pe@@ ople would ask : How much would that cost ?"
"Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are p@@ ay@@ ing now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fi@@ sh@@ ing : 3@@ 5 billion dollars per year ."
M@@ any of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to de@@ struc@@ tive fi@@ sh@@ ing prac@@ tic@@ es .
"Well , there are a couple es@@ tim@@ ates of how much it would cost to create a network of prot@@ ected areas co@@ ver@@ ing 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fr@@ action of what we are now p@@ ay@@ ing ; the government hands out to a fi@@ sh@@ ery that is coll@@ ap@@ sing ."
Pe@@ ople are l@@ os@@ ing their j@@ ob@@ s because the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies are coll@@ ap@@ sing .
A cre@@ ation of a network of re@@ ser@@ ves would provi@@ de direc@@ t emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment for more than a million people pl@@ us all the secon@@ d@@ ary j@@ ob@@ s and all the secon@@ d@@ ary bene@@ f@@ its .
So how can we do that ?
"If it &apos;s so clear that these sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?"
And how can we re@@ ach that go@@ al ?
"Well , there are two ways of getting there ."
The tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large prot@@ ected areas like the C@@ ha@@ go@@ s Ar@@ chi@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
"The problem is that we can create these large re@@ ser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conf@@ lic@@ t , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low ."
"And a few of us , a few organiz@@ ations in this room and el@@ se@@ where are working on this ."
"But what about the rest of the co@@ ast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fi@@ sh@@ ing ?"
"Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have ten@@ s of thousands of small re@@ ser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves do , and fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men t@@ end to be really , really def@@ en@@ sive when it comes to reg@@ ul@@ ating or clos@@ ing an area , even if it &apos;s small ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , the govern@@ ance is not right because most co@@ ast@@ al comm@@ unities around the world don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ ority to mon@@ it@@ or the resources to create the re@@ ser@@ ve and en@@ force it ."
It &apos;s a top down hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical structure where people wa@@ it for government ag@@ ents to come and this is not eff@@ ective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
"Wh@@ ich takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more re@@ ser@@ ves , is that the fund@@ ing mod@@ els have been wrong ."
"N@@ G@@ O@@ s and govern@@ ments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , us@@ u@@ ally ."
"So mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation and co@@ ast@@ al prot@@ ection has become a s@@ ink for government or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic money , and this is not sust@@ ain@@ able ."
So the solu@@ tions are just fi@@ x@@ ing these three issu@@ es .
"F@@ irst , we need to devel@@ op a global a@@ war@@ en@@ ess cam@@ pa@@ ign to in@@ sp@@ ire local comm@@ unities and govern@@ ments to create no@@ -@@ take re@@ ser@@ ves that are better than what we have now ."
It &apos;s the sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ ts ver@@ su@@ s the de@@ bit ac@@ coun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
"S@@ econ@@ d , we need to re@@ design our govern@@ ance so con@@ serv@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts can be dec@@ en@@ tr@@ aliz@@ ed , so con@@ serv@@ ation eff@@ or@@ ts don &apos;t dep@@ end on work from N@@ G@@ O@@ s or from government ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and can be created by the local comm@@ unities , like it happens in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines and a few other places ."
"And third , and very important , we need to devel@@ op new business mod@@ els ."
The ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ rop@@ y s@@ ink as the only way to create re@@ ser@@ ves is not sust@@ ain@@ able .
"We really need to devel@@ op mod@@ els , business mod@@ els , where co@@ ast@@ al con@@ serv@@ ation is an invest@@ ment , because we already know that these mar@@ ine re@@ ser@@ ves provi@@ de social , ec@@ o@@ logical and economic bene@@ f@@ its ."
"And I &apos;d like to fin@@ ish with one thought , which is that no one organiz@@ ation alone is going to sa@@ ve the ocean ."
"There has been a lot of compe@@ ti@@ tion in the past , and we need to devel@@ op a new model of part@@ ner@@ ship , tru@@ ly coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative , where we are looking for comple@@ men@@ ting , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting ."
The sta@@ kes are just too high to contin@@ ue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c S@@ al@@ a : Thank you .
CA : That was a ma@@ st@@ er@@ ful job of pul@@ ling things together .
"F@@ irst of all , your p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id , your in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id , sho@@ wing 8@@ 5 percent bi@@ om@@ ass in the pre@@ dat@@ ors , that seems im@@ possible ."
How could 8@@ 5 percent survi@@ ve on 15 percent ?
"E@@ S : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ear@@ s of a watch , a big one and a small one ."
"The big one is moving very s@@ low@@ ly , and the small one is moving fast ."
That &apos;s basically it .
"The animals at the lo@@ wer parts of the food cha@@ in , they re@@ produce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of e@@ g@@ gs ."
"@@ U@@ p there , you have sh@@ ar@@ ks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years ."
"They re@@ produce very s@@ low@@ ly ; they have a s@@ low met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m ; and , basically , they just ma@@ in@@ tain their bi@@ om@@ ass ."
"So , basically , the produc@@ tion sur@@ pl@@ us of these guys down there is enough to ma@@ in@@ tain this bi@@ om@@ ass that is not moving ."
They are like cap@@ ac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
CA : That &apos;s very fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
"So , really , our picture of a food p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id is just — we have to change that completely ."
E@@ S : A@@ t least in the se@@ as .
"What we found in cor@@ al ree@@ f@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ y@@ ra@@ m@@ id is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the S@@ er@@ en@@ ge@@ t@@ i , with five li@@ ons per w@@ il@@ de@@ be@@ est ."
"And on land , this cannot work ."
But at least on cor@@ al ree@@ f@@ s are systems where there is a bottom comp@@ on@@ ent with structure .
We think this is univer@@ s@@ al .
But we have started stud@@ ying pri@@ st@@ ine ree@@ f@@ s only very recently .
CA : So the numbers you pres@@ ented really are ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re sp@@ ending 3@@ 5 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only cost 1@@ 6 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas that actually give new living cho@@ ices to the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men as well .
"If the world was a smar@@ ter place , we could solve this problem for ne@@ ga@@ tive 1@@ 9 billion dollars ."
We &apos;ve got 1@@ 9 billion to spend on health care or something .
E@@ S : And then we have the under@@ -@@ perform@@ ance of fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies that is 50 billion dollars .
"So again , one of the big solu@@ tions is have the World T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation shi@@ f@@ ting the sub@@ si@@ dies to sust@@ ain@@ able prac@@ tic@@ es ."
"C@@ A : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of exam@@ ples that I &apos;m hear@@ ing out there about ending this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ d@@ ness ."
So th@@ ank you for those numbers .
The last one &apos;s a personal question .
"A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oce@@ ans for a long time has just been seeing this de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting wor@@ se , de@@ pres@@ sing ."
T@@ al@@ k to me about the feeling that you must have experi@@ enc@@ ed of going to these pri@@ st@@ ine areas and seeing things coming back .
E@@ S : It is a sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual experience .
"We go there to try to understand the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems , to try to meas@@ ure or coun@@ t fish and sh@@ ar@@ ks and see how these places are different from the places we know ."
"But the best feeling is this bi@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a that E@@ .@@ O@@ . W@@ il@@ son tal@@ ks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and won@@ der in front of un@@ t@@ am@@ ed nature , of ra@@ w nature ."
"And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a lar@@ ger thing or of a lar@@ ger global ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem ."
"And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could contin@@ ue doing this job ."
It would be just too de@@ pres@@ sing .
"C@@ A : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , th@@ ank you so much for sh@@ ar@@ ing some of that sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual experience with us all . Thank you ."
E@@ S : Thank you very much .
"So it &apos;s 199@@ 5 , I &apos;m in colle@@ ge , and a friend and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de Is@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ ads through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the lon@@ gest rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ outh D@@ a@@ k@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 miles ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter I keep seeing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
My friend looks at me tot@@ ally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perf@@ ect im@@ it@@ ation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep seeing with the Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cr@@ ac@@ ks up , because she fi@@ gu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) Right , the fam@@ ous Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter for pic@@ n@@ ic area . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situ@@ ations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ r@@ is say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a str@@ an@@ ge care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ ant@@ age : no job compe@@ ti@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ o@@ id thinking about being wrong , or at least to av@@ o@@ id thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ str@@ act .
We all know everybody in this room makes m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes .
"The human species , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — o@@ kay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beli@@ e@@ f@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , sudd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ str@@ act ap@@ preci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ d@@ ow — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ et@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family v@@ ac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ote in the present ten@@ se .
"So eff@@ ec@@ tively , we all kind of w@@ ind up trav@@ eling through life , tr@@ app@@ ed in this little bu@@ b@@ ble of feeling very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our personal and prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us coll@@ ec@@ tively as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get st@@ uck inside this feeling of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to conv@@ ince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single gre@@ at@@ est mor@@ al , int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual and cre@@ ative lea@@ p you can make ."
So why do we get st@@ uck in this feeling of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tion@@ ally — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ bs down .
"E@@ m@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing . Okay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , th@@ um@@ bs down , em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing — th@@ ank you , these are great ans@@ wers , but they &apos;re ans@@ wers to a different question ."
You guys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) Re@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be dev@@ ast@@ ating , it can be re@@ v@@ el@@ at@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stu@@ p@@ id Chin@@ ese charac@@ ter m@@ ist@@ ake ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remember that L@@ o@@ ony T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a c@@ li@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a b@@ ird , he can fly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote run@@ s off the c@@ li@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s tot@@ ally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ e@@ ps run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid@@ -@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ alls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the c@@ li@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tural reason , why we get st@@ uck inside this feeling of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ."
I call this er@@ ro@@ r bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ nal c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too l@@ ate ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get st@@ uck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cul@@ tural .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
"You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your te@@ ac@@ her is h@@ anding back qu@@ i@@ z p@@ ap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not mine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper ."
"It &apos;s the d@@ um@@ b kid , the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker , the one who never does his h@@ ome@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ zy , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to suc@@ ce@@ ed in life is to never make any m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes ."
We learn these really bad l@@ ess@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , esp@@ eci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just bec@@ om@@ ing perf@@ ect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"@@ Right , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phys@@ ic@@ ist , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ phys@@ ici@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we f@@ re@@ ak out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vir@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ ed@@ ical C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing hosp@@ ital for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard — one of the best hosp@@ it@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the reco@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she wa@@ kes up , and she looks down at her@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in b@@ and@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in b@@ and@@ ages because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perform@@ ed a major oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the v@@ ice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ e@@ th Is@@ ra@@ el sp@@ o@@ ke about this in@@ ci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or whatever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply felt that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ sting too much in the feeling of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ nal sense of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ nal world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ing the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like d@@ um@@ ping 20@@ 0 million g@@ all@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global economy ."
So this is a huge prac@@ tical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beli@@ e@@ f@@ s just perf@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a ser@@ ies of un@@ fortun@@ ate as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions ."
The first thing we us@@ u@@ ally do when someone dis@@ ag@@ re@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still dis@@ ag@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ sum@@ ption , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ on@@ ic to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ ag@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a third as@@ sum@@ ption : they know the tru@@ th , and they are deli@@ ber@@ ately di@@ stor@@ ting it for their own m@@ al@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he .
This att@@ ach@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness ke@@ e@@ ps us from pre@@ ven@@ ting m@@ ist@@ a@@ kes when we absolutely need to and ca@@ uses us to tre@@ at each other terri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ aff@@ ling and most tra@@ gic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perf@@ ec@@ tly trans@@ l@@ uc@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ d@@ ow and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 20@@ 0 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his fam@@ ous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , s@@ at down and wrote &quot; &quot; F@@ all@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing def@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate or over@@ come ."
It &apos;s tot@@ ally fundam@@ ental to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other animals , we are ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ tivity and cre@@ a@@ tivity ."
"L@@ ast year , for vari@@ ous reasons , I found myself list@@ ening to a lot of ep@@ is@@ o@@ des of the P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American Li@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m list@@ ening and I &apos;m list@@ ening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ zy wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness l@@ ad@@ y .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ r@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ tion@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a sta@@ ff , we jo@@ ke that every single ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of our show has the same cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the cr@@ yp@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ r@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ s@@ al and wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience mem@@ bers , as list@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and surpri@@ se end@@ ings .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ush thought he was going to inv@@ ade I@@ ra@@ q , find a b@@ unch of we@@ ap@@ ons of m@@ ass de@@ struc@@ tion , li@@ ber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ cr@@ acy to the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast ."
And something else happened instead .
"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ u@@ bar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dic@@ t@@ ator of E@@ g@@ yp@@ t for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too s@@ ick and could p@@ ass the re@@ ig@@ ns of power onto his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your h@@ ome@@ to@@ wn and ra@@ ise a b@@ unch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was wr@@ iting an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody h@@ ates for an audience that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ es us ."
"@@ No off@@ en@@ se , but this entire con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ um@@ ent to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an entire week talking about innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ em@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents , but you know why we need all of those innov@@ ations and adv@@ anc@@ em@@ ents and impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 199@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"Wh@@ ere &apos;s my j@@ et p@@ ack , Ch@@ r@@ is ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
M@@ ay@@ be I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

N@@ os@@ air would ev@@ en@@ tually be conv@@ ic@@ ted for his invol@@ v@@ ement in the p@@ lot .
E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
"I was born in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia in 198@@ 3 to him , an E@@ g@@ yp@@ ti@@ an engine@@ er , and a lo@@ ving American mother and gra@@ de school te@@ ac@@ her , who together tried their best to create a happy chil@@ d@@ hood for me ."
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic started to change .
"My father ex@@ posed me to a side of Is@@ la@@ m that few people , inclu@@ ding the maj@@ ority of Mus@@ li@@ ms , get to see ."
"It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to inter@@ act with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , in every religi@@ on , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small per@@ cent@@ age of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beli@@ e@@ f@@ s that they feel they must use any means nec@@ ess@@ ary to make others live as they do ."
"A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he s@@ at me down and expl@@ ain@@ ed that for the past few wee@@ k@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ ot@@ ing ran@@ ge on L@@ ong Is@@ land for tar@@ get prac@@ tice ."
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
"We ar@@ ri@@ ved at C@@ al@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ ot@@ ing R@@ an@@ ge , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being wat@@ ched by the F@@ B@@ I ."
"When it was my turn to sh@@ oot , my father hel@@ ped me hold the ri@@ f@@ le to my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der and expl@@ ain@@ ed how to a@@ i@@ m at the tar@@ get about 30 y@@ ar@@ ds off ."

"My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Ar@@ ab@@ ic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke father , like son ."
"They all se@@ em@@ ed to get a really big l@@ au@@ gh out of that com@@ ment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully underst@@ ood what they thought was so fun@@ ny ."
They thought they saw in me the same de@@ struc@@ tion my father was cap@@ able of .
"Th@@ ose men would ev@@ en@@ tually be conv@@ ic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an f@@ illed with 1@@ ,@@ 50@@ 0 p@@ ounds of expl@@ os@@ i@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter &apos;s Nor@@ th T@@ o@@ wer , ca@@ using an expl@@ os@@ ion that k@@ illed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 others ."
These were the men I looked up to .
"These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle ."
"B@@ y the time I turned 1@@ 9 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my chil@@ d@@ hood didn &apos;t really provi@@ de an opportunity to make many friends ."
"E@@ ach time I would beg@@ in to feel comfor@@ table around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next to@@ wn ."
"B@@ e@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tual new face in class , I was f@@ requ@@ ently the tar@@ get of b@@ ul@@ lies ."
"I ke@@ pt my identi@@ ty a secre@@ t from my cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es to av@@ o@@ id being tar@@ ge@@ ted , but as it turns out , being the qu@@ i@@ et , ch@@ u@@ b@@ by new kid in class was more than enough am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion ."
"So for the most part , I spent my time at home read@@ ing books and wat@@ ching T@@ V or playing video g@@ ames ."
"For those reasons , my social sk@@ ills were l@@ ac@@ king , to say the least , and growing up in a bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se@@ hold , I wasn &apos;t pre@@ par@@ ed for the real world ."
"I &apos;d been rais@@ ed to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , like a person &apos;s r@@ ace or religi@@ on ."
So what open@@ ed my eyes ?
One of my first experi@@ ences that challeng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 200@@ 0 pre@@ si@@ d@@ ential elec@@ tions .
"Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the N@@ ational Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a ."
"My particular group &apos;s foc@@ us was on y@@ outh violence , and having been the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of b@@ ul@@ l@@ ying for most of my life , this was a sub@@ ject in which I felt partic@@ ularly pas@@ sion@@ ate ."
The mem@@ bers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
"One day to@@ ward the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ en@@ ded was J@@ e@@ wish ."
"Now , it had taken sever@@ al days for this de@@ ta@@ il to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ os@@ ity between the two of us ."
"I had never had a J@@ e@@ wish friend before , and fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ m@@ oun@@ table ."
"A@@ no@@ ther major tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ mer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ d@@ ens , an am@@ us@@ ement par@@ k ."
"There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sor@@ ts of fa@@ i@@ ths and cul@@ tures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundam@@ ental to the develop@@ ment of my charac@@ ter ."
"M@@ ost of my life , I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght that h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion , that all g@@ ay people were a ne@@ ga@@ tive in@@ flu@@ ence ."
"As chan@@ ce would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the g@@ ay perform@@ ers at a show there , and so@@ on found that many were the kin@@ d@@ est , least ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met ."
"B@@ e@@ ing b@@ ul@@ li@@ ed as a kid created a sense of em@@ pa@@ thy in me to@@ ward the suff@@ ering of others , and it comes very un@@ nat@@ ur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated ."
"Because of that feeling , I was able to con@@ tr@@ ast the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es I &apos;d been ta@@ u@@ ght as a child with real life experience and inter@@ action ."
"I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be g@@ ay , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with being ju@@ d@@ ged for something that &apos;s be@@ y@@ ond my control ."
"Th@@ en there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ a@@ ily S@@ how . &quot; &quot; O@@ n a ni@@ gh@@ tly bas@@ is , J@@ on S@@ te@@ war@@ t for@@ c@@ ed me to be int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tually hon@@ est with myself about my own bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry and hel@@ ped me to realize that a person &apos;s r@@ ace , religi@@ on or se@@ x@@ ual ori@@ en@@ tation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one &apos;s charac@@ ter ."
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
"In@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion can often come from an un@@ exp@@ ected place , and the fact that a J@@ e@@ wish com@@ e@@ di@@ an had done more to posi@@ tively in@@ flu@@ ence my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view than my own extre@@ m@@ ist father is not lost on me ."
"One day , I had a conversa@@ tion with my mother about how my wor@@ l@@ d@@ view was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I live ."
"She looked at me with the w@@ ear@@ y eyes of someone who had experi@@ enc@@ ed enough do@@ g@@ ma@@ tis@@ m to last a li@@ fe@@ time , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of h@@ ating people . &quot;"
"In that inst@@ ant , I realized how much ne@@ ga@@ tive energy it takes to hold that h@@ at@@ red inside of you ."
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connec@@ tion with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and pot@@ entially put myself in d@@ an@@ ger ?
"Well , that &apos;s simple ."
"I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ ell@@ ed to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that al@@ though I had been sub@@ j@@ ected to this viol@@ ent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ o@@ logy , that I did not become f@@ an@@ a@@ tici@@ zed ."
"In@@ stead , I cho@@ ose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , against the bi@@ g@@ ot@@ ry ."
"I do it for the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism and their lo@@ ved ones , for the terri@@ ble pa@@ in and l@@ oss that ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism has for@@ c@@ ed up@@ on their lives ."
"For the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that violence isn &apos;t in@@ her@@ ent in one &apos;s religi@@ on or r@@ ace , and the son does not have to fol@@ low the ways of his father ."
I am not my father .
"Th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks a lot . ( Applause )"
I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be here .
"I &apos;m hon@@ o@@ red by the inv@@ it@@ ation , and th@@ an@@ ks ."
"I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but un@@ fortun@@ ately , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t inter@@ est many other people ."
"F@@ irst off , my b@@ ad@@ ge says I &apos;m an a@@ str@@ on@@ om@@ er ."

So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
"( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 198@@ 6 and 198@@ 7 , when a computer h@@ ac@@ ker is brea@@ king into our systems over at L@@ a@@ wr@@ ence B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ ab@@ s ."

I feel that there &apos;s a mas@@ sive and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea going around that we have to bring more computers into s@@ cho@@ ols .
My idea is : no ! No !
"@@ G@@ et them out of s@@ cho@@ ols , and keep them out of s@@ cho@@ ols ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent is so obvi@@ ous to anyone who &apos;s h@@ un@@ g around a f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de cl@@ ass@@ room that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I gu@@ ess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said ."
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
"H@@ a@@ ving said that , I out@@ l@@ ined my talk about five minutes ago ."
"( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my th@@ um@@ b was the future ."
"I &apos;m sup@@ posed to talk about the future , yes ?"
"O@@ h , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , because I &apos;ve got gr@@ ay ha@@ ir , and so , it &apos;s kind of sil@@ ly for me to talk about the future ."
"In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a techno@@ log@@ ist , a scienti@@ st , a phys@@ ic@@ ist ."
No ! D@@ on &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s wr@@ iting co@@ de .
"@@ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten te@@ ac@@ her ."
They know .
"In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten te@@ ac@@ her , ask an experi@@ enc@@ ed one ."
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
"I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring ."
"C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these c@@ ool new things that are going to be there ."
"But to me , things ar@@ en &apos;t the future ."
"What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally good at t@@ ext mess@@ ag@@ ing and spend a huge amount of on@@ -@@ scre@@ en time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?"
"@@ Ch@@ an@@ ge is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in sof@@ tw@@ are ."
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
"I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?"
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
Is that vi@@ sible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is on@@ e-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
"Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les ."
"@@ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over ."
This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle .
"For those of you in the audience who know , you ro@@ ll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it ."
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bot@@ tle wh@@ ose inside is its outside .
It has z@@ er@@ o vol@@ u@@ me . And it &apos;s non@@ -@@ ori@@ ent@@ able .
It has wonderful proper@@ ties .
"If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ op@@ s and se@@ w their common e@@ dge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of gl@@ ass ."
"And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : I &apos;ve got a co@@ ld . ) H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course st@@ ands for design ."
"@@ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medi@@ um and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ t@@ les for the tra@@ de ."
"But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to show you , first time in public here ."
"This is a K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tle w@@ ine bot@@ tle , which , al@@ though in four di@@ men@@ sions it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to hold any flu@@ id at all , it &apos;s perf@@ ec@@ tly cap@@ able of doing so because our universe has only three sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al di@@ men@@ sions ."
"And because our universe is only three sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al di@@ men@@ sions , it can hold flu@@ i@@ ds ."
So it &apos;s high@@ ly — that one &apos;s the c@@ ool one .
That was a mon@@ th of my life .
"But al@@ though I would love to talk about t@@ op@@ o@@ logy with you , I &apos;m not going to ."
"( Laughter ) In@@ stead , I &apos;m going to men@@ tion my mo@@ m , who pas@@ sed away last sum@@ mer ."

"And I looked over her al@@ bu@@ m and she had coll@@ ected a picture of me , st@@ anding — well , sitting — in 19@@ 6@@ 9 , in front of a b@@ unch of di@@ als ."
"And I looked at it , and said , o@@ h my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the electr@@ on@@ ic music stu@@ di@@ o !@@ "

And it s@@ ent me back .

This guy over here of course is me .

"We &apos;re stud@@ ying phys@@ ics , I &apos;m stud@@ ying phys@@ ics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do ."

I was talking about this stuff to some s@@ cho@@ ol@@ teach@@ ers about a year ago .

P@@ ut your money where you m@@ outh is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de science four days a week .

"T@@ each a so@@ li@@ d week . Okay , I &apos;m teach@@ ing th@@ ree@@ -@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters time , but good enough ."

We &apos;re going to be doing gen@@ u@@ ine phys@@ ics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
"( H@@ igh@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched t@@ one ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the l@@ ens , and one of the things we used a l@@ ens for was to meas@@ ure the speed of light ."
"My students in E@@ l C@@ er@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very be@@ at up os@@ c@@ ill@@ os@@ cop@@ e — meas@@ u@@ red the speed of light ."
We were off by 25 percent . How many e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ d@@ ers do you know of who have meas@@ u@@ red the speed of light ?
"In ad@@ di@@ tion to that , we &apos;ve meas@@ u@@ red the speed of sound ."
I &apos;d love to meas@@ ure the speed of light here .
"I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to imp@@ ose up@@ on the po@@ wers that be , and meas@@ ure the speed of light ."
"And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !@@ "
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
"So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll meas@@ ure the speed of light !@@ "
"But mean@@ while , let &apos;s meas@@ ure the speed of sound !@@ "
"Well , the obvi@@ ous way to meas@@ ure the speed of sound is to b@@ oun@@ ce sound off something and look at the ech@@ o ."
"But , probably — one of my students , A@@ ri@@ el &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , said , &quot; C@@ ould we meas@@ ure the speed of light using the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation ? &quot;"
And all of you know the wa@@ ve equ@@ ation is the f@@ requ@@ ency times the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th of any wa@@ ve ...
"@@ is a con@@ st@@ ant . When the f@@ requ@@ ency goes up , the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th goes up , f@@ requ@@ ency goes down . So , if we have a wa@@ ve here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the p@@ it@@ ch goes up , things get clos@@ er , p@@ it@@ ch goes down , things stre@@ t@@ ch out ."
Right ? This is simple phys@@ ics .
"All of you know this from e@@ igh@@ th gra@@ de , remember ?"
"What they didn &apos;t tell you in phys@@ ics — in e@@ igh@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ de phys@@ ics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multi@@ ply the f@@ requ@@ ency times the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound or light , you get a con@@ st@@ ant ."
And that con@@ st@@ ant is the speed of sound .
"So , in order to meas@@ ure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its f@@ requ@@ ency . Well , that &apos;s easy ."
I &apos;ve got a f@@ requ@@ ency coun@@ ter right here .
"S@@ et it up to around A , abo@@ ve A , abo@@ ve A@@ . There &apos;s an A , more or less ."
"Now , so I know the f@@ requ@@ ency ."
It &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ her@@ t@@ z . I meas@@ ure its wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th .
"All I need now is to f@@ li@@ p on another be@@ am , and the bottom be@@ am is me talking , right ?"
"So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the scre@@ en ."
"I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the sour@@ ce , you &apos;ll no@@ tice the sp@@ ir@@ al ."
"The s@@ l@@ in@@ ky mo@@ ves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the wa@@ ve , coming out this way ."
"Th@@ ose of you who are phys@@ ici@@ sts , I hear you ro@@ l@@ ling your eyes , but be@@ ar with me . ( Laughter ) T@@ o meas@@ ure the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th , all I need to do is meas@@ ure the dist@@ ance from here — one full wa@@ ve — over to here ."
F@@ rom here to here is the wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th of sound .
"So , I &apos;ll put a meas@@ uring t@@ ape here , meas@@ uring t@@ ape here , move it back over to here ."
I &apos;ve moved the micro@@ phone 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters .
"@@ 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters from here , back to here , 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters ."
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go back to M@@ r@@ . E@@ l@@ m@@ o ."
"And we &apos;ll say the f@@ requ@@ ency is 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 ki@@ lo@@ her@@ t@@ z , or 17@@ 60 ."
The wa@@ v@@ el@@ eng@@ th was 0@@ .@@ 2 me@@ ters .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 6 times 0@@ .@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 5@@ 2 me@@ ters per second .
"If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 ."
"But , here with k@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ gy material , and l@@ ous@@ y dr@@ ink — we &apos;ve been able to meas@@ ure the speed of sound to — not bad . P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good ."
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
G@@ o back to this picture of me a million years ago .
"It was 197@@ 1 , the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ am W@@ ar was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m stud@@ ying phys@@ ics : L@@ and@@ a@@ u , Li@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , R@@ es@@ n@@ ick and H@@ al@@ li@@ day ."

"A few years ago , I bro@@ ke into my own house ."
"I had just dri@@ ven home , it was around mid@@ night in the de@@ ad of M@@ on@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been vi@@ sit@@ ing my friend , J@@ e@@ ff , across to@@ wn , and the ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 degre@@ es — and don &apos;t bo@@ ther asking if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or F@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two sc@@ al@@ es me@@ et — it was very co@@ ld ."

"So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and win@@ do@@ ws , and they were loc@@ ked ti@@ ght ."
"I thought about call@@ ing a loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith — at least I had my c@@ ell@@ phone , but at mid@@ night , it could take a while for a loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith to show up , and it was co@@ ld ."
"I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend J@@ e@@ ff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early f@@ light to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my pas@@ sp@@ ort and my su@@ it@@ case ."
"So , des@@ per@@ ate and free@@ zing co@@ ld , I found a large roc@@ k and I bro@@ ke through the bas@@ ement win@@ d@@ ow , c@@ lear@@ ed out the sh@@ ar@@ ds of gl@@ ass , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ board and t@@ ap@@ ed it up over the op@@ ening , fig@@ uring that in the morning , on the way to the air@@ port , I could call my con@@ trac@@ tor and ask him to fi@@ x it ."
"This was going to be exp@@ en@@ sive , but probably no more exp@@ en@@ sive than a mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith , so I fi@@ gu@@ red , under the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ances , I was coming out even ."
"Now , I &apos;m a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st by tra@@ ining and I know a little bit about how the brain per@@ for@@ ms under st@@ res@@ s ."
"It re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l that rais@@ es your heart rate , it mod@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ r@@ en@@ al@@ ine lev@@ els and it cl@@ ou@@ ds your thinking ."
"So the next morning , when I w@@ o@@ ke up on too little sle@@ ep , wor@@ r@@ ying about the h@@ ole in the win@@ d@@ ow , and a mental n@@ ote that I had to call my con@@ trac@@ tor , and the free@@ zing tem@@ per@@ at@@ ures , and the me@@ et@@ ings I had up@@ coming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l in my brain , my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cl@@ ou@@ dy because my thinking was cl@@ ou@@ dy ."
"( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the air@@ port ch@@ ec@@ k@@ -@@ in coun@@ ter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ sp@@ ort . ( Laughter )"
"So I r@@ ac@@ ed home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ sp@@ ort , r@@ ac@@ ed back to the air@@ port , I made it just in time , but they had given away my se@@ at to someone else , so I got st@@ uck in the back of the plan@@ e , next to the ba@@ th@@ ro@@ oms , in a se@@ at that wouldn &apos;t re@@ cl@@ ine , on an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our f@@ light ."
"Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sle@@ ep ."
"( Laughter ) And I started wonder@@ ing , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will pre@@ v@@ ent bad things from happening ?"
"O@@ r at least if bad things happen , will min@@ im@@ ize the like@@ li@@ hood of it being a tot@@ al cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ he ."
"So I started thinking about that , but my thou@@ ghts didn &apos;t cr@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ li@@ ze until about a mon@@ th later ."
"I was having d@@ in@@ ner with my colle@@ ag@@ ue , D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man , the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ se@@ dly told him about having bro@@ ken my win@@ d@@ ow , and , you know , for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten my pas@@ sp@@ ort , and D@@ an@@ ny sh@@ ared with me that he &apos;d been prac@@ tic@@ ing something called pr@@ osp@@ ective h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had g@@ ot@@ ten from the psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had writ@@ ten about it a few years before , also called the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m ."
"Now , you all know what the pos@@ t@@ mor@@ te@@ m is ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever there &apos;s a di@@ sa@@ ster , a team of exper@@ ts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?"
"Well , in the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ an@@ ny expl@@ ain@@ ed , you look a@@ head and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to pre@@ v@@ ent those things from happening , or to min@@ im@@ ize the d@@ ama@@ ge ."
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
"S@@ ome of them are obvi@@ ous , some of them are not so obvi@@ ous ."
I &apos;ll start with the obvi@@ ous ones .
"A@@ rou@@ nd the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are eas@@ ily lost ."
"Now , this s@@ ounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ a@@ ti@@ al mem@@ ory works ."
"There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us , that evol@@ ved over ten@@ s of thousands of years , to keep tr@@ ack of the loc@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of f@@ ru@@ it tre@@ es , where the fri@@ end@@ ly and ene@@ my tri@@ bes live ."
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us is the part of the brain that in L@@ on@@ don ta@@ x@@ ic@@ a@@ b dri@@ ver@@ s becomes en@@ lar@@ ged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allo@@ ws squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their nu@@ ts .
"And if you &apos;re wonder@@ ing , somebody actually did the experim@@ ent where they cut off the ol@@ fac@@ t@@ ory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their nu@@ ts ."
"They wer@@ en &apos;t using sm@@ ell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ p@@ us , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely evol@@ ved mechan@@ ism in the brain for fin@@ ding things ."
"But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around ."
So this is why we l@@ ose car ke@@ ys and read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses and pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a sp@@ ot for your ke@@ ys — a h@@ ook by the do@@ or , maybe a dec@@ or@@ ative bo@@ w@@ l ."
"For your pas@@ sp@@ ort , a particular dra@@ wer ."
"For your read@@ ing gl@@ as@@ ses , a particular table ."
"If you desig@@ n@@ ate a sp@@ ot and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them ."
What about trav@@ el ?
"T@@ ake a cell phone picture of your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds , your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se , your pas@@ sp@@ ort , ma@@ il it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
"If these things are lost or st@@ ol@@ en , you can fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate re@@ plac@@ ement ."
Now these are some rather obvi@@ ous things .
"@@ Re@@ member , when you &apos;re under st@@ res@@ s , the brain re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l ."
"C@@ or@@ ti@@ so@@ l is to@@ x@@ ic , and it ca@@ uses cl@@ ou@@ dy thinking ."
"So part of the prac@@ tice of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recogn@@ ize that under st@@ res@@ s you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place ."
And there &apos;s perhaps no more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful a situ@@ ation than when you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a me@@ dical deci@@ sion to make .
"And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important deci@@ sion about the future of our me@@ dical care or that of a lo@@ ved one , to help them with a deci@@ sion ."
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular me@@ dical condi@@ tion .
"But this st@@ ands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of me@@ dical deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and in@@ de@@ ed for fin@@ anci@@ al deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and social deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making — any kind of deci@@ sion you have to make that would bene@@ fit from a ra@@ tional ass@@ ess@@ ment of the fac@@ ts ."
"So sup@@ pose you go to your doc@@ tor and the doc@@ tor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;"
"Now , you all know that high cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ ol is as@@ soci@@ ated with an incre@@ as@@ ed risk of car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ c@@ ular disease , heart att@@ ack , st@@ ro@@ ke ."
"And so you &apos;re thinking having high cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ ol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doc@@ tor says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a dru@@ g that will help you lo@@ wer your cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ ol , a sta@@ ti@@ n . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve probably heard of st@@ at@@ ins , you know that they &apos;re am@@ ong the most wi@@ de@@ ly pre@@ scri@@ bed drugs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them ."
"And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! G@@ ive me the sta@@ ti@@ n . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c you should ask for that most doc@@ tors don &apos;t like talking about , and ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical companies like talking about even less ."
It &apos;s for the number needed to tre@@ at .
"Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?"
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a dru@@ g or under@@ go a sur@@ g@@ ery or any me@@ dical pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure before one person is hel@@ ped .
"And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of cra@@ zy sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c is that ?"
The number should be one .
My doc@@ tor wouldn &apos;t pre@@ scri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
"But actually , me@@ dical prac@@ tice doesn &apos;t work that way ."
"And it &apos;s not the doc@@ tor &apos;s fa@@ ult , if it &apos;s any@@ body &apos;s fa@@ ult , it &apos;s the fa@@ ult of scientists like me ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ red out the under@@ l@@ ying mechan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line es@@ tim@@ ates that 9@@ 0 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
"So the number needed to tre@@ at for the most wi@@ de@@ ly pre@@ scri@@ bed sta@@ ti@@ n , what do you sup@@ pose it is ?"
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ ped ?
30@@ 0 .
"This is ac@@ cor@@ ding to research by research prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers J@@ er@@ ome G@@ ro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ el@@ a H@@ ar@@ t@@ z@@ b@@ and , in@@ depend@@ ently con@@ fir@@ med by B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g@@ .@@ com@@ ."
I ran through the numbers myself .
"@@ 30@@ 0 people have to take the dru@@ g for a year before one heart att@@ ack , st@@ ro@@ ke or other ad@@ ver@@ se ev@@ ent is pre@@ ven@@ ted ."
"Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 30@@ 0 chan@@ ce of lo@@ wer@@ ing my cho@@ le@@ st@@ er@@ ol ."
"Wh@@ y not , do@@ c ? G@@ ive me the pre@@ scri@@ ption any@@ way . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c , and that is , &quot; &quot; T@@ ell me about the side eff@@ ects . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"So for this particular dru@@ g , the side eff@@ ects oc@@ cu@@ r in five percent of the patients ."
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be har@@ med by the dru@@ g than you are to be hel@@ ped by the dru@@ g .
"Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the sta@@ ti@@ n or not ."
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversa@@ tion with your doc@@ tor .
"M@@ ed@@ ical e@@ th@@ ics requ@@ i@@ res it , it &apos;s part of the princi@@ ple of infor@@ med con@@ s@@ ent ."
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to beg@@ in the conversa@@ tion about whether you want to take the ris@@ ks or not .
"Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pul@@ led this number out of the air for sho@@ c@@ k value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typ@@ ical , this number needed to tre@@ at ."
"For the most wi@@ de@@ ly perform@@ ed sur@@ g@@ ery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mov@@ al of the pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate for cancer , the number needed to tre@@ at is 4@@ 9 ."
"That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s hel@@ ped ."
And the side eff@@ ects in that case oc@@ cu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
"They inclu@@ de imp@@ ot@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le d@@ ys@@ func@@ tion , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ t@@ al t@@ ear@@ ing , f@@ ec@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence ."
"And if you &apos;re l@@ uc@@ ky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two ."
So the idea of the pre@@ -@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think a@@ head of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will p@@ ush the conversa@@ tion forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to man@@ u@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the sp@@ ot .
And you also want to think about things like qu@@ ality of life .
"Because you have a choice of@@ t@@ enti@@ m@@ es , do you I want a sh@@ or@@ ter life that &apos;s pain@@ -@@ free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pa@@ in to@@ wards the end ?"
"These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your lo@@ ved ones ."
"You might change your mind in the he@@ at of the moment , but at least you &apos;re prac@@ tic@@ ed with this kind of thinking ."
"@@ Re@@ member , our brain under st@@ res@@ s re@@ le@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole b@@ unch on systems sh@@ ut down ."
There &apos;s an evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary reason for this .
"F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ face with a pre@@ dat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your dig@@ es@@ tive system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your im@@ m@@ un@@ e system , because if you &apos;re body is exp@@ ending met@@ abo@@ li@@ s@@ m on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the li@@ on &apos;s l@@ unch , and then n@@ one of those things matter ."
"@@ Un@@ fortun@@ ately , one of the things that goes out the win@@ d@@ ow during those times of st@@ res@@ s is ra@@ tional , logical thinking , as D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his colle@@ ag@@ ues have sho@@ wn ."
So we need to tra@@ in ourselves to think a@@ head to these kinds of situ@@ ations .
I think the important point here is recogn@@ iz@@ ing that all of us are f@@ la@@ wed .
We all are going to fa@@ il now and then .
"The idea is to think a@@ head to what those fail@@ ures might be , to put systems in place that will help min@@ im@@ ize the d@@ ama@@ ge , or to pre@@ v@@ ent the bad things from happening in the first place ."
"@@ G@@ e@@ tting back to that s@@ no@@ w@@ y night in M@@ on@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my tri@@ p , I had my con@@ trac@@ tor inst@@ all a comb@@ ination loc@@ k next to the do@@ or , with a key to the front do@@ or in it , an easy to remember comb@@ ination ."
"And I have to ad@@ m@@ it , I still have p@@ il@@ es of ma@@ il that ha@@ ven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and p@@ il@@ es of e@@ ma@@ ils that I ha@@ ven &apos;t gone through ."
"So I &apos;m not completely organiz@@ ed , but I see organiz@@ ation as a gra@@ du@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
G@@ ood morning !
A@@ re you a@@ wa@@ ke ?
"They took my name ta@@ g , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the ta@@ g in Ar@@ ab@@ ic ?"
"A@@ n@@ y@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem ."
"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant with my friend , or@@ der@@ ing food ."
"So I looked at the wa@@ it@@ er and said , &quot; Do you have a men@@ u ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) ? &quot;"
"He looked at me str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; S@@ or@@ ry ? ( Eng@@ lish ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , ple@@ ase . &quot; &quot; He re@@ p@@ li@@ ed , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;"
"He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( Eng@@ lish ) , or &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( Fr@@ en@@ ch ) . &quot; &quot; Is the Fr@@ en@@ ch pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation cor@@ rec@@ t ?"
"&quot; &quot; C@@ ome , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ it@@ er ."
"He was dis@@ gu@@ sted when talking to me , as if he was saying to h@@ im@@ self , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;"
What &apos;s the mean@@ ing of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in Ar@@ ab@@ ic ?
T@@ w@@ o words made a Le@@ ban@@ ese young man ju@@ dge a girl as being back@@ ward and ig@@ nor@@ ant .
How could she speak that way ?
"At that moment , I started thinking ."
It made me ma@@ d .
It defin@@ it@@ ely h@@ ur@@ ts !
I &apos;m den@@ i@@ ed the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Wh@@ ere could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
"Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would re@@ ach a stage in their lives , where they invol@@ un@@ tar@@ ily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re moder@@ n and civi@@ li@@ zed ."
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get all my culture , thou@@ ghts , int@@ ell@@ ect and all my mem@@ ories ?"
Ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood stories might be the best mem@@ ories we have of the war !
"S@@ h@@ ould I for@@ get everything I learned in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , just to con@@ form ?"
T@@ o be one of them ?
Wh@@ ere &apos;s the logi@@ c in that ?
"D@@ esp@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him ."
I didn &apos;t want to ju@@ dge him with the same c@@ ru@@ el@@ ty that he ju@@ d@@ ged me .
The Ar@@ ab@@ ic language doesn &apos;t sa@@ tis@@ fy today &apos;s needs .
"It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in univer@@ si@@ ties , a language we use in the wor@@ k@@ place , a language we rely on if we were to per@@ form an adv@@ anc@@ ed research project , and it defin@@ it@@ ely isn &apos;t a language we use at the air@@ port ."
"If we did so , they &apos;d stri@@ p us of our c@@ lo@@ th@@ es ."
"Wh@@ ere can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !@@ "
"So , you want us to use Ar@@ ab@@ ic . Wh@@ ere are we to do so ?"
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ou@@ ght to think about .
Ar@@ ab@@ ic is the mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch says that ma@@ st@@ ery of other langu@@ ages de@@ man@@ ds ma@@ st@@ ery of the mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
M@@ ast@@ ery of the mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for cre@@ ative ex@@ pression in other langu@@ ages .
How ?
"@@ G@@ i@@ br@@ an K@@ hal@@ il G@@ i@@ br@@ an , when he first started wr@@ iting , he used Ar@@ ab@@ ic ."
"All his ideas , imag@@ ination and ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ y were inspi@@ red by this little bo@@ y in the v@@ ill@@ age where he gre@@ w up , sm@@ elling a speci@@ fic sm@@ ell , hear@@ ing a speci@@ fic vo@@ ice , and thinking a speci@@ fic thought ."
"So , when he started wr@@ iting in Eng@@ lish , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age ."
"E@@ ven when he wrote in Eng@@ lish , when you read his writ@@ ings in Eng@@ lish , you sm@@ ell the same sm@@ ell , sense the same feeling ."
"You can imagine that that &apos;s him wr@@ iting in Eng@@ lish , the same bo@@ y who came from the m@@ oun@@ tain . F@@ rom a v@@ ill@@ age on M@@ oun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on ."
"So , this is an example no one can ar@@ gu@@ e with ."
"S@@ econ@@ d , it &apos;s often said that if you want to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , the only way to k@@ ill a n@@ ation , is to k@@ ill its language ."
This is a reality that developed soci@@ e@@ ties are aw@@ are of .
"The G@@ er@@ m@@ ans , Fr@@ en@@ ch , J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese and Chin@@ ese , all these n@@ ations are aw@@ are of this ."
That &apos;s why they leg@@ is@@ l@@ ate to prot@@ ect their language .
They make it s@@ ac@@ red .
"That &apos;s why they use it in produc@@ tion , they pay a lot of money to devel@@ op it ."
Do we know better than them ?
"All right , we ar@@ en &apos;t from the developed world , this adv@@ anc@@ ed thinking ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t re@@ ach@@ ed us yet , and we would like to cat@@ ch up with the civi@@ li@@ zed world ."
"C@@ oun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for develop@@ ment , do research , and cat@@ ch up with those countries , such as T@@ ur@@ key , M@@ al@@ ay@@ si@@ a and others , they car@@ ried their language with them as they were clim@@ b@@ ing the l@@ ad@@ der , prot@@ ected it like a di@@ am@@ ond ."
They ke@@ pt it close to them .
"Because if you get any produc@@ t from T@@ ur@@ key or el@@ se@@ where and it &apos;s not lab@@ el@@ ed in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local produc@@ t ."
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local produc@@ t .
"They &apos;d go back to being con@@ sum@@ ers , clu@@ el@@ ess con@@ sum@@ ers , like we are most of the time ."
"So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and produce , they had to prot@@ ect their language ."
"If I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depend@@ ence ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this re@@ mind you of ?"
"It doesn &apos;t r@@ ing a b@@ ell , does it ?"
"@@ Re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the who , how and why ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for conver@@ sing , just words coming out of our m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age re@@ pres@@ ents speci@@ fic st@@ ages in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ o@@ logy that is l@@ in@@ ked to our emo@@ tions ."
"So when we say , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depend@@ ence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a speci@@ fic image in their own mind , there are speci@@ fic fe@@ el@@ ings of a speci@@ fic day in a speci@@ fic hi@@ stor@@ ical peri@@ od ."
"L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or le@@ t@@ ters put together ."
"It &apos;s an idea inside that rel@@ ates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us ."
What is our int@@ ell@@ ect ?
How do you say whether this guy underst@@ ands or not ?
"So , if I say , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , in@@ depend@@ ence ( Eng@@ lish ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you lived through the peri@@ od of the free@@ dom ( Eng@@ lish ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;"
How would you feel ?
"If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ ain ."
The idea is that these ex@@ pres@@ sions re@@ mind us of a speci@@ fic thing .
I have a fr@@ anc@@ oph@@ one friend who &apos;s mar@@ ried to a Fr@@ en@@ ch man .
I asked her once how things were going .
"She said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing is f@@ ine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to trans@@ l@@ ate the mean@@ ing of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The po@@ or woman had m@@ ist@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ ly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him ."
He was pu@@ z@@ z@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this c@@ ru@@ el ?
D@@ o@@ es she want to comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ury me ? &apos; ( Eng@@ lish ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few exam@@ ples .
"It made us feel that she &apos;s un@@ able to tell that word to her h@@ us@@ b@@ and , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different ."
"She said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ ens to F@@ air@@ u@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to trans@@ l@@ ate for him so he can feel what I feel when I list@@ en to F@@ air@@ u@@ z . &quot; &quot; The po@@ or woman tried to trans@@ l@@ ate this for him : &quot; F@@ rom them I ex@@ ten@@ ded my hands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you bel@@ ong to them , I re@@ turned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )"
T@@ r@@ ans@@ l@@ ate that for me .
"( Applause ) So , what have we done to prot@@ ect the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ?"
"We turned this into a con@@ cer@@ n of the civi@@ l society , and we la@@ un@@ ched a cam@@ pa@@ ign to pres@@ er@@ ve the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ."
"E@@ ven though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bo@@ ther ?"
F@@ or@@ get about this head@@ ac@@ he and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
"The cam@@ pa@@ ign to pres@@ er@@ ve Ar@@ ab@@ ic la@@ un@@ ched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est . &quot;"
"We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not ac@@ cept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t ad@@ op@@ t this st@@ y@@ le because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be underst@@ ood ."
"And when someone tal@@ ks to me that way , I h@@ ate the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language ."
"We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be conv@@ inc@@ ed in a way that re@@ fl@@ ects our dre@@ am@@ s , as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions and d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life ."
In a way that dre@@ s@@ ses like us and thin@@ ks like we do .
"So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the E@@ ast , but you re@@ ply from the W@@ est &quot; &quot; has h@@ it the sp@@ ot ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very easy , yet cre@@ ative and per@@ su@@ as@@ ive ."
"A@@ f@@ ter that , we la@@ un@@ ched another cam@@ pa@@ ign with sc@@ en@@ es of le@@ t@@ ters on the ground ."
"You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a sc@@ en@@ e of a le@@ tter sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by black and y@@ el@@ low t@@ ape with &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t k@@ ill your language ! &quot; &quot; writ@@ ten on it ."
"Wh@@ y ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t k@@ ill your language ."
We really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t k@@ ill our language .
"If we were to k@@ ill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identi@@ ty ."
We &apos;d have to find an exist@@ ence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is be@@ y@@ ond just mis@@ sing our chan@@ ce of being moder@@ n and civi@@ li@@ zed .
A@@ f@@ ter that we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed phot@@ os of guys and girls w@@ ear@@ ing the Ar@@ ab@@ ic le@@ tter .
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os of &quot; &quot; c@@ ool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very c@@ ool !
"And to wh@@ o@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an Eng@@ lish word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I ad@@ op@@ t the word &apos; c@@ ool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them ob@@ ject ho@@ we@@ ver they want , but give me a word that &apos;s n@@ ic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better ."
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wi@@ de we@@ b &quot; &quot; ( L@@ augh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
"But to re@@ ach this point , we all have to be conv@@ inc@@ ed that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thin@@ ks they have any au@@ th@@ ority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want ."
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity is the idea .
"So , if we can &apos;t re@@ ach space or build a roc@@ k@@ et and so on , we can be cre@@ ative ."
"At this moment , every one of you is a cre@@ ative project ."
C@@ re@@ a@@ tivity in your mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e is the p@@ ath .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a nov@@ el or produce a sh@@ ort film .
A single nov@@ el could make us global again .
It could bring the Ar@@ ab@@ ic language back to being number one .
"So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !@@ "
"But we have to know that , and be conv@@ inc@@ ed that a solution ex@@ ists , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution ."
"In con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , what can you do today ?"
"Now , tw@@ e@@ ets , who &apos;s tw@@ e@@ e@@ ting ?"
"P@@ le@@ ase , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has fin@@ i@@ shed , either Ar@@ ab@@ ic , Eng@@ lish , Fr@@ en@@ ch or Chin@@ ese ."
But don &apos;t write Ar@@ ab@@ ic with L@@ a@@ ti@@ n charac@@ ters mi@@ x@@ ed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a di@@ sa@@ ster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be en@@ ter@@ ing a vir@@ tual world with a vir@@ tual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and ri@@ se .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
"S@@ econ@@ d , there are many other things that we can do ."
We &apos;re not here today to conv@@ ince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring attention to the nec@@ ess@@ ity of pres@@ er@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a secre@@ t .
A baby first identi@@ fi@@ es its father through language .
"When my d@@ aughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your d@@ ad , hon@@ ey ( Eng@@ lish ) . &quot; &quot; And in the super@@ market , I prom@@ ise my d@@ aughter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ ks ( Ar@@ ab@@ ic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , M@@ am@@ an , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her ."
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get ri@@ d of this cul@@ tural cr@@ in@@ ge . ( Applause )
"S@@ u@@ st@@ ain@@ ability re@@ pres@@ ents the what , the where and the how of what is c@@ au@@ ght ."
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my d@@ in@@ ner cho@@ ices .
I want to know how I imp@@ act them .
I want to know how they imp@@ act me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s b@@ oun@@ ty for their living .
Un@@ der@@ st@@ anding all of this en@@ ab@@ les us to shi@@ ft our per@@ cep@@ tion of se@@ af@@ ood away from a com@@ mod@@ ity to an opportunity to re@@ st@@ ore our ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .
It allo@@ ws for us to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the se@@ af@@ ood that we &apos;re also so fortun@@ ate to e@@ at .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
"Wh@@ ere sust@@ ain@@ ability is the cap@@ ac@@ ity to end@@ ure and ma@@ in@@ tain , re@@ stor@@ ative is the ability to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish and pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood allo@@ ws for an evol@@ ving and d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ es our relation@@ ship with the ocean as a resour@@ ce , su@@ g@@ ge@@ sting that we eng@@ age to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge its resi@@ li@@ ency ."
"It is a more hop@@ e@@ ful , it is a more human , and is a more us@@ e@@ ful way of understanding our environment ."
W@@ al@@ let gu@@ id@@ es — stand@@ ard issue by lots in the mar@@ ine con@@ serv@@ ation world — are very h@@ an@@ dy ; they &apos;re a wonderful to@@ ol .
"@@ Gre@@ en , y@@ el@@ low and red li@@ sts &#91; of &#93; se@@ af@@ ood species ."
"The as@@ soci@@ ation is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think tw@@ ice about y@@ el@@ low ."
"But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just e@@ at green li@@ st ."
We can &apos;t sust@@ ain this without the meas@@ ure of our suc@@ cess really changing the f@@ ate of the species in the y@@ el@@ low and the red .
But what if we e@@ at only in the green li@@ st ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le@@ -@@ c@@ au@@ ght y@@ el@@ low@@ f@@ in tun@@ a here — comes from sust@@ ain@@ able st@@ oc@@ ks .
P@@ ole c@@ au@@ ght — no b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch .
Gre@@ at for fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . S@@ up@@ por@@ ting local econom@@ ies .
But it &apos;s a li@@ on of the sea . It &apos;s a top pre@@ dat@@ or .
What &apos;s the cont@@ ext of this me@@ al ?
A@@ m I sitting down in a ste@@ a@@ k@@ house to a 16@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
"I might still be in the green li@@ st , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oce@@ ans any fav@@ ors ."
"The point is that we have to have a cont@@ ext , a g@@ au@@ ge for our ac@@ tions in all this ."
E@@ x@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red w@@ ine is great for my health — anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ants and min@@ er@@ als — heart heal@@ thy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red w@@ ine !
I &apos;m going to dr@@ ink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so heal@@ thy .
"Well , how many bot@@ t@@ les is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?"
"Well fol@@ ks , we have a prot@@ e@@ in problem ."
"We have lost this sen@@ si@@ bility when it reg@@ ar@@ ds our food , and we are p@@ ay@@ ing a cost ."
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost bene@@ ath the wa@@ ves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social ac@@ cep@@ t@@ ance of exp@@ anding wa@@ ist@@ l@@ ines .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster prof@@ its .
So the first thing about this idea of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood is that it really takes into ac@@ coun@@ t our needs .
"@@ R@@ est@@ or@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood might best be re@@ pres@@ ented not by J@@ a@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ p@@ per , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Gre@@ en G@@ i@@ ant ."
V@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les : they might yet sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a li@@ kes to say that blue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to re@@ spec@@ t@@ fully sub@@ m@@ it that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blue .
"We must contin@@ ue to e@@ at the best se@@ af@@ ood possible , if at all ."
But we also must e@@ at it with a ton of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
The best part about re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood though is that it comes on the hal@@ f-@@ sh@@ ell with a bot@@ tle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ c@@ o and le@@ m@@ on we@@ d@@ g@@ es .
"It comes in a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia b@@ read@@ ed with D@@ i@@ j@@ on mu@@ star@@ d and cri@@ sp@@ y , bro@@ il@@ ed b@@ read@@ cr@@ um@@ bs and a ste@@ am@@ ing pi@@ le of p@@ ec@@ an qu@@ in@@ o@@ a p@@ il@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ illed bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so so@@ ft and s@@ we@@ et and char@@ red and s@@ mo@@ ky on the outside with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i f@@ la@@ ke ."
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an easy s@@ ell .
And the best part is all of those in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are avail@@ able to every family at the neigh@@ bor@@ hood W@@ al@@ mar@@ t .
J@@ am@@ i@@ e O@@ li@@ ver is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve America from the way we e@@ at .
S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a is cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ning to sa@@ ve the oce@@ ans from the way we e@@ at .
There &apos;s a patter@@ n here .
F@@ or@@ get nuclear ho@@ loc@@ a@@ ust ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to wor@@ ry about .
We have ra@@ v@@ ag@@ ed our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sour@@ c@@ ed to hand@@ ic@@ a@@ p ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole e@@ ating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we exp@@ ect from our food .
Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability is comp@@ lic@@ ated but d@@ in@@ ner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
D@@ an B@@ ar@@ ber and A@@ li@@ ce W@@ at@@ ers are lead@@ ing pas@@ sion@@ ately the green food D@@ e@@ li@@ ci@@ ous R@@ evolution .
But green f@@ oo@@ ds often re@@ present a way for us to dis@@ reg@@ ard the respon@@ si@@ bility as e@@ at@@ ers .
Just because it comes from a green sour@@ ce doesn &apos;t mean we can tre@@ at it with dis@@ reg@@ ard on the pl@@ ate .
We have ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o-@@ fri@@ end@@ ly all@@ -@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ e@@ at sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p bu@@ ff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ heal@@ thy d@@ in@@ ner is a very important part of re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood .
"Wh@@ ile we try to man@@ age dec@@ l@@ ining mar@@ ine pop@@ ul@@ ations , the media &apos;s re@@ comm@@ ending incre@@ as@@ ed con@@ sum@@ ption of se@@ af@@ ood ."
"S@@ tu@@ dies say that ten@@ s of thousands of American grand@@ mo@@ thers , grand@@ fa@@ thers , mo@@ thers and fa@@ thers might be around for another bir@@ th@@ day if we inclu@@ ded more se@@ af@@ ood ."
That &apos;s a re@@ ward I am not w@@ illing to p@@ ass up .
But it &apos;s not all about the se@@ af@@ ood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
"As a che@@ f , I realize the eas@@ i@@ est thing for me to do is re@@ duce the por@@ tion si@@ z@@ es on my pl@@ ate ."
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
"P@@ e@@ ople started bu@@ ying appe@@ tiz@@ ers and s@@ al@@ ads , because they knew they wer@@ en &apos;t going to f@@ ill up on the ent@@ re@@ es alone ."
"P@@ e@@ ople spent more time eng@@ ag@@ ing in their me@@ als , eng@@ ag@@ ing with each other over their me@@ als ."
"P@@ e@@ ople got , in sh@@ ort , more of what they came there for even though they got less prot@@ e@@ in ."
They got more cal@@ ories over the course of a di@@ ver@@ si@@ fied me@@ al .
They got heal@@ th@@ i@@ er . I made more money .
This is great .
"E@@ n@@ viron@@ mental consi@@ der@@ ation was ser@@ ved with every pl@@ ate , but it was ser@@ ved with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consi@@ der@@ ation for human interest@@ s at the same time ."
"One of the other things we did was beg@@ in to di@@ ver@@ si@@ fy the species that we ser@@ ved — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ d@@ ines were un@@ common ."
"S@@ h@@ ell@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , o@@ y@@ st@@ ers , cl@@ am@@ s , ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia , cha@@ r — these were the common species ."
"We were direc@@ ting ta@@ st@@ es to@@ wards more resi@@ li@@ ence , more re@@ stor@@ ative op@@ tions ."
This is what we need to fav@@ or .
This is what the green li@@ st says .
But this is also how we can actually beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore our environment .
"But what of those big pre@@ dat@@ ors , those fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able species , that green li@@ st tun@@ a that I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er ?"
"Well , if you must , I have a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for you ."
"It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go ."
St@@ art with a 16@@ -@@ oun@@ ce por@@ tion of big fish .
G@@ et a k@@ ni@@ fe . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
"M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and then open up the very best bot@@ tle of B@@ ur@@ g@@ und@@ y you have , light the c@@ and@@ les and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate it ."
C@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the opportunity you have to e@@ at this .
"In@@ v@@ ite your friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors over and re@@ pe@@ at once a year , maybe ."
I exp@@ ect a lot from food .
I exp@@ ect health and jo@@ y and family and community .
"I exp@@ ect that produc@@ ing in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents , pre@@ par@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es and e@@ ating me@@ als is all part of the comm@@ uni@@ on of human interest@@ s ."
I was l@@ uc@@ ky enough that my father was a f@@ ant@@ astic c@@ ook .
And he ta@@ u@@ ght me very early on about the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ge that e@@ ating re@@ pres@@ ents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my chil@@ d@@ hood .
"They were reas@@ on@@ able por@@ tions of prot@@ e@@ in ser@@ ved with cop@@ ious qu@@ anti@@ ties of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les and small amoun@@ ts of star@@ ch , us@@ u@@ ally r@@ ice ."
This is still how I lar@@ ge@@ ly e@@ at today .
I get s@@ ick when I go to ste@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
I get the me@@ at s@@ we@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a h@@ an@@ go@@ ver from prot@@ e@@ in .
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
"But of all the di@@ re news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oce@@ ans , I have the un@@ fortun@@ ate bur@@ den of deli@@ ver@@ ing to you possi@@ bly the very wor@@ st of it and that is this whole time your mother was right ."
E@@ at your ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
It &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a me@@ al ?
"Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents that are good for my body ."
"For jo@@ y , I &apos;m looking for bu@@ tter and s@@ al@@ t and se@@ x@@ y things that make things ta@@ st@@ e less like pen@@ ance ."
"For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ ci@@ p@@ es that gen@@ u@@ fl@@ ect to my own personal hi@@ stories ."
"For community though , we start at the very beginning ."
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we e@@ at has a global imp@@ act .
So try and learn as best you can what that imp@@ act is and then take the first step to min@@ im@@ ize it .
"We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world b@@ ank ."
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ y of the comm@@ uni@@ on we call d@@ in@@ ner .
"So if we all take only what we need , then we can beg@@ in to share the rest , we can beg@@ in to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate , we can beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore ."
We need to sa@@ v@@ or ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
We need to sa@@ v@@ or sm@@ all@@ er por@@ tions of se@@ af@@ ood .
And we need to sa@@ ve d@@ in@@ ner .
Thank you .
( Applause )
H@@ i . I am an archit@@ ect .
"I am the only archit@@ ect in the world making buil@@ d@@ ings out of paper like this car@@ d@@ board tu@@ be , and this ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion is the first one I did using paper tu@@ bes ."
"@@ 198@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ec@@ o@@ logical issu@@ es and environ@@ mental issu@@ es , I just started te@@ sting the paper tu@@ be in order to use this as a building structure ."
"It &apos;s very comp@@ lic@@ ated to test the new material for the building , but this is much str@@ on@@ ger than I exp@@ ected , and also it &apos;s very easy to wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of , and also , because it &apos;s indu@@ stri@@ al material , it &apos;s also possible to fi@@ re@@ pro@@ of ."
"Th@@ en I built the tem@@ por@@ ary structure , 199@@ 0 ."
This is the first tem@@ por@@ ary building made out of paper .
"There are 3@@ 30 tu@@ bes , di@@ a@@ me@@ ter 5@@ 5 &#91; c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters &#93; , there are only 12 tu@@ bes with a di@@ a@@ me@@ ter of 1@@ 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters , or four feet , wi@@ de ."
"As you see it in the ph@@ o@@ to , inside is the to@@ il@@ et ."
"In case you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed with to@@ il@@ et paper , you can te@@ ar off the inside of the w@@ all . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very us@@ e@@ ful ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar 200@@ 0 , there was a big exp@@ o in G@@ er@@ many ."
"I was asked to design the building , because the the@@ me of the exp@@ o was environ@@ mental issu@@ es ."
"So I was ch@@ os@@ en to build the pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on out of paper tu@@ bes , rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able paper ."
My go@@ al of the design is not when it &apos;s comple@@ ted .
"My go@@ al was when the building was demo@@ li@@ shed , because each country makes a lot of pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons but after half a year , we create a lot of indu@@ stri@@ al wa@@ st@@ e , so my building has to be re@@ used or rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
"A@@ f@@ ter , the building was rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed ."
So that was the go@@ al of my design .
Th@@ en I was very l@@ uc@@ ky to w@@ in the compe@@ ti@@ tion to build the second P@@ om@@ p@@ id@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in Fr@@ ance in the city of M@@ et@@ z .
"Because I was so po@@ or , I wanted to r@@ ent an off@@ ice in P@@ ar@@ is , but I couldn &apos;t aff@@ ord it , so I decided to bring my students to P@@ ar@@ is to build our off@@ ice on top of the P@@ om@@ p@@ id@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ ar@@ is by ourselves ."
So we brought the paper tu@@ bes and the w@@ oo@@ den jo@@ in@@ ts to comple@@ te the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long off@@ ice .
We st@@ ay@@ ed there for six years without p@@ ay@@ ing any r@@ ent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
"Because we were part of the ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a tic@@ k@@ et to see me ."
That was the problem .
Th@@ en I comple@@ ted the P@@ om@@ p@@ id@@ ou C@@ en@@ ter in M@@ et@@ z .
"It &apos;s a very pop@@ ular mus@@ e@@ um now , and I created a big mon@@ um@@ ent for the government ."
"But then I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted at my prof@@ es@@ sion as an archit@@ ect , because we are not hel@@ ping , we are not working for society , but we are working for priv@@ il@@ e@@ ged people , r@@ ich people , government , develop@@ ers ."
They have money and power .
Th@@ ose are in@@ vi@@ sible .
So they h@@ ire us to visu@@ aliz@@ e their power and money by making mon@@ um@@ ental archit@@ ec@@ ture .
"That is our prof@@ es@@ sion , even hi@@ stor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same ."
"So I was very dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their h@@ ous@@ es by natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers ."
But I must say they are no longer natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"For example , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes never k@@ ill people , but coll@@ ap@@ se of the buil@@ d@@ ings k@@ ill people ."
That &apos;s the respon@@ si@@ bility of archit@@ ects .
"Th@@ en people need some tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , but there are no archit@@ ects working there because we are too bus@@ y working for priv@@ il@@ e@@ ged people ."
"So I thought , even as archit@@ ects , we can be involved in the re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing ."
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in di@@ sa@@ ster areas .
"@@ 199@@ 4 , there was a big di@@ sa@@ ster in R@@ w@@ and@@ a , Africa ."
"T@@ w@@ o tri@@ bes , H@@ ut@@ u and T@@ ut@@ s@@ i , f@@ ou@@ ght each other ."
O@@ ver two million people became re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
"But I was so surpri@@ sed to see the sh@@ el@@ ter , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p organiz@@ ed by the U.@@ N@@ ."
"They &apos;re so po@@ or , and they are free@@ zing with bl@@ an@@ kets during the ra@@ in@@ y se@@ as@@ on , In the sh@@ el@@ ters built by the U.@@ N@@ . , they were just provi@@ ding a pl@@ astic sh@@ e@@ et , and the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es had to cut the tre@@ es , and just like this ."
But over two million people cut tre@@ es .
"It just became big , he@@ av@@ y de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation and an environ@@ mental problem ."
"That is why they started provi@@ ding al@@ um@@ in@@ um pi@@ p@@ es , al@@ um@@ in@@ um bar@@ r@@ ac@@ ks ."
"@@ V@@ ery exp@@ en@@ sive , they th@@ row them out for money , then c@@ utting tre@@ es again ."
"So I pro@@ posed my idea to impro@@ ve the situ@@ ation using these rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ed paper tu@@ bes because this is so ch@@ ea@@ p and also so str@@ ong , but my bu@@ d@@ get is only 50 U.S. dollars per un@@ it ."
"We built 50 un@@ its to do that as a mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing test for the d@@ ur@@ ability and mo@@ ist@@ ure and ter@@ m@@ it@@ es , so on ."
"And then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 199@@ 5 , in K@@ o@@ be , J@@ ap@@ an , we had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were k@@ illed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ at@@ a di@@ str@@ ic@@ t , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fir@@ e after the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
And also I found out there &apos;s many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es suff@@ ering and ga@@ ther@@ ing at a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c ch@@ ur@@ ch — all the building was tot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
"So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ est@@ s , &quot; Why don &apos;t we re@@ build the ch@@ ur@@ ch out of paper tu@@ bes ? &quot;"
"And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you cra@@ zy ?"
"A@@ f@@ ter a fir@@ e , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ sted me , but I didn &apos;t give up ."
"I started comm@@ u@@ ting to K@@ o@@ be , and I met the society of V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people ."
They were living like this with very po@@ or pl@@ astic sh@@ e@@ ets in the par@@ k .
So I pro@@ posed to re@@ build . I rais@@ ed — did fund@@ rais@@ ing .
"I made a paper tu@@ be sh@@ el@@ ter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demo@@ lish , I used be@@ er cr@@ ates as a f@@ ound@@ ation ."
"I asked the K@@ ir@@ in be@@ er company to pro@@ pose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ h@@ i be@@ er company made their pl@@ astic be@@ er cr@@ ates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tu@@ bes ."
The color co@@ ordin@@ ation is very important .
"And also I still remember , we were exp@@ ec@@ ting to have a be@@ er inside the pl@@ astic be@@ er cr@@ ate , but it came emp@@ ty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting ."
"So during the sum@@ mer with my students , we built over 50 un@@ its of the sh@@ el@@ ters ."
"F@@ in@@ ally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ sted me to re@@ build ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you coll@@ ect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"It was me@@ ant to st@@ ay there for three years , but actually it st@@ ay@@ ed there 10 years because people lo@@ ved it ."
"Th@@ en , in T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an , they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and we pro@@ posed to d@@ on@@ ate this ch@@ ur@@ ch , so we dis@@ man@@ t@@ led them , we s@@ ent them over to be built by vol@@ un@@ te@@ er people ."
It st@@ ay@@ ed there in T@@ a@@ i@@ w@@ an as a per@@ man@@ ent ch@@ ur@@ ch even now .
So this building became a per@@ man@@ ent building .
"Th@@ en I won@@ der , what is a per@@ man@@ ent and what is a tem@@ por@@ ary building ?"
E@@ ven a building made in paper can be per@@ man@@ ent as long as people love it .
E@@ ven a con@@ cre@@ te building can be very tem@@ por@@ ary if that is made to make money .
"In 199@@ 9 , in T@@ ur@@ key , the big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , I went there to use the local material to build a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"@@ 200@@ 1 , in W@@ est India , I built also a sh@@ el@@ ter ."
"In 200@@ 4 , in S@@ r@@ i L@@ an@@ k@@ a , after the S@@ um@@ at@@ r@@ a ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , I re@@ built Is@@ l@@ am@@ ic fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men &apos;s v@@ ill@@ ages ."
"And in 200@@ 8 , in Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u , S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an area in China , ne@@ arly 7@@ 0@@ ,000 people were k@@ illed , and also esp@@ eci@@ ally many of the s@@ cho@@ ols were de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed because of the cor@@ ru@@ ption between the au@@ th@@ ority and the con@@ trac@@ tor ."
I was asked to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I brought my J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students to work with the Chin@@ ese students .
"In one mon@@ th , we comple@@ ted n@@ ine cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ oms , over 50@@ 0 squ@@ are me@@ ters ."
"It &apos;s still used , even after the curr@@ ent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in China ."
"In 200@@ 9 , in I@@ tal@@ y , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake ."
"And this is a very interesting ph@@ o@@ to : form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er form@@ er P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er M@@ r@@ . A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er ever year ."
"And they are very kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my model ."
"I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tem@@ por@@ ary music h@@ all , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ il@@ a is very fam@@ ous for music and all the con@@ cer@@ t h@@ alls were de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , so mus@@ ici@@ ans were moving out ."
"So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or , I &apos;d like to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; A@@ s long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very l@@ uc@@ ky ."
"M@@ r@@ . B@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i brought G@@ 8 sum@@ m@@ it , and our form@@ er pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er came , so they hel@@ ped us to coll@@ ect money , and I got half a million e@@ u@@ ro@@ s from the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese government to re@@ build this tem@@ por@@ ary au@@ d@@ it@@ ori@@ um ."
"@@ Y@@ e@@ ar 20@@ 10 in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , there was a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but it &apos;s im@@ possible to fly over , so I went to S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go , nex@@ t-@@ do@@ or country , to dri@@ ve six hours to get to H@@ a@@ it@@ i with the local students in S@@ an@@ to D@@ om@@ in@@ go to build 50 un@@ its of sh@@ el@@ ter out of local paper tu@@ bes ."
"This is what happened in J@@ ap@@ an two years ago , in nor@@ ther@@ n J@@ ap@@ an ."
"A@@ f@@ ter the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake and t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , people had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated in a big room like a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ as@@ i@@ um ."
But look at this . There &apos;s no priv@@ acy .
Pe@@ ople suff@@ er m@@ ent@@ ally and phys@@ ically .
"So we went there to build par@@ ti@@ tions with all the stud@@ ent vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers with paper tu@@ bes , just a very simple sh@@ el@@ ter out of the tu@@ be fra@@ me and the cur@@ tain ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , some of the fac@@ ility au@@ th@@ ority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them ."
But it &apos;s really nec@@ ess@@ ary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough fl@@ at area to build stand@@ ard government sing@@ le@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing like this one .
"L@@ ook at this . E@@ ven civi@@ l government is doing such po@@ or con@@ struc@@ tion of the tem@@ por@@ ary h@@ ous@@ ing , so den@@ se and so mess@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is lea@@ king , so I thought , we have to make multi@@ -@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfor@@ table ."
So I pro@@ posed to the may@@ or while I was making par@@ ti@@ tions .
F@@ in@@ ally I met a very nice may@@ or in O@@ n@@ ag@@ aw@@ a v@@ ill@@ age in M@@ i@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build th@@ ree@@ -@@ story h@@ ous@@ ing on bas@@ e@@ ball &#91; fiel@@ ds &#93; .
"I used the shi@@ p@@ ping con@@ tain@@ er and also the students hel@@ ped us to make all the building fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure to make them comfor@@ table , within the bu@@ d@@ get of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfor@@ table ."
M@@ any of the people want to st@@ ay here fore@@ ver .
I was very happy to hear that .
"Now I am working in New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch ."
"A@@ b@@ out 20 days before the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake happened , also they had a big ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , and many J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese students were also k@@ illed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al of the city , the sym@@ bo@@ l of Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch , was tot@@ ally de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed ."
And I was asked to come to re@@ build the tem@@ por@@ ary ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
So this is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ um@@ ents that are bel@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .

What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
"If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , inclu@@ ding psy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts , would have said that this baby was ir@@ ra@@ tional , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ri@@ c — that he couldn &apos;t take the per@@ spec@@ tive of another person or understand c@@ ause and effect ."
"In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture ."
"So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most br@@ illi@@ ant scientists ."
Let me give you just one example of this .
"One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , one of the things that &apos;s har@@ d@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling ."
And maybe the har@@ d@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
An@@ y@@ one who &apos;s follo@@ wed poli@@ tics can t@@ es@@ ti@@ fy to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if bab@@ ies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
"B@@ ab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-@@ old to tell you what he thin@@ ks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stre@@ am of consci@@ ous@@ ness mon@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ e about p@@ on@@ ies and bir@@ th@@ days and things like that ."
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secre@@ t was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
"What we did — B@@ et@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the bab@@ ies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of deli@@ ci@@ ous go@@ l@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ac@@ kers ."
"Now all of the bab@@ ies , even in B@@ er@@ k@@ le@@ y , like the cr@@ ac@@ kers and don &apos;t like the ra@@ w bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
( Laughter ) But then what B@@ et@@ ty did was to take a little ta@@ st@@ e of food from each bo@@ w@@ l .
And she would act as if she li@@ ked it or she didn &apos;t .
"So half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ac@@ kers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a baby and any other s@@ an@@ e person ."
"But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"I ta@@ sted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ac@@ kers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck , cr@@ ac@@ kers ."
"I ta@@ sted the cr@@ ac@@ kers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the op@@ pos@@ ite of what the bab@@ ies wanted ."
We did this with 15 and 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies .
"And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; C@@ an you give me some ? &quot;"
"So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they li@@ ked or what she li@@ ked ?"
"And the re@@ mark@@ able thing was that 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies , just bar@@ ely wal@@ king and talking , would give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers if she li@@ ked the cr@@ ac@@ kers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ."
"O@@ n the other hand , 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she ac@@ ted as if she li@@ ked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out ."
"But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers , what they thought everybody must like ."
So there are two really re@@ mark@@ able things about this .
"The first one is that these little 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies have already discovered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing ."
"And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted ."
"E@@ ven more re@@ mark@@ ably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds didn &apos;t do this su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that these 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ -@@ ol@@ ds had learned this deep , pro@@ found fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old ."
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of stu@@ dies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a sh@@ ort time ?
"I mean , after all , if you look at bab@@ ies su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally , they see@@ m pretty us@@ el@@ ess ."
"And actually in many ways , they &apos;re wor@@ se than us@@ el@@ ess , because we have to put so much time and energy into just ke@@ ep@@ ing them ali@@ ve ."
"But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ el@@ ess bab@@ ies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer ."
"If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mat@@ es , but also inclu@@ ding other ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , bir@@ ds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ ang@@ ar@@ oo@@ s and wom@@ b@@ ats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relation@@ ship between how long a chil@@ d@@ hood a species has and how big their bra@@ ins are com@@ par@@ ed to their bo@@ dies and how smar@@ t and f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble they are ."
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ bir@@ ds for this idea are the bir@@ ds up there .
O@@ n one side is a New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian c@@ row .
"And c@@ ro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ d@@ a@@ e , ra@@ ven@@ s , ro@@ o@@ ks and so for@@ th , are incredi@@ bly smar@@ t bir@@ ds ."
They &apos;re as smar@@ t as ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es in some re@@ spec@@ ts .
And this is a b@@ ird on the co@@ ver of science who &apos;s learned how to use a to@@ ol to get food .
"O@@ n the other hand , we have our friend the dom@@ es@@ tic ch@@ ic@@ ken ."
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ ke@@ ys are basically as d@@ um@@ b as d@@ um@@ ps .
"So they &apos;re very , very good at p@@ ec@@ king for gra@@ in , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else ."
"Well it turns out that the bab@@ ies , the New C@@ al@@ ed@@ on@@ ian c@@ row bab@@ ies , are f@@ le@@ d@@ gl@@ ings ."
"They dep@@ end on their mom@@ s to dro@@ p wor@@ ms in their little open m@@ ou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a b@@ ird ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually mat@@ ure within a couple of months .
So chil@@ d@@ hood is the reason why the c@@ ro@@ ws end up on the co@@ ver of S@@ ci@@ ence and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the s@@ ou@@ p po@@ t .
There &apos;s something about that long chil@@ d@@ hood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of ex@@ plan@@ ation could we have for this ?
"Well some animals , like the ch@@ ic@@ ken , see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well ."
So they see@@ m to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to p@@ ec@@ king gra@@ in in one environment .
"O@@ ther cre@@ at@@ ures , like the c@@ ro@@ ws , ar@@ en &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extre@@ me@@ ly good at learning about la@@ ws of different environ@@ ments ."
"And of course , we human be@@ ings are way out on the end of the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion like the c@@ ro@@ ws ."
We have bigger bra@@ ins rela@@ tive to our bo@@ dies by far than any other animal .
"We &apos;re smar@@ ter , we &apos;re more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , we can learn more , we survi@@ ve in more different environ@@ ments , we m@@ ig@@ r@@ ated to co@@ ver the world and even go to ou@@ ter space ."
And our bab@@ ies and children are depend@@ ent on us for much longer than the bab@@ ies of any other species .
My son is 2@@ 3 .
"( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 2@@ 3 , we &apos;re still pop@@ ping those wor@@ ms into those little open m@@ ou@@ ths ."
"All right , why would we see this cor@@ rel@@ ation ?"
"Well an idea is that that str@@ ate@@ gy , that learning str@@ ate@@ gy , is an extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , great str@@ ate@@ gy for getting on in the world , but it has one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age ."
"And that one big di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess ."
"So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ st@@ o@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A s@@ l@@ ing@@ sho@@ t or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Wh@@ ich would actually be better ? &quot;"
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ od@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evol@@ u@@ tions seems to have sol@@ ved that problem is with a kind of divi@@ sion of lab@@ or .
So the idea is that we have this early peri@@ od when we &apos;re completely prot@@ ected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
"And then as ad@@ ults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were bab@@ ies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world ."
So one way of thinking about it is that bab@@ ies and young children are like the research and develop@@ ment divi@@ sion of the human species .
"So they &apos;re the prot@@ ected blue sk@@ y guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re produc@@ tion and mar@@ ke@@ ting ."
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
"A@@ no@@ ther way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of bab@@ ies and children as being like def@@ ective grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars and bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies — ex@@ cept that they &apos;re actually the br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the gar@@ den and expl@@ or@@ ing , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our n@@ ar@@ row , grow@@ n@@ up , ad@@ ult p@@ ath ."
"If this is true , if these bab@@ ies are designed to learn — and this evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might exp@@ ect that they would have really powerful learning mechan@@ is@@ ms ."
"And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet ."
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revol@@ ution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
"And it all dep@@ ends on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Th@@ om@@ as B@@ ay@@ es , who was a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and mathema@@ tici@@ an in the 18@@ th century ."
"And ess@@ entially what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provi@@ de a mathema@@ tical way using prob@@ ability theory to charac@@ ter@@ ize , descri@@ be , the way that scientists find out about the world ."
So what scientists do is they have a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis .
Th@@ en they test that new hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis and so on and so for@@ th .
And what B@@ ay@@ es showed was a mathema@@ tical way that you could do that .
And that mathema@@ tics is at the c@@ ore of the best machine learning progra@@ ms that we have now .
"And some 10 years ago , I su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted that bab@@ ies might be doing the same thing ."
"So if you want to know what &apos;s going on under@@ ne@@ ath those beautiful bro@@ wn eyes , I think it actually looks something like this ."
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s n@@ ot@@ e@@ book .
So I think those bab@@ ies are actually making comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations with condi@@ tional prob@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties that they &apos;re re@@ vi@@ sing to figure out how the world works .
"All right , now that might see@@ m like an even t@@ all@@ er order to actually de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate ."
"Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about sta@@ tis@@ tics , they look extre@@ me@@ ly stu@@ p@@ id ."
How could it be that children are doing sta@@ tis@@ tics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ tor .
This is a box that li@@ ghts up and pl@@ ays music when you put some things on it and not others .
"And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done do@@ z@@ ens of stu@@ dies sho@@ wing just how good bab@@ ies are at learning about the world ."
"L@@ et me men@@ tion just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ma@@ r K@@ ush@@ ner , my stud@@ ent ."
"If I showed you this de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , you would be likely to think to beg@@ in with that the way to make the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor go would be to put a b@@ loc@@ k on top of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor ."
"But actually , this de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor works in a bit of a str@@ an@@ ge way ."
"Because if you wa@@ ve a b@@ loc@@ k over the top of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to beg@@ in with , the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor will actually ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of three times ."
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as , if you do the likely thing , put the b@@ loc@@ k on the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor , it will only ac@@ tiv@@ ate two out of six times ."
So the un@@ likely hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis actually has str@@ on@@ ger evidence .
It looks as if the wa@@ ving is a more eff@@ ective str@@ ate@@ gy than the other str@@ ate@@ gy .
"So we did just this ; we gave four year-@@ ol@@ ds this patter@@ n of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go ."
"And sure enough , the four year-@@ ol@@ ds used the evidence to wa@@ ve the ob@@ ject on top of the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor ."
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
"The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds ."
They &apos;re just learning how to coun@@ t .
"But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite comp@@ lic@@ ated cal@@ cul@@ ations that will give them a condi@@ tional prob@@ ability meas@@ ure ."
"And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis about the world , that seems very un@@ likely to beg@@ in with ."
"And in stu@@ dies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar stu@@ dies , we &apos;ve show that four year-@@ ol@@ ds are actually better at fin@@ ding out an un@@ likely hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis than ad@@ ults are when we give them exactly the same t@@ ask ."
"So in these cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ances , the children are using sta@@ tis@@ tics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experim@@ ents , and we wanted to see if children are doing experim@@ ents ."
When children do experim@@ ents we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a b@@ unch of interesting stu@@ dies recently that have sho@@ wn this playing around is really a kind of experim@@ ental research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s lab .
What C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine did was use our B@@ lic@@ k@@ et D@@ et@@ ec@@ tors .
"And what she did was show children that y@@ el@@ low ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y ."
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little bo@@ y will go through five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in the space of two minutes .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) B@@ o@@ y : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
"A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis has just been f@@ al@@ si@@ fied ."
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : This one li@@ gh@@ ted up , and this one nothing ."
"A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ental n@@ ot@@ e@@ book out ."
B@@ o@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : E@@ very scienti@@ st will recogn@@ ize that ex@@ pression of des@@ pa@@ ir .
"( Laughter ) B@@ o@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this ."
"A@@ G : Okay , hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis two ."
B@@ o@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
"He told the experim@@ en@@ ter to do this , to try p@@ utting it out onto the other loc@@ ation ."
N@@ ot working either .
"B@@ o@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here ."
"O@@ h , the bottom of this box has electr@@ ic@@ ity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electr@@ ic@@ ity ."
"A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a f@@ our@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ."
B@@ o@@ y : It &apos;s li@@ gh@@ ting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
"A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fi@@ f@@ th hy@@ po@@ the@@ sis ."
"Now that is a partic@@ ularly — that is a partic@@ ularly ad@@ or@@ able and ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate little bo@@ y , but what C@@ ri@@ st@@ ine discovered is this is actually quite typ@@ ical ."
"If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a ser@@ ies of experim@@ ents ."
This is actually pretty typ@@ ical of four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
"Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of cre@@ ature ?"
What &apos;s it like to be one of these br@@ illi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who can test five hy@@ po@@ the@@ ses in two minutes ?
"Well , if you go back to those psy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts and ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that bab@@ ies and young children were bar@@ ely consci@@ ous if they were consci@@ ous at all ."
And I think just the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
I think bab@@ ies and children are actually more consci@@ ous than we are as ad@@ ults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how ad@@ ult consci@@ ous@@ ness works .
And ad@@ ults &apos; attention and consci@@ ous@@ ness look kind of like a sp@@ ot@@ light .
"So what happens for ad@@ ults is we deci@@ de that something &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant or important , we should pay attention to it ."
"O@@ ur consci@@ ous@@ ness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to becomes extre@@ me@@ ly b@@ right and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes d@@ ark ."
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
"So what happens when we pay attention is that the pre@@ fron@@ t@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , the sort of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive part of our bra@@ ins , sen@@ ds a sig@@ nal that makes a little part of our brain much more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , more pl@@ astic , better at learning , and sh@@ u@@ ts down ac@@ tivity in all the rest of our bra@@ ins ."
"So we have a very foc@@ used , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ dri@@ ven kind of attention ."
"If we look at bab@@ ies and young children , we see something very different ."
I think bab@@ ies and young children see@@ m to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consci@@ ous@@ ness than a sp@@ ot@@ light of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
So bab@@ ies and young children are very bad at n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sour@@ ces at once .
"And if you actually look in their bra@@ ins , you see that they &apos;re f@@ loo@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ters that are really good at in@@ duc@@ ing learning and pl@@ as@@ tic@@ ity , and the in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory parts ha@@ ven &apos;t come on yet ."
"So when we say that bab@@ ies and young children are bad at p@@ ay@@ ing attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not p@@ ay@@ ing attention ."
So they &apos;re bad at getting ri@@ d of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
"That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consci@@ ous@@ ness , that we might exp@@ ect from those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies who are designed to learn ."
"Well if we want to think about a way of getting a ta@@ st@@ e of that kind of baby consci@@ ous@@ ness as ad@@ ults , I think the best thing is think about c@@ ases where we &apos;re put in a new situ@@ ation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we f@@ all in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time ."
"And what happens then is not that our consci@@ ous@@ ness con@@ trac@@ ts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three days in P@@ ar@@ is see@@ m to be more full of consci@@ ous@@ ness and experience than all the months of being a wal@@ king , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing@@ -@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bi@@ e back home ."
"And by the way , that co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , that wonderful co@@ ff@@ e@@ e you &apos;ve been dr@@ in@@ king do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s , actually m@@ im@@ ics the effect of those baby neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ m@@ it@@ ters ."
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in P@@ ar@@ is for the first time after you &apos;ve had three dou@@ b@@ le@@ -@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s a f@@ ant@@ astic way to be , but it does t@@ end to leave you wa@@ king up cr@@ ying at three o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k in the morning . ( Laughter )"
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful bab@@ ies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like ti@@ e our sho@@ el@@ ac@@ es and cr@@ oss the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of eff@@ ort into making bab@@ ies think like ad@@ ults do .
"But if what we want is to be like those bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ lies , to have open@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , open learning , imag@@ ination , cre@@ a@@ tivity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the ad@@ ults to start thinking more like children ."

I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner .
And this is the name of my cam@@ pa@@ ign : S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign .
"In No@@ v@@ em@@ ber of 200@@ 3 , I was inv@@ ited to take part in the la@@ unch of N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 F@@ ound@@ ation — that is his HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S f@@ ound@@ ation ."
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 is the number that M@@ and@@ el@@ a had when he was im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en Is@@ land .
"And that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ stage , having the time of my life ."
"The next day , all the arti@@ sts were inv@@ ited to jo@@ in M@@ and@@ el@@ a in R@@ ob@@ b@@ en Is@@ land , where he was going to give a con@@ fer@@ ence to the world &apos;s press , st@@ anding in front of his form@@ er pri@@ son cell ."
You can see the b@@ ars of the win@@ d@@ ow there .
It was quite a mom@@ ent@@ ous oc@@ c@@ as@@ ion for all of us .
"In that moment in time , M@@ and@@ el@@ a told the world &apos;s press that there was a vir@@ tual gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de taking place in his country ; that pos@@ t-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id R@@ ain@@ b@@ ow N@@ ation , a thous@@ and people were d@@ ying on a d@@ a@@ ily bas@@ is and that the front line v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of all , were women and children ."
"This was a huge imp@@ act on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I ha@@ dn &apos;t realized that the HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S pan@@ dem@@ ic was direc@@ tly aff@@ ec@@ ting women in such a way ."
"And so I comm@@ it@@ ted — when I left S@@ outh Africa , when I left C@@ ap@@ e@@ to@@ wn , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about ."
"I have to ser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , inter@@ vie@@ ws , talking and using my pl@@ at@@ form as a mus@@ ici@@ an , with my comm@@ it@@ ment to M@@ and@@ el@@ a — out of resp@@ ect for the tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous , un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able work that he had done ."
"E@@ very@@ one in the world re@@ spec@@ ts N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a , everyone re@@ ver@@ es N@@ el@@ son M@@ and@@ el@@ a ."
"But do they all know about what has been taking place in S@@ outh Africa , his country , the country that had one of the high@@ est in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us ?"
"I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be sho@@ c@@ ked ."
"I was very , very fortun@@ ate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ac@@ ki@@ e A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign , an incredible cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ner and ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st ."
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 6@@ 4 ev@@ ent .
He was w@@ ear@@ ing a t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t like the one I we@@ ar now .
"This is a to@@ ol — this t@@ ells you I am in so@@ li@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with people who have HI@@ V , people who are living with HI@@ V ."
"And in a way because of the sti@@ g@@ ma , by w@@ ear@@ ing this t-@@ sh@@ ir@@ t I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue ."
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clos@@ et . &quot; &quot; I became a member of T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign and I &apos;m very p@@ rou@@ d to be a member of that incredible organiz@@ ation .
"It &apos;s a gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots cam@@ pa@@ ign with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of wh@@ om are HI@@ V@@ -@@ posi@@ tive ."
They work in the field .
They have tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living direc@@ tly with the eff@@ ects of the vir@@ us .
They have education progra@@ ms .
They bring out the issu@@ es of sti@@ g@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extra@@ ordinary what they do .
"And yes , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign has sup@@ por@@ ted T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign in the way that I have tried to ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess and to try to also ra@@ ise fun@@ ds ."
"A lot of the fund@@ ing that I have manag@@ ed to ra@@ ise has gone direc@@ tly to T@@ re@@ at@@ ment A@@ c@@ tion C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign and the incredible work that they do , and are still contin@@ u@@ ing to do in S@@ outh Africa ."
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G C@@ am@@ pa@@ ign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
I &apos;ve trav@@ el@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
"Here I am in O@@ s@@ l@@ o in Nor@@ way , getting a nice , f@@ at ch@@ ec@@ k ; sing@@ ing in H@@ ong K@@ ong , trying to get people to ra@@ ise money ."
"In Jo@@ h@@ an@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g , I had the opportunity to play to a ma@@ in@@ ly white , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ class S@@ outh Afr@@ ican audience who en@@ ded up in t@@ ear@@ s because I use film c@@ li@@ ps that really tou@@ ch the heart , the whole nature , of this terri@@ ble tra@@ ge@@ dy that is taking place , that people are ten@@ ding to av@@ o@@ id , because they are fa@@ ti@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solu@@ tions are ."
"A@@ ar@@ on M@@ ot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the curr@@ ent health min@@ ist@@ er , atten@@ ded that con@@ cer@@ t and I had an opportunity to me@@ et with him , and he gave his ab@@ sol@@ ute comm@@ it@@ ment to try to making a change , which is absolutely nec@@ ess@@ ary ."
This is in the S@@ c@@ ot@@ tis@@ h P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for S@@ c@@ ot@@ land and HI@@ V .
"And I was sho@@ wing them my experi@@ ences and trying to , again , ra@@ ise a@@ war@@ en@@ ess ."
"And once again , in E@@ d@@ in@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful Afr@@ ican Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Ch@@ o@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore ."
"And it &apos;s children like this , many of wh@@ om have been or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being aff@@ ected by the AI@@ D@@ S vir@@ us ."
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with M@@ ic@@ he@@ l S@@ i@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the direc@@ tor of U@@ NA@@ I@@ D@@ S .
"And I &apos;m very hon@@ o@@ red by the fact that M@@ ic@@ he@@ l inv@@ ited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ NA@@ I@@ D@@ S am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening my pl@@ at@@ form and bro@@ ad@@ ening my ou@@ tre@@ ach ."
The message that U@@ NA@@ I@@ D@@ S are curr@@ ently sen@@ ding out to the world is that we would like to see the vir@@ tual e@@ li@@ min@@ ation of the trans@@ mis@@ sion of the vir@@ us from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
It &apos;s a very am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous go@@ al but we believe it can be achi@@ ev@@ ed with political will .
This can happen .
"And here I am with a pre@@ gn@@ ant woman , who is HI@@ V posi@@ tive and we &apos;re sm@@ il@@ ing , both of us are sm@@ il@@ ing , because we &apos;re very con@@ fi@@ dent , because we know that that young woman is re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving tre@@ at@@ ment so her life can be ex@@ ten@@ ded to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give bir@@ th to ."
"And her baby will re@@ ce@@ ive P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the vir@@ us ."
Now that is pre@@ ven@@ tion at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at inter@@ ven@@ tion with the AI@@ D@@ S pan@@ dem@@ ic .
"Now , I just would like to fin@@ ish off to tell you the little story about A@@ ve@@ li@@ le ."
This is A@@ ve@@ li@@ le — she goes with me wh@@ er@@ ever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she re@@ pres@@ ents one of millions of HI@@ V / AI@@ D@@ S or@@ ph@@ ans .
A@@ ve@@ li@@ le &apos;s mother had HI@@ V vir@@ us — she died from AI@@ D@@ S@@ -@@ rel@@ ated ill@@ ness .
"A@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the vir@@ us , she was born with the vir@@ us ."
"And here she is at seven years old , we@@ igh@@ ing no more than a one year-@@ old baby ."
"At this point in her life , she &apos;s suff@@ ering with ful@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ lo@@ wn AI@@ D@@ S and had p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia ."
We met her in a hosp@@ ital in the E@@ ast@@ er@@ n C@@ ape and spent a whole af@@ ter@@ no@@ on with her — an ad@@ or@@ able child .
The doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses were ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
They put her on very special nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous di@@ et and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hosp@@ ital — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survi@@ ve .
"So , it was obvi@@ ously — it was a very emo@@ tional en@@ coun@@ ter and left us feeling very res@@ on@@ ant with this direc@@ t experience , this one child , you know , that story ."
"F@@ ive months later , we went back to S@@ outh Africa to me@@ et A@@ ve@@ li@@ le again ."
And I &apos;m getting — the ha@@ ir@@ s on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the ha@@ ir@@ s on my ar@@ ms .
They &apos;re st@@ anding up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the trans@@ for@@ mation that took place .
Is@@ n &apos;t it extra@@ ordinary ?
( Applause ) That rou@@ nd of ap@@ plause is actually for the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses of the hosp@@ ital who took care of A@@ ve@@ li@@ le .
And I take it that you ap@@ preci@@ ate that kind of trans@@ for@@ mation .
"So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nu@@ tri@@ tion and good me@@ dical care , and you believe that the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment G@@ o@@ als , speci@@ f@@ ically five and six , should be absolutely comm@@ it@@ ted to by all govern@@ ments around the world — esp@@ eci@@ ally in sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa — could you ple@@ ase stand up ."
"I think that &apos;s fa@@ ir to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the h@@ all ."
Thank you very much .

"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty years ago in the old S@@ o@@ vi@@ et Uni@@ on , a team of engine@@ ers was secre@@ tly moving a large ob@@ ject through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
"W@@ ith it , they were hop@@ ing to cap@@ ture the min@@ ds of people every@@ where by being the first to con@@ qu@@ er ou@@ ter space ."
The roc@@ k@@ et was huge .
And p@@ ac@@ ked in its n@@ ose was a sil@@ ver ball with two radi@@ os inside .
"O@@ n O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 4 , 19@@ 5@@ 7 , they la@@ un@@ ched their roc@@ k@@ et ."
One of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k .
"In the ol@@ den days , expl@@ or@@ ers like V@@ as@@ c@@ o d@@ a G@@ am@@ a and C@@ ol@@ um@@ b@@ us had the good fortun@@ e to open up the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al g@@ lo@@ be ."
Now we have the good fortun@@ e to open up space .
"And it is for those in the future to en@@ v@@ y us our jo@@ y . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wat@@ ching s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fi@@ f@@ th doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fe@@ ature , which is just about comple@@ ted ."
"It t@@ ells the story of S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a result ."
"For days after the la@@ unch , S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity ."
"A man@@ -@@ made mo@@ on vi@@ sible by ordinary ci@@ tiz@@ ens , it inspi@@ red a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally la@@ un@@ ched an ob@@ ject into space ."
"But just three days later , on a day they called R@@ ed M@@ on@@ day , the media and the poli@@ tici@@ ans told us , and we beli@@ ev@@ ed , that S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k was pro@@ of that our ene@@ my had be@@ at@@ en us in science and technology , and that they could now att@@ ack us with hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en b@@ om@@ bs , using their S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k roc@@ k@@ et as an I@@ B@@ M mis@@ si@@ le ."
All h@@ ell bro@@ ke lo@@ ose .
S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great sho@@ c@@ ks to h@@ it America — hi@@ stor@@ i@@ ans say the equ@@ al of P@@ ear@@ l H@@ ar@@ b@@ or or 9 / 11 .
It pro@@ vo@@ ked the mis@@ si@@ le ga@@ p .
It exp@@ lo@@ ded an ar@@ ms r@@ ace .
It began the space r@@ ace .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in a year , Con@@ gre@@ ss fund@@ ed huge we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases , and we went from 1@@ ,@@ 20@@ 0 nuclear we@@ ap@@ ons to 20@@ ,000 ."
And the re@@ ac@@ tions to S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k went far be@@ y@@ ond we@@ ap@@ ons incre@@ ases .
"For example , some here will remember this day , J@@ un@@ e 19@@ 5@@ 8 , the N@@ ational C@@ i@@ vi@@ l D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ se D@@ r@@ ill , where ten@@ s of millions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went under@@ ground ."
"O@@ r the G@@ all@@ up P@@ ol@@ l that showed that seven in 10 Amer@@ ic@@ ans beli@@ ev@@ ed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be k@@ illed ."
But S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k pro@@ vo@@ ked wonderful changes as well .
"For example , some in this room went to school on sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k ."
"S@@ up@@ port for engine@@ ering , mat@@ h and science — education in gener@@ al — bo@@ om@@ ed ."
"And V@@ int C@@ er@@ f poin@@ ts out that S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k led direc@@ tly to A@@ R@@ P@@ A , and the Internet , and , of course , NA@@ S@@ A ."
My fe@@ ature doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary shows how a free society can be st@@ am@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
"But it also shows how we can turn what appe@@ ars at first to be a bad situ@@ ation , into something that was over@@ all very good for America ."
&quot; &quot; S@@ p@@ ut@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will so@@ on be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"In clos@@ ing , I would like to take a moment to th@@ ank one of my invest@@ ors : lon@@ g@@ time TED@@ ster , J@@ ay W@@ al@@ ker ."
And I &apos;d like to th@@ ank you all .

"@@ G@@ lob@@ ally , 1@@ .@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1@@ .@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in U@@ g@@ and@@ a re@@ pres@@ ents the tradi@@ tional appro@@ ach to these problems that has been prac@@ tic@@ ed since 19@@ 4@@ 4 , when win@@ ners of World W@@ ar I@@ I , 50@@ 0 f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ oun@@ ding mother , ga@@ ther@@ ed in New H@@ am@@ p@@ sh@@ ire , U@@ S@@ A , to est@@ ab@@ lish the B@@ re@@ t@@ ton W@@ oo@@ ds institu@@ tions , inclu@@ ding the World B@@ ank ."
"And that tradi@@ tional appro@@ ach to develop@@ ment had three key el@@ em@@ ents . F@@ irst , trans@@ f@@ er of resources from r@@ ich countries in the Nor@@ th to po@@ ore@@ r countries in the S@@ outh , ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by re@@ form pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions ."
"And third , the eng@@ ag@@ ement in develop@@ ing countries was with a n@@ ar@@ row set of government el@@ it@@ es with little inter@@ action with the ci@@ tiz@@ ens , who are the ul@@ tim@@ ate bene@@ f@@ ici@@ ar@@ ies of develop@@ ment as@@ si@@ st@@ ance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , each of these el@@ em@@ ents is op@@ ening up du@@ e to dra@@ ma@@ tic changes in the global environment ."
"O@@ p@@ en knowledge , open a@@ id , open govern@@ ance , and together , they re@@ present three key shi@@ f@@ ts that are trans@@ form@@ ing develop@@ ment and that also hold gre@@ ater hope for the problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
The first key shi@@ ft is open knowledge .
"You know , develop@@ ing countries today will not simply ac@@ cept solu@@ tions that are h@@ an@@ ded down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World B@@ ank ."
"They get their inspi@@ ra@@ tion , their hope , their prac@@ tical know@@ -@@ how , from success@@ ful emer@@ ging econom@@ ies in the S@@ outh ."
"They want to know how China li@@ f@@ ted 50@@ 0 million people out of po@@ ver@@ ty in 30 years , how M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ port@@ un@@ id@@ ades program impro@@ ved s@@ cho@@ ol@@ ing and nu@@ tri@@ tion for millions of children ."
"This is the new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of open@@ -@@ knowledge flo@@ ws , not just trav@@ eling Nor@@ th to S@@ outh , but S@@ outh to S@@ outh , and even S@@ outh to Nor@@ th , with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o &apos;s O@@ port@@ un@@ id@@ ades today in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing New York C@@ ity ."
"And just as these Nor@@ th@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ S@@ outh trans@@ f@@ ers are op@@ ening up , so too are the develop@@ ment institu@@ tions that chan@@ n@@ el@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers ."
This is the second shi@@ ft : open a@@ id .
"@@ R@@ ec@@ ently , the World B@@ ank open@@ ed its v@@ a@@ ult of data for public use , re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 8@@ ,000 economic and social in@@ dic@@ ators for 20@@ 0 countries over 50 years , and it la@@ un@@ ched a global compe@@ ti@@ tion to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d@@ sour@@ ce innov@@ ative app@@ s using this data ."
D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ment institu@@ tions today are also op@@ ening for public sc@@ ru@@ tiny the pro@@ jects they fin@@ ance .
"T@@ ake G@@ e@@ o@@ M@@ app@@ ing . In this map from K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the red d@@ ots show where all the s@@ cho@@ ols fin@@ anc@@ ed by d@@ on@@ ors are loc@@ ated , and the d@@ ar@@ ker the sha@@ de of green , the more the number of out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children ."
"So this simple m@@ ash@@ up re@@ ve@@ als that d@@ on@@ ors have not fin@@ anc@@ ed any s@@ cho@@ ols in the areas with the most out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ vo@@ king new questions . Is develop@@ ment as@@ si@@ st@@ ance tar@@ ge@@ ting those who most need our help ?"
This is a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous lea@@ p forward in transp@@ ar@@ ency and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability of a@@ id .
"And this lea@@ ds me to the third , and in my view , the most sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant shi@@ ft in develop@@ ment : open govern@@ ance . G@@ o@@ vern@@ ments today are op@@ ening up just as ci@@ tiz@@ ens are de@@ man@@ ding vo@@ ice and ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
"F@@ rom the A@@ ra@@ b S@@ pr@@ ing to the An@@ n@@ a H@@ az@@ are movement in India , using mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and social media not just for political ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability but also for develop@@ ment ac@@ coun@@ t@@ ability ."
A@@ re govern@@ ments deli@@ ver@@ ing serv@@ ices to the ci@@ tiz@@ ens ?
"So for inst@@ ance , sever@@ al govern@@ ments in Africa and E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europe are op@@ ening their bu@@ d@@ gets to the public ."
"But , you know , there is a big difference between a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s public and a bu@@ d@@ get that &apos;s acc@@ es@@ sible ."
"This is a public bu@@ d@@ get . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really acc@@ es@@ sible or underst@@ and@@ able to an ordinary ci@@ tiz@@ en that is trying to understand how the government is sp@@ ending its resources ."
"T@@ o t@@ ack@@ le this problem , govern@@ ments are using new tools to visu@@ aliz@@ e the bu@@ d@@ get so it &apos;s more underst@@ and@@ able to the public ."
"In this map from M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a , the green color shows those di@@ str@@ ic@@ ts that have low sp@@ ending on s@@ cho@@ ols but good educ@@ ational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the op@@ pos@@ ite ."
"T@@ o@@ ols like this help turn a sh@@ el@@ f full of in@@ sc@@ ru@@ table doc@@ um@@ ents into a pub@@ lic@@ ly underst@@ and@@ able visu@@ al , and what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that with this open@@ ness , there are today new opport@@ unities for ci@@ tiz@@ ens to give fe@@ ed@@ back and eng@@ age with government ."
"So in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines today , parents and students can give re@@ al@@ -@@ time fe@@ ed@@ back on a we@@ b@@ site , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ m@@ ys@@ cho@@ ol@@ .@@ or@@ g , or using S@@ M@@ S , whether teach@@ ers and t@@ ex@@ t@@ books are sho@@ wing up in school , the same problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a and in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"And the government is respon@@ sive . So for inst@@ ance , when it was re@@ por@@ ted on this we@@ b@@ site that 8@@ 0@@ 0 students were at risk because school re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s had st@@ all@@ ed du@@ e to cor@@ ru@@ ption , the D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines took s@@ wi@@ ft action ."
"And you know what &apos;s exc@@ iting is that this innovation is now sp@@ read@@ ing S@@ outh to S@@ outh , from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines to In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ia , K@@ en@@ y@@ a , M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a and be@@ y@@ ond ."
"In D@@ ar es S@@ al@@ a@@ am , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia , even an im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed community was able to use these tools to vo@@ ice its as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions ."
"This is what the map of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in Au@@ g@@ ust , 20@@ 11 . But within a few weeks , univer@@ sity students were able to use mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones and an open@@ -@@ sour@@ ce pl@@ at@@ form to dra@@ ma@@ tically map the entire community in@@ fra@@ structure ."
"And what is very exc@@ iting is that ci@@ tiz@@ ens were then able to give fe@@ ed@@ back as to which health or water poin@@ ts were not working , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated in the red bu@@ b@@ bl@@ es that you see , which together provi@@ des a grap@@ hi@@ c visu@@ al of the coll@@ ective vo@@ ices of the po@@ or ."
"T@@ o@@ day , even B@@ i@@ ha@@ r is tur@@ ning around and op@@ ening up under a comm@@ it@@ ted lead@@ er@@ ship that is making government transp@@ ar@@ ent , acc@@ es@@ sible and respon@@ sive to the po@@ or ."
"But , you know , in many parts of the world , govern@@ ments are not interested in op@@ ening up or in ser@@ ving the po@@ or , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system ."
"These are the lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fron@@ ti@@ er of develop@@ ment work is to help these lon@@ ely war@@ ri@@ ors jo@@ in hands so they can together over@@ come the od@@ ds ."
"So for inst@@ ance , today , in G@@ h@@ an@@ a , cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous re@@ form@@ ers from civi@@ l society , P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent and government , have for@@ ged a co@@ ali@@ tion for transp@@ ar@@ ent con@@ trac@@ ts in the oil sec@@ tor , and , g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ iz@@ ed by this , re@@ form@@ ers in P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent are now inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous con@@ trac@@ ts ."
"These exam@@ ples give new hope , new possi@@ bility to the problems I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed in U@@ g@@ and@@ a or that my father con@@ fron@@ ted in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r ."
"T@@ w@@ o years ago , on Ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 20@@ 10 , I called my father ."
"It was very l@@ ate at night , and at age 80 , he was typ@@ ing a 7@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age public inter@@ est li@@ ti@@ g@@ ation against cor@@ ru@@ ption in a ro@@ ad project ."
"Th@@ ough he was no la@@ w@@ y@@ er , he ar@@ gu@@ ed the case in cour@@ t h@@ im@@ self the next day . He won the r@@ ul@@ ing , but later that very ev@@ ening , he f@@ ell , and he died ."
"He f@@ ou@@ ght ti@@ ll the end , incre@@ as@@ ingly pas@@ sion@@ ate that to comb@@ at cor@@ ru@@ ption and po@@ ver@@ ty , not only did government off@@ ici@@ als need to be hon@@ est , but ci@@ tiz@@ ens needed to jo@@ in together to make their vo@@ ices heard ."
"These became the two boo@@ k@@ ends of his life , and the jour@@ ney he trav@@ el@@ ed in between m@@ ir@@ ro@@ red the changing develop@@ ment l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m inspi@@ red by these changes , and I &apos;m exc@@ ited that at the World B@@ ank , we are em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing these new direc@@ tions , a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in U@@ g@@ and@@ a 20 years ago ."
"We need to ra@@ dic@@ ally open up develop@@ ment so knowledge flo@@ ws in multi@@ ple direc@@ tions , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers , so a@@ id becomes transp@@ ar@@ ent , ac@@ coun@@ table and eff@@ ective , so govern@@ ments open up and ci@@ tiz@@ ens are eng@@ ag@@ ed and em@@ power@@ ed with re@@ form@@ ers in government ."
We need to acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate these shi@@ f@@ ts .
"If we do , we will find that the coll@@ ective vo@@ ices of the po@@ or will be heard in B@@ i@@ ha@@ r , in U@@ g@@ and@@ a , and be@@ y@@ ond ."
We will find that t@@ ex@@ t@@ books and teach@@ ers will show up in s@@ cho@@ ols for their children .
"We will find that these children , too , have a real chan@@ ce of brea@@ king their way out of po@@ ver@@ ty ."
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
"So imagine that a plan@@ e is about to cr@@ ash with 2@@ 50 children and bab@@ ies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?"
Now imagine that 60 plan@@ es full of bab@@ ies under five cr@@ ash every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fi@@ f@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
"M@@ ost of these de@@ a@@ ths are pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sa@@ d , it makes me an@@ gr@@ y , and it makes me de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed ."
"D@@ i@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a and p@@ ne@@ um@@ on@@ ia are am@@ ong the top two k@@ ill@@ ers of children under five , and what we can do to pre@@ v@@ ent these dise@@ ases isn &apos;t some smar@@ t , new techno@@ logical innov@@ ations ."
It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s ol@@ d@@ est inv@@ en@@ tions : a b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p .
"W@@ ash@@ ing hands with so@@ a@@ p , a ha@@ bit we all take for gr@@ an@@ ted , can re@@ duce di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a by half , can re@@ duce resp@@ ir@@ at@@ ory inf@@ ec@@ tions by one third ."
"H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p can have an imp@@ act on re@@ duc@@ ing fl@@ u , tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a , S@@ A@@ R@@ S , and most recently in the case of ch@@ ol@@ era and E@@ b@@ ol@@ a out@@ bre@@ ak , one of the key inter@@ ven@@ tions is hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ke@@ e@@ ps kids in school .
It stop@@ s bab@@ ies from d@@ ying .
H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p is one of the most cos@@ t-@@ eff@@ ective ways of sa@@ ving children &apos;s lives .
"It can sa@@ ve over 6@@ 00@@ ,000 children every year ."
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of stop@@ ping 10 j@@ um@@ b@@ o j@@ ets full of bab@@ ies and children from cr@@ ash@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll ag@@ ree with me that that &apos;s a pretty us@@ e@@ ful public health inter@@ ven@@ tion .
So now just take a minut@@ e .
I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
Why don &apos;t you just sha@@ ke their hands .
P@@ le@@ ase sha@@ ke their hands .
"All right , get to know each other ."
They look really pretty .
All right .
"So what if I told you that the person wh@@ ose hands you just sh@@ ook actually didn &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they were coming out of the to@@ il@@ et ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty any@@ more , right ?"
"P@@ re@@ t@@ ty y@@ uc@@ ky , you would ag@@ ree with me ."
"Well , sta@@ tis@@ tics are actually sho@@ wing that four people out of five don &apos;t was@@ h their hands when they come out of the to@@ il@@ et , glob@@ ally ."
"And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got f@@ anc@@ y to@@ il@@ ets , run@@ ning water , and so@@ a@@ p avail@@ able , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mor@@ tal@@ ity is really high ."
What is it ? Is there no so@@ a@@ p ?
"A@@ c@@ tually , so@@ a@@ p is avail@@ able ."
"In 9@@ 0 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in K@@ en@@ y@@ a , you will find so@@ a@@ p ."
"E@@ ven in countries where so@@ a@@ p is the low@@ est , like E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , we are at 50 percent ."
So why is it ?
Why ar@@ en &apos;t people was@@ h@@ ing their hands ?
"Wh@@ y is it that M@@ ay@@ ank , this young bo@@ y that I met in India , isn &apos;t was@@ h@@ ing his hands ?"
"Well , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ a@@ p is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ a@@ p is used for la@@ und@@ ry , so@@ a@@ p is used for was@@ h@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es ."
"H@@ is parents think sometimes it &apos;s a preci@@ ous com@@ mod@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a c@@ up@@ board ."
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t wa@@ st@@ e it .
"O@@ n average , in M@@ ay@@ ank &apos;s family , they will use so@@ a@@ p for was@@ h@@ ing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for was@@ h@@ ing hands with so@@ a@@ p ."
What &apos;s the result of that ?
"@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren pic@@ k up disease in the place that &apos;s sup@@ posed to love them and prot@@ ect them the most , in their h@@ omes ."
Th@@ ink about where you learned to was@@ h your hands .
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands at home ?
D@@ id you learn to was@@ h your hands in school ?
I think behavi@@ or@@ al scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the ha@@ b@@ its that you have had early in life .
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , we all cop@@ y what everyone else does , and local cul@@ tural nor@@ ms are something that sh@@ ape how we change our behavior , and this is where the priv@@ ate sec@@ tor comes in ."
"E@@ very second in A@@ si@@ a and Africa , 11@@ 1 mo@@ thers will buy this b@@ ar to prot@@ ect their family ."
"M@@ any women in India will tell you they learned all about hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , dise@@ ases , from this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p from Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and ."
I@@ con@@ ic br@@ ands like this one have a respon@@ si@@ bility to do good in the places where they s@@ ell their produc@@ ts .
"It &apos;s that beli@@ ef , pl@@ us the scale of Un@@ il@@ ever , that allo@@ ws us to keep talking about hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e to these mo@@ thers ."
B@@ i@@ g bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es and br@@ ands can change and shi@@ ft those social nor@@ ms and make a difference for those ha@@ b@@ its that are so stu@@ b@@ born .
Th@@ ink about it : M@@ ar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers spend all their time making us s@@ wit@@ ch from one br@@ and to the other .
"And actually , they know how to trans@@ form science and fac@@ ts into comp@@ elling mess@@ ages ."
"@@ Just for a minut@@ e , imagine when they put all their for@@ ces behind a message as powerful as hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
The prof@@ it mo@@ tive is trans@@ form@@ ing health out@@ comes in this world .
But it &apos;s been happening for cent@@ ur@@ ies : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y br@@ and was la@@ un@@ ched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ an Eng@@ land to actually comb@@ at ch@@ ol@@ era .
"L@@ ast week , I was in G@@ h@@ an@@ a with the min@@ ist@@ er of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ bre@@ ak in G@@ h@@ an@@ a at the moment ."
"A hund@@ red and e@@ igh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop ch@@ ol@@ era from sp@@ read@@ ing ."
"I think this dri@@ ve for prof@@ it is extre@@ me@@ ly powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most comm@@ it@@ ted char@@ ity or government ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ vern@@ ment is doing what they can , esp@@ eci@@ ally in terms of the pan@@ dem@@ ics and ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ics such as ch@@ ol@@ era , or E@@ b@@ ol@@ a at the moment , but with compe@@ ting pri@@ ori@@ ties ."
The bu@@ d@@ get is not always there .
"And when you think about this , you think about what is requ@@ i@@ red to make hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing a d@@ a@@ ily ha@@ bit , it requ@@ i@@ res sust@@ ain@@ ed fund@@ ing to re@@ f@@ ine this behavior ."
"In sh@@ ort , those that fi@@ ght for public health are actually depend@@ ent up@@ on the so@@ a@@ p companies to keep prom@@ ot@@ ing hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
"We have friends like U@@ S@@ AI@@ D , the G@@ lob@@ al P@@ u@@ b@@ lic@@ -@@ P@@ ri@@ v@@ ate P@@ ar@@ t@@ ner@@ ship for H@@ and@@ was@@ h@@ ing with S@@ o@@ a@@ p , L@@ on@@ don S@@ ch@@ ool of H@@ y@@ gi@@ en@@ e and T@@ rop@@ ical M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine , P@@ l@@ an , W@@ at@@ er@@ A@@ id , that all believe for a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ w@@ in part@@ ner@@ ship ."

"W@@ in for the priv@@ ate sec@@ tor , because we build new gener@@ ations of future hand@@ was@@ h@@ ers ."

"What &apos;s requ@@ i@@ red , and again where the priv@@ ate sec@@ tor can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , cre@@ ative thinking that dri@@ ves adv@@ oc@@ acy ."
"If you take our H@@ el@@ p a Ch@@ il@@ d R@@ each 5 cam@@ pa@@ ign , we &apos;ve created great fil@@ ms that bring the message of hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p to the every@@ day person in a way that can rel@@ ate to them ."
We &apos;ve had over 30 million vie@@ ws .

I ur@@ ge you to take five minutes and look at those fil@@ ms .
"I come from M@@ al@@ i , one of the world &apos;s po@@ o@@ rest countries ."
I gre@@ w up in a family where every d@@ in@@ ner conversa@@ tion was around social j@@ us@@ tice .

"I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degre@@ e in health , and the only one with a doc@@ t@@ or@@ ate in hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing with so@@ a@@ p ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ine years ago , I decided , with a success@@ ful public health care@@ er in the making , that I could make the bi@@ ggest imp@@ act coming , sel@@ ling and prom@@ ot@@ ing the world &apos;s best inv@@ en@@ tion in public health : so@@ a@@ p ."
We run today the world &apos;s lar@@ gest hand@@ was@@ h@@ ing program by any public health stand@@ ar@@ ds .
We &apos;ve re@@ ach@@ ed over 18@@ 3 million people in 1@@ 6 countries .
My team and I have the am@@ bi@@ tion to re@@ ach one billion by 20@@ 20 .
"O@@ ver the last four years , business has gro@@ wn dou@@ ble dig@@ its , wh@@ il@@ st child mor@@ tal@@ ity has re@@ duc@@ ed in all the places where so@@ a@@ p use has incre@@ as@@ ed ."
It may be un@@ comfor@@ table for some to hear — business growth and lives sa@@ ved some@@ how equ@@ ated in the same s@@ ent@@ ence — but it is that business growth that allo@@ ws us to keep doing more .
"W@@ i@@ th@@ out it , and without talking about it , we cannot achi@@ eve the change that we need ."
"L@@ ast week , my team and I spent time vi@@ sit@@ ing mo@@ thers that have all experi@@ enc@@ ed the same thing : the death of a ne@@ w@@ born ."
I &apos;m a mo@@ m . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more pain@@ ful .
This one is from M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
"She had the most beautiful sm@@ ile , the sm@@ ile , I think , that life gi@@ ves you when you &apos;ve had a second chan@@ ce ."
"H@@ er son , M@@ y@@ o , is her second one ."
"She had a d@@ aughter who pas@@ sed away at three weeks , and we know that the maj@@ ority of children that actually die die in the first mon@@ th of their life , and we know that if we give a b@@ ar of so@@ a@@ p to every sk@@ illed bir@@ th atten@@ d@@ ant , and that if so@@ a@@ p is used before tou@@ ching the bab@@ ies , we can re@@ duce and make a change in terms of those numbers ."
"And that &apos;s what inspi@@ res me , inspi@@ res me to contin@@ ue in this mis@@ sion , to know that I can equ@@ i@@ p her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing her ne@@ w@@ born ."
"And next time you think of a gi@@ ft for a new mo@@ m and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her so@@ a@@ p ."
It &apos;s the most beautiful inv@@ en@@ tion in public health .

"These are simple ob@@ jects : c@@ loc@@ ks , ke@@ ys , comb@@ s , gl@@ as@@ ses ."

The fact that some of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms car@@ ried personal it@@ ems such as to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e and a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush is a clear sig@@ n they had no idea what was about to happen to them .

Th@@ ous@@ ands of arti@@ fac@@ ts are p@@ ac@@ ked in white pl@@ astic b@@ ag@@ s just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
"These ob@@ jects are used as a for@@ en@@ si@@ c to@@ ol in visu@@ al identi@@ fic@@ ation of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , but they are also used as very val@@ u@@ able for@@ en@@ si@@ c evidence in the on@@ going war cri@@ m@@ es tri@@ als ."
"S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors are oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally called to try to identi@@ fy these it@@ ems phys@@ ically , but physical bro@@ w@@ sing is extre@@ me@@ ly difficult , an in@@ eff@@ ective and pain@@ ful process ."
"O@@ n@@ ce the for@@ en@@ s@@ ics and doc@@ tors and la@@ w@@ y@@ ers are done with these ob@@ jects , they become or@@ ph@@ ans of the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive ."
"M@@ any of them get de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , believe it or not , or they get simply sh@@ el@@ ved , out of si@@ ght and out of mind ."
I decided a few years ago to photograp@@ h every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ e@@ m in order to create a visu@@ al arch@@ ive that survi@@ v@@ ors could eas@@ ily bro@@ w@@ se .
"As a stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er , I like to give back to the community ."
I like to move be@@ y@@ ond rais@@ ing a@@ war@@ en@@ ess .
"And in this case , someone may recogn@@ ize these it@@ ems or at least their photograp@@ h@@ s will re@@ main as a per@@ man@@ ent , un@@ bi@@ as@@ ed and ac@@ cur@@ ate re@@ min@@ der of what happened ."
"P@@ h@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ y is about em@@ pa@@ thy , and the famili@@ ar@@ ity of these it@@ ems gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e em@@ pa@@ thy ."

Thank you very much .
( Applause )
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for cho@@ col@@ ate d@@ on@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30@@ -@@ day challeng@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 30@@ -@@ day challeng@@ es .
It &apos;s aw@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun ."
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in pro@@ gre@@ ss ."
"S@@ ince we are still realiz@@ ing these works , we are lar@@ ge@@ ly working within the re@@ al@@ m of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion and my@@ st@@ ery , still ."
So I &apos;m going to try and descri@@ be some of the experi@@ ences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the I@@ m@@ peri@@ al M@@ on@@ o@@ ch@@ r@@ omes .
"A vie@@ wer sort of un@@ s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ingly wal@@ ks into the room , and cat@@ ches a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of these pan@@ els in a mess@@ y comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion on the w@@ all ."
"W@@ i@@ th@@ in secon@@ ds , as if the pan@@ els have no@@ tic@@ ed the pres@@ ence of the vie@@ wer , they appe@@ ar to pan@@ ic and sort of get into a str@@ ic@@ t sym@@ me@@ try ."
( Laughter ) So this is the s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch of the two st@@ ates .
One is tot@@ al cha@@ os . The other is ab@@ sol@@ ute order .
And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
This also re@@ min@@ ded us of two very different pic@@ t@@ ori@@ al tradi@@ tions .
"One is the al@@ t@@ ar t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts of the 15@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , M@@ al@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s ab@@ str@@ act comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions ."
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
"T@@ o give you a sense of scale , the lar@@ gest pan@@ el is about two me@@ ters high ."
That &apos;s about this much . And the sm@@ all@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
"So a vie@@ wer en@@ ters the space , and they s@@ na@@ p to attention ."
"And after a while , if the vie@@ wer contin@@ ues to re@@ main in the space , the pan@@ els will sort of become im@@ m@@ un@@ e to the pres@@ ence of the vie@@ wer and become la@@ x and au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ous again , until they sort of sense a pres@@ ence in the room or a movement , when they will again s@@ na@@ p to attention ."
"( Laughter ) So here it appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s the vie@@ wer that &apos;s sort of in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating the sense of order am@@ ong the pan@@ els , but it could also be the other way around , that the pan@@ els are so st@@ uck within their pre@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed behavi@@ ors that they sort of th@@ r@@ ust the vie@@ wer with the ro@@ le of a t@@ y@@ r@@ ant ."
"So this br@@ ings me to a qu@@ i@@ e@@ ter , small work called H@@ and@@ hel@@ d ."
"The vie@@ wer se@@ es a piece of paper that &apos;s m@@ oun@@ ted on the far end of the w@@ all , but when you go clos@@ er , you see that it &apos;s a bl@@ ank A@@ 4 , or a le@@ t@@ ter@@ -@@ si@@ zed piece of paper , that &apos;s hel@@ d on either side by two small hands that appe@@ ar to be car@@ ved with a great deal of attention and care from a small b@@ loc@@ k of w@@ ood ."
"The vie@@ wer also se@@ es that this entire sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture is sort of moving very sli@@ gh@@ tly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long peri@@ od of time , and some@@ how are not manag@@ ing to ."
So this inst@@ ability in the movement very clos@@ ely re@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ es the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of images seen through a hand@@ hel@@ d cam@@ era .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two t@@ an@@ de@@ m c@@ li@@ ps .
One is through a still cam@@ era and the other is through a hand@@ hel@@ d cam@@ era .
And you im@@ medi@@ ately see how the un@@ ste@@ ad@@ y nature of the video su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts the pres@@ ence of an ob@@ ser@@ ver and a sub@@ j@@ ective point of view .
So we &apos;ve just re@@ moved the cam@@ era and trans@@ fer@@ red that movement onto the pan@@ el .
So here &apos;s a video .
You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
"But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to ev@@ o@@ ke a self-@@ eff@@ ac@@ ing ge@@ st@@ ure , as if there &apos;s a little person with out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched ar@@ ms behind this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous piece of paper ."
That sort of li@@ k@@ ens it to the amount of stra@@ in to be at the serv@@ ice of the ob@@ ser@@ ver and present this piece of paper very de@@ lic@@ ately to the vie@@ wer in front of them .
The next work is D@@ ec@@ o@@ y .
"This is a car@@ d@@ board model , so the ob@@ ject is about as t@@ all as I am ."
"It has a r@@ oun@@ ded body , two ar@@ ms , and a very t@@ all , head@@ -@@ like an@@ ten@@ n@@ a , and its so@@ le pur@@ pose is to at@@ tr@@ act attention to@@ wards itself ."
"So when a vie@@ wer pas@@ ses by , it sort of ti@@ l@@ ts from side to side , and mo@@ ves its ar@@ ms more and more fr@@ an@@ tically as the person gets clos@@ er ."
So here is the first test sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
"You see the two mov@@ em@@ ents in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated , and the ob@@ ject seems to be emp@@ lo@@ ying its entire being in this ex@@ pression of des@@ per@@ ation ."
"But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person wh@@ ose attention to get ."
( Laughter ) So this is the fin@@ al f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ated body of the D@@ ec@@ o@@ y .
It appe@@ ars to be m@@ ass@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ red like it came out of a fac@@ t@@ ory like v@@ ac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers and was@@ h@@ ing mach@@ ines .
"Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this con@@ sum@@ er a@@ es@@ the@@ tic sort of de@@ person@@ aliz@@ es the ob@@ ject and gi@@ ves us a bit of dist@@ ance in its appe@@ ar@@ ance , at least ."
"And so to us this is a kind of s@@ in@@ ist@@ er being which is trying to di@@ str@@ act you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help ."
"The next work is an ob@@ ject , that &apos;s also a kind of sound in@@ str@@ um@@ ent ."
In the sh@@ ape of an am@@ p@@ hi@@ the@@ ater that &apos;s sc@@ al@@ ed to the size of an audience as per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved from somebody from the stage .
"So from where I &apos;m st@@ anding , each of you appe@@ ars to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision ."
S@@ e@@ ated in this audience are 9@@ 9@@ 6 small fi@@ gu@@ res .
They &apos;re mechan@@ ically en@@ ab@@ led to cl@@ a@@ p of their own free will .
"This means that each of them can deci@@ de if and when they want to cl@@ a@@ p , how hard , for how long , how they want to be in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by those around them or in@@ flu@@ ence others , and if they want to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to innovation ."
"So when the vie@@ wer ste@@ ps in front of the audience , there will be a respon@@ se ."
"It could be a few cl@@ aps or a str@@ ong ap@@ plause , and then nothing happens until the vie@@ wer lea@@ ves the stage , and again the audience will respon@@ d ."
"It could be anything from a few fe@@ e@@ ble cl@@ aps from mem@@ bers in the audience , or it could be a very l@@ ou@@ d o@@ v@@ ation ."
"So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own ob@@ ject or its own organ@@ ism that &apos;s also got a sort of mus@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it , an in@@ str@@ um@@ ent ."
"So the vie@@ wer can play it by e@@ lic@@ iting quite complex and vari@@ ed , nu@@ anc@@ ed mus@@ ical or sound patter@@ ns , but cannot really pro@@ vo@@ ke the audience into any particular kind of respon@@ se ."
So there &apos;s a sense of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment and cap@@ r@@ ici@@ ous@@ ness and un@@ eas@@ iness involved .
It also has an all@@ uring and tr@@ ap@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite exc@@ ited about the image of the head s@@ pl@@ it@@ ting to form the two hands .
"So here &apos;s a small visu@@ al an@@ i@@ mation , as if the two si@@ des of the brain are sort of cl@@ ash@@ ing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the ten@@ sion ."
And here is a prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
So we can &apos;t wa@@ it to be eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed by 9@@ 9@@ 6 of them .
"O@@ kay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the F@@ ra@@ mer@@ un@@ ners ."
It comes out of the idea of a win@@ d@@ ow .
"This is an ac@@ tual win@@ d@@ ow in our stu@@ di@@ o , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ick@@ n@@ ess@@ es of w@@ oo@@ den sec@@ tions ."
So we used the same win@@ d@@ ow v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary to con@@ struc@@ t our own fra@@ me or g@@ ri@@ d that &apos;s s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in the room and that can be vie@@ wed from two si@@ des .
This g@@ ri@@ d is in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small fi@@ gu@@ res .
"They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ z@@ es , as if to su@@ ggest a kind of per@@ spec@@ tive or l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape on the single pl@@ ain ."
E@@ ach of these fi@@ gu@@ res can also run back@@ ward and forward in the tr@@ ack and hi@@ de behind two ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent trac@@ ks .
"So in con@@ tr@@ ast to this very ti@@ ght g@@ ri@@ d , we wanted to give these fi@@ gu@@ res a very com@@ ical and s@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ tic@@ k@@ -@@ like qu@@ ality , as if a pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er has taken them and phys@@ ically anim@@ ated them down the p@@ ath ."
"So we like the idea of these fi@@ gu@@ res sort of s@@ ki@@ p@@ ping along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and care@@ free and happ@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ l@@ uc@@ ky and cont@@ ent , until they sort of sense a movement from the vie@@ wer and they will hi@@ de behind the fa@@ st@@ est w@@ all ."
"So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion ."
"These fi@@ gu@@ res are sort of en@@ tr@@ app@@ ed within this very str@@ ong g@@ ri@@ d , which is like a pri@@ son , but also a for@@ tre@@ ss , because it allo@@ ws them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and na@@ ive and care@@ free and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the ex@@ ter@@ nal world ."
"So all these real life qu@@ ali@@ ties that I talk about are sort of trans@@ l@@ ated to a very speci@@ fic tech@@ n@@ ical con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation , and we were very l@@ uc@@ ky to coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ ur@@ ich to devel@@ op the first prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ."
So you see they ex@@ trac@@ ted the mo@@ tion co@@ gs from our an@@ ima@@ tions and created a w@@ ig@@ g@@ le that in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated the head@@ -@@ bo@@ b@@ b@@ ing movement and the back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ for@@ th movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can fit into the p@@ al@@ m of my hand .
"So imagine our exc@@ it@@ ement when we saw it really working in the stu@@ di@@ o , and here it is ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the pl@@ an .
"I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this ."
( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
"But then came my 9@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ age sen@@ i@@ or the@@ sis , a paper you &apos;re sup@@ posed to spend a year on ."
"And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work f@@ low was not an op@@ tion ."
It was way too big a project .
This is how the year would go .
"But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened ."
Th@@ ose first few months ?
"( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here ."
"And then two months turned into one mon@@ th , which turned into two weeks ."
"It was a very , very bad the@@ sis . ( Laughter )"
"@@ No , no , it was very , very bad ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er@@ -@@ b@@ log@@ ger guy ."
"Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ator ?"
"Well , it means everything &apos;s f@@ ine until this happens ."
He lives enti@@ rely in the present moment .
"He has no mem@@ ory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : easy and fun ."
"Now , in the animal world , that works f@@ ine ."
"( Laughter ) And to the M@@ on@@ key , humans are just another animal species ."
"We &apos;re in an adv@@ anc@@ ed civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation , and the M@@ on@@ key does not know what that is ."
We can visu@@ aliz@@ e the future .
We can see the big picture .
And that &apos;s when we have a conf@@ lic@@ t .
"And import@@ antly , he &apos;s the only thing the M@@ on@@ key is terri@@ fied of ."
"As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to re@@ le@@ ase the spea@@ kers ."
"It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works ."
This is what I decided to write about on the b@@ lo@@ g a couple of years ago .
Why are all of these people in such a d@@ ark place ?
It &apos;s us@@ u@@ ally suff@@ ered qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly and priv@@ ately .
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cra@@ m@@ ming for some project .
That &apos;s right — I think all of you are pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ators .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0@@ -@@ year life .
"So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ end@@ ar ."
"We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ cra@@ st@@ in@@ ating on something in life ."
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
( Laughter ) You know .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"There &apos;s a man by the name of C@@ ap@@ tain W@@ illi@@ am S@@ w@@ en@@ son who recently was a@@ war@@ ded the con@@ gre@@ s@@ sion@@ al M@@ ed@@ al of H@@ on@@ or for his ac@@ tions on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 8 , 200@@ 9 ."
"O@@ n that day , a col@@ um@@ n of American and A@@ f@@ gh@@ an tro@@ op@@ s were making their way through a part of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an to help prot@@ ect a group of government off@@ ici@@ als , a group of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an government off@@ ici@@ als , who would be me@@ e@@ ting with some local v@@ ill@@ age el@@ d@@ ers ."
"The col@@ um@@ n came under am@@ bus@@ h , and was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded on three si@@ des , and am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son was recogn@@ iz@@ ed for run@@ ning into live fir@@ e to re@@ sc@@ ue the w@@ oun@@ ded and pul@@ l out the de@@ ad ."
"One of the people he re@@ sc@@ u@@ ed was a ser@@ ge@@ ant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ a@@ c he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter ."
"And what was re@@ mark@@ able about this day is , by sh@@ e@@ er co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence , one of the me@@ dev@@ a@@ c medic@@ s happened to have a G@@ o@@ P@@ r@@ o cam@@ era on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tu@@ red the whole sc@@ en@@ e on cam@@ era ."
It shows C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de br@@ ing@@ ing this w@@ oun@@ ded sol@@ di@@ er who had re@@ ce@@ i@@ ved a g@@ un@@ sho@@ t to the nec@@ k .
"They put him in the he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter , and then you see C@@ ap@@ tain S@@ w@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ is@@ s before he turns around to re@@ sc@@ ue more ."
"I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?"
"What is that ? That is some deep , deep emo@@ tion , when you would want to do that ."
"There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?"
"You know , in the mil@@ it@@ ary , they give me@@ d@@ als to people who are w@@ illing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice themselves so that others may g@@ ain ."
"In business , we give b@@ on@@ uses to people who are w@@ illing to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice others so that we may g@@ ain ."
We have it back@@ wards . Right ?
"So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?"
And my in@@ i@@ ti@@ al con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion was that they &apos;re just better people .
These better people are at@@ trac@@ ted to this con@@ cept of serv@@ ice .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
"What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these re@@ mark@@ able things , and more import@@ antly , others have that cap@@ ac@@ ity too ."
"I &apos;ve had the great hon@@ or of getting to me@@ et some of these , who we would call her@@ o@@ es , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to sa@@ ve others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?"
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this deep sense of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
So tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation are really important here .
"The problem with con@@ cep@@ ts of tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation is that they are fe@@ el@@ ings , they are not in@@ struc@@ tions ."
"I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; T@@ r@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will ."
"I can &apos;t simply in@@ struc@@ t two people to co@@ oper@@ ate , and they will ."
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
"If you go back 50@@ ,000 years to the P@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic era , to the early days of H@@ om@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , what we find is that the world was f@@ illed with d@@ an@@ ger , all of these for@@ ces working very , very hard to k@@ ill us ."
No@@ thing personal .
"Wh@@ e@@ ther it was the we@@ a@@ ther , l@@ ack of resources , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ o@@ th@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to re@@ duce our li@@ f@@ esp@@ an ."
"And so we evol@@ ved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a cir@@ cle of sa@@ fe@@ ty , inside the tri@@ be , where we felt like we bel@@ on@@ ged ."
"And when we felt sa@@ fe am@@ on@@ g@@ st our own , the natural re@@ action was tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation ."
There are in@@ her@@ ent bene@@ f@@ its to this .
It means I can f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep at night and tr@@ ust that someone from within my tri@@ be will watch for d@@ an@@ ger .
"If we don &apos;t tr@@ ust each other , if I don &apos;t tr@@ ust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for d@@ an@@ ger ."
B@@ ad system of survi@@ v@@ al .
The moder@@ n day is exactly the same thing .
"The world is f@@ illed with d@@ an@@ ger , things that are trying to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate our lives or re@@ duce our suc@@ cess , re@@ duce our opportunity for suc@@ cess ."
"It could be the u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns in the economy , the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the st@@ oc@@ k market ."
It could be a new technology that r@@ end@@ ers your business model ob@@ so@@ le@@ te o@@ vern@@ ight .
O@@ r it could be your compe@@ ti@@ tion that is sometimes trying to k@@ ill you .
"It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very min@@ im@@ um is working hard to f@@ ru@@ str@@ ate your growth and ste@@ al your business from you ."
We have no control over these for@@ ces .
"These are a con@@ st@@ ant , and they &apos;re not going away ."
"The only vari@@ able are the condi@@ tions inside the organiz@@ ation , and that &apos;s where lead@@ er@@ ship mat@@ ters , because it &apos;s the lead@@ er that se@@ ts the t@@ one ."
"When a lead@@ er makes the choice to put the sa@@ fe@@ ty and lives of the people inside the organiz@@ ation first , to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice their comfor@@ ts and s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble res@@ ults , so that the people re@@ main and feel sa@@ fe and feel like they bel@@ ong , re@@ mark@@ able things happen ."
"I was fl@@ ying on a tri@@ p , and I was wit@@ ness to an in@@ ci@@ dent where a pas@@ sen@@ ger att@@ emp@@ ted to board before their number was called , and I wat@@ ched the g@@ ate ag@@ ent tre@@ at this man like he had bro@@ ken the la@@ w , like a cri@@ min@@ al ."
He was y@@ ell@@ ed at for att@@ emp@@ ting to board one group too so@@ on .
So I said something .
"I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have tre@@ at us like cat@@ tle ?"
Why can &apos;t you tre@@ at us like human be@@ ings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
"She said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ir , if I don &apos;t fol@@ low the rules , I could get in tr@@ ou@@ ble or l@@ ose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel sa@@ fe . All she was telling me is th@@ at@@ "
she doesn &apos;t tr@@ ust her lead@@ ers .
The reason we like fl@@ ying S@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ir@@ l@@ ines is not because they nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily h@@ ire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their lead@@ ers .
"You see , if the condi@@ tions are wrong , we are for@@ c@@ ed to exp@@ end our own time and energy to prot@@ ect ourselves from each other , and that in@@ her@@ ently we@@ a@@ k@@ ens the organiz@@ ation ."
"When we feel sa@@ fe inside the organiz@@ ation , we will nat@@ ur@@ ally comb@@ ine our tal@@ ents and our str@@ eng@@ ths and work ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to face the d@@ ang@@ ers outside and se@@ ize the opport@@ unities ."
"The clos@@ est anal@@ o@@ gy I can give to what a great lead@@ er is , is like being a par@@ ent ."
"If you think about what being a great par@@ ent is , what do you want ? What makes a great par@@ ent ?"
"We want to give our child opport@@ unities , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine them when nec@@ ess@@ ary , all so that they can grow up and achi@@ eve more than we could for ourselves ."
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers want exactly the same thing .
"They want to provi@@ de their people opportunity , education , dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine when nec@@ ess@@ ary , build their self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dence , give them the opportunity to try and fa@@ il , all so that they could achi@@ eve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves ."
"@@ Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e K@@ i@@ m , who &apos;s the C@@ E@@ O of a company called N@@ ext J@@ um@@ p in New York C@@ ity , a t@@ ech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consi@@ der l@@ ay@@ ing off one of your children ?"
We would never do it .
Th@@ en why do we consi@@ der l@@ ay@@ ing off people inside our organiz@@ ation ?
Ch@@ ar@@ li@@ e imp@@ le@@ men@@ ted a po@@ lic@@ y of li@@ fe@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
"If you get a job at N@@ ext J@@ um@@ p , you cannot get fi@@ red for perform@@ ance issu@@ es ."
"In fact , if you have issu@@ es , they will co@@ ach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school ."
It &apos;s the comple@@ te op@@ pos@@ ite .
"This is the reason so many people have such a vi@@ sc@@ er@@ al h@@ at@@ red , an@@ ger , at some of these ban@@ king C@@ E@@ O@@ s with their dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies and b@@ on@@ us struc@@ tures ."
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very defin@@ i@@ tion of lead@@ er@@ ship .
They have viol@@ ated this deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated social con@@ tr@@ act .
"We know that they allo@@ wed their people to be s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed so they could prot@@ ect their own interest@@ s , or wor@@ se , they s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed their people to prot@@ ect their own interest@@ s ."
"This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers ."
W@@ ould any@@ body be off@@ en@@ ded if we gave a $ 1@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to G@@ and@@ h@@ i ?
How about a $ 2@@ 50 million b@@ on@@ us to M@@ other T@@ er@@ es@@ a ?
Do we have an issue with that ? N@@ one at all . N@@ one at all .
Gre@@ at lead@@ ers would never s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice
the people to sa@@ ve the numbers .
They would so@@ on@@ er s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice the numbers to sa@@ ve the people .
"B@@ o@@ b Ch@@ ap@@ man , who run@@ s a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company in the M@@ id@@ w@@ est called B@@ ar@@ r@@ y-@@ W@@ e@@ h@@ m@@ ill@@ er , in 200@@ 8 was h@@ it very hard by the rec@@ es@@ sion , and they lost 30 percent of their ord@@ ers o@@ vern@@ ight ."
"Now in a large man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer aff@@ ord their lab@@ or po@@ ol ."
"They needed to sa@@ ve 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed l@@ ay@@ off@@ s ."
And B@@ o@@ b re@@ f@@ used .
"You see , B@@ o@@ b doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts ."
"B@@ o@@ b beli@@ ev@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply re@@ duce the heart coun@@ t ."
And so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough program .
"E@@ very emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e , from secre@@ t@@ ary to C@@ E@@ O , was requ@@ i@@ red to take four weeks of un@@ pa@@ id v@@ ac@@ ation ."
"They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ sec@@ u@@ tively ."
But it was how B@@ o@@ b an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed the program that mat@@ ter@@ ed so much .
"He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suff@@ er a little than any of us should have to suff@@ er a lot , and mor@@ ale went up ."
"They sa@@ ved 20 million dollars , and most import@@ antly , as would be exp@@ ected , when the people feel sa@@ fe and prot@@ ected by the lead@@ er@@ ship in the organiz@@ ation , the natural re@@ action is to tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ate ."
"And quite sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ously , no@@ body exp@@ ected , people started tra@@ ding with each other ."
Th@@ ose who could aff@@ ord it more would tra@@ de with those who could aff@@ ord it less .
Pe@@ ople would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Le@@ ad@@ er@@ ship is a choice . It is not a r@@ ank .
I know many people at the sen@@ i@@ or@@ most lev@@ els of organiz@@ ations who are absolutely not lead@@ ers .
"They are au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties , and we do what they say because they have au@@ th@@ ority over us , but we would not fol@@ low them ."
"And I know many people who are at the bot@@ tom@@ s of organiz@@ ations who have no au@@ th@@ ority and they are absolutely lead@@ ers , and this is because they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the left of them , and they have ch@@ os@@ en to look after the person to the right of them ."
This is what a lead@@ er is .
"I heard a story of some M@@ ar@@ ines who were out in the@@ ater , and as is the M@@ ar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the off@@ ic@@ er ate last , and he let his men e@@ at first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him ."
"And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may e@@ at , because that &apos;s what happens ."
We call them lead@@ ers because they go first .
We call them lead@@ ers because they take the risk before any@@ body else does .
"We call them lead@@ ers because they will cho@@ ose to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice so that their people may be sa@@ fe and prot@@ ected and so their people may g@@ ain , and when we do , the natural respon@@ se is that our people will s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice for us ."
"They will give us their blood and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s to see that their lead@@ er &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?"
Why would you give your blood and s@@ we@@ at and t@@ ear@@ s for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organiz@@ ation we would all like to work in ?

One of every hund@@ red children born wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem star@@ ts during pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y .
The fe@@ tu@@ s needs to survi@@ ve inside the mother .
S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al dep@@ ends on communic@@ ation between the sy@@ st@@ em@@ ic and the pul@@ mon@@ ary blood .
"At the moment of bir@@ th , this communic@@ ation needs to stop ."
It is ca@@ used by pre@@ mat@@ urity and gene@@ tic condi@@ tions .
But what we know today is that a l@@ ack of o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en is also one of the ca@@ uses .
"As you can see in the ch@@ art , the f@@ requ@@ ency of this kind of h@@ ole dra@@ ma@@ tically incre@@ ases with al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de ."

"T@@ o close the h@@ ole , major sur@@ g@@ ery used to be the only solution ."
"One night , my friend M@@ al@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the A@@ ma@@ z@@ on regi@@ on ."
The only thing that would not bur@@ n in the fir@@ e was a green av@@ oc@@ a@@ do br@@ an@@ ch .
Th@@ en came a moment of inspi@@ ra@@ tion .
So we used the br@@ an@@ ch as a mo@@ ld for our first inv@@ en@@ tion .
The hol@@ es in children &apos;s hear@@ ts can be clos@@ ed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of w@@ ire wr@@ app@@ ed onto itself .
"It maybe doesn &apos;t look so f@@ anc@@ y to you now , but that was our first success@@ ful att@@ emp@@ t to create a device for this major problem ."
"In this video , we can see how a very tiny ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart ."
The co@@ il then clos@@ es the h@@ ole .
"A@@ f@@ ter that moment of inspi@@ ra@@ tion , there came a very long time of eff@@ ort develop@@ ing a prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e ."
In v@@ it@@ r@@ o and in vi@@ v@@ o stu@@ dies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
"The co@@ il , if it works , can sa@@ ve lives ."
"I re@@ turned from G@@ er@@ many to B@@ o@@ li@@ vi@@ a , thinking that wh@@ er@@ ever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference ."
"W@@ ith my wi@@ fe and part@@ ner , D@@ r@@ . A@@ le@@ x@@ and@@ r@@ a H@@ e@@ ath , we started to see patients ."
"A@@ f@@ ter success@@ fully tre@@ ating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ astic ."
"But we live in a place that is 12@@ ,000 feet high ."
"And , the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condi@@ tion ."
"The h@@ ole in al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de patients is different , because the ori@@ f@@ ice between the ar@@ ter@@ ies is lar@@ ger ."
"M@@ ost patients cannot aff@@ ord to be tre@@ ated on time , and they die ."

"For cent@@ ur@@ ies , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous women told stories by we@@ a@@ ving complex patter@@ ns on lo@@ oms , and an un@@ exp@@ ected sk@@ ill hel@@ ped us for the new device ."

It can change by itself into very complex struc@@ tures by a pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure that took dec@@ ades to devel@@ op .
"As you can see , the device en@@ ters the body through the natural chan@@ n@@ els ."
D@@ oc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the h@@ ole .
"O@@ ur device exp@@ ands , places itself and clos@@ es the h@@ ole ."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .

"F@@ rom start to fin@@ ish , the whole pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure takes only 30 minutes ."
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the me@@ dical and human point of view .
"We are so p@@ rou@@ d that some of our form@@ er patients are part of our team — a team , th@@ an@@ ks to ad@@ ded close inter@@ action with patients that work with us ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solu@@ tions need to be simple ."
We lost the fear of creating something new .

"So I gre@@ w up in L@@ im@@ pop@@ o , on the bor@@ der of L@@ im@@ pop@@ o and M@@ p@@ um@@ al@@ ang@@ a , a little to@@ wn called M@@ ot@@ et@@ em@@ a ."
"W@@ ater and electr@@ ic@@ ity sup@@ ply are as un@@ predic@@ table as the we@@ a@@ ther , and growing up in these t@@ ough situ@@ ations , at the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rela@@ x@@ ing with a couple of friends of mine in win@@ ter , and we were s@@ un@@ ba@@ thing ."
The L@@ im@@ pop@@ o su@@ n gets really h@@ ot in win@@ ter .
"So as we were s@@ un@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your sk@@ in and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I s@@ at , and I was like , &quot; &quot; M@@ an , I would buy that , e@@ h ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very sho@@ c@@ king sta@@ tis@@ tics ."
O@@ ver 2@@ .@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have pro@@ per access to water and s@@ an@@ it@@ ation .
"F@@ our hund@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in S@@ outh Africa ."
"@@ V@@ ari@@ ous dise@@ ases th@@ ri@@ ve in this environment , the most dr@@ astic of which is called tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a ."
T@@ r@@ ach@@ om@@ a is an inf@@ ection of the ey@@ e du@@ e to di@@ r@@ t getting into your ey@@ e . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple inf@@ ec@@ tions of tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a can leave you per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind .
"The disease lea@@ ves eight million people per@@ man@@ ently bl@@ ind each and every year . The sho@@ c@@ king part about it is that to av@@ o@@ id being inf@@ ected with tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a , all you have to do is was@@ h your face : no medic@@ ine , no p@@ ills , no in@@ j@@ ec@@ tions ."
"So after seeing these sho@@ c@@ king sta@@ tis@@ tics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to sa@@ ve the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ st@@ y little ste@@ ed , my No@@ k@@ ia 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a l@@ ap@@ top , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , ex@@ cept for the 20@@ -@@ r@@ and@@ -@@ an@@ -@@ h@@ our Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , on Google , about lo@@ tions , cre@@ am@@ s , the comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions , the m@@ el@@ ting poin@@ ts , the to@@ x@@ ici@@ ties — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little form@@ ul@@ a on a piece of paper ,@@ "
"@@ and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C special sp@@ ice , you know ?"
"So I was like , o@@ kay , so we &apos;ve got the form@@ ul@@ a ready ."
Now we need to get this thing into prac@@ tice .
"F@@ ast forward four years later , after having writ@@ ten a 40@@ -@@ p@@ age business pl@@ an on the cell phone , having writ@@ ten my pat@@ ent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ gest pat@@ ent@@ -@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had inv@@ ented D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first ba@@ th@@ -@@ sub@@ stitu@@ ting lo@@ tion ."
"You literally put it on your sk@@ in , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ."
"( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the lim@@ ited resources I had , I went to univer@@ sity , met a few people , got it into prac@@ tice , and we have a fully func@@ tion@@ ing produc@@ t that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually avail@@ able on the market ."
So we learned a few l@@ ess@@ ons in comm@@ er@@ ci@@ aliz@@ ing and making D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath avail@@ able .
One of the things we learned was that po@@ or comm@@ unities don &apos;t buy produc@@ ts in b@@ ul@@ k .
"They buy produc@@ ts on dem@@ and . A person in A@@ le@@ x doesn &apos;t buy a box of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ t@@ es . They buy one ci@@ gar@@ et@@ te each day , even though it &apos;s more exp@@ en@@ sive ."
So we p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ed D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath in these innov@@ ative little s@@ ac@@ he@@ ts .
"You just s@@ na@@ p them in half , and you squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze it out ."
"And the c@@ ool part is , one s@@ ach@@ et sub@@ stitu@@ t@@ es one b@@ ath for five r@@ and ."
"A@@ f@@ ter creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of imp@@ le@@ men@@ ting the produc@@ t ."
We realized that even r@@ ich kids from the sub@@ ur@@ bs really want D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) A@@ t least once a week .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , we realized that we could sa@@ ve 80 million lit@@ ers of water on average each time they s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped a b@@ ath , and also we would sa@@ ve two hours a day for kids who are in r@@ ural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for h@@ ome@@ work , two hours more to just be a kid ."
"A@@ f@@ ter seeing that global imp@@ act , we n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wed it down to our key value pro@@ position , which was cle@@ an@@ l@@ iness and con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence ."
D@@ r@@ y@@ B@@ ath is a r@@ ich man &apos;s con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence and a po@@ or man &apos;s li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver .
"H@@ a@@ ving put the produc@@ t into prac@@ tice , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of sel@@ ling the produc@@ t onto a mul@@ tin@@ ational to take it to the re@@ ta@@ il market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gra@@ v@@ el ro@@ ads of L@@ im@@ pop@@ o , with an allo@@ w@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the ."
What &apos;s stop@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
"And another key thing that I learned a lot throu@@ gh@@ out this whole process , last year Google nam@@ ed me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young min@@ ds in the world ."
"I &apos;m also curr@@ ently the best stud@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur in the world , the first Afr@@ ican to get that ac@@ col@@ ade , and one thing that really pu@@ z@@ z@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you ."

"F@@ ive years ago , I was on a s@@ ab@@ ba@@ tical , and I re@@ turned to the me@@ dical univer@@ sity where I stu@@ died ."
"I saw real patients and I wor@@ e the white co@@ at for the first time in 1@@ 7 years , in fact since I became a manag@@ ement con@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ant ."
There were two things that surpri@@ sed me during the mon@@ th I spent .
"The first one was that the common the@@ me of the di@@ sc@@ us@@ sions we had were hosp@@ ital bu@@ d@@ gets and cos@@ t-@@ c@@ utting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that sever@@ al of the colle@@ ag@@ ues I met , form@@ er friends from me@@ dical school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most mo@@ tiv@@ ated , eng@@ ag@@ ed and pas@@ sion@@ ate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ n@@ ical , dis@@ eng@@ ag@@ ed , or had dist@@ anc@@ ed themselves from hosp@@ ital manag@@ ement ."
"So with this foc@@ us on cos@@ t-@@ c@@ utting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patient ?"
M@@ any countries that you re@@ present and where I come from str@@ u@@ gg@@ le with the cost of heal@@ th@@ care .
It &apos;s a big part of the national bu@@ d@@ gets .
And many different re@@ for@@ ms a@@ i@@ m at hol@@ ding back this growth .
"In some countries , we have long wa@@ iting times for patients for sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"In other countries , new drugs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and ther@@ e@@ fore don &apos;t re@@ ach patients ."
"In sever@@ al countries , doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses are the tar@@ gets , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , for the govern@@ ments ."
"A@@ f@@ ter all , the cos@@ tly deci@@ sions in health care are taken by doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses ."
"You cho@@ ose an exp@@ en@@ sive lab test , you cho@@ ose to oper@@ ate on an old and fra@@ il patient ."
"So , by lim@@ iting the degre@@ es of free@@ dom of phys@@ ici@@ ans , this is a way to hold cos@@ ts down ."
"And ul@@ tim@@ ately , some phys@@ ici@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full li@@ ber@@ ty to make the cho@@ ices they think are right for their patients ."
So no won@@ der that some of my old colle@@ ag@@ ues are f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated .
"At B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of manag@@ ing heal@@ th@@ care ."
"And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achi@@ eve ? &quot;"
"@@ U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately , in the heal@@ th@@ care system , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing at impro@@ ving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a lim@@ ited , or aff@@ ord@@ able , cost ."
We call this val@@ u@@ e-@@ based heal@@ th@@ care .
"O@@ n the scre@@ en behind me , you see what we mean by value : out@@ comes that matter to patients rela@@ tive to the money we spend ."
This was descri@@ bed beauti@@ fully in a book in 200@@ 6 by M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter and E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th T@@ e@@ is@@ ber@@ g .
"O@@ n this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by his three beautiful d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the cos@@ ts , but to look at the qu@@ ality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fas@@ c@@ in@@ ated us was the vari@@ ation we saw ."
"You comp@@ are hosp@@ it@@ als in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extre@@ me@@ ly good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are v@@ ast@@ ly much wor@@ se ."
The differ@@ ences were dra@@ ma@@ tic .
"E@@ ri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ la@@ w , he suff@@ ers from pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer , and he probably needs sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"Now living in Europe , he can cho@@ ose to go to G@@ er@@ many that has a w@@ ell@@ -@@ re@@ pu@@ ted heal@@ th@@ care system ."
"If he goes there and goes to the average hosp@@ ital , he will have the risk of bec@@ om@@ ing in@@ contin@@ ent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start w@@ ear@@ ing di@@ ap@@ ers again ."
You f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in . F@@ i@@ f@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
"If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ bur@@ g , and to a cl@@ in@@ ic called the M@@ ar@@ tin@@ i@@ -@@ K@@ l@@ in@@ i@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 ."
"E@@ i@@ ther you a f@@ li@@ p a co@@ in , or you have a one in 20 risk ."
"That &apos;s a huge difference , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ f@@ old difference ."
"When we look at many hosp@@ it@@ als for many different dise@@ ases , we see these huge differ@@ ences ."
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
"And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t ex@@ ist ."
No@@ body kno@@ ws .
So going the hosp@@ ital is a l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope ."
"In the l@@ ate &apos; 7@@ 0s , there were a group of S@@ we@@ dis@@ h or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons who met at their an@@ n@@ ual me@@ e@@ ting , and they were di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing the different pro@@ ce@@ du@@ res they used to oper@@ ate hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"T@@ o the left of this sli@@ de , you see a vari@@ ety of met@@ al piec@@ es , arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hi@@ p ."
They all realized they had their individual way of oper@@ ating .
"They all ar@@ gu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My tech@@ ni@@ que is the best , &quot; &quot; but n@@ one of them actually knew , and they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that ."
"So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to meas@@ ure qu@@ ality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years de@@ b@@ ating , &quot; So what is qu@@ ality in hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery ? &quot;"
"&quot; Oh , we should meas@@ ure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should meas@@ ure that . &quot;"
And they finally ag@@ re@@ ed .
"And once they had ag@@ re@@ ed , they started meas@@ uring , and started sh@@ ar@@ ing the data ."
"@@ V@@ ery quickly , they found that if you put c@@ ement in the b@@ one of the patient before you put the met@@ al sha@@ ft in , it actually la@@ sted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on in their li@@ fe@@ time ."
"They publi@@ shed the data , and it actually trans@@ form@@ ed cl@@ in@@ ical prac@@ tice in the country ."
E@@ very@@ body saw this makes a lot of sense .
"S@@ ince then , they publi@@ sh every year ."
"O@@ n@@ ce a year , they publi@@ sh the le@@ ag@@ ue table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?"
"And they vi@@ sit each other to try to learn , so a contin@@ u@@ ous cy@@ cle of impro@@ v@@ ement ."
"For many years , S@@ we@@ dis@@ h hi@@ p sur@@ ge@@ ons had the best res@@ ults in the world , at least for those who actually were meas@@ uring , and many were not ."
Now I found this princi@@ ple really exc@@ iting .
"So the phys@@ ici@@ ans get together , they ag@@ ree on what qu@@ ality is , they start meas@@ uring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it ."
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ v@@ ement .
"Now , that &apos;s not the only exc@@ iting part ."
That &apos;s exc@@ iting in itself .
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equ@@ ation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have foc@@ used on qu@@ ality , they actually also have the low@@ est cos@@ ts , al@@ though that &apos;s not been the pur@@ pose in the first place ."
"So if you look at the hi@@ p sur@@ g@@ ery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they com@@ par@@ ed the U.S. and S@@ we@@ den ."
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re@@ -@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first sur@@ g@@ ery .
"In the United States , the number was three times high@@ er than in S@@ we@@ den ."
"So many un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary sur@@ g@@ er@@ ies , and so much un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ary suff@@ ering for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year peri@@ od ."
"Now , you can imagine how much sa@@ v@@ ings there would be for society ."
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ C@@ D data .
"O@@ E@@ C@@ D does , every so often , look at qu@@ ality of care where they can find the data across the member countries ."
"The United States has , for many dise@@ ases , actually a qu@@ ality which is bel@@ ow the average in O@@ E@@ C@@ D ."
"Now , if the American heal@@ th@@ care system would foc@@ us a lot more on meas@@ uring qu@@ ality , and ra@@ ise qu@@ ality just to the level of average O@@ E@@ C@@ D , it would sa@@ ve the American people 50@@ 0 billion U.S. dollars a year ."
"That &apos;s 20 percent of the bu@@ d@@ get , of the heal@@ th@@ care bu@@ d@@ get of the country ."
"Now you may say that these numbers are f@@ ant@@ astic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?"
"This would be a par@@ a@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft in heal@@ th@@ care , and I would ar@@ gu@@ e that not only can it be done , but it has to be done ."
The ag@@ ents of change are the doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses in the heal@@ th@@ care system .
"In my prac@@ tice as a con@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ant , I me@@ et probably a hund@@ red or more than a hund@@ red doc@@ tors and n@@ ur@@ ses and other hosp@@ ital or heal@@ th@@ care sta@@ ff every year ."
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achi@@ eve in terms of qu@@ ality for their patients .
"P@@ h@@ ys@@ ici@@ ans are , like most of you in the audience , very compe@@ ti@@ tive ."
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
"And if somebody can show them that the result they per@@ form for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to impro@@ ve ."
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But phys@@ ici@@ ans have another charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic .
They actually th@@ ri@@ ve from pe@@ er reco@@ g@@ ni@@ tion .
"If a car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist call@@ s another car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist in a compe@@ ting hosp@@ ital and di@@ sc@@ us@@ ses why that other hosp@@ ital has so much better res@@ ults , they will share ."
They will share the information on how to impro@@ ve .
"So it is , by meas@@ uring and creating transp@@ ar@@ ency , you get a cy@@ cle of contin@@ u@@ ous impro@@ v@@ ement , which is what this sli@@ de shows ."
"Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea ."
This is happening in reality .
"We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to meas@@ ure and comp@@ are what we achi@@ eve ."
"T@@ o@@ gether with two ac@@ a@@ dem@@ ic institu@@ tions , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el P@@ or@@ ter at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness S@@ ch@@ ool , and the K@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a In@@ stitu@@ te in S@@ we@@ den , B@@ C@@ G has form@@ ed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M ."
"You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an acr@@ on@@ y@@ m ."
It st@@ ands for the Inter@@ national Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um for H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ ut@@ come M@@ eas@@ u@@ re@@ ment .
"We &apos;re br@@ ing@@ ing together lead@@ ing phys@@ ici@@ ans and patients to di@@ sc@@ us@@ s , disease by disease , what is really qu@@ ality , what should we meas@@ ure , and to make those stand@@ ar@@ ds global ."
"They &apos;ve worked — four working grou@@ ps have worked during the past year : cat@@ ar@@ ac@@ ts , back pa@@ in , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y disease , which is , for inst@@ ance , heart att@@ ack , and pr@@ os@@ t@@ ate cancer ."
The four grou@@ ps will publi@@ sh their data in No@@ v@@ em@@ ber of this year .
"That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples , not only within a country , but between countries ."
"N@@ ext year , we &apos;re plan@@ ning to do eight dise@@ ases , the year after , 1@@ 6 ."
"In three years &apos; time , we pl@@ an to have co@@ vered 40 percent of the disease bur@@ den ."
C@@ om@@ p@@ are ap@@ ples to ap@@ ples . Wh@@ o &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
"F@@ ive months ago , I led a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p at the lar@@ gest univer@@ sity hosp@@ ital in Nor@@ ther@@ n Europe ."
"They have a new C@@ E@@ O , and she has a vision : I want to man@@ age my big institu@@ tion much more on qu@@ ality , out@@ comes that matter to patients ."
"This particular day , we s@@ at in a wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p together with phys@@ ici@@ ans , n@@ ur@@ ses and other sta@@ ff , di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing le@@ u@@ k@@ em@@ ia in children ."
"The group di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we meas@@ ure qu@@ ality today ?"
C@@ an we meas@@ ure it better than we do ?
"We di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed , how do we tre@@ at these kids , what are important impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ?"
"And we di@@ sc@@ us@@ sed what are the cos@@ ts for these patients , can we do tre@@ at@@ ment more effici@@ ently ?"
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous energy in the room .
"There were so many ideas , so much en@@ th@@ us@@ i@@ as@@ m ."
"At the end of the me@@ e@@ ting , the cha@@ ir@@ man of the de@@ part@@ ment , he st@@ ood up ."
"He looked over the group and he said — first he rais@@ ed his hand , I for@@ got that — he rais@@ ed his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his f@@ ist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
"Th@@ ank you . T@@ o@@ day , we &apos;re finally di@@ sc@@ us@@ sing what this hosp@@ ital does the right way . &quot; &quot; B@@ y meas@@ uring value in heal@@ th@@ care , that is not only cos@@ ts but out@@ comes that matter to patients , we will make sta@@ ff in hosp@@ it@@ als and el@@ se@@ where in the heal@@ th@@ care system not a problem but an important part of the solution ."
"I believe meas@@ uring value in heal@@ th@@ care will bring about a revol@@ ution , and I &apos;m conv@@ inc@@ ed that the f@@ oun@@ der of moder@@ n medic@@ ine , the G@@ ree@@ k H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ cr@@ ates , who always put the patient at the cen@@ ter , he would sm@@ ile in his gra@@ ve ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is one of the gre@@ at@@ est for@@ ms to make the world a better place .
"If you take a group of people with the right equ@@ ity inc@@ enti@@ ves and organiz@@ e them in a star@@ tu@@ p , you can un@@ loc@@ k human pot@@ ential in a way never before possible ."
You get them to achi@@ eve un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able things .
"But if the star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation is so great , why do so many fa@@ il ?"
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually mat@@ ters most for star@@ tu@@ p suc@@ cess .
"And I wanted to try to be sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic about it , av@@ o@@ id some of my inst@@ inc@@ ts and maybe mis@@ per@@ cep@@ tions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years ."
"I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been starting bus@@ in@@ ess@@ es since I was 12 years old when I so@@ ld can@@ dy at the b@@ us stop in j@@ uni@@ or high school , to high school , when I made solar energy dev@@ ices , to colle@@ ge , when I made l@@ ou@@ d@@ spea@@ kers ."
"And when I gra@@ du@@ ated from colle@@ ge , I started sof@@ tw@@ are companies ."
We learned a lot from those fail@@ ures .
So I looked at these five .
"F@@ irst , the idea ."
I used to think that the idea was everything .
I nam@@ ed my company I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b for how much I wor@@ ship the &quot; &quot; a@@ h@@ a ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
"But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the ex@@ ec@@ ution , ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ability , that mat@@ ter@@ ed even more than the idea ."
"I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing bo@@ x@@ er M@@ i@@ ke T@@ y@@ son on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ body has a pl@@ an , until they get p@@ un@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well ."
So much about a team &apos;s ex@@ ec@@ ution is its ability to ad@@ ap@@ t to getting p@@ un@@ ched in the face by the cu@@ st@@ om@@ er .
The cu@@ st@@ om@@ er is the true reality .
And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
Th@@ en I started looking at the business model .
D@@ o@@ es the company have a very clear p@@ ath gener@@ ating cu@@ st@@ om@@ er re@@ ven@@ ues ?
That started ri@@ sing to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ ter@@ ed most for suc@@ cess .
M@@ ay@@ be that &apos;s the most important thing ?
"And then of course , the tim@@ ing ."
Is the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
"I@@ s it early , as in , you &apos;re in adv@@ ance and you have to educ@@ ate the world ?"
Is it just right ?
"O@@ r is it too l@@ ate , and there &apos;s already too many compe@@ ti@@ tors ?"
So I tried to look very care@@ fully at these five fac@@ tors across many companies .
"And I looked across all 100 I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , and 100 non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies to try and come up with something scienti@@ fic about it ."
"So first , on these I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , the top five companies — C@@ it@@ y@@ search , C@@ ar@@ s@@ D@@ i@@ rec@@ t , G@@ o@@ T@@ o , N@@ et@@ Z@@ er@@ o , T@@ ic@@ ke@@ t@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m — those all became b@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ l@@ ar success@@ es ."
"And the five companies on the bottom — Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , In@@ si@@ der P@@ ages , M@@ y@@ Li@@ fe , D@@ es@@ k@@ top F@@ ac@@ t@@ ory , Pe@@ op@@ l@@ el@@ ink — we all had high hop@@ es for , but didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
So I tried to r@@ ank across all of those at@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ es how I felt those companies s@@ co@@ red on each of those di@@ men@@ sions .
"And then for non@@ -@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ a@@ b companies , I looked at w@@ il@@ d success@@ es , like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b and In@@ st@@ ag@@ ra@@ m and U@@ ber and Y@@ ou@@ tu@@ be and L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In ."
"And some fail@@ ures : W@@ e@@ b@@ v@@ an , K@@ o@@ z@@ m@@ o , P@@ et@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m F@@ loo@@ z and F@@ ri@@ end@@ ster ."
"The bottom companies had inten@@ se fund@@ ing , they even had business mod@@ els in some c@@ ases , but they didn &apos;t suc@@ ce@@ ed ."
"I tried to look at what fac@@ tors actually ac@@ coun@@ ted the most for suc@@ cess and fail@@ ure across all of these companies , and the res@@ ults really surpri@@ sed me ."
The number one thing was tim@@ ing .
T@@ im@@ ing ac@@ coun@@ ted for 4@@ 2 percent of the difference between suc@@ cess and fail@@ ure .
"T@@ e@@ am and ex@@ ec@@ ution came in second , and the idea , the differ@@ enti@@ ability of the idea , the uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of the idea , that actually came in third ."
"Now , this isn &apos;t absolutely defin@@ i@@ tive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much surpri@@ sed me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing ."
S@@ ome@@ times it mat@@ ter@@ ed more when it was actually tim@@ ed .
"The last two , business model and fund@@ ing , made sense to me actually ."
I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and ad@@ d one later if your cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are de@@ man@@ ding what you &apos;re creating .
"And fund@@ ing , I think as well , if you &apos;re under@@ fund@@ ed at first but you &apos;re ga@@ ining tr@@ action , esp@@ eci@@ ally in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get inten@@ se fund@@ ing ."
So now let me give you some speci@@ fic exam@@ ples about each of these .
So take a w@@ il@@ d suc@@ cess like A@@ ir@@ b@@ n@@ b that everybody kno@@ ws about .
"Well , that company was fam@@ ously pas@@ sed on by many smar@@ t invest@@ ors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to r@@ ent out a space in their home to a str@@ an@@ ger . &quot;"
"O@@ f course , people pro@@ ved that wrong ."
"But one of the reasons it suc@@ ce@@ e@@ ded , as@@ i@@ de from a good business model , a good idea , great ex@@ ec@@ ution , is the tim@@ ing ."
"That company came out right during the he@@ ight of the rec@@ es@@ sion when people really needed ex@@ tr@@ a money , and that maybe hel@@ ped people over@@ come their ob@@ j@@ ection to r@@ en@@ ting out their own home to a str@@ an@@ ger ."
S@@ ame thing with U@@ ber .
"@@ U@@ ber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great ex@@ ec@@ ution , too ."
But the tim@@ ing was so perf@@ ect for their need to get dri@@ ver@@ s into the system .
"D@@ ri@@ ver@@ s were looking for ex@@ tr@@ a money ; it was very , very important ."
"S@@ ome of our early success@@ es , C@@ it@@ y@@ search , came out when people needed we@@ b p@@ ages ."
"@@ G@@ o@@ T@@ o@@ .@@ co@@ m , which we an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed actually at TED in 199@@ 8 , was when companies were looking for cos@@ t-@@ eff@@ ective ways to get tra@@ ff@@ ic ."
"We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the tim@@ ing was probably maybe more important ."
And then some of our fail@@ ures .
"We started a company called Z@@ .@@ co@@ m , it was an on@@ line en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment company ."
"We were so exc@@ ited about it — we rais@@ ed enough money , we had a great business model , we even sig@@ ned incredi@@ bly great H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood tal@@ ent to jo@@ in the company ."
But bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and p@@ ene@@ tra@@ tion was too low in 199@@ 9@@ -@@ 200@@ 0 .
"It was too hard to watch video cont@@ ent on@@ line , you had to put co@@ dec@@ s in your bro@@ w@@ s@@ er and do all this stuff , and the company ev@@ en@@ tually went out of business in 200@@ 3 ."
"@@ Just two years later , when the co@@ de@@ c problem was sol@@ ved by A@@ do@@ be F@@ l@@ ash and when bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and p@@ ene@@ tra@@ tion cr@@ os@@ sed 50 percent in America , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be was perf@@ ec@@ tly tim@@ ed ."
"@@ Gre@@ at idea , but un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able tim@@ ing ."
"In fact , Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started ."
It wasn &apos;t even certain that that would work out .
"But that was beauti@@ fully , beauti@@ fully tim@@ ed ."
"So what I would say , in sum@@ mar@@ y , is ex@@ ec@@ ution defin@@ it@@ ely mat@@ ters a lot ."
The idea mat@@ ters a lot .
But tim@@ ing might matter even more .
And the best way to really ass@@ ess tim@@ ing is to really look at whether con@@ sum@@ ers are really ready for what you have to off@@ er them .
"And to be really , really hon@@ est about it , not be in den@@ ial about any res@@ ults that you see , because if you have something you love , you want to p@@ ush it forward , but you have to be very , very hon@@ est about that fac@@ tor on tim@@ ing ."
"As I said ear@@ li@@ er , I think star@@ tu@@ ps can change the world and make the world a better place ."
"I hope some of these in@@ si@@ ghts can maybe help you have a sli@@ gh@@ tly high@@ er suc@@ cess ra@@ ti@@ o , and th@@ us make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se ."
"Th@@ ank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience ."
( Applause )
"I &apos;d done well at school . E@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ e@@ fully en@@ ter@@ ed the stud@@ ent life of l@@ ec@@ tures , par@@ ties and tra@@ ff@@ ic c@@ one the@@ ft ."
"@@ Un@@ der@@ ne@@ ath , I was actually deep@@ ly un@@ happy , in@@ sec@@ ure and fundam@@ ent@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of fail@@ ure and of the emp@@ t@@ iness that I felt was within me ."
"I was lea@@ ving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ bl@@ ing with my ba@@ g just as I &apos;d done a hund@@ red times before , when sudd@@ en@@ ly I heard a vo@@ ice cal@@ m@@ ly ob@@ ser@@ ve , &quot; She is lea@@ ving the room . &quot;"
"I looked around , and there was no one there , but the cl@@ ar@@ ity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the com@@ ment was un@@ m@@ ist@@ a@@ k@@ able ."
&quot; She is op@@ ening the do@@ or . &quot;
This was the beginning . The vo@@ ice had ar@@ ri@@ ved .
"And the vo@@ ice per@@ si@@ sted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , n@@ ar@@ r@@ ating everything I did in the third person ."
&quot; She is going to a l@@ ec@@ ture . &quot;
"It was ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , al@@ though I did no@@ tice that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or sometimes sli@@ p@@ ped and that it oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally m@@ ir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ ex@@ pres@@ sed emo@@ tion ."
"So , for example , if I was an@@ gr@@ y and had to hi@@ de it , which I often did , being very a@@ dep@@ t at con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing how I really felt , then the vo@@ ice would sound f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated ."
"A sub@@ tle condi@@ tion@@ ing process had be@@ gu@@ n , the imp@@ lic@@ ation that normal people don &apos;t hear vo@@ ices and the fact that I did me@@ ant that something was very ser@@ i@@ ously wrong ."
I spent some time telling the colle@@ ge G@@ .@@ P@@ .
"And to be fa@@ ir , I was des@@ per@@ ate for inter@@ est and help , and I began to tell him about my str@@ an@@ ge comm@@ ent@@ ator ."
"For example , I was part of a stud@@ ent T@@ V st@@ ation that bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast news b@@ ul@@ le@@ t@@ ins around the cam@@ p@@ us , and during an ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment which was run@@ ning very l@@ ate , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , doc@@ tor , I &apos;ve got to go ."
It was at this point that ev@@ ents began to r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly over@@ take me .
"A hosp@@ ital ad@@ mis@@ sion follo@@ wed , the first of many , a di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ r@@ en@@ ia came next , and then , wor@@ st of all , a to@@ x@@ ic , t@@ or@@ men@@ ting sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hum@@ ili@@ ation and des@@ pa@@ ir about myself and my pr@@ osp@@ ects ."
"But having been enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged to see the vo@@ ice not as an experience but as a sym@@ p@@ tom , my fear and resi@@ st@@ ance to@@ wards it inten@@ si@@ fied ."
"Now ess@@ entially , this re@@ pres@@ ented taking an ag@@ gre@@ s@@ sive st@@ ance to@@ wards my own mind , a kind of psy@@ ch@@ ic civi@@ l war , and in turn this ca@@ used the number of vo@@ ices to incre@@ ase and grow pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ ely h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing ."
You see that gl@@ ass of water ?
"In effect , a v@@ ici@@ ous cy@@ cle of fear , av@@ o@@ id@@ ance , mi@@ str@@ ust and mis@@ understanding had been est@@ ab@@ li@@ shed , and this was a b@@ at@@ tle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ cap@@ able of est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ing any kind of pe@@ ace or re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"T@@ w@@ o years later , and the de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation was dra@@ ma@@ tic ."
"B@@ y now , I had the whole fr@@ en@@ z@@ i@@ ed re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : terri@@ f@@ ying vo@@ ices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que vi@@ sions , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , in@@ trac@@ table d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ ons ."
"Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age and des@@ pa@@ ir of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was sa@@ ved ."
"A bro@@ ken and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that jour@@ ney , but the person who emer@@ ged was a survi@@ v@@ or and would ul@@ tim@@ ately grow into the person I was de@@ st@@ ined to be ."
"M@@ any people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the mem@@ ories grow p@@ ale and fa@@ int in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the people who &apos;ve hel@@ ped me ."
I believe that E@@ le@@ an@@ or can get through this .
"S@@ ome@@ times , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as l@@ ate as M@@ ay , but sum@@ mer always comes ev@@ en@@ tually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully cre@@ d@@ it those good and gener@@ ous people who f@@ ou@@ ght with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to w@@ el@@ come me back from that ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ed , lon@@ ely place ."
"Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the vo@@ ices appe@@ ared so h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this resp@@ ect , a v@@ ital first step was learning to se@@ par@@ ate out a met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical mean@@ ing from what I &apos;d pre@@ vi@@ ously inter@@ pre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al tru@@ th ."
"So for example , vo@@ ices which thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to att@@ ack my home I learned to inter@@ pre@@ t as my own sense of fear and in@@ sec@@ urity in the world , rather than an ac@@ tual , ob@@ j@@ ective d@@ an@@ ger ."
"Now at first , I would have beli@@ ev@@ ed them ."
"I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to prot@@ ect them from what I thought was a gen@@ u@@ ine thre@@ at from the vo@@ ices ."
"It was like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t m@@ ess with me ."
"I &apos;ve got a pl@@ astic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ate@@ gic ."
"It was ar@@ med with this knowledge that ul@@ tim@@ ately I would ga@@ ther together my sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed self , each fra@@ g@@ ment re@@ pres@@ ented by a different vo@@ ice , gra@@ du@@ ally with@@ dra@@ w from all my medic@@ ation , and re@@ turn to psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side ."

"This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way ."

I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ h@@ y .
O@@ r is it photograp@@ h@@ y ?
"Because , of course , this is a photograp@@ h that you can &apos;t take with your cam@@ era ."
"@@ Y@@ et , my inter@@ est in photograp@@ h@@ y started as I got my first digital cam@@ era at the age of 15 ."
"It mi@@ x@@ ed with my ear@@ li@@ er pas@@ sion for dra@@ wing , but it was a bit different , because using the cam@@ era , the process was in the plan@@ ning instead ."
"And when you take a photograp@@ h with a cam@@ era , the process ends when you press the tri@@ gger ."
So to me it felt like photograp@@ h@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
"So I wanted to create something different , something where the process star@@ ts when you press the tri@@ gger ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os like this : con@@ struc@@ tion going on along a bus@@ y ro@@ ad .
But it has an un@@ exp@@ ected tw@@ ist .
"And des@@ p@@ ite that , it re@@ ta@@ ins a level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"O@@ r phot@@ os like these — both d@@ ark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common go@@ al of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ al@@ ism ."
"When I say re@@ al@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ al@@ ism ."
"Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tu@@ red some@@ how as a photograp@@ h ."
P@@ h@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the tr@@ ick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea than about cap@@ tur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the tr@@ ick that makes it look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ?
Is it something about the de@@ ta@@ ils or the col@@ ors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What cre@@ ates the ill@@ us@@ ion ?
S@@ ome@@ times the per@@ spec@@ tive is the ill@@ us@@ ion .
"But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o-@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al surface ."
"It &apos;s not really what is re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks re@@ al@@ is@@ tic really ."
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different piec@@ es of reality and put it together to create al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
"Here we have three perf@@ ec@@ tly imag@@ in@@ able physical ob@@ jects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world ."
"But comb@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al , like it could ex@@ ist ."
"But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t ."
"So we tr@@ ick our bra@@ ins , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t ac@@ cept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense ."
And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photograp@@ h@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different re@@ ali@@ ties .
"So the things that make a photograp@@ h look re@@ al@@ is@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our d@@ a@@ ily lives ."
"But when comb@@ ining photograp@@ h@@ s , this is really important to consi@@ der , because o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se it just looks wrong some@@ how ."
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to fol@@ low to achi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic result .
"As you can see , these images ar@@ en &apos;t really special ."
"But comb@@ ined , they can create something like this ."
So the first ru@@ le is that phot@@ os comb@@ ined should have the same per@@ spec@@ tive .
"S@@ econ@@ dly , phot@@ os comb@@ ined should have the same type of light ."
And these two images both ful@@ f@@ ill these two requ@@ i@@ re@@ ments — sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it im@@ possible to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different images beg@@ in and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it im@@ possible to say how the image actually was comp@@ os@@ ed .
"So by mat@@ ching color , con@@ tr@@ ast and bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness in the bor@@ d@@ ers between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hi@@ c def@@ ects like dep@@ th of field , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ ise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ d@@ ers between the different images and make it look like one single image , des@@ p@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of l@@ ay@@ ers basically ."
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ape and the lo@@ wer part is what &apos;s man@@ i@@ pul@@ ated .
But this image is actually enti@@ rely comp@@ os@@ ed of photograp@@ h@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
"I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s eas@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comp@@ r@@ om@@ ise with the ideas in your head ."
But it does requ@@ ire a lot of plan@@ ning .
"And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had sever@@ al months to pl@@ an it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le basically ."
"So for example , the fish was cap@@ tu@@ red on a fi@@ sh@@ ing tri@@ p ."
The sho@@ res are from a different loc@@ ation .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tu@@ red in a st@@ one p@@ it .
"And ye@@ ah , I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dis@@ h ."
"So to achi@@ eve a re@@ al@@ is@@ tic result , I think it comes down to plan@@ ning ."
"It always star@@ ts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch , an idea ."
Th@@ en it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photograp@@ h@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
"And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the phot@@ os , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ al@@ is@@ tic ."
"So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imag@@ ination ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
The P@@ ri@@ me M@@ in@@ ist@@ er of I@@ c@@ el@@ and has re@@ sig@@ ned .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the b@@ ru@@ t@@ al S@@ y@@ ri@@ an dic@@ t@@ ator B@@ as@@ ha@@ r Al@@ -@@ A@@ s@@ sa@@ d has also got off@@ sh@@ ore companies .
"There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tra@@ il that lea@@ ds back to P@@ resi@@ dent V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir P@@ u@@ ti@@ n of R@@ us@@ si@@ a vi@@ a his close chil@@ d@@ hood friend , who happens to be a top c@@ el@@ li@@ st ."
And there will be a lot of r@@ ich individu@@ als out there and others who will be ner@@ v@@ ous about the next set of stories and the next set of lea@@ ked doc@@ um@@ ents .
"Now , this s@@ ounds like the p@@ lot of a sp@@ y th@@ r@@ ill@@ er or a Jo@@ h@@ n G@@ ris@@ ha@@ m nov@@ el ."
"It seems very dist@@ ant from you , me , ordinary people ."
Why should we care about this ?
"But the tru@@ th is that if r@@ ich and powerful individu@@ als are able to keep their money off@@ sh@@ ore and not pay the ta@@ x@@ es that they should , it means that there is less money for v@@ ital public serv@@ ices like heal@@ th@@ care , education , ro@@ ads ."
"Now , for my organiz@@ ation G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this ex@@ pos@@ é has been ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al ."
We have the world &apos;s media and political lead@@ ers talking about how individu@@ als can use off@@ sh@@ ore sec@@ rec@@ y to hi@@ de and dis@@ gu@@ ise their as@@ se@@ ts — something we have been talking about and ex@@ pos@@ ing for a dec@@ ade .
"Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world b@@ aff@@ ling and conf@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ sh@@ ore world works ."
I like to think of it a bit like a R@@ us@@ si@@ an dol@@ l .
"It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ sh@@ ore works , M@@ os@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fe@@ wer American c@@ li@@ ents ."
"I think if we saw lea@@ ks from the C@@ ay@@ man Is@@ l@@ ands or even from D@@ el@@ aw@@ are or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a , you would see many more c@@ ases and exam@@ ples l@@ in@@ king back to Amer@@ ic@@ ans ."
It has allo@@ wed sc@@ am@@ m@@ ers to ri@@ p off v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able invest@@ ors .
This is the sort of behavior that aff@@ ects all of us .
How does this actually work ?
So what we did is we s@@ ent in an under@@ co@@ ver inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator to 1@@ 3 M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an la@@ w fir@@ ms .
"O@@ ur inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator posed as an Afr@@ ican min@@ ist@@ er who wanted to move s@@ us@@ p@@ ect fun@@ ds into the United States to buy a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a j@@ et ."
"These were all pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary me@@ et@@ ings , and n@@ one of the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers took us on as a c@@ li@@ ent and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system ."
It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual c@@ ases .
"This is about how a system works , that en@@ tr@@ en@@ ches cor@@ ru@@ ption , ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ ion , po@@ ver@@ ty and inst@@ ability ."
"And in order to t@@ ack@@ le this , we need to change the game ."
"This may see@@ m like do@@ om and g@@ loo@@ m , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be r@@ ich and powerful individu@@ als ."
"But as a natural op@@ tim@@ ist , I do see that we are starting to get some change ."
"One of the things that is sa@@ d is that , actually , the U@@ S is l@@ ag@@ ging behind ."
"So we &apos;d really want to see the P@@ an@@ am@@ a lea@@ ks , this huge pe@@ e@@ k into the off@@ sh@@ ore world , be used as a way of op@@ ening up in the U@@ S and around the world ."
"For us at G@@ lob@@ al W@@ it@@ ness , this is a moment for change ."
"We need business lead@@ ers to stand up and say , &quot; S@@ ec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;"
"We need political lead@@ ers to recogn@@ ize the problem , and to comm@@ it to changing the la@@ w to open up this sort of sec@@ rec@@ y ."
"T@@ o@@ gether , we can end the sec@@ rec@@ y that is curr@@ ently allo@@ wing ta@@ x ev@@ as@@ ion , cor@@ ru@@ ption , money la@@ under@@ ing to fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h ."
"@@ Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : J@@ u@@ li@@ an , w@@ el@@ come ."

C@@ an that possi@@ bly be true ?
"@@ J@@ u@@ li@@ an A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge : Yeah , can it possi@@ bly be true ?"
It &apos;s a wor@@ ry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts is able to re@@ le@@ ase more of that type of information than the rest of the world press comb@@ ined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people re@@ le@@ ase the doc@@ um@@ ents ?
And how do you sec@@ ure their priv@@ acy ?
"@@ J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — cl@@ ass@@ ical wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ wers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us ."
"So we use this st@@ ate@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art enc@@ r@@ yp@@ tion to b@@ oun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hi@@ de tra@@ ils , p@@ ass it through leg@@ al j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions like S@@ we@@ den and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those leg@@ al prot@@ ec@@ tions ."
"We get information in the ma@@ il , the reg@@ ular pos@@ t@@ al ma@@ il , enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a reg@@ ular news organiz@@ ation , form@@ at it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about gi@@ ant dat@@ ab@@ ases of information — re@@ le@@ ase it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the in@@ ev@@ it@@ able leg@@ al and political att@@ ac@@ ks ."
"C@@ A : So you make an eff@@ ort to en@@ sure the doc@@ um@@ ents are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate , but you actually almost never know who the identi@@ ty of the sour@@ ce is ?"
"@@ J@@ A : That &apos;s right , ye@@ ah . V@@ ery r@@ ar@@ ely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we de@@ st@@ ro@@ y that information as so@@ on as possible ."
( P@@ h@@ one r@@ ing ) God d@@ am@@ n it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A asking what the co@@ de is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
"So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually ."
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this doc@@ um@@ ent up ...
So this was a story in K@@ en@@ y@@ a a few years ago .
C@@ an you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ ro@@ ll Re@@ port .
This was a secre@@ t intellig@@ ence re@@ port comm@@ is@@ sion@@ ed by the K@@ en@@ y@@ an government after its elec@@ tion in 200@@ 4 .
"P@@ ri@@ or to 200@@ 4 , K@@ en@@ y@@ a was r@@ ul@@ ed by D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p Mo@@ i for about 1@@ 8 years ."
He was a so@@ ft dic@@ t@@ ator of K@@ en@@ y@@ a .
"And when K@@ i@@ ba@@ k@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of for@@ ces that were trying to cle@@ an up cor@@ ru@@ ption in K@@ en@@ y@@ a — they comm@@ is@@ sion@@ ed this re@@ port , spent about two million p@@ ounds on this and an as@@ soci@@ ated re@@ port ."
"And then the government s@@ at on it and used it for political le@@ verage on Mo@@ i , who was the ric@@ h@@ est man — still is the ric@@ h@@ est man — in K@@ en@@ y@@ a ."
It &apos;s the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ ra@@ il of K@@ en@@ y@@ an jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism .
"So I went there in 200@@ 7 , and we manag@@ ed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the elec@@ tion — the national elec@@ tion , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 8 ."
"When we re@@ le@@ as@@ ed that re@@ port , we did so three days after the new pre@@ si@@ dent , K@@ i@@ ba@@ k@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to cle@@ an out , D@@ an@@ i@@ el ar@@ a@@ p Mo@@ i , so this re@@ port then became a de@@ ad al@@ b@@ at@@ r@@ oss around P@@ resi@@ dent K@@ i@@ ba@@ k@@ i &apos;s nec@@ k ."
"C@@ A : And — I mean , to cut a long story sh@@ ort — word of the re@@ port lea@@ ked into K@@ en@@ y@@ a , not from the off@@ ici@@ al media , but in@@ direc@@ tly , and in your op@@ in@@ ion , it actually shi@@ f@@ ted the elec@@ tion ."
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front p@@ age of the G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then prin@@ ted in all the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding countries of K@@ en@@ y@@ a , in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ian and S@@ outh Afr@@ ican press ."
And so it came in from the outside .
"And that , after a couple of days , made the K@@ en@@ y@@ an press feel sa@@ fe to talk about it ."
"And it ran for 20 ni@@ ghts stra@@ ight on K@@ en@@ y@@ an T@@ V , shi@@ f@@ ted the v@@ ote by 10 percent , ac@@ cor@@ ding to a K@@ en@@ y@@ an intellig@@ ence re@@ port , which changed the result of the elec@@ tion ."
"C@@ A : W@@ ow , so your lea@@ k really sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally changed the world ?"
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p from this B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad air@@ stri@@ ke video .
"The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a sh@@ ort c@@ li@@ p ."
"This is — this is inten@@ se material , I should war@@ n you ."
"@@ R@@ a@@ di@@ o : ... just f@@ uc@@ k@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; e@@ m just open &apos; e@@ m up ."

"@@ we need to move , time now !@@ "
"All right , we just eng@@ ag@@ ed all eight individu@@ als ."
"@@ Yeah , we see two bir@@ ds &#91; he@@ lic@@ op@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing ."
R@@ o@@ ger . I got &apos; e@@ m .
"T@@ w@@ o-@@ S@@ i@@ x , this is T@@ w@@ o-@@ S@@ i@@ x , we &apos;re mo@@ bi@@ le ."
"O@@ op@@ s , I &apos;m sor@@ ry . What was going on ?"
"@@ God d@@ am@@ n it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ h@@ a . I h@@ it &apos; e@@ m ."
"C@@ A : So , what was the imp@@ act of that ?"
J@@ A : The imp@@ act on the people who worked on it was se@@ v@@ ere .
We en@@ ded up sen@@ ding two people to B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad to fur@@ ther research that story .
So this is just the first of three att@@ ac@@ ks that oc@@ cur@@ red in that sc@@ en@@ e .
"C@@ A : So , I mean , 11 people died in that att@@ ack , right , inclu@@ ding two Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . T@@ w@@ o Re@@ u@@ ters emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es , two young children were w@@ oun@@ ded ."
There were between 1@@ 8 and 2@@ 6 people k@@ illed all together .
CA : And re@@ le@@ as@@ ing this ca@@ used wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tra@@ ge .
"What was the key el@@ ement of this that actually ca@@ used the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?"
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess people can see the gr@@ oss di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in force .
"You have guys wal@@ king in a rela@@ x@@ ed way down the street , and then an Ap@@ ac@@ he he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter sitting up at one k@@ il@@ ome@@ ter fir@@ ing 30@@ -@@ m@@ illi@@ me@@ ter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ ells on everyone — looking for any exc@@ use to do so — and k@@ illing people re@@ sc@@ u@@ ing the w@@ oun@@ ded ."
And there was two jour@@ n@@ ali@@ sts involved that c@@ lear@@ ly wer@@ en &apos;t in@@ sur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their ful@@ l@@ -@@ time job .
"C@@ A : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intellig@@ ence anal@@ y@@ st , B@@ ra@@ d@@ le@@ y M@@ an@@ ning , ar@@ re@@ sted , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he conf@@ ess@@ ed in a ch@@ at room to have lea@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 cl@@ as@@ si@@ fied U.S. em@@ bas@@ s@@ y c@@ ab@@ les ."
"I mean , did he ?"
J@@ A : We have den@@ i@@ ed re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving those c@@ ab@@ les .
"He has been char@@ ged , about five days ago , with ob@@ tain@@ ing 1@@ 50@@ ,000 c@@ ab@@ les and re@@ le@@ as@@ ing 50 ."
"Now , we had re@@ le@@ as@@ ed , early in the year , a c@@ able from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ a@@ vi@@ k U.S. em@@ bas@@ s@@ y , but this is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily connected ."
"I mean , I was a known vi@@ sit@@ or of that em@@ bas@@ s@@ y ."
"C@@ A : I mean , if you did re@@ ce@@ ive thousands of U.S. em@@ bas@@ s@@ y di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ tic c@@ ab@@ les ..@@ ."
"@@ J@@ A : We would have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things re@@ ve@@ al what the true state of , say , A@@ ra@@ b govern@@ ments are like , the true human@@ -@@ ri@@ ghts ab@@ uses in those govern@@ ments ."
"If you look at dec@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fied c@@ ab@@ les , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there ."
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more bro@@ ad@@ ly about this .
"I mean , in gener@@ al , what &apos;s your ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ y ?"
Why is it right to enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge lea@@ king of secre@@ t information ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achi@@ eve re@@ form ."
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
"So information that organiz@@ ations are sp@@ ending economic eff@@ ort into con@@ ce@@ al@@ ing , that &apos;s a really good sig@@ nal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organiz@@ ations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are sp@@ ending work to con@@ ce@@ al it ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in prac@@ tice , and that &apos;s what the history of jour@@ n@@ al@@ ism is ."
"C@@ A : But are there ris@@ ks with that , either to the individu@@ als con@@ cer@@ ned or in@@ de@@ ed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequ@@ ence ?"
J@@ A : N@@ ot that we have seen with anything we have re@@ le@@ as@@ ed .
"I mean , we have a har@@ m im@@ m@@ un@@ iz@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y ."
We have a way of de@@ al@@ ing with information that has sort of personal — person@@ ally identi@@ f@@ ying information in it .
"But there are le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate secre@@ ts — you know , your rec@@ or@@ ds with your doc@@ tor ; that &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate secre@@ t — but we deal with wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ wers that are coming forward that are really sort of w@@ ell@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ated ."
CA : So they are w@@ ell@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ated .
"And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the par@@ ent of someone wh@@ ose son is out ser@@ ving the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an inc@@ enti@@ ve to put out ."
It shows a U.S. sol@@ di@@ er l@@ augh@@ ing at people d@@ ying .
"That gi@@ ves the im@@ pression , has given the im@@ pression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. sol@@ di@@ ers are in@@ human people ."
"A@@ c@@ tually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that ."
"But remember , the people in B@@ a@@ gh@@ d@@ ad , the people in I@@ ra@@ q , the people in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day ."
So it &apos;s not going to change their op@@ in@@ ion . It &apos;s not going to change their per@@ cep@@ tion .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
"It will change the per@@ cep@@ tion and op@@ in@@ ion of the people who are p@@ ay@@ ing for it all , and that &apos;s our hope ."
CA : So you found a way to sh@@ ine light into what you see as these sort of d@@ ark secre@@ ts in companies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
"But do you see any ir@@ ony in the fact that , in order for you to sh@@ ine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sour@@ ces ?"
"@@ J@@ A : N@@ ot really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents yet ."
We don &apos;t have sour@@ ces who are dis@@ si@@ d@@ ents on other sour@@ ces .
"S@@ h@@ ould they come forward , that would be a tr@@ ick@@ y situ@@ ation for us , but we &apos;re pre@@ sum@@ ably ac@@ ting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ ell@@ ed to contin@@ ue our mis@@ sion , not to scre@@ w it up ."
"C@@ A : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m cur@@ ious as to the op@@ in@@ ion in the TED audience ."
"You know , there might be a couple of vie@@ ws of W@@ i@@ ki@@ L@@ ea@@ ks and of J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"You know , her@@ o — people &apos;s her@@ o — br@@ ing@@ ing this important light ."
D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker .
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the her@@ o view ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s got the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ker view ?
"@@ J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some ."
"C@@ A : It &apos;s a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , a so@@ ft c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
"Now here &apos;s something that you ha@@ ven &apos;t yet lea@@ ked , but I think for TED you are ."
"I mean it &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?"
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sa@@ m@@ ple of what we do sort of every day .
"So l@@ ate last year — in No@@ v@@ em@@ ber last year — there was a ser@@ ies of well b@@ low@@ ou@@ ts in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but not quite as big ."
"And we got a re@@ port — a sort of engine@@ ering anal@@ ys@@ is into what happened — saying that , in fact , sec@@ urity gu@@ ar@@ ds from some ri@@ v@@ al , vari@@ ous compe@@ ting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tr@@ uc@@ ks there and b@@ lo@@ wn them up ."
"And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , et@@ c . , et@@ c ."
"And the engine@@ ering re@@ port had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extre@@ me@@ ly difficult doc@@ um@@ ent for us ."
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical that maybe it was a compe@@ ting oil fir@@ m just sort of playing the issue up .
"So under that bas@@ is , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , we &apos;re s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this thing ."
"We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?"
"The material looks good , it fe@@ els right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a le@@ tter just this week from the company who wrote it , wan@@ ting to tr@@ ack down the sour@@ ce — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , we want to tr@@ ack down the sour@@ ce . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more ."
"What doc@@ um@@ ent is it , preci@@ se@@ ly , you &apos;re talking about ?"
C@@ an you show that you had leg@@ al au@@ th@@ ority over that doc@@ um@@ ent ?
Is it really y@@ ours ? &quot; &quot; So they s@@ ent us this scre@@ en sho@@ t with the au@@ th@@ or in the M@@ ic@@ r@@ os@@ o@@ ft W@@ ord I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
"This is like one of our me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of identi@@ f@@ ying , of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write le@@ t@@ ters ."
CA : Yeah . H@@ a@@ ve you had information from inside B@@ P ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of ser@@ ious fund@@ rais@@ ing and engine@@ ering eff@@ ort ."
So our pub@@ lic@@ ation rate over the past few months has been sort of min@@ im@@ iz@@ ed while we &apos;re re@@ -@@ engine@@ ering our back systems for the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al public inter@@ est that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
"I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organiz@@ ation , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting en@@ or@@ m@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ wer dis@@ clos@@ ures of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information ."
"C@@ A : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k , basically jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and / or the fund@@ ing of jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ sted people ."
"I mean , we &apos;re an organiz@@ ation that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will deal with the high@@ est national sec@@ urity stuff , and then lo@@ wer sec@@ urity c@@ ases ."
CA : So help us understand a bit about you person@@ ally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 3@@ 7 different s@@ cho@@ ols .
C@@ an that be right ?
"@@ J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a c@@ ult , so the comb@@ ination between the two ..@@ ."
"( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist might say that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for bre@@ e@@ ding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia ."
"@@ J@@ A : What , the movie business ?"
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a h@@ ac@@ ker at an early age and ran into the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties early on ."
"@@ J@@ A : Well , I was a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist ."
"You know , I was a very young jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st at an early age ."
"I wrote a mag@@ az@@ ine , was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted for it when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er ."
So you have to be care@@ ful with h@@ ac@@ ker .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a me@@ th@@ od that can be dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed for vari@@ ous things .
"@@ Un@@ fortun@@ ately , at the moment , it &apos;s mos@@ tly dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ed by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an ma@@ fi@@ a in order to ste@@ al your grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts ."
"So this ph@@ r@@ ase is not , not as nice as it used to be ."
"C@@ A : Yeah , well , I cer@@ tain@@ ly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ al@@ ing anyone &apos;s grand@@ mother &apos;s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t , but what about your c@@ ore val@@ ues ?"
C@@ an you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some in@@ ci@@ dent in your life that hel@@ ped de@@ ter@@ mine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the in@@ ci@@ dent .
"But the c@@ ore val@@ ues : well , cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ."
"And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other cap@@ able , gener@@ ous men that have been in my life ."
"C@@ A : C@@ ap@@ able , gener@@ ous men do not create v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ; they n@@ ur@@ ture v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms ?"
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the n@@ ur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms , which is to poli@@ ce per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ators of cri@@ me ."
And so that is something that has been in my charac@@ ter for a long time .
"C@@ A : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minut@@ e , the story : what happened in I@@ c@@ el@@ and ?"
"You basically publi@@ shed something there , ran into tr@@ ou@@ ble with a b@@ ank , then the news serv@@ ice there was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted from run@@ ning the story ."
"In@@ stead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side ."
That made you very high@@ -@@ pro@@ fi@@ le in I@@ c@@ el@@ and . What happened next ?
"@@ J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know ."
I@@ c@@ el@@ and went through this fin@@ anci@@ al cri@@ sis .
It was the har@@ d@@ est h@@ it of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sec@@ tor was 10 times the G@@ D@@ P of the rest of the economy .
"A@@ n@@ y@@ way , so we re@@ le@@ ase this re@@ port in J@@ u@@ ly last year ."
"And the national T@@ V st@@ ation was in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : in@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion lan@@ ded on the news des@@ k , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;"
"Well , we just show the we@@ b@@ site instead , for all that time , as a f@@ ill@@ er , and we became very fam@@ ous in I@@ c@@ el@@ and , went to I@@ c@@ el@@ and and sp@@ o@@ ke about this issue ."
"And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c poli@@ tici@@ ans and some other inter@@ national leg@@ al exper@@ ts , we put together a new sort of p@@ ack@@ age of leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation for I@@ c@@ el@@ and to sort of become an off@@ sh@@ ore ha@@ ven for the free press , with the str@@ on@@ gest jour@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ tic prot@@ ec@@ tions in the world , with a new No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for free@@ dom of spe@@ ech ."
"I@@ c@@ el@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to ta@@ p into the system ."
"And just a mon@@ th ago , this was pas@@ sed by the I@@ c@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ anim@@ ously ."
CA : W@@ ow .
"( Applause ) L@@ ast question , J@@ u@@ li@@ an ."
"When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us wat@@ ching B@@ i@@ g B@@ ro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be play@@ ed for either way ?"
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
"I mean , there &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pres@@ su@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize free@@ dom of spe@@ ech leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation and transp@@ ar@@ ency leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation around the world — within the E@@ .@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States ."
Wh@@ ich way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
"That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of eff@@ ort , we can shi@@ ft it one way or the other ."
"C@@ A : Well , it looks like I &apos;m re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting the audience &apos;s op@@ in@@ ion to say , J@@ u@@ li@@ an , be care@@ ful , and all power to you ."
"@@ J@@ A : Thank you , Ch@@ r@@ is . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )"
"As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my care@@ er since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , and the best example I have is a car@@ to@@ on in The New Yor@@ ker a couple of years ago ."
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great bl@@ ess@@ ing as a form@@ er pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"N@@ ot only am I famili@@ ar with the 50 st@@ ates in the United States , but also my wi@@ fe and I have vi@@ s@@ ited more than 1@@ 4@@ 5 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had ful@@ l@@ -@@ time progra@@ ms in 80 n@@ ations on Earth ."
"And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the me@@ et the king or the pre@@ si@@ dent , but we also me@@ et the v@@ ill@@ ag@@ ers who live in the most re@@ m@@ ote areas of Africa ."
"So our over@@ all comm@@ it@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to prom@@ ote human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equ@@ i@@ v@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , str@@ an@@ ge@@ ly , not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed quite often , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reasons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ irst of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of religi@@ ous scri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures , in the B@@ i@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ ur@@ an and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ c@@ end@@ ant posi@@ tions in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the ch@@ ur@@ ches and in the mos@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these rules to make sure that women are ordin@@ ar@@ ily re@@ leg@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary position com@@ par@@ ed to men in the eyes of God .
This is a very ser@@ ious problem . It &apos;s ordin@@ ar@@ ily not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed .
"A number of years ago , in the year 200@@ 0 , I had been a B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st , a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st for 7@@ 0 years — I tell you , I still teach S@@ und@@ ay school every S@@ und@@ ay ; I &apos;ll be teach@@ ing this S@@ und@@ ay as well — but the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st Con@@ ven@@ tion in the year 200@@ 0 decided that women should play a secon@@ d@@ ary position , a sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent position to men ."
"So they issu@@ ed an e@@ dic@@ t , in effect , that pre@@ v@@ ents women from being pri@@ est@@ s , pa@@ st@@ ors , de@@ ac@@ ons in the ch@@ ur@@ ch , or ch@@ ap@@ la@@ ins in the mil@@ it@@ ary , and if a woman teach@@ es a cl@@ ass@@ room in a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st se@@ min@@ ary , they cannot teach if a bo@@ y is in the room , because you can find ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , there &apos;s over 30@@ ,000 ver@@ ses in the B@@ i@@ ble , that say that a woman sh@@ ouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so for@@ th ."
But the bas@@ ic thing is the scri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ c@@ end@@ ant position .
"That is an all@@ -@@ per@@ v@@ as@@ ive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ us@@ ive h@@ us@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for inst@@ ance , wan@@ ts to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equ@@ al in the eyes of God , why should I tre@@ at them as equ@@ als myself ?"
Why should I pay them equ@@ al pay for doing the same kind of work ?
"The other very ser@@ ious b@@ light that ca@@ uses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive res@@ ort to violence , and that is incre@@ as@@ ing tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously around the world ."
"In the United States of America , for inst@@ ance , we have had an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of po@@ or people , mos@@ tly black people and min@@ ori@@ ties , by p@@ utting them in pri@@ son ."
"When I was in off@@ ice as govern@@ or of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Amer@@ ic@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"N@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ ven@@ f@@ old incre@@ ase .
"And since I left the Wh@@ ite H@@ ouse , there &apos;s been an 8@@ 0@@ 0 percent incre@@ ase in the number of women who are black who are in pri@@ son ."
We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death pen@@ al@@ ty that is a developed country .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ on@@ g@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ us@@ ive in all el@@ em@@ ents of human ri@@ ghts in enc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ging the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
"We &apos;re in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a now , and I fi@@ gu@@ red out the other day that C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a has spent four billion dollars in conv@@ ic@@ ting 1@@ 3 people for the death pen@@ al@@ ty ."
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 30@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to s@@ end a person to be ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted ."
"N@@ e@@ br@@ as@@ k@@ a this week just pas@@ sed a la@@ w abo@@ li@@ sh@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty , because it cos@@ ts so much . ( Applause ) So the res@@ ort to violence and ab@@ use of po@@ or people and hel@@ pl@@ ess people is another c@@ ause of the incre@@ ase in ab@@ use of women ."
"L@@ et me just go down a very few ab@@ uses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fa@@ ir@@ ly bri@@ ef , because I have a lim@@ ited amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation .
"@@ G@@ en@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ation is hor@@ ri@@ ble and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very so@@ on in her life , her gen@@ it@@ als are completely cut away by a so@@ -@@ called c@@ ut@@ ter who has a ra@@ z@@ or b@@ la@@ de and , in a non@@ -@@ st@@ eri@@ li@@ zed way , they re@@ move the ex@@ ter@@ i@@ or parts of a woman &apos;s gen@@ it@@ al@@ ia ."
"And sometimes , in more extre@@ me c@@ ases but not very r@@ are c@@ ases , they se@@ w the ori@@ f@@ ice up so the girl can just ur@@ in@@ ate or men@@ str@@ u@@ ate ."
"And then later , when she gets mar@@ ried , the same c@@ ut@@ ter goes in and op@@ ens the ori@@ f@@ ice up so she can have sex ."
"This is not a r@@ are thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ yp@@ t , for inst@@ ance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fem@@ al@@ es that live in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in that way ."
"In some countries , it &apos;s more than 9@@ 8 percent of the women are cut that way before they re@@ ach mat@@ urity ."
This is a hor@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"A@@ no@@ ther very ser@@ ious thing is hon@@ or k@@ ill@@ ings , where a family with mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation , again , of a ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ ture — there &apos;s nothing in the Q@@ ur@@ an that m@@ and@@ ates this — will ex@@ ec@@ ute a girl in their family if she is r@@ ap@@ ed or if she mar@@ ri@@ es a man that her father does not appro@@ ve , or sometimes even if she w@@ ear@@ s in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate c@@ lo@@ thing ."
"And this is done by mem@@ bers of her own family , so the family becomes m@@ ur@@ der@@ ers when the girl br@@ ings so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gr@@ ace to the family ."
"A@@ n anal@@ ys@@ is was done in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t not so long ago by the United N@@ ations and it showed that 7@@ 5 percent of these m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers of a girl are per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ated by the father , the un@@ cle or the bro@@ ther , but 25 percent of the m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers are con@@ duc@@ ted by women ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rel@@ ates to women partic@@ ularly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king it &apos;s called no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays ."
There were about 12@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from Africa into s@@ la@@ very in the New World back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now living in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of St@@ ate now has a m@@ and@@ ate from Con@@ gre@@ ss to give a re@@ port every year , and the St@@ ate D@@ e@@ part@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 00@@ ,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national bor@@ d@@ ers every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 80 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 60@@ ,000 people are living in human b@@ on@@ d@@ age , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is loc@@ ated and where I teach at E@@ m@@ ory Uni@@ versity , they have between 20@@ 0 and 30@@ 0 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the n@@ ation because of that .
"A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a has the bus@@ i@@ est air@@ port in the world , and they also have a lot of pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers that come from the S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n H@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here ."
"If a bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner wan@@ ts to buy a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ sk@@ in@@ ned girl br@@ ings sever@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the tot@@ al dru@@ g tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ lan@@ t@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
"So this is another very ser@@ ious problem , and the bas@@ ic problem is pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , because there &apos;s not a wh@@ ore@@ house in America that &apos;s not known by the local off@@ ici@@ als , the local po@@ lic@@ em@@ en , or the chi@@ ef of poli@@ ce or the may@@ or and so for@@ th ."
"And this lea@@ ds to one of the wor@@ st problems , and that is that women are b@@ ou@@ ght incre@@ as@@ ingly and put into se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very in all countries in the world ."
S@@ we@@ den has got a good appro@@ ach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , S@@ we@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted if they are in se@@ x@@ ual s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ners and the p@@ im@@ ps and the m@@ ale cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and — ( Applause ) — pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every m@@ ale ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ leg@@ al sex tra@@ de , 25 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , I@@ re@@ land , I &apos;ve already said S@@ we@@ den , Fr@@ ance , and other countries are moving now to@@ wards this so@@ -@@ called S@@ we@@ dis@@ h model ."
That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
We have two great institu@@ tions in this country that all of us ad@@ m@@ ire : our mil@@ it@@ ary and our great univer@@ sity system .
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults take place ."
"The last re@@ port I got , there were 2@@ 6@@ ,000 se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults that took place in the mil@@ it@@ ary — 2@@ 6@@ ,000 ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , and the reason is that the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ at@@ tal@@ ion in the Ar@@ my or a company in the M@@ ar@@ ines — the comm@@ anding off@@ ic@@ er has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to pr@@ os@@ ec@@ ute a r@@ ap@@ ist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ults are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
"A@@ b@@ out one out of four girls who en@@ ter American univer@@ si@@ ties will be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted before she gra@@ du@@ ates , and this is now getting a lot of pub@@ lic@@ ity , par@@ ti@@ ally because of my book , but other things , and so 8@@ 9 univer@@ si@@ ties in America are now con@@ dem@@ ned by the D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of E@@ duc@@ ation under T@@ it@@ le I@@ X because the off@@ ici@@ als of the univer@@ si@@ ties are not taking care of the women to prot@@ ect them from se@@ x@@ ual as@@ sa@@ ult ."
"The D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of J@@ us@@ tice says that more than half of the r@@ ap@@ es on a colle@@ ge cam@@ p@@ us take place by ser@@ ial r@@ ap@@ ists , because outside of the univer@@ sity system , if they r@@ ape somebody , they &apos;ll be pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted , but when they get on a univer@@ sity cam@@ p@@ us , they can r@@ ape with imp@@ unity ."
They &apos;re not pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very ser@@ ious about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the l@@ ack of equ@@ al pay for equ@@ al work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for ful@@ l@@ -@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
"So we &apos;ve made some pro@@ gre@@ ss , par@@ ti@@ ally because I was pre@@ si@@ dent and so for@@ th — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no pro@@ gre@@ ss made , so it &apos;s been just about 2@@ 3 or 2@@ 4 percent difference for the last 15 years ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 50@@ 0 companies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 50@@ 0 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like n@@ ation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d World W@@ ar .
"S@@ ome@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying over@@ head d@@ rop@@ ping b@@ om@@ bs on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have dr@@ ones that att@@ ack people and so for@@ th ."
We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the S@@ econ@@ d World W@@ ar .
"There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t dro@@ p a b@@ om@@ b , we didn &apos;t la@@ unch a mis@@ si@@ le , we didn &apos;t fir@@ e a b@@ ul@@ let ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the res@@ ort to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures are what ca@@ uses , are the bas@@ ic ca@@ uses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more bas@@ ic c@@ ause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a d@@ am@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly ac@@ cep@@ ts the priv@@ il@@ e@@ ged position that we oc@@ c@@ up@@ y , and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ par@@ ate but equ@@ al had exist@@ ed ."
"@@ R@@ ac@@ ial di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation , leg@@ ally , had exist@@ ed for 100 years , from 18@@ 6@@ 5 at the end of the W@@ ar B@@ e@@ tween the States , the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar , all the way up to the 19@@ 60@@ s , when L@@ y@@ n@@ don Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son got the b@@ ills pas@@ sed for equ@@ al ri@@ ghts ."
"But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that r@@ ac@@ ial di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation was o@@ kay , but they st@@ ay@@ ed qu@@ i@@ et , because they en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed the priv@@ il@@ e@@ g@@ es of better j@@ ob@@ s , uni@@ que access to j@@ ury du@@ ty , better s@@ cho@@ ols , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that ex@@ ists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a priv@@ il@@ e@@ ged position ."
"And it &apos;s very difficult to get the maj@@ ority of men who control the univer@@ sity system , the maj@@ ority of men that control the mil@@ it@@ ary system , the maj@@ ority of men that control the govern@@ ments of the world , and the maj@@ ority of men that control the great religi@@ ons ."
So what is the bas@@ ic thing that we need to do today ?
"I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful n@@ ations like this one , and where you come from , Europe and so for@@ th , who have in@@ flu@@ ence and who have free@@ dom to speak and to act , need to take the respon@@ si@@ bility on y@@ ourselves to be more for@@ ce@@ ful in de@@ man@@ ding an end to r@@ ac@@ ial di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation against girls and women all over the world ."
The average woman in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ augh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated and so for@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even go down to de@@ ta@@ il about that .
"But I hope that out of this con@@ fer@@ ence , that every woman here will get your h@@ us@@ b@@ ands to realize that these ab@@ uses on the colle@@ ge cam@@ p@@ uses and the mil@@ it@@ ary and so for@@ th and in the future job market , need to prot@@ ect your d@@ augh@@ ters and your grand@@ d@@ augh@@ ters ."
"I have 12 grand@@ children , four children , and 10 gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ children , and I think often about them and about the p@@ light that they will face in America , not only if they lived in E@@ g@@ yp@@ t or a fore@@ ign country , in having equ@@ al ri@@ ghts , and I hope that all of you will jo@@ in me in being a cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on for women and girls around the world and prot@@ ect their human ri@@ ghts ."

"When I was a stud@@ ent here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d in the 197@@ 0s , the future of the world was b@@ lea@@ k ."
The population expl@@ os@@ ion was un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
G@@ lob@@ al fam@@ ine was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able .
A cancer ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic ca@@ used by chem@@ ic@@ als in the environment was going to sh@@ or@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id ra@@ in was f@@ all@@ ing on the fore@@ sts .
The des@@ er@@ t was adv@@ anc@@ ing by a m@@ ile or two a year .
"The oil was run@@ ning out , and a nuclear win@@ ter would fin@@ ish us off ."
"N@@ one of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ingly , if you look at what actually happened in my li@@ fe@@ time , the average per@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come of the average person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ ju@@ sted for in@@ fl@@ ation , has tri@@ pl@@ ed ."
Li@@ f@@ esp@@ an is up by 30 percent in my li@@ fe@@ time .
Ch@@ il@@ d mor@@ tal@@ ity is down by tw@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds .
P@@ er@@ -@@ cap@@ it@@ a food produc@@ tion is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has dou@@ bl@@ ed .
"@@ How did we achi@@ eve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?"
How did we achi@@ eve that ?
How did we become the only species that becomes more pr@@ os@@ per@@ ous as it becomes more pop@@ ul@@ ous ?
"The size of the b@@ lo@@ b in this grap@@ h re@@ pres@@ ents the size of the population , and the level of the grap@@ h re@@ pres@@ ents G@@ D@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a ."
"I think to answer that question you need to understand how human be@@ ings bring together their bra@@ ins and en@@ able their ideas to comb@@ ine and re@@ comb@@ ine , to me@@ et and , in@@ de@@ ed , to m@@ ate ."
"In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex ."
I want you to imagine how we got from making ob@@ jects like this to making ob@@ jects like this .
These are both real ob@@ jects .
One is an A@@ che@@ u@@ le@@ an hand a@@ x@@ e from half a million years ago of the kind made by H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s .
The other is obvi@@ ously a computer m@@ ouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and sh@@ ape to an un@@ can@@ ny degre@@ e .
"I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost im@@ possible ."
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
"They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their simil@@ ar@@ ity is not that interesting ."
It just t@@ ells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
"The differ@@ ences are what inter@@ est me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ v@@ ar@@ ying design for about a million years — from on@@ e-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago ."
"H@@ om@@ o er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s made the same to@@ ol for 30@@ ,000 gener@@ ations ."
"O@@ f course there were a few changes , but tools changed s@@ lo@@ wer than sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons in those days ."
"There was no pro@@ gre@@ ss , no innovation ."
"It &apos;s an extra@@ ordinary ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on , but it &apos;s true ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the ob@@ ject on the right is ob@@ so@@ le@@ te after five years .
"And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the ob@@ ject on the left is made from one sub@@ st@@ ance ."
"The ob@@ ject on the right is made from a conf@@ ection of different sub@@ st@@ ances , from si@@ lic@@ on and met@@ al and pl@@ astic and so on ."
"And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ection of different ideas , the idea of pl@@ astic , the idea of a l@@ as@@ er , the idea of tran@@ si@@ st@@ ors ."
They &apos;ve all been comb@@ ined together in this technology .
"And it &apos;s this comb@@ ination , this c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative technology , that in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me , because I think it &apos;s the secre@@ t to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world ."
"My body &apos;s an acc@@ um@@ ulation of ideas too : the idea of sk@@ in cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of li@@ ver cells ."
They &apos;ve come together .
"@@ How does evolution do c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative , comb@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al things ?"
"Well , it uses se@@ x@@ ual re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"In an as@@ ex@@ ual species , if you get two different mu@@ ta@@ tions in different cre@@ at@@ ures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other ."
One goes ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t for the other to survi@@ ve .
"But if you have a se@@ x@@ ual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to in@@ her@@ it both mu@@ ta@@ tions from different l@@ ine@@ ages ."
So what sex does is it en@@ ab@@ les the individual to dra@@ w up@@ on the gene@@ tic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not con@@ fin@@ ed to its own l@@ ine@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cul@@ tural evolution as sex is having in bio@@ logical evolution ?
"And I think the answer is ex@@ change , the ha@@ bit of ex@@ changing one thing for another ."
It &apos;s a uni@@ que human fe@@ ature .
No other animal does it .
You can teach them in the lab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to do a little bit of ex@@ change — and in@@ de@@ ed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals — But the ex@@ change of one ob@@ ject for another never happens .
"As A@@ d@@ am S@@ m@@ ith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a do@@ g make a fa@@ ir ex@@ change of a b@@ one with another do@@ g . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without ex@@ change ."
"You can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture ."
"@@ Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es , k@@ ill@@ er wh@@ al@@ es , these kinds of cre@@ at@@ ures , they have culture ."
They teach each other tradi@@ tions which are h@@ an@@ ded down from par@@ ent to off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing .
"In this case , ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es teach@@ ing each other how to cr@@ ack nu@@ ts with roc@@ ks ."
"But the difference is that these cul@@ tures never exp@@ and , never grow , never acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate , never become comb@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no ex@@ change of ideas ."
Ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ e tro@@ op@@ s have different cul@@ tures in different tro@@ op@@ s .
There &apos;s no ex@@ change of ideas between them .
And why does ex@@ change ra@@ ise living stand@@ ar@@ ds ?
"Well , the answer came from D@@ a@@ vi@@ d R@@ ic@@ ar@@ do in 18@@ 1@@ 7 ."
"And here is a St@@ one A@@ ge ver@@ sion of his story , al@@ though he told it in terms of tra@@ de between countries ."
A@@ d@@ am takes four hours to make a spe@@ ar and three hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
O@@ z takes one h@@ our to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an a@@ x@@ e .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and a@@ x@@ es than A@@ d@@ am .
He doesn &apos;t need A@@ d@@ am .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and a@@ x@@ es .
"Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and A@@ d@@ am make two a@@ x@@ es , and then they tra@@ de , then they will each have sa@@ ved an h@@ our of work ."
"And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better A@@ d@@ am is going to get at making a@@ x@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars ."
So the ga@@ ins from tra@@ de are only going to grow .
"And this is one of the beau@@ ties of ex@@ change , is it actually cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more speci@@ aliz@@ ation , which cre@@ ates the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m for more ex@@ change and so on ."
A@@ d@@ am and O@@ z both sa@@ ved an h@@ our of time .
"That is pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity , the sa@@ ving of time in sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying your needs ."
A@@ s@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to provi@@ de for yourself an h@@ our of read@@ ing light this ev@@ ening to read a book by .
"If you had to start from sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side ."
You find a sh@@ e@@ ep . You k@@ ill it . You get the f@@ at out of it .
"You r@@ en@@ der it down . You make a c@@ and@@ le , et@@ c@@ . et@@ c ."
How long is it going to take you ? Q@@ u@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to ear@@ n an h@@ our of read@@ ing light if you &apos;re on the average w@@ age in B@@ rit@@ ain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
"B@@ ack in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight secon@@ ds on the average w@@ age to ac@@ qu@@ ire that much light ."
"And that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds of pr@@ os@@ per@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half secon@@ ds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qu@@ ire another good or serv@@ ice ."
"And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to ear@@ n that amount of light on the average w@@ age ."
"B@@ ack in 18@@ 0@@ 0 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to ear@@ n a c@@ and@@ le that could bur@@ n for an h@@ our ."
"In other words , the average person on the average w@@ age could not aff@@ ord a c@@ and@@ le in 18@@ 0@@ 0 ."
"@@ G@@ o back to this image of the a@@ x@@ e and the m@@ ouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The st@@ one a@@ x@@ e was made by someone for h@@ im@@ self ."
It was self-@@ suff@@ ici@@ ency .
We call that po@@ ver@@ ty these days .
But the ob@@ ject on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? H@@ und@@ re@@ ds ? Th@@ ous@@ ands ?
"You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions ."
"Because you &apos;ve got to inclu@@ de the man who gre@@ w the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was dr@@ illing for oil , which was going to be made into the pl@@ astic , et@@ c ."
"They were all working for me , to make a m@@ ouse for me ."
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achi@@ ev@@ ed as a species .
"In the old days , if you were r@@ ich , you literally had people working for you ."
That &apos;s how you got to be r@@ ich ; you emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed them .
L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
"They made his sil@@ ly out@@ f@@ its , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his sil@@ ly ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ les , or whatever ."
He had 4@@ 9@@ 8 people to pre@@ p@@ are his d@@ in@@ ner every night .
"But a moder@@ n tou@@ ri@@ st going around the p@@ al@@ ace of V@@ er@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pic@@ tures , he has 4@@ 9@@ 8 people doing his d@@ in@@ ner t@@ on@@ ight too ."
"They &apos;re in bi@@ st@@ ro@@ s and c@@ af@@ es and re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants and sh@@ op@@ s all over P@@ ar@@ is , and they &apos;re all ready to ser@@ ve you at an h@@ our &apos;s no@@ tice with an exc@@ ell@@ ent me@@ al that &apos;s probably got high@@ er qu@@ ality than L@@ ou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had ."
"And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other ."
We &apos;re able to dra@@ w up@@ on speci@@ aliz@@ ation and ex@@ change to ra@@ ise each other &apos;s living stand@@ ar@@ ds .
"Now , you do get other animals working for each other too ."
An@@ ts are a cl@@ as@@ si@@ c example ; wor@@ kers work for qu@@ e@@ ens and qu@@ e@@ ens work for wor@@ kers .
"But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the col@@ ony ."
There &apos;s no working for each other across the col@@ on@@ ies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ produc@@ tive divi@@ sion of lab@@ or .
"That is to say , they speci@@ aliz@@ e with resp@@ ect to re@@ produc@@ tion ."
The qu@@ een does it all .
"In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that ."
"It &apos;s the one thing we in@@ si@@ st on doing for ourselves , is re@@ produc@@ tion ."
"( Laughter ) E@@ ven in Eng@@ land , we don &apos;t leave re@@ produc@@ tion to the Q@@ u@@ een ."
( Applause ) So when did this ha@@ bit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
"Well , I think , probably , the ol@@ d@@ est ver@@ sion of this is probably the se@@ x@@ ual divi@@ sion of lab@@ or ."
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work m@@ ale for fem@@ ale and fem@@ ale for m@@ ale .
"In all h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er soci@@ e@@ ties today , there &apos;s a for@@ ag@@ ing divi@@ sion of lab@@ or between , on the whole , h@@ un@@ ting m@@ al@@ es and ga@@ ther@@ ing fem@@ al@@ es ."
"It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a dist@@ inc@@ tion between speci@@ aliz@@ ed ro@@ les for m@@ al@@ es and fem@@ al@@ es ."
And the beau@@ ty of this system is that it bene@@ f@@ its both si@@ des .
"The woman kno@@ ws that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gg@@ ing ro@@ ots to share with men in ex@@ change for me@@ at — she kno@@ ws that all she has to do to get access to prot@@ e@@ in is to di@@ g some ex@@ tr@@ a ro@@ ots and tra@@ de them for me@@ at ."
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sting h@@ un@@ t and try and k@@ ill a war@@ th@@ o@@ g .
And the man kno@@ ws that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gg@@ ing to get ro@@ ots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he k@@ ills a war@@ th@@ o@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both si@@ des ra@@ ise each other &apos;s stand@@ ar@@ ds of living through the se@@ x@@ ual divi@@ sion of lab@@ or .
"When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this ."
They were a high@@ ly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a high@@ ly intellig@@ ent species .
"Th@@ e@@ ir bra@@ ins on average , by the end , were bigger than y@@ ours and mine in this room today ."
They were imag@@ in@@ ative . They bur@@ i@@ ed their de@@ ad .
"They had language , probably , because we know they had the F@@ O@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gen@@ e of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d ."
And so it looks like they probably had l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic sk@@ ills .
They were br@@ illi@@ ant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a se@@ x@@ ual divi@@ sion of lab@@ or .
There &apos;s no evidence of ga@@ ther@@ ing behavior by fem@@ al@@ es .
It looks like the fem@@ al@@ es were co@@ oper@@ ative h@@ un@@ ters with the men .
"And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is ex@@ change between grou@@ ps , because the ob@@ jects that you find in N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al re@@ ma@@ ins , the tools they made , are always made from local materi@@ als ."
"For example , in the C@@ a@@ uc@@ as@@ us there &apos;s a site where you find local N@@ e@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al tools ."
They &apos;re always made from local ch@@ er@@ t .
"In the same val@@ le@@ y there are moder@@ n human re@@ ma@@ ins from about the same d@@ ate , 30@@ ,000 years ago , and some of those are from local ch@@ er@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away ."
"And when human be@@ ings began moving ob@@ jects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ changing between grou@@ ps ."
T@@ ra@@ de is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
Pe@@ ople for@@ get that . Pe@@ ople think of tra@@ de as a moder@@ n thing .
E@@ x@@ change between grou@@ ps has been going on for a hund@@ red thous@@ and years .
"And the ear@@ li@@ est evidence for it c@@ ro@@ ps up some@@ where between 80 and 1@@ 20@@ ,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long dist@@ ances in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia ."
You also see se@@ ash@@ ells — as discovered by a team here in O@@ x@@ for@@ d — moving 12@@ 5 miles in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ g@@ er@@ ia .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ changing between grou@@ ps .
And that will have led to speci@@ aliz@@ ation .
How do you know that lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance movement means tra@@ de rather than m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion ?
"Well , you look at moder@@ n h@@ un@@ ter ga@@ ther@@ ers like ab@@ orig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ ar@@ ried for st@@ one a@@ x@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t Is@@ a , which was a qu@@ ar@@ ry o@@ w@@ ned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ a@@ do@@ on tri@@ be ."
"They tra@@ ded them with their neigh@@ b@@ ors for things like st@@ in@@ gr@@ ay bar@@ bs , and the con@@ sequ@@ ence was that st@@ one a@@ x@@ es en@@ ded up over a large part of Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia ."
"So lon@@ g@@ -@@ dist@@ ance movement of tools is a sig@@ n of tra@@ de , not m@@ ig@@ ra@@ tion ."
"What happens when you cut people off from ex@@ change , from the ability to ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ e ?"
"And the answer is that not only do you s@@ low down techno@@ logical pro@@ gre@@ ss , you can actually th@@ row it into re@@ ver@@ se ."
A@@ n example is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
"When the sea level r@@ ose and T@@ as@@ man@@ ia became an is@@ land 10@@ ,000 years ago , the people on it not only experi@@ enc@@ ed s@@ lo@@ wer pro@@ gre@@ ss than people on the ma@@ in@@ land , they actually experi@@ enc@@ ed re@@ gre@@ ss ."
"They gave up the ability to make st@@ one tools and fi@@ sh@@ ing equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment and c@@ lo@@ thing because the population of about 4@@ ,000 people was simply not large enough to ma@@ in@@ tain the speci@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ ills nec@@ ess@@ ary to keep the technology they had ."
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were pl@@ on@@ ked on a des@@ er@@ t is@@ land .
"@@ How many of the things in our po@@ c@@ kets could we contin@@ ue to make after 10@@ ,000 years ?"
"It didn &apos;t happen in T@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a del F@@ u@@ e@@ go — similar is@@ land , similar people ."
"The reason : because T@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a del F@@ u@@ e@@ go is se@@ par@@ ated from S@@ outh America by a much n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer stra@@ ight , and there was tra@@ ding cont@@ act across that stra@@ ight throu@@ gh@@ out 10@@ ,000 years ."
The T@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ ans were is@@ ol@@ ated .
"@@ G@@ o back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it ."
"In the case of the st@@ one a@@ x@@ e , the man who made it knew how to make it ."
But who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse ?
"N@@ o@@ body , literally no@@ body ."
There is no@@ body on the planet who kno@@ ws how to make a computer m@@ ouse .
I mean this quite ser@@ i@@ ously .
The pre@@ si@@ dent of the computer m@@ ouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just kno@@ ws how to run a company .
"The person on the as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dr@@ ill an oil well to get oil out to make pl@@ astic , and so on ."
"We all know little b@@ its , but n@@ one of us kno@@ ws the whole ."
"I am of course quot@@ ing from a fam@@ ous es@@ say by Le@@ on@@ ard Re@@ ad , the econom@@ ist in the 19@@ 50@@ s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ en@@ ci@@ l &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pen@@ ci@@ l came to be made , and how no@@ body kno@@ ws even how to make a pen@@ ci@@ l , because the people who as@@ se@@ m@@ ble it don &apos;t know how to mine grap@@ h@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to f@@ ell tre@@ es and that kind of thing ."
"And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through ex@@ change and speci@@ aliz@@ ation , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand ."
It &apos;s not the same with language .
W@@ ith language we have to trans@@ f@@ er ideas that we understand with each other .
"But with technology , we can actually do things that are be@@ y@@ ond our cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties ."
We &apos;ve gone be@@ y@@ ond the cap@@ ac@@ ity of the human mind to an extra@@ ordinary degre@@ e .
"And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the de@@ b@@ ate about I@@ .@@ Q@@ . , about whether some grou@@ ps have high@@ er I@@ .@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other grou@@ ps ."
It &apos;s completely ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant .
"What &apos;s re@@ lev@@ ant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ oper@@ ating , not how cle@@ ver the individu@@ als are ."
So we &apos;ve created something called the coll@@ ective brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the network .
We &apos;re the neur@@ ons in this brain .
"It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the me@@ e@@ ting and m@@ ating of ideas between them , that is ca@@ using techno@@ logical pro@@ gre@@ ss , incre@@ m@@ ent@@ ally , bit by bit ."
"H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , bad things happen ."
"And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terri@@ ble things ."
There will be war@@ s ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers .
"A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure ."
"But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connec@@ tions people are making , and the ability of ideas to me@@ et and to m@@ ate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will adv@@ ance , and ther@@ e@@ fore living stand@@ ar@@ ds will adv@@ ance ."
"Because through the cl@@ ou@@ d , through c@@ ro@@ w@@ d sour@@ c@@ ing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ it@@ es but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them me@@ et and m@@ ate , we are su@@ rely acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the rate of innovation ."
Thank you .

I am a phot@@ o-@@ based arti@@ st from R@@ us@@ si@@ a .
"I foc@@ us on bal@@ anc@@ ing mean@@ ing@@ ful message , a@@ es@@ the@@ tic , beau@@ ty , comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion , some ir@@ ony , and arti@@ fac@@ ts ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is nam@@ ed D@@ es@@ per@@ ate R@@ om@@ an@@ tics ."
"They &apos;re my arti@@ fac@@ ts , or pa@@ int@@ ings from pre@@ -@@ R@@ ap@@ ha@@ el@@ it@@ es B@@ ro@@ ther@@ hood Eng@@ land mid@@ -@@ 19@@ th century ."
"I took the pain@@ ting and gi@@ f@@ ted new , cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary mean@@ ing talking about issu@@ es which are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ding me in R@@ us@@ si@@ a , cap@@ tur@@ ing people who are non@@ -@@ mod@@ els but have an interesting story ."
"This bo@@ y is a prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al d@@ ancer , only 12 years old , but at secon@@ d@@ ary school , he hi@@ des his d@@ anc@@ ing cl@@ as@@ ses and is w@@ ear@@ ing the m@@ ask of b@@ ru@@ tal@@ ity , trying to be un@@ ited with the rest of his cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es like a stor@@ m tro@@ op@@ er has no person@@ ality ."
"But this bo@@ y has go@@ als and dre@@ am@@ s but hi@@ des it to be soci@@ ally ac@@ cep@@ ted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , esp@@ eci@@ ally in R@@ us@@ si@@ a ."
N@@ ext por@@ tra@@ it inter@@ pre@@ tation is met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ic .
"And this is N@@ i@@ k@@ it@@ a , a sec@@ urity gu@@ ard from one of the b@@ ars in St@@ . Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g ."
"He li@@ kes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; &quot; quot@@ ing H@@ ul@@ k from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him an@@ gr@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) S@@ ome@@ times , in my project , I would take the pain@@ ting and give it new mean@@ ing and new t@@ emp@@ tation about it ."
"S@@ ome@@ times , I would comp@@ are fac@@ ial fe@@ at@@ ures and playing with words : ir@@ ony , I@@ r@@ on M@@ an , ir@@ on@@ ing man ."
"( Laughter ) Th@@ rou@@ gh the arti@@ fac@@ ts , I bring social issu@@ es which sur@@ rou@@ nd me in R@@ us@@ si@@ a into the conversa@@ tion ."
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing fact about mar@@ ri@@ age in R@@ us@@ si@@ a , that most of the 1@@ 8 , 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old girls are already ready , and dre@@ am to get mar@@ ried ."
"We &apos;re ta@@ u@@ ght from chil@@ d@@ hood , success@@ ful mar@@ ri@@ age means success@@ ful life , so most of the girls kind of fi@@ ght to get a good h@@ us@@ b@@ and ."
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 2@@ 7 years old .
"For R@@ us@@ si@@ an society , I &apos;m an old ma@@ id and hop@@ el@@ ess to ever get mar@@ ried ."
"That &apos;s why you see me in a M@@ ex@@ ican fi@@ gh@@ ter m@@ ask , in the we@@ d@@ ding dre@@ ss , all des@@ per@@ ate in my gar@@ den ."
"But remember , ir@@ ony is the key , and this is actually to mo@@ tiv@@ ate girls to fi@@ ght for go@@ als , for dre@@ am@@ s , and change st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es ."
B@@ e bra@@ ve . B@@ e ir@@ on@@ ic — it hel@@ ps .
B@@ e fun@@ ny and create some ma@@ gic .
( Applause )
My name is A@@ m@@ it .
"And 1@@ 8 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I p@@ it@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and art to my b@@ oss who &apos;s actually here , and she allo@@ wed me to do it ."
And it took 1@@ 8 months .
"A lot of fun , ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 1@@ 7 very interesting mus@@ e@@ um@@ s from n@@ ine countries ."
But I &apos;m going to foc@@ us on the dem@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
"I think my personal story is expl@@ ain@@ ed very simply on the sli@@ de , and it &apos;s access ."
And I gre@@ w up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s and these ar@@ t@@ works .
"And so when I started trav@@ eling and going to these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s , I started learning a lot ."
"And while working at Google , I tried to put this des@@ ire to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together ."
"So we form@@ ed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this ."
I &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since la@@ unch .
"So , simple : you come to Goog@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ P@@ ro@@ j@@ ec@@ t@@ .@@ com@@ ."
You look around at all these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s here .
"You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ M@@ A , the H@@ er@@ m@@ it@@ age , the R@@ i@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh ."
"I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es , the M@@ et@@ rop@@ ol@@ it@@ an Mus@@ e@@ um of Ar@@ t in New York ."
T@@ w@@ o ways of going in — very simple .
"C@@ lic@@ k and , ban@@ g , you &apos;re in this mus@@ e@@ um ."
"It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ om@@ b@@ ay , M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , it doesn &apos;t really matter ."
"You move around , you have fun ."
You want to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate around the mus@@ e@@ um ?
"O@@ p@@ en the pl@@ an up , and , in one c@@ lic@@ k , j@@ um@@ p ."
"You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or ."
K@@ e@@ ep going . H@@ a@@ ve fun .
E@@ x@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Th@@ an@@ ks . I ha@@ ven &apos;t come to the best part .
"( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my fav@@ or@@ ite pa@@ int@@ ings , &quot; &quot; The H@@ ar@@ v@@ est@@ ers &quot; &quot; by P@@ i@@ e@@ ter B@@ ru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the M@@ et ."
I see this pl@@ us sig@@ n .
"If the mus@@ e@@ um has given us the image , you c@@ lic@@ k on it ."
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information .
"For those of you who are tru@@ ly interested in art , you can c@@ lic@@ k this — but I &apos;m going to c@@ lic@@ k this off right now ."
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tu@@ red in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
"So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ."
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can z@@ oo@@ m around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his ex@@ pression is pr@@ ic@@ el@@ ess .
But then you really want to go deep .
"And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here ."
"And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That s@@ ounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started no@@ tic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something ."
"I did a little research , sp@@ o@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ ac@@ ts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a s@@ tic@@ k on S@@ h@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day ."
And ap@@ par@@ ently it was quite pop@@ ular .
"I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it ."
"Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"Now just to give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , I &apos;m going to z@@ oo@@ m out so you really see what you get ."
"Here is where we were , and this is the pain@@ ting ."
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
"So now let &apos;s just quickly j@@ um@@ p into the Mo@@ M@@ A , again in New York ."
"So another one of my fav@@ or@@ it@@ es , &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about fin@@ ding de@@ ta@@ ils ."
But what if you want to see br@@ ush st@@ ro@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an G@@ o@@ gh actually created this ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece ?
You z@@ oo@@ m in . You really go in .
"I &apos;m going to go to one of my fav@@ or@@ ite parts in this pain@@ ting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ ac@@ ks ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before ."
I &apos;m going to show you my other fav@@ or@@ ite fe@@ ature .
"There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time ."
This is the real c@@ ool part . It &apos;s called C@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ tions .
"A@@ ny one of you , any@@ body — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re r@@ ich , if you &apos;re po@@ or , if you have a f@@ anc@@ y house — doesn &apos;t matter ."
You can go and create your own mus@@ e@@ um on@@ line — create your own coll@@ ection across all these images .
"@@ V@@ ery simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The P@@ o@@ wer of Z@@ oo@@ m — you can just z@@ oo@@ m around ."
"This is &quot; &quot; The A@@ m@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the N@@ ational G@@ all@@ ery ."
"You can an@@ n@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , s@@ end it to your friends and really get a conversa@@ tion going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ st@@ er@@ piec@@ es ."
"So I think , in con@@ cl@@ us@@ ion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google ."
"It doesn &apos;t , in my op@@ in@@ ion , even come from the mus@@ e@@ um@@ s ."
I probably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these arti@@ sts .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bl@@ ing experience in this .
"I mean , I hope in this digital medi@@ um that we do j@@ us@@ tice to their ar@@ t@@ work and re@@ present it proper@@ ly on@@ line ."
"And the bi@@ ggest question I get asked no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays is , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a mus@@ e@@ um ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no ."
It &apos;s to sup@@ ple@@ ment the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er .
"That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , wr@@ iting nov@@ els — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of stor@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ n@@ i ."
"But before I go there , ple@@ ase allow me to share with you g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of my personal story ."
"I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical sh@@ ape , the cir@@ cle , so throu@@ gh@@ out my talk , you will come across sever@@ al cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , Fr@@ ance to T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish parents ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got se@@ par@@ ated , and I came to T@@ ur@@ key with my mo@@ m ."
"F@@ rom then on , I was rais@@ ed as a single child by a single mother ."
"Now in the early 197@@ 0s , in An@@ k@@ ar@@ a , that was a bit un@@ us@@ ual ."
"O@@ ur neigh@@ bor@@ hood was full of large famili@@ es , where fa@@ thers were the he@@ ads of h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , so I gre@@ w up seeing my mother as a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce@@ e in a pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l environment ."
"In fact , I gre@@ w up ob@@ ser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood ."
"O@@ n the one hand was my mother , a w@@ ell@@ -@@ educ@@ ated , sec@@ ular , moder@@ n , we@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ iz@@ ed , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman ."
"O@@ n the other hand was my grand@@ mother , who also took care of me and was more sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual , less educ@@ ated and defin@@ it@@ ely less ra@@ tional ."
This was a woman who read co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ ounds to see the future and m@@ el@@ ted le@@ ad into my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous sh@@ ap@@ es to f@@ end off the evi@@ l ey@@ e .
"M@@ any people vi@@ s@@ ited my grand@@ mother , people with se@@ v@@ ere ac@@ ne on their fac@@ es or war@@ ts on their hands ."
"E@@ ach time , my grand@@ mother would ut@@ ter some words in Ar@@ ab@@ ic , take a red app@@ le and sta@@ b it with as many r@@ ose th@@ or@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to re@@ move ."
"Th@@ en one by one , she would enc@@ ir@@ cle these th@@ or@@ ns with d@@ ark ink ."
"A week later , the patient would come back for a follo@@ w@@ -@@ up exam@@ ination ."
"Now , I &apos;m aw@@ are that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of sch@@ ol@@ ars and scientists , but the tru@@ th is , of all the people who vi@@ s@@ ited my grand@@ mother for their sk@@ in condi@@ tions , I did not see anyone go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed ."
I asked her how she did this . W@@ as it the power of p@@ ra@@ ying ?
"In respon@@ se she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , p@@ ra@@ ying is eff@@ ective , but also be@@ w@@ are of the power of cir@@ cl@@ es . &quot; &quot; F@@ rom her , I learned , am@@ on@@ g@@ st many other things , one very preci@@ ous l@@ ess@@ on — that if you want to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a b@@ le@@ m@@ ish or the human s@@ ou@@ l , all you need to do is to sur@@ rou@@ nd it with th@@ ick w@@ alls ."
It will d@@ ry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cul@@ tural cir@@ cle .
We all do .
"We &apos;re born into a certain family , n@@ ation , class ."
"But if we have no connec@@ tion what@@ so@@ ever with the wor@@ l@@ ds be@@ y@@ ond the one we take for gr@@ an@@ ted , then we too run the risk of dr@@ ying up inside ."
"O@@ ur imag@@ ination might sh@@ r@@ ink ; our hear@@ ts might d@@ win@@ dle , and our human@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we st@@ ay for too long inside our cul@@ tural co@@ co@@ ons ."
"O@@ ur friends , neigh@@ b@@ ors , colle@@ ag@@ ues , family — if all the people in our in@@ ner cir@@ cle re@@ se@@ m@@ ble us , it means we are sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded with our m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r image ."
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in T@@ ur@@ key is to co@@ ver m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors with v@@ el@@ v@@ et or to h@@ an@@ g them on the w@@ alls with their bac@@ ks fac@@ ing out .
It &apos;s an old E@@ ast@@ er@@ n tradi@@ tion based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not heal@@ thy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own re@@ fl@@ ection .
"I@@ r@@ on@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; comm@@ unities of the like@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the gre@@ at@@ est d@@ ang@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ aliz@@ ed world ."
"And it &apos;s happening every@@ where , am@@ ong li@@ ber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ a@@ ti@@ ves , ag@@ n@@ os@@ tics and beli@@ e@@ ver@@ s , the r@@ ich and the po@@ or , E@@ ast and W@@ est ali@@ ke ."
"We t@@ end to form clu@@ st@@ ers based on simil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produce st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about other clu@@ st@@ ers of people ."
"In my op@@ in@@ ion , one way of tran@@ sc@@ ending these cul@@ tural gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of stor@@ y@@ telling ."
"S@@ t@@ ories cannot demo@@ lish fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ unch hol@@ es in our mental w@@ alls ."
"And through those hol@@ es , we can get a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the other , and sometimes even like what we see ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise n@@ ot@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in ke@@ ep@@ ing a personal jour@@ nal .
"In re@@ tr@@ osp@@ ect , I think she was sli@@ gh@@ tly wor@@ ried about my s@@ an@@ ity ."
"I was con@@ st@@ antly telling stories at home , which was good , ex@@ cept I told this to imag@@ in@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good ."
"I was an int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with co@@ lo@@ red cra@@ y@@ ons and ap@@ o@@ logi@@ zing to ob@@ jects when I b@@ um@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my d@@ ay@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day experi@@ ences and emo@@ tions ."
"What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terri@@ bly bor@@ ing , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself ."
"In@@ stead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened ."
And th@@ us began my li@@ fe@@ -@@ long pas@@ sion for wr@@ iting fic@@ tion .
"So from the very beginning , fic@@ tion for me was less of an au@@ to@@ bio@@ grap@@ h@@ ical man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation than a tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ental jour@@ ney into other lives , other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties ."
And ple@@ ase be@@ ar with me : I &apos;ll dra@@ w a cir@@ cle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
"So from this small , super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous , mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ class neigh@@ bor@@ hood of my grand@@ mother , I was z@@ o@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , inter@@ national school &#91; in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d &#93; , where I was the only T@@ ur@@ k ."
"It was here that I had my first en@@ coun@@ ter with what I call the &quot; &quot; re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our cl@@ ass@@ room , there were children from all na@@ tion@@ ali@@ ties , yet this di@@ versity did not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily le@@ ad to a cos@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ an , e@@ g@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an cl@@ ass@@ room demo@@ cr@@ acy ."
"In@@ stead , it gener@@ ated an at@@ m@@ osp@@ here in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of something lar@@ ger ."
"We were like a min@@ i@@ ature United N@@ ations , which was fun , ex@@ cept wh@@ en@@ ever something ne@@ ga@@ tive , with reg@@ ar@@ ds to a n@@ ation or a religi@@ on , took place ."
"The child who re@@ pres@@ ented it was mo@@ c@@ ked , ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ed and b@@ ul@@ li@@ ed end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly ."
"And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a mil@@ it@@ ary ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my na@@ tion@@ ality ne@@ arly k@@ illed the P@@ op@@ e , and T@@ ur@@ key got z@@ er@@ o poin@@ ts in &#91; the &#93; Eu@@ ro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test ."
( Laughter ) I s@@ ki@@ p@@ ped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of bec@@ om@@ ing a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first ta@@ st@@ e of cul@@ tural st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es there .
"The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night E@@ x@@ press , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qu@@ i@@ red how many ci@@ gar@@ et@@ t@@ es a day I s@@ mo@@ ked , because they thought all T@@ ur@@ ks were he@@ av@@ y s@@ mo@@ kers , and they wonder@@ ed at what age I would start co@@ ver@@ ing my ha@@ ir ."
"I came to learn that these were the three main st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about my country : poli@@ tics , ci@@ gar@@ et@@ t@@ es and the ve@@ il ."
"A@@ f@@ ter S@@ pa@@ in , we went to J@@ ord@@ an , G@@ er@@ many and An@@ k@@ ar@@ a again ."
"E@@ very@@ where I went , I felt like my imag@@ ination was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me ."
"S@@ t@@ ories gave me a sense of cen@@ ter , contin@@ u@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se l@@ ac@@ ked ."
"In my mid@@ -@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I moved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore ."
"I lived in a very vi@@ br@@ ant , di@@ ver@@ se neigh@@ bor@@ hood where I wrote sever@@ al of my nov@@ els ."
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake h@@ it in 199@@ 9 .
"When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stop@@ ped me in my trac@@ ks ."
"There was the local gro@@ c@@ er there — a gr@@ um@@ p@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t s@@ ell al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ g@@ in@@ als ."
He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a run@@ ning down her che@@ e@@ ks .
"I wat@@ ched the man open a p@@ ack of ci@@ gar@@ et@@ t@@ es with tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ing hands and off@@ er one to her , and that is the image of the night of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in my mind today — a con@@ serv@@ ative gro@@ c@@ er and a cr@@ ying trans@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ te s@@ mo@@ king together on the si@@ de@@ walk ."
"In the face of death and de@@ struc@@ tion , our m@@ und@@ an@@ e differ@@ ences ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours ."
"But I &apos;ve always beli@@ ev@@ ed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us ."
"I &apos;m not saying that fic@@ tion has the mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , but when we are read@@ ing a good nov@@ el , we leave our small , co@@ zy ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ as@@ ed against ."
"S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s colle@@ ge in B@@ os@@ ton , then M@@ ic@@ hi@@ g@@ an ."
"I experi@@ enc@@ ed this , not so much as a ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical shi@@ ft , as a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic one ."
I started wr@@ iting fic@@ tion in Eng@@ lish .
"I &apos;m not an im@@ m@@ ig@@ r@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the comm@@ ute between langu@@ ages gi@@ ves me the chan@@ ce to re@@ create myself ."
"I love wr@@ iting in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emo@@ tional , and I love wr@@ iting in Eng@@ lish , which to me is very mathema@@ tical and cer@@ e@@ br@@ al ."
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
"For me , like millions of other people around the world today , Eng@@ lish is an ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red language ."
"When you &apos;re a l@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a contin@@ u@@ ous and per@@ pe@@ tual f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion ."
"As l@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , cr@@ ack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a ga@@ p between the mind and the t@@ on@@ gu@@ e ."
And that ga@@ p is very in@@ tim@@ id@@ ating .
"But if we man@@ age not to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also sti@@ mul@@ ating ."
And this is what I discovered in B@@ os@@ ton — that f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion was very sti@@ mul@@ ating .
"At this stage , my grand@@ mother , who had been wat@@ ching the course of my life with incre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , started to inclu@@ de in her d@@ a@@ ily p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get mar@@ ried so that I could se@@ t@@ tle down once and for all ."
"And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get mar@@ ried ."
"( Laughter ) But instead of se@@ t@@ t@@ ling down , I went to A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a ."
"And since my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started comm@@ u@@ ting between A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of ear@@ th that couldn &apos;t be more different ."
"I gu@@ ess one part of me has always been a n@@ om@@ ad , phys@@ ically and sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ally ."
"S@@ t@@ ories ac@@ company me , ke@@ ep@@ ing my piec@@ es and mem@@ ories together , like an exist@@ ential gl@@ ue ."
"@@ Y@@ et as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also be@@ gu@@ n to think that they l@@ ose their ma@@ gic if and when a story is seen as more than a story ."
And this is a sub@@ ject that I would love to think about together .
"When my first nov@@ el writ@@ ten in Eng@@ lish came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic ."
"&quot; I li@@ ked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had writ@@ ten it differ@@ ently . &quot;"
( Laughter ) I asked him what he me@@ ant by that .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many S@@ pan@@ ish , American , H@@ i@@ sp@@ an@@ ic charac@@ ters in it , but there &apos;s only one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ter and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the nov@@ el took place on a univer@@ sity cam@@ p@@ us in B@@ os@@ ton , so to me , it was normal that there be more inter@@ national charac@@ ters in it than T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish charac@@ ters , but I underst@@ ood what my cri@@ tic was looking for ."
And I also underst@@ ood that I would keep dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting him .
He wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my identi@@ ty .
He was looking for a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
"We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identi@@ ty poli@@ tics aff@@ ects the way stories are being cir@@ cul@@ ated , read and re@@ vie@@ wed ."
"M@@ any au@@ th@@ ors feel this pres@@ sure , but non@@ -@@ W@@ ester@@ n au@@ th@@ ors feel it more he@@ a@@ vi@@ ly ."
"If you &apos;re a woman writ@@ er from the Mus@@ li@@ m world , like me , then you are exp@@ ected to write the stories of Mus@@ li@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy Mus@@ li@@ m women ."
"You &apos;re exp@@ ected to write infor@@ ma@@ tive , po@@ ig@@ n@@ ant and charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic stories and leave the experim@@ ental and av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de to your W@@ ester@@ n colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
What I experi@@ enc@@ ed as a child in that school in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
"W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as cre@@ ative individu@@ als on their own , but as the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of their re@@ spec@@ tive cul@@ tures : a few au@@ th@@ ors from China , a few from T@@ ur@@ key , a few from N@@ ig@@ er@@ ia ."
"We &apos;re all thought to have something very dist@@ inc@@ tive , if not p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ."
The writ@@ er and comm@@ u@@ ter J@@ ames B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in gave an inter@@ view in 198@@ 4 in which he was re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly asked about his h@@ om@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
"When the inter@@ vie@@ wer tried to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ h@@ ole him as a g@@ ay writ@@ er , B@@ al@@ d@@ w@@ in stop@@ ped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identi@@ ty poli@@ tics tries to put lab@@ els on us , it is our free@@ dom of imag@@ ination that is in d@@ an@@ ger ."
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ zy c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory called mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural liter@@ ature in which all au@@ th@@ ors from outside the W@@ ester@@ n world are l@@ um@@ ped together .
"I never for@@ get my first mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural read@@ ing , in H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard S@@ qu@@ are about 10 years ago ."
"We were three writ@@ ers , one from the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines , one T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ d@@ on@@ es@@ ian — like a jo@@ ke , you know ."
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we sh@@ ared an arti@@ sti@@ c st@@ y@@ le or a liter@@ ary ta@@ st@@ e .
It was only because of our pas@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
"M@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural writ@@ ers are exp@@ ected to tell real stories , not so much the imag@@ in@@ ary ."
A func@@ tion is at@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted to fic@@ tion .
"In this way , not only the writ@@ ers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional charac@@ ters become the re@@ pres@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ves of something lar@@ ger ."
But I must quickly ad@@ d that this ten@@ d@@ ency to see a story as more than a story does not so@@ le@@ ly come from the W@@ est .
It comes from every@@ where .
And I experi@@ enc@@ ed this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on tri@@ al in 200@@ 5 for the words my fic@@ tional charac@@ ters ut@@ ter@@ ed in a nov@@ el .
"I had inten@@ ded to write a con@@ struc@@ tive , multi@@ -@@ l@@ ay@@ ered nov@@ el about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women ."
My mic@@ r@@ o story became a m@@ acr@@ o issue when I was pr@@ os@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
"S@@ ome people cri@@ tici@@ zed , others p@@ rais@@ ed me for wr@@ iting about the T@@ ur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian conf@@ lic@@ t ."
But there were times when I wanted to re@@ mind both si@@ des that this was fic@@ tion .
It was just a story .
"And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to bel@@ it@@ tle my work ."
"I want to love and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate fic@@ tion for what it is , not as a means to an end ."
"W@@ rit@@ ers are enti@@ t@@ led to their political op@@ in@@ i@@ ons , and there are good political nov@@ els out there , but the language of fic@@ tion is not the language of d@@ a@@ ily poli@@ tics ."
"C@@ he@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the cor@@ rec@@ t way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely se@@ par@@ ate things ."
And only the l@@ at@@ ter is an arti@@ st &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility . &quot; &quot; I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics divi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion connec@@ ts .
One is interested in s@@ we@@ ep@@ ing gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
"The other , in nu@@ ances ."
One dra@@ ws b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies .
The other recogn@@ iz@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty poli@@ tics is made of so@@ li@@ d br@@ ic@@ ks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flo@@ wing water .
"In the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ dd@@ ah . &quot; &quot; They would go to co@@ ff@@ e@@ e h@@ ous@@ es , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often im@@ provi@@ sing ."
"W@@ ith each new person in the story , the me@@ dd@@ ah would change his vo@@ ice , im@@ person@@ ating that charac@@ ter ."
"E@@ very@@ body could go and list@@ en , you know — ordinary people , even the s@@ ul@@ t@@ an , Mus@@ li@@ ms and non@@ -@@ Mus@@ li@@ ms ."
"S@@ t@@ ories cut across all b@@ ound@@ ar@@ ies , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ al@@ es of N@@ as@@ re@@ dd@@ in H@@ od@@ j@@ a , &quot; &quot; which were very pop@@ ular throu@@ gh@@ out the M@@ id@@ dle E@@ ast , Nor@@ th Africa , the B@@ al@@ k@@ ans and A@@ si@@ a ."
"T@@ o@@ day , stories contin@@ ue to tran@@ sc@@ end bor@@ d@@ ers ."
"When P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian and Is@@ ra@@ el@@ i poli@@ tici@@ ans talk , they us@@ u@@ ally don &apos;t list@@ en to each other , but a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian read@@ er still re@@ ads a nov@@ el by a J@@ e@@ wish au@@ th@@ or , and v@@ ice ver@@ s@@ a , connec@@ ting and em@@ pa@@ th@@ iz@@ ing with the n@@ ar@@ r@@ ator ."
L@@ it@@ er@@ ature has to take us be@@ y@@ ond .
"If it cannot take us there , it is not good liter@@ ature ."
"B@@ oo@@ ks have sa@@ ved the int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted , tim@@ id child that I was — that I once was ."
But I &apos;m also aw@@ are of the d@@ an@@ ger of fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ iz@@ ing them .
"When the po@@ et and my@@ sti@@ c , R@@ um@@ i , met his sp@@ ir@@ it@@ ual compan@@ ion , S@@ ha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the l@@ at@@ ter did was to t@@ oss R@@ um@@ i &apos;s books into water and watch the le@@ t@@ ters dis@@ solve ."
"The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ dge that takes you not be@@ y@@ ond yourself is far wor@@ se than ig@@ nor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cul@@ tural gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not l@@ ack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not be@@ y@@ ond ourselves : it makes us e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , dist@@ ant and dis@@ connected ."
There &apos;s a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or which I love : living like a dra@@ wing comp@@ ass .
"As you know , one le@@ g of the comp@@ ass is sta@@ tic , ro@@ ot@@ ed in a place ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the other le@@ g dra@@ ws a wi@@ de cir@@ cle , con@@ st@@ antly moving ."
"L@@ i@@ ke that , my fic@@ tion as well ."
"One part of it is ro@@ ot@@ ed in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , with str@@ ong T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish ro@@ ots , but the other part trav@@ els the world , connec@@ ting to different cul@@ tures ."
"In that sense , I like to think of my fic@@ tion as both local and univer@@ s@@ al , both from here and every@@ where ."
"Now those of you who have been to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i P@@ al@@ ace , which was the resi@@ dence of O@@ t@@ tom@@ an s@@ ul@@ t@@ ans for more than 40@@ 0 years ."
"In the p@@ al@@ ace , just outside the qu@@ ar@@ ters of the fav@@ or@@ ite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing P@@ l@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n ."
It &apos;s between buil@@ d@@ ings .
I &apos;m in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by this con@@ cept .
We us@@ u@@ ally di@@ str@@ ust those areas that f@@ all in between things .
"We see them as the dom@@ ain of super@@ natural cre@@ at@@ ures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of s@@ mo@@ k@@ el@@ ess fir@@ e and are the sym@@ bo@@ l of el@@ us@@ i@@ ven@@ ess ."
But my point is perhaps that el@@ us@@ ive space is what writ@@ ers and arti@@ sts need most .
When I write fic@@ tion I ch@@ er@@ ish el@@ us@@ i@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not kno@@ wing what will happen 10 p@@ ages later .
I like it when my charac@@ ters surpri@@ se me .
"I might write about a Mus@@ li@@ m woman in one nov@@ el , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a hand@@ some , g@@ ay prof@@ ess@@ or in Nor@@ way ."
"As long as it comes from our hear@@ ts , we can write about anything and everything ."
"A@@ u@@ d@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fa@@ thers ta@@ u@@ ght us to say , &apos; I think , ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted , &quot; &quot; I feel , ther@@ e@@ fore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful par@@ a@@ dig@@ m shi@@ ft ."
"And yet , why is it that , in cre@@ ative wr@@ iting cour@@ ses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?"
P@@ er@@ haps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ative liter@@ ature is not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily about wr@@ iting who we are or what we know or what our identi@@ ty is about .
We should teach young people and ourselves to exp@@ and our hear@@ ts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cul@@ tural gh@@ et@@ to and go vi@@ sit the next one and the next .
"In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ sh@@ es , dra@@ wing cir@@ cl@@ es be@@ y@@ ond cir@@ cl@@ es ."
"They con@@ n@@ ect all human@@ ity , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of identi@@ ty poli@@ tics , and that is the good news ."
"And I would like to fin@@ ish with an old Su@@ f@@ i po@@ e@@ m : &quot; &quot; C@@ ome , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ ver@@ s and lo@@ ved ones ; the ear@@ th sh@@ all be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
We do achi@@ eve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
"So , so far , coll@@ ec@@ tively all the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h ."
"Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing ."
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build str@@ on@@ ger social relation@@ ships as a result .
F@@ ive million people use it every mon@@ th .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
H@@ is work is br@@ illi@@ ant .
"But it is not , by any means , an op@@ tim@@ al situ@@ ation ."
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
"B@@ e@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les ."
Pe@@ ople were suff@@ ering . Pe@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
This is really exc@@ iting .
"A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al d@@ ice game ."
"We want to imagine ep@@ ic w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achi@@ eve the ep@@ ic w@@ in ."
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an amazing story and adv@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on .
"We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in sk@@ ills like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sust@@ ain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness ."
"The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little to@@ wn in C@@ ol@@ or@@ a@@ do , called C@@ ra@@ i@@ g ."
It &apos;s only a couple do@@ z@@ en squ@@ are miles . It &apos;s in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies .
And the job in question was sh@@ e@@ ep ran@@ ch@@ er .
"My ro@@ le on the show , for those of you who ha@@ ven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple ."
"I &apos;m an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the j@@ ob@@ s in question ."
"And my respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties are to simply try and keep up and give an hon@@ est ac@@ coun@@ t of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life ."
The job in question : her@@ ding sh@@ e@@ ep . Gre@@ at .
We go to C@@ ra@@ i@@ g and we ch@@ ec@@ k in to a h@@ ot@@ el and I realize the next day that ca@@ stra@@ tion is going to be an ab@@ sol@@ ute part of this work .
"So , norm@@ ally , I never do any research at all ."
"But , this is a tou@@ ch@@ y sub@@ ject , and I work for the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l , and we want to por@@ tr@@ ay ac@@ cur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we cer@@ tain@@ ly want to do it with a lot of resp@@ ect for the animals ."
"So I called the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , I &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some l@@ am@@ bs , C@@ an you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward . &quot; &quot; They use a b@@ and — basically a ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and , like this , only a little sm@@ all@@ er ."
"This one was actually around the playing car@@ ds I got y@@ ester@@ day , but it had a certain famili@@ ar@@ ity to it ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the ta@@ il , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
"And then another b@@ and is app@@ li@@ ed to the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ gh@@ tly ."
B@@ loo@@ d f@@ low is s@@ low@@ ly re@@ tar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question f@@ all off .
&quot; Gre@@ at — got it . &quot;
"O@@ K , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to con@@ fir@@ m this — they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"I also call P@@ E@@ T@@ A , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they con@@ fir@@ m it ."
"O@@ K , that &apos;s basically how you do it ."
So the next day I go out .
"And I &apos;m given a hor@@ se and we go get the l@@ am@@ bs and we take them to a p@@ en that we built , and we go about the business of animal h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry ."
M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e is the wi@@ fe of Al@@ ber@@ t .
Al@@ ber@@ t is the sh@@ e@@ ph@@ er@@ d in question .
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the l@@ am@@ b — two hands — one hand on both le@@ gs on the right , like@@ wi@@ se on the left ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the p@@ ost , she op@@ ens it up ."
Al@@ right . Gre@@ at .
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t goes in , I fol@@ low Al@@ ber@@ t , the cre@@ w is around ."
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
"B@@ e@@ ing an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t re@@ ach@@ es in his po@@ c@@ k@@ et to pul@@ l out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe ."
"And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know ."
"And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that c@@ au@@ ght the su@@ n that was just coming over the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , it was very — it was , it was im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"In the space of about two secon@@ ds , Al@@ ber@@ t had the k@@ ni@@ fe between the car@@ ti@@ l@@ age of the ta@@ il , right next to the bu@@ t@@ t of the l@@ am@@ b , and very quickly the ta@@ il was gone and in the b@@ uc@@ k@@ et that I was hol@@ ding ."
"A second later , with a big th@@ um@@ b and a well call@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ f@@ ing@@ er , he had the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gr@@ as@@ p ."
"And he pul@@ led it to@@ ward him , like so , and he took the k@@ ni@@ fe and he put it on the ti@@ p ."
"Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el — you don &apos;t , OK ?"
"He s@@ ni@@ ps it , th@@ ro@@ ws the ti@@ p over his sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and then gr@@ ab@@ s the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um and p@@ ush@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , ob@@ sc@@ uring my view , but what I hear is a s@@ l@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a no@@ ise that s@@ ounds like V@@ el@@ cr@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a s@@ tic@@ ky w@@ all and I am not even k@@ id@@ ding ."
C@@ an we ro@@ ll the video ?
No I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pic@@ tures .
"So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; sh@@ oot , ever ."
"I say , &quot; &quot; T@@ i@@ me out . S@@ top . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two ."
"There &apos;s no wr@@ iting , there &apos;s no scri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense ."
"We don &apos;t f@@ ool around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we sh@@ oot what we get !@@ "
"I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ top . This is nu@@ ts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know ."
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is cra@@ zy .
"We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Al@@ ber@@ t &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are t@@ es@@ tic@@ les in this b@@ uc@@ k@@ et and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ke the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety ."
"L@@ et &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the l@@ am@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and b@@ le@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five contin@@ ents , du@@ de ."
"We &apos;re on tw@@ ice a day on the D@@ is@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pul@@ ls out a ba@@ g of these little ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ ands ."
"M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up another l@@ am@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , b@@ and goes on the ta@@ il , b@@ and goes on the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um ."
"L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , l@@ am@@ b takes two ste@@ ps , f@@ alls down , gets up , sha@@ kes a little , takes another couple ste@@ ps , f@@ alls down ."
"I &apos;m like , this is not a good sig@@ n for this l@@ am@@ b , at all ."
"@@ G@@ ets up , wal@@ ks to the cor@@ ner , it &apos;s qu@@ i@@ ver@@ ing , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvi@@ ous dist@@ res@@ s ."
"And I &apos;m looking at the l@@ am@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Al@@ ber@@ t , how long ?"
"When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to f@@ all off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;"
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the l@@ am@@ b that he had just did his little pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ anc@@ ing around , b@@ le@@ e@@ ding stop@@ ped ."

"And I was just so b@@ lo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second ."
"And I was re@@ min@@ ded how ut@@ ter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time ."
"( Laughter ) And I was esp@@ eci@@ ally re@@ min@@ ded of what an ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously sh@@ ort stra@@ w I had that day because now I had to do what Al@@ ber@@ t had just done , and there are like 100 of these l@@ am@@ bs in the p@@ en , and sudd@@ en@@ ly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a G@@ er@@ man por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) M@@ el@@ an@@ i@@ e pic@@ ks up the l@@ am@@ b , pu@@ ts it on the p@@ ost , op@@ ens it up ."
Al@@ ber@@ t hands me the k@@ ni@@ fe .

"I go in , I gra@@ b the sc@@ r@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ p comes off ."
"A@@ l@@ ber@@ t in@@ struc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ ush it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do ."
&quot; P@@ ush it fur@@ ther . &quot;

"@@ Just b@@ ite &apos; e@@ m off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words ."
"( Laughter ) Li@@ ke , how did — how did I get here ?"
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those mom@@ ents where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and sudd@@ en@@ ly , I &apos;m st@@ anding there , in the R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies , and all I can think of is the A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ e@@ li@@ an defin@@ i@@ tion of a tra@@ ge@@ dy ."
"You know , A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le says a tra@@ ge@@ dy is that moment when the her@@ o comes face to face with his true identi@@ ty ."
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this j@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ?"
"I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my si@@ ght , so I did what I had to do ."
I went in and I took them .
"I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back ."
And I &apos;m st@@ anding there with two t@@ es@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t sha@@ ke the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
"O@@ K , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; P@@ o@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in A@@ ri@@ st@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of no@@ where , two terms come cr@@ ash@@ ing into my head that I ha@@ ven &apos;t heard since my cl@@ ass@@ ics prof@@ ess@@ or in colle@@ ge dr@@ illed them there ."
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the G@@ ree@@ k word for disco@@ very .
"L@@ it@@ er@@ ally , the tran@@ si@@ tion from ig@@ nor@@ ance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is ."
It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my nec@@ k in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ es every single day .
Gre@@ at .
"The other word , peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tra@@ ge@@ dies , you know — E@@ ur@@ i@@ p@@ id@@ es and S@@ op@@ ho@@ cl@@ es — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us has his moment , where he sudd@@ en@@ ly realiz@@ es that h@@ ot ch@@ ick he &apos;s been sle@@ ep@@ ing with and having bab@@ ies with is his mother . OK ."
That &apos;s peri@@ pe@@ ty or peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia .
And this met@@ ap@@ h@@ or in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
"( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though ."

"I mean , B@@ ru@@ ce W@@ ill@@ is in &quot; &quot; The S@@ i@@ x@@ th S@@ en@@ se , &quot; &quot; right ?"
"S@@ p@@ ends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who se@@ es de@@ ad people , and then , bo@@ om — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m de@@ ad &quot; &quot; — peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a ."
You know ?
It &apos;s cr@@ ush@@ ing when the audience se@@ es it the right way .

"L@@ oo@@ king at that po@@ or other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struc@@ k by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pat@@ e@@ tic mis@@ con@@ cep@@ tions might I be able to com@@ ment up@@ on ?"
"Because , look , I &apos;m not a social an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ ist but I have a friend who is ."
And I talk to him .
"( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey M@@ i@@ ke ."
"L@@ ook , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve sho@@ t in every state ?"
"You &apos;ve worked in min@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in fi@@ sh@@ ing , you &apos;ve worked in ste@@ el , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry ."
"You &apos;ve had your back sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der with these guys that our poli@@ tici@@ ans are des@@ per@@ ate to rel@@ ate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ ill@@ ary doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ y@@ e , dri@@ b@@ bl@@ ing down her ch@@ in , with the ste@@ el wor@@ kers ."
"I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day ."
"&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thou@@ ghts , coll@@ ec@@ tively , it might be time to think about it ."
"Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , t@@ es@@ tic@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thou@@ ghts are b@@ oun@@ c@@ ing around ."
"And , after that sh@@ oot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , person@@ ally ."
"And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it ."
"I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that I &apos;ve just been as@@ sum@@ ing are s@@ acr@@ os@@ anc@@ t , and they &apos;re not ."
Pe@@ ople with di@@ r@@ ty j@@ ob@@ s are happ@@ i@@ er than you think .
"As a group , they &apos;re the happ@@ i@@ est people I know ."
"And I don &apos;t want to start wh@@ ist@@ ling &quot; &quot; L@@ ook for the Uni@@ on L@@ ab@@ el , &quot; &quot; and all that happy wor@@ ker cra@@ p ."
I &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ anc@@ ed people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
R@@ o@@ ad@@ k@@ ill pic@@ k@@ er@@ -@@ up@@ per@@ s wh@@ ist@@ le while they work . I s@@ we@@ ar to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of sym@@ me@@ try to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to won@@ der what would happen if we challeng@@ ed some of these s@@ ac@@ red co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 3@@ 6 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your pas@@ sion — what could possi@@ bly be wrong with that ?
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably the wor@@ st adv@@ ice I ever got .
"( Laughter ) You know , fol@@ low your dre@@ am@@ s and go bro@@ ke , right ?"
"I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up ."
"I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion , it &apos;s going to work out ."
"I can give you 30 exam@@ ples , right now — B@@ o@@ b C@@ om@@ bs , the pi@@ g far@@ mer in L@@ as V@@ e@@ g@@ as who coll@@ ects the un@@ e@@ at@@ en sc@@ r@@ aps of food from the c@@ as@@ in@@ os and fe@@ e@@ ds them them to his s@@ w@@ ine ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because there &apos;s so much prot@@ e@@ in in the stuff we don &apos;t e@@ at his pi@@ gs grow at tw@@ ice the normal speed , and he is one r@@ ich pi@@ g far@@ mer , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ ends his days doing this incredible serv@@ ice , and he sm@@ ells like h@@ ell , but God bl@@ ess him ."
He &apos;s making a great living .
"You ask him , &quot; &quot; D@@ id you fol@@ low your pas@@ sion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d l@@ au@@ gh at you ."
"The guy &apos;s wor@@ th — he just got off@@ ered like 60 million dollars for his far@@ m and turned it down , outside of V@@ e@@ g@@ as ."
He didn &apos;t fol@@ low his pas@@ sion .
He ste@@ p@@ ped back and he wat@@ ched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
"M@@ at@@ t F@@ ro@@ ind , a d@@ air@@ y far@@ mer in New C@@ an@@ a@@ an , Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , who w@@ o@@ ke up one day and realized the cra@@ p from his co@@ ws was wor@@ th more than their mil@@ k , if he could use it to make these bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able flo@@ wer p@@ ots ."
"Now , he &apos;s sel@@ ling them to W@@ al@@ mar@@ t ."
F@@ ol@@ low his pas@@ sion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
"So I started to look at pas@@ sion , I started to look at effici@@ ency ver@@ su@@ s eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess — as T@@ i@@ m tal@@ ked about ear@@ li@@ er , that &apos;s a huge dist@@ inc@@ tion ."
"I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ a@@ ti@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; success@@ ories &quot; &quot; that h@@ an@@ g with that sch@@ m@@ al@@ t@@ zy art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms around the world right now ."
That stuff — it &apos;s sudd@@ en@@ ly all been turned on its head .
S@@ a@@ fe@@ ty — sa@@ fe@@ ty first ?
"@@ G@@ o@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and P@@ E@@ T@@ A and the H@@ um@@ an@@ e S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?"
"I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really sa@@ fe@@ ty third ?"
Right ?
"( Laughter ) No , I mean really ."
"What I mean to say is I value my sa@@ fe@@ ty on these cra@@ zy j@@ ob@@ s as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done ."
"And I &apos;ll never for@@ get , up in the B@@ ering S@@ e@@ a , I was on a cra@@ b bo@@ at with the &quot; &quot; D@@ e@@ ad@@ li@@ est C@@ at@@ ch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first se@@ as@@ on ."
"We &apos;re about 100 miles off the co@@ ast of R@@ us@@ si@@ a : 50@@ -@@ f@@ oot se@@ as , big wa@@ ves , green water coming over the whe@@ el@@ house , right ?"
"M@@ ost ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , l@@ ash@@ ing the p@@ ots down ."
"So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the dec@@ k , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean ."
Un@@ spea@@ k@@ ably d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
"I sc@@ am@@ per down , I go into the whe@@ el@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ d@@ ul@@ ity , &quot; C@@ ap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;"
"And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? O@@ ce@@ an . &quot; &quot; And he poin@@ ts out there ."
"( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated in the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 ."
It can &apos;t be re@@ pe@@ ated on any fac@@ t@@ ory flo@@ or or any con@@ struc@@ tion site .
"But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; S@@ on &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he call@@ s me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; S@@ on , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cra@@ b bo@@ at ."
My respon@@ si@@ bility is not to get you home ali@@ ve .
"My respon@@ si@@ bility is to get you home r@@ ich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home ali@@ ve , that &apos;s on you ."
"And for the rest of that day , sa@@ fe@@ ty first ."
"I was like — So , the idea that we create this f@@ al@@ se — this sense of com@@ plac@@ ency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s respon@@ si@@ bility as though it &apos;s our own , and v@@ ice ver@@ s@@ a ."
"A@@ n@@ y@@ how , a whole lot of things ."
I could talk at l@@ eng@@ th about the many little dist@@ inc@@ tions we made and the end@@ less li@@ st of ways that I got it wrong .
"But , what it all comes down to is this ."
"I form@@ ed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my re@@ ma@@ ining two minutes and 30 secon@@ ds ."
"It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us ."
It &apos;s a civi@@ l war .
"It &apos;s a co@@ ld war , really ."
"We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ st@@ ac@@ he in some M@@ achi@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it ."
"And we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on at least four fron@@ ts , cer@@ tain@@ ly in H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood ."
The way we por@@ tr@@ ay working people on T@@ V — it &apos;s l@@ au@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
"If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 30@@ 0 p@@ ounds and he &apos;s got a gi@@ ant bu@@ t@@ t cr@@ ack . A@@ d@@ m@@ it it ."
You see him all the time .
"That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?"
"We turn them into her@@ o@@ es , or we turn them into p@@ unch l@@ ines ."
That &apos;s what T@@ V does .
"We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at ."
"But , we &apos;ve w@@ ag@@ ed this war on Ma@@ dis@@ on A@@ ven@@ ue ."
"I mean , so many of the comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?"
"@@ Y@@ our life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little ear@@ li@@ er , if you could re@@ ti@@ re a little fa@@ ster , if you could p@@ unch out a little so@@ on@@ er — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again ."
W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton ? I can &apos;t even beg@@ in to talk about the de@@ als and poli@@ ci@@ es in place that aff@@ ect the bottom line reality of the avail@@ able j@@ ob@@ s because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
"And right here guys , S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y , I mean — how many people have an iP@@ h@@ one on them right now ?"
How many people have their B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ?
We &apos;re pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed in ; we &apos;re connected .
I would never su@@ ggest for a second that something bad has come out of the t@@ ech revol@@ ution .
"@@ G@@ ood g@@ ri@@ ef , not to this c@@ ro@@ w@@ d ."
( Laughter ) But I would su@@ ggest that innovation without im@@ it@@ ation is a comple@@ te wa@@ st@@ e of time .
And no@@ body c@@ ele@@ br@@ ates im@@ it@@ ation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ ob@@ s &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
"@@ Y@@ our iP@@ h@@ one without those people making the same inter@@ face , the same cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same board , over and over ?"
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the gen@@ i@@ us that goes inside of it .
"So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know ."
O@@ ur tools today don &apos;t look like sho@@ v@@ els and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the coll@@ ective effect of all of that has been this mar@@ g@@ in@@ aliz@@ ation of lots and lots of j@@ ob@@ s .
"And I realized , probably too l@@ ate in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 20@@ 0 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can ."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the t@@ es@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in ."
I got a lot wrong .
"So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a P@@ R cam@@ pa@@ ign for work , man@@ ual lab@@ or , sk@@ illed lab@@ or ."
S@@ ome@@ body needs to be out there talking about the for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten bene@@ f@@ its .
"I &apos;m talking about grand@@ father stuff , the stuff a lot us probably gre@@ w up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little ."
B@@ ar@@ ack wan@@ ts to create two and a half million j@@ ob@@ s .
The in@@ fra@@ structure is a huge deal .
"This war on work , that I sup@@ pose ex@@ ists , has c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties like any other war ."
The in@@ fra@@ structure &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ l@@ ining tra@@ de@@ -@@ school en@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ments are the second one .
"E@@ very single year : fe@@ wer electr@@ ici@@ ans , fe@@ wer car@@ pen@@ ters , fe@@ wer pl@@ um@@ bers , fe@@ wer w@@ el@@ d@@ ers , fe@@ wer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fe@@ wer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters ."
"The in@@ fra@@ structure j@@ ob@@ s that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in dec@@ line , over and over ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two tr@@ illion dollars — at a min@@ im@@ um , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the American S@@ o@@ ci@@ ety of C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Eng@@ ine@@ ers — that we need to exp@@ end to even make a dent in the in@@ fra@@ structure , which is curr@@ ently r@@ ated at a D min@@ us ."
"So , if I were run@@ ning for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to make and the j@@ ob@@ s we hope to create ar@@ en &apos;t going to s@@ tic@@ k un@@ less they &apos;re j@@ ob@@ s that people want ."
"And I know the point of this con@@ fer@@ ence is to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate things that are ne@@ ar and de@@ ar to us , but I also know that cle@@ an and di@@ r@@ ty ar@@ en &apos;t op@@ pos@@ it@@ es ."
"They &apos;re two si@@ des of the same co@@ in , just like innovation and im@@ it@@ ation , like risk and respon@@ si@@ bility , like peri@@ pe@@ ti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that po@@ or little l@@ am@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qu@@ i@@ ver@@ ing any@@ more , and like my time that &apos;s gone ."
"It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?"
( Applause )
"My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ loc@@ k b@@ illions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ m@@ ant inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is sle@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of t@@ y@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of sle@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the value of sle@@ ep ."
"T@@ w@@ o-@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my des@@ k . I bro@@ ke my che@@ e@@ k@@ b@@ one , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right ey@@ e ."
And I began the jour@@ ney of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the value of sle@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I stu@@ died , I met with me@@ dical doc@@ tors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more inspi@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough sle@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new revol@@ ution , this new fem@@ in@@ ist issue ."
"We are literally going to sle@@ ep our way to the top , literally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ fortun@@ ately for men , sle@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation has become a vir@@ ility sym@@ bo@@ l ."
I was recently having d@@ in@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours sle@@ ep the night before .
"And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this d@@ in@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sle@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a brea@@ k@@ fast d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k is too l@@ ate for me , but that &apos;s o@@ kay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence call@@ s and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bus@@ y and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had br@@ illi@@ ant lead@@ ers in business , in fin@@ ance , in poli@@ tics , making terri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs h@@ it@@ ting our T@@ it@@ an@@ ics .
"In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ ile all the bro@@ thers were bus@@ y just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connected 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have no@@ tic@@ ed the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g , because she would have w@@ o@@ ken up from a se@@ ven@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or e@@ igh@@ t-@@ h@@ our sle@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your eyes and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ ines and disco@@ ver the power of sle@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ r@@ is poin@@ ted out , I study the human brain , the func@@ tions and structure of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a minut@@ e about what this en@@ ta@@ ils .
"Here is this m@@ ass of j@@ el@@ ly , th@@ ree@@ -@@ p@@ ound m@@ ass of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space ."
It can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate itself cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ating on the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ en@@ ess , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , and hop@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this ac@@ tivity emer@@ g@@ es the whole spec@@ tr@@ um of ab@@ ili@@ ties that we call human nature and human consci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the func@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One appro@@ ach , the one we use ma@@ in@@ ly , is to look at patients with sust@@ ain@@ ed d@@ ama@@ ge to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a gene@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an acr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ board re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive ability ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ective l@@ oss of one func@@ tion , with other func@@ tions being pres@@ er@@ ved int@@ act , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how involved in medi@@ ating that func@@ tion ."
"So you can then map func@@ tion onto structure , and then find out what the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular func@@ tion ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ ples of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ ples , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extra@@ ordinary syn@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as syn@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ por@@ al lob@@ es , fron@@ t@@ al lob@@ es , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lob@@ es , OK — the lob@@ es that con@@ stitu@@ te the brain ."
"And if you look , t@@ uc@@ ked away inside the in@@ ner surface of the tem@@ por@@ al lob@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed , you can no longer recogn@@ ize people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogn@@ ize them from their vo@@ ice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogn@@ ize yourself in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you w@@ ink and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , but you don &apos;t really recogn@@ ize yourself as yourself ."
OK . Now that syn@@ dr@@ ome is well known as ca@@ used by d@@ ama@@ ge to the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us .
"But there &apos;s another r@@ are syn@@ dr@@ ome , so r@@ are , in fact , that very few phys@@ ici@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gr@@ as d@@ el@@ us@@ ion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely normal , has had a head in@@ j@@ ury , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is perf@@ ec@@ tly l@@ uc@@ id and intellig@@ ent in all other re@@ spec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ us@@ ion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ books , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys ."
"When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a str@@ ong se@@ x@@ ual at@@ tr@@ action to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us complex of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stand@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to@@ wards your mother ."
"Th@@ ank God , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , d@@ a@@ mag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these l@@ at@@ ent se@@ x@@ ual ur@@ g@@ es to emer@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the surface , and sudd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ ably you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent ."
"It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ ious , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same d@@ el@@ us@@ ion , a patient having the same d@@ el@@ us@@ ion , about his pe@@ t po@@ o@@ dle . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; Right ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the l@@ at@@ ent b@@ es@@ ti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cur@@ ious dis@@ order , we look at the structure and func@@ tions of the normal visu@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"N@@ or@@ m@@ ally , visu@@ al sig@@ n@@ als come in , into the e@@ ye@@ b@@ alls , go to the visu@@ al areas in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after pro@@ cess@@ ing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , where you per@@ ce@@ ive fac@@ es ."
There are neur@@ ons there that are sen@@ si@@ tive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?"
I tal@@ ked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that area &apos;s d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the ability to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that area , the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ades into a structure called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional c@@ ore of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ g@@ es the emo@@ tional sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at ."
Is it pre@@ y ? Is it pre@@ dat@@ or ? Is it m@@ ate ?
"O@@ r is it something absolutely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ int , or a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?"
Wh@@ ich you can completely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mess@@ ages then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start s@@ we@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ c@@ ular ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s fortun@@ ate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and meas@@ ure the change in sk@@ in resi@@ st@@ ance produc@@ ed by s@@ we@@ ating ."
"So I can de@@ ter@@ mine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , OK ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minut@@ e .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the visu@@ al areas and , ho@@ we@@ ver , and it &apos;s pro@@ cess@@ ed in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us , and you recogn@@ ize it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?"
"And then the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ades into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ic ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that w@@ ire that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bi@@ c system , the emo@@ tional c@@ ore of the brain , is cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the f@@ us@@ i@@ form is int@@ act , the cha@@ p can still recogn@@ ize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh ye@@ ah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the w@@ ire is cut to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ ro@@ r , as the case may be ? Right ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ coun@@ t for this in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able l@@ ack of emo@@ tions ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some str@@ an@@ ge woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and meas@@ ure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can meas@@ ure how you s@@ we@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an um@@ bre@@ l@@ l@@ a . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t s@@ we@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a li@@ on , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start s@@ we@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start s@@ we@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ wish .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?"
You take the patient and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and meas@@ ure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and cha@@ ir@@ s and l@@ int , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is fl@@ at ."
"There &apos;s no emo@@ tional re@@ action to his mother , because that w@@ ire going from the visu@@ al areas to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters is cut ."
"So his vision is normal because the visu@@ al areas are normal , his emo@@ tions are normal — he &apos;ll l@@ au@@ gh , he &apos;ll cr@@ y , so on and so for@@ th — but the w@@ ire from vision to emo@@ tions is cut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ us@@ ion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ v@@ ely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , se@@ em@@ ingly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , ne@@ ural psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c syn@@ dr@@ ome and say that the stand@@ ard F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a preci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ ural an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this patient then goes , and mother ph@@ ones from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — ph@@ ones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? Wh@@ ere are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ us@@ ion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ ach@@ es him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ par@@ ate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cen@@ ters in the brain to the emo@@ tional cen@@ ters , and that &apos;s not been cut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expl@@ a@@ ins why through the phone he recogn@@ iz@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this complex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it n@@ ur@@ ture ?"
And we appro@@ ach this problem by consi@@ der@@ ing another cur@@ ious syn@@ dr@@ ome called ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , or a le@@ g is am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated , for g@@ an@@ gr@@ en@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a ser@@ ious problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m or a ph@@ an@@ tom le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ e@@ li@@ eve it or not , even with inter@@ nal vi@@ sc@@ era ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us re@@ moved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ tom@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , inclu@@ ding ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ str@@ ual cra@@ m@@ ps at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one stud@@ ent asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ p@@ e for scienti@@ fic en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ su@@ ed that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs by doing experim@@ ents ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs cl@@ a@@ i@@ m that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ b@@ y@@ e ."
"These are very comp@@ elling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The patient &apos;s not d@@ el@@ us@@ i@@ on@@ al .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s a comp@@ elling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the patient ."
"But ho@@ we@@ ver , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b is par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pa@@ in will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b be par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ?"
It s@@ ounds like an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case sh@@ e@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs , the orig@@ inal ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed because of the peri@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ j@@ ury ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was cut , by say , a m@@ ot@@ or@@ cy@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the patient had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pain@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pa@@ in in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ p@@ ut@@ ates the ar@@ m , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a ser@@ ious cl@@ in@@ ical problem .
P@@ a@@ ti@@ ents become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ ici@@ de , OK ?"
"So , how do you tre@@ at this syn@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case sh@@ e@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves sup@@ pl@@ ying the ar@@ m had been cut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for sever@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pa@@ in then gets car@@ ried over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was int@@ act , but par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , the brain sen@@ ds comm@@ ands to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visu@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , OK ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ e@@ b@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated the ar@@ m , this learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is car@@ ri@@ es over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , OK ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now s@@ end the comm@@ and to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him visu@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"M@@ ay@@ be you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , the ph@@ an@@ tom cra@@ m@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vir@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts millions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r box .
"You have a car@@ d@@ board box with a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first patient , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated 10 years ago .
"He had a br@@ achi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the ar@@ m was par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ p@@ ut@@ ated ."
"He had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m , ex@@ cr@@ uc@@ i@@ at@@ ingly pain@@ ful , and he couldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r like that , in a box , which I call a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r box , right ?"
"And the patient pu@@ ts his ph@@ an@@ tom left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and the normal hand on the right side of the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ection of the normal ar@@ m in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real f@@ ing@@ ers , or move your real f@@ ing@@ ers while looking in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visu@@ al im@@ pression that the ph@@ an@@ tom is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s obvi@@ ous , but the ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again , and the pa@@ in , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — th@@ ank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , and I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook at your re@@ fl@@ ection of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ p@@ id . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r re@@ fl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s pain@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pa@@ in is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clos@@ es his eyes ."
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
"&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;"
"&quot; Oh my God , o@@ h my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a kid in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and the cri@@ tical ro@@ le of visu@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ el@@ ess ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of par@@ al@@ ys@@ is that you see in ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , like st@@ ro@@ ke , foc@@ al d@@ y@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can over@@ come with the simple device of using a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ er@@ e@@ k &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pa@@ in — I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , D@@ er@@ e@@ k , take it home and prac@@ tice with it for a week or two ."
"M@@ ay@@ be , after a peri@@ od of prac@@ tice , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r , un@@ learn the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and start moving your par@@ al@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pa@@ in . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; L@@ ook , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he ph@@ ones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r box was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ ared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ th@@ ics and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ e@@ k , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ b@@ ow pa@@ in , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ ar@@ m pa@@ in , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom f@@ ing@@ ers d@@ ang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your box doesn &apos;t re@@ ach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and e@@ li@@ min@@ ate my ph@@ an@@ tom f@@ ing@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ici@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory conf@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mess@@ ages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no pro@@ pri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mus@@ cle sig@@ n@@ als saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your m@@ ot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this conf@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of den@@ ial — it g@@ ates the sig@@ n@@ als .
"And when the ar@@ m dis@@ appe@@ ars , the b@@ on@@ us is , the pa@@ in dis@@ appe@@ ars because you can &apos;t have dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died pa@@ in flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the b@@ on@@ us ."
"Now , this tech@@ ni@@ que has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other grou@@ ps in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i , so it may pro@@ ve to be val@@ u@@ able as a tre@@ at@@ ment for ph@@ an@@ tom pa@@ in , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ ro@@ ke re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation ."
"S@@ tro@@ ke you norm@@ ally think of as d@@ ama@@ ge to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ ro@@ ke par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is also learned par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be over@@ come using m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also gone through cl@@ in@@ ical tri@@ als , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the third part of my talk , which is about another cur@@ ious ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on called syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
This was discovered by Fr@@ anc@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ en@@ th century .
He was a c@@ ous@@ in of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in .
"He poin@@ ted out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely normal , had the follo@@ wing p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ ive is blue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , OK ?"
"B@@ e@@ ar in mind , these people are completely normal in other re@@ spec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C sh@@ ar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ o@@ ke color ."
"@@ C sh@@ ar@@ p is blue , F sh@@ ar@@ p is green , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . G@@ al@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a , a m@@ ing@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ inc@@ t ."
These people mu@@ dd@@ le up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ p@@ ects of this problem are very in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ n@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a run@@ s in famili@@ es , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary bas@@ is , a gene@@ tic bas@@ is ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main the@@ me of this l@@ ec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ a@@ tivity — syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a is eight times more common am@@ ong arti@@ sts , po@@ ets , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ? What ca@@ uses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One theory is they &apos;re just cra@@ zy .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fic theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a . All right ?"
"So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ental cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing between color and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding color , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cr@@ os@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
Re@@ member I said it run@@ s in famili@@ es ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ normal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that ca@@ uses this ab@@ normal cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ med down to create the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mod@@ ular archit@@ ec@@ ture of the ad@@ ult brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e ca@@ using this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e m@@ ut@@ ates , then you get def@@ ici@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain areas ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ color syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and color , you get t@@ on@@ e-@@ color syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ connected ?"
"Well , think about what arti@@ sts , no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , l@@ in@@ king se@@ em@@ ingly un@@ rel@@ ated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the e@@ ast , and J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the Su@@ n . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , J@@ u@@ li@@ et is the su@@ n , does that mean she &apos;s a g@@ lo@@ wing ball of fir@@ e ?"
"I mean , sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ r@@ en@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"N@@ or@@ m@@ al people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the su@@ n , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the su@@ n , she &apos;s n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing like the su@@ n ."
"In@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the l@@ in@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this gre@@ ater cr@@ oss w@@ ir@@ ing and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a gre@@ ater pro@@ pen@@ sity to@@ wards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and cre@@ a@@ tivity in people with syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common in@@ ci@@ dence of syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a am@@ ong po@@ ets , arti@@ sts and no@@ ve@@ li@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ r@@ en@@ o@@ logical view of syn@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ a ."
The last de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion — can I take one minut@@ e ?
"( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ es@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in den@@ ial about it ."

How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two m@@ ut@@ ants ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ i@@ k@@ i ? R@@ a@@ ise your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
"Now , n@@ one of you is a M@@ arti@@ an . How did you do that ?"
"It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ model syn@@ es@@ the@@ tic ab@@ str@@ action , mean@@ ing you &apos;re saying that that sh@@ ar@@ p in@@ fl@@ ection — ki@@ -@@ k@@ i , in your au@@ d@@ it@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x , the ha@@ ir cells being exc@@ ited — K@@ i@@ k@@ i , m@@ im@@ ics the visu@@ al in@@ fl@@ ection , sudd@@ en in@@ fl@@ ection of that j@@ ag@@ ged sh@@ ape ."
"Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is eng@@ ag@@ ing in a pri@@ mi@@ tive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a sil@@ ly ill@@ us@@ ion , but these phot@@ ons in your ey@@ e are doing this sh@@ ape , and ha@@ ir cells in your e@@ ar are exc@@ iting the au@@ d@@ it@@ ory patter@@ n , but the brain is able to ex@@ tr@@ act the common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator ."
"It &apos;s a pri@@ mi@@ tive form of ab@@ str@@ action , and we now know this happens in the f@@ us@@ i@@ form g@@ y@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s d@@ a@@ mag@@ ed , these people l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in B@@ ou@@ b@@ a K@@ i@@ k@@ i , but they also l@@ ose the ability to eng@@ age in met@@ ap@@ h@@ or ."
"If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not go@@ ld , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s me@@ tal@@ li@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s go@@ ld ."
"You have to meas@@ ure its speci@@ fic gra@@ v@@ ity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely mis@@ s the met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical mean@@ ing ."
"So , this area is about eight times the size in high@@ er — esp@@ eci@@ ally in humans — as in lo@@ wer pri@@ mat@@ es ."
"S@@ ome@@ thing very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ular g@@ y@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cr@@ os@@ s@@ ro@@ ads between hear@@ ing , vision and tou@@ ch , and it became en@@ or@@ m@@ ous in humans . And something very interesting is going on ."
"And I think it &apos;s a bas@@ is of many uni@@ qu@@ ely human ab@@ ili@@ ties like ab@@ str@@ action , met@@ ap@@ h@@ or and cre@@ a@@ tivity ."
"All of these questions that ph@@ il@@ os@@ oph@@ ers have been stud@@ ying for m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a , we scientists can beg@@ in to expl@@ ore by doing brain imag@@ ing , and by stud@@ ying patients and asking the right questions ."
Thank you .

This story is about taking imag@@ ination ser@@ i@@ ously .
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed this ordinary material , fi@@ sh@@ net , used the same way for cent@@ ur@@ ies ."
"T@@ o@@ day , I &apos;m using it to create per@@ man@@ ent , b@@ il@@ lo@@ wing , vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous for@@ ms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buil@@ d@@ ings in cities around the world ."
I was an un@@ likely person to be doing this .
"I never stu@@ died sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , engine@@ ering or archit@@ ec@@ ture ."
"In fact , after colle@@ ge I app@@ li@@ ed to seven art s@@ cho@@ ols and was re@@ j@@ ected by all seven ."
"I went off on my own to become an arti@@ st , and I pain@@ ted for 10 years , when I was off@@ ered a F@@ ul@@ b@@ right to India ."
"P@@ r@@ om@@ is@@ ing to give ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions of pa@@ int@@ ings , I shi@@ p@@ ped my pain@@ ts and ar@@ ri@@ ved in Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ ali@@ pur@@ am ."
The de@@ ad@@ line for the show ar@@ ri@@ ved — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fi@@ sh@@ ing v@@ ill@@ age was fam@@ ous for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture .
So I tried br@@ on@@ ze ca@@ sting .
But to make large for@@ ms was too he@@ av@@ y and exp@@ en@@ sive .
"I went for a walk on the be@@ ach , wat@@ ching the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men b@@ und@@ le their ne@@ ts into m@@ ounds on the s@@ and ."
"I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differ@@ ently — a new appro@@ ach to sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture , a way to make vol@@ u@@ me@@ tri@@ c form without he@@ av@@ y so@@ li@@ d materi@@ als ."
My first sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture was made in coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation with these fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it ti@@ t@@ led &quot; &quot; W@@ i@@ de H@@ i@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ ist@@ ed them on pol@@ es to photograp@@ h .
I discovered their so@@ ft sur@@ fac@@ es re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed every ri@@ p@@ ple of w@@ ind in con@@ st@@ antly changing patter@@ ns .
I was m@@ es@@ mer@@ iz@@ ed .
"I contin@@ u@@ ed stud@@ ying cra@@ ft tradi@@ tions and coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ating with ar@@ tis@@ ans , next in Li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace ma@@ kers ."
"I li@@ ked the f@@ ine de@@ ta@@ il it gave my work , but I wanted to make them lar@@ ger — to shi@@ ft from being an ob@@ ject you look at to something you could get lost in ."
"@@ Re@@ tur@@ ning to India to work with those fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half hand@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots — inst@@ all@@ ed bri@@ e@@ fly in M@@ ad@@ ri@@ d ."
"Th@@ ous@@ ands of people saw it , and one of them was the ur@@ ban@@ ist M@@ an@@ ual S@@ ol@@ a@@ -@@ M@@ or@@ al@@ es who was re@@ desig@@ ning the wat@@ er@@ front in P@@ or@@ to , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al ."
He asked if I could build this as a per@@ man@@ ent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and pres@@ er@@ ve my art .
"D@@ ur@@ able , engine@@ ered , per@@ man@@ ent — those are in op@@ position to i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic , de@@ lic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al ."
"For two years , I sear@@ ched for a fi@@ ber that could survi@@ ve ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys , s@@ al@@ t , air , pol@@ l@@ ution , and at the same time re@@ main so@@ ft enough to move flu@@ id@@ ly in the w@@ ind ."
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the tra@@ ff@@ ic cir@@ cle .
"So we rais@@ ed this 4@@ 5@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound ste@@ el r@@ ing ."
We had to engine@@ er it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an average bre@@ e@@ ze and survi@@ ve in h@@ ur@@ ric@@ an@@ e win@@ ds .
But there was no engine@@ ering sof@@ tw@@ are to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a br@@ illi@@ ant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engine@@ er who desig@@ ns sa@@ ils for America &apos;s C@@ up r@@ ac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts nam@@ ed Pe@@ ter H@@ ep@@ pe@@ l .
He hel@@ ped me t@@ ack@@ le the tw@@ in challeng@@ es of preci@@ se sh@@ ape and g@@ ent@@ le movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand@@ -@@ ti@@ ed k@@ n@@ ots wer@@ en &apos;t going to with@@ stand a h@@ ur@@ ric@@ an@@ e .
"So I developed a relation@@ ship with an indu@@ stri@@ al fi@@ sh@@ net fac@@ t@@ ory , learned the vari@@ ab@@ les of their mach@@ ines , and fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make l@@ ace with them ."
"There was no language to trans@@ l@@ ate this anci@@ ent , i@@ di@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ cra@@ tic hand@@ cra@@ ft into something machine oper@@ ators could produce ."
So we had to create one .
"Th@@ ree years and two children later , we rais@@ ed this 50@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ f@@ oot l@@ ace net ."
"It was hard to believe that what I had imag@@ ined was now built , per@@ man@@ ent and had lost nothing in trans@@ l@@ ation ."
( Applause ) This inter@@ sec@@ tion had been bl@@ and and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I wal@@ ked under@@ ne@@ ath it for the first time .
"As I wat@@ ched the w@@ ind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ograp@@ h@@ y un@@ f@@ old , I felt sh@@ el@@ ter@@ ed and , at the same time , connected to lim@@ it@@ less sk@@ y ."
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture in sp@@ ac@@ es of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two direc@@ tions that are new in my work .
"H@@ ist@@ or@@ ic P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hi@@ a C@@ ity H@@ all : its pl@@ az@@ a , I felt , needed a material for sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture that was li@@ gh@@ ter than ne@@ tting ."
"So we experim@@ ented with tiny at@@ om@@ iz@@ ed water partic@@ les to create a d@@ ry m@@ ist that is sh@@ ap@@ ed by the w@@ ind and in te@@ sting , discovered that it can be sh@@ ap@@ ed by people who can inter@@ act and move through it without getting w@@ et ."
I &apos;m using this sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture material to tr@@ ace the pa@@ ths of sub@@ way tra@@ ins abo@@ ve ground in real time — like an X@@ -@@ r@@ ay of the city &apos;s cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
"N@@ ext challenge , the B@@ i@@ en@@ ni@@ al of the Amer@@ ic@@ as in D@@ en@@ ver asked , could I re@@ present the 3@@ 5 n@@ ations of the W@@ ester@@ n h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here and their inter@@ connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness in a sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ?"
"( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to beg@@ in , but I said yes ."
I read about the re@@ cent ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in C@@ hi@@ le and the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i that ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed across the entire P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
"It shi@@ f@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ec@@ t@@ on@@ ic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s r@@ ot@@ ation and literally sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed the l@@ eng@@ th of the day ."
"So I cont@@ ac@@ ted N@@ O@@ A@@ A , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i , and trans@@ l@@ ated it into this ."
I@@ ts ti@@ tle : &quot; &quot; 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 6 &quot; &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of mic@@ r@@ os@@ econ@@ ds that the Earth &apos;s day was sh@@ or@@ ten@@ ed .
"I couldn &apos;t build this with a ste@@ el r@@ ing , the way I knew ."
I@@ ts sh@@ ape was too complex now .
"So I re@@ plac@@ ed the met@@ al ar@@ mat@@ ure with a so@@ ft , f@@ ine m@@ es@@ h of a fi@@ ber 15 times str@@ on@@ ger than ste@@ el ."
"The sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture could now be enti@@ rely so@@ ft , which made it so light it could ti@@ e in to exist@@ ing buil@@ d@@ ings — literally bec@@ om@@ ing part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of the city ."
There was no sof@@ tw@@ are that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net for@@ ms and model them with gra@@ v@@ ity .
So we had to create it .
Th@@ en I got a call from New York C@@ ity asking if I could ad@@ ap@@ t these con@@ cep@@ ts to T@@ im@@ es S@@ qu@@ are or the H@@ i@@ gh L@@ ine .
This new so@@ ft struc@@ tural me@@ th@@ od en@@ ab@@ les me to model these and build these sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tures at the scale of sk@@ y@@ sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ers .
"They don &apos;t have fund@@ ing yet , but I dre@@ am now of br@@ ing@@ ing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed ."
"F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I sear@@ ched for beau@@ ty in the tradi@@ tional things , in cra@@ ft for@@ ms ."
"Now I comb@@ ine them with hi@@ -@@ t@@ ech materi@@ als and engine@@ ering to create vol@@ up@@ tu@@ ous , b@@ il@@ lo@@ wing for@@ ms the scale of buil@@ d@@ ings ."
My arti@@ sti@@ c hor@@ iz@@ ons contin@@ ue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
"A@@ n att@@ or@@ ney in the off@@ ice who &apos;d never been interested in art , never vi@@ s@@ ited the local art mus@@ e@@ um , dra@@ gg@@ ed everyone she could from the building and got them outside to li@@ e down under@@ ne@@ ath the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ture ."
"There they were in their business su@@ its , l@@ ay@@ ing in the gr@@ ass , no@@ tic@@ ing the changing patter@@ ns of w@@ ind b@@ es@@ i@@ de people they didn &apos;t know , sh@@ ar@@ ing the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this sli@@ de is to look at your age on the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al a@@ x@@ is .
"A@@ f@@ ter pub@@ er@@ ty , we f@@ all off the map ."
She &apos;s a si@@ x@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
( Applause )
So when I was a kid ...
this was my team .
( Laughter ) I st@@ un@@ k at sp@@ or@@ ts .
"I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to watch them ."
So this is what I did . I went fi@@ sh@@ ing .
"And for all of my growing up I fi@@ shed on the sho@@ res of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , and these are the cre@@ at@@ ures that I saw on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is ."
"But after I gre@@ w up and went to colle@@ ge , and I came home in the early 9@@ 0 &apos;s , this is what I found ."
My team had sh@@ run@@ k .
It was like literally having your r@@ os@@ ter dev@@ ast@@ ated .
"And as I sort of looked into that , from a very personal point of view as a fi@@ sh@@ er@@ man , I started to kind of figure out , well , what was the rest of the world thinking about it ?"
F@@ irst place I started to look was fish mar@@ kets .
"And when I went to fish mar@@ kets , in sp@@ ite of where I was — whether I was in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a , or P@@ ar@@ is , or L@@ on@@ don , or wh@@ er@@ ever — I ke@@ pt seeing this we@@ ir@@ dly re@@ pe@@ ating t@@ rope of four cre@@ at@@ ures , again and again — on the men@@ us , on ice — sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , tun@@ a , s@@ al@@ m@@ on and co@@ d ."
"And I thought this was pretty str@@ an@@ ge , and as I looked at it , I was wonder@@ ing , did anyone else no@@ tice this sort of sh@@ r@@ in@@ king of the market ?"
"Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team ."
"O@@ r@@ d@@ in@@ ary people , the way they looked at se@@ af@@ ood was like this ."
It &apos;s not an un@@ us@@ ual human charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic to re@@ duce the natural world down to very few el@@ em@@ ents .
"We did it before , 10@@ ,000 years ago , when we came out of our ca@@ ves ."
"If you look at fir@@ e p@@ its from 10@@ ,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see r@@ ac@@ co@@ ons , you &apos;ll see , you know , w@@ ol@@ ves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different cre@@ at@@ ures ."
"But if you t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to the age of — you know , 2@@ ,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four ma@@ m@@ m@@ als : pi@@ gs , co@@ ws , sh@@ e@@ ep and go@@ ats ."
"It &apos;s true of bir@@ ds , too ."
"You look at the men@@ us in New York C@@ ity re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants 1@@ 50 years ago , 20@@ 0 years ago , you &apos;ll see s@@ ni@@ p@@ e , w@@ oo@@ d@@ co@@ c@@ k , grou@@ se , do@@ z@@ ens of duc@@ ks , do@@ z@@ ens of ge@@ ese ."
"But t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e a@@ head to the age of moder@@ n animal h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry , and you &apos;ll see four : tur@@ ke@@ ys , duc@@ ks , ch@@ ic@@ ken and ge@@ ese ."
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve head@@ ed in this direc@@ tion .
But how have we head@@ ed in this direc@@ tion ?
Well ...
"@@ first it &apos;s a very , very new problem ."
This is the way we &apos;ve been fi@@ sh@@ ing the oce@@ ans over the last 50 years .
World W@@ ar I@@ I was a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous inc@@ enti@@ ve to ar@@ m ourselves in a war against fish .
"All of the technology that we perf@@ ected during World W@@ ar I@@ I — son@@ ar , li@@ gh@@ tw@@ eight pol@@ y@@ m@@ ers — all these things were re@@ direc@@ ted to@@ wards fish ."
"And so you see this tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous buil@@ d@@ up in fi@@ sh@@ ing cap@@ ac@@ ity , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ing in the course of time , from the end of World W@@ ar I@@ I to the present time ."
And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 9@@ 0 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons out of the sea every year .
That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the human we@@ ight of China taken out of the sea every year .
And it &apos;s no co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that I use China as the example because China is now the lar@@ gest fi@@ sh@@ ing n@@ ation in the world .
"Well , that &apos;s only half the story ."
"The other half of the story is this incredible bo@@ om in fish far@@ ming and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , which is now , only in the last year or two , starting to ex@@ ce@@ ed the amount of w@@ il@@ d fish that we produce ."
"So that if you ad@@ d w@@ il@@ d fish and far@@ med fish together , you get the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two Chin@@ as created from the ocean each and every year ."
"And again , it &apos;s not a co@@ in@@ ci@@ dence that I use China as the example , because China , in ad@@ di@@ tion to being the bi@@ ggest cat@@ ch@@ er of fish , is also the bi@@ ggest far@@ mer of fish ."
So let &apos;s look though at the four cho@@ ices we are making right now .
"The first one — by far the most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ af@@ ood in America and in much of the W@@ est , is sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
S@@ h@@ ri@@ m@@ p in the w@@ il@@ d — as a w@@ il@@ d produc@@ t — is a terri@@ ble produc@@ t .
"@@ 5 , 10 , 15 p@@ ounds of w@@ il@@ d fish are reg@@ ularly k@@ illed to bring one p@@ ound of sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p to the market ."
They &apos;re also incredi@@ bly fu@@ el in@@ effici@@ ent to bring to the market .
"In a re@@ cent study that was produc@@ ed out of D@@ al@@ h@@ ou@@ si@@ e Uni@@ versity , it was found that dra@@ gg@@ ing for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is one of the most car@@ b@@ on@@ -@@ inten@@ sive ways of fi@@ sh@@ ing that you can find ."
"So you can far@@ m them , and people do far@@ m them , and they far@@ m them a lot in this very area ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m is ...
the place where you far@@ m sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p is in these w@@ il@@ d ha@@ bit@@ ats — in man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts .
Now look at those lo@@ v@@ ely ro@@ ots coming down .
"Th@@ ose are the things that hold so@@ il together , prot@@ ect co@@ a@@ sts , create ha@@ bit@@ ats for all sor@@ ts of young fish , young sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , all sor@@ ts of things that are important to this environment ."
"Well , this is what happens to a lot of co@@ ast@@ al man@@ gro@@ ve fore@@ sts ."
We &apos;ve lost millions of ac@@ res of co@@ ast@@ al man@@ gro@@ ves over the last 30 or 40 years .
"That rate of de@@ struc@@ tion has s@@ lo@@ wed , but we &apos;re still in a major man@@ gro@@ ve de@@ fic@@ it ."
"The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on that the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker M@@ ark B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in called &quot; &quot; G@@ r@@ in@@ ding N@@ em@@ o . &quot; &quot; This ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is very , very re@@ lev@@ ant to anything that you &apos;ve ever seen on a t@@ rop@@ ical ree@@ f ."
"Because what &apos;s going on right now , we have sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p dra@@ gg@@ ers dra@@ gg@@ ing for sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , cat@@ ching a huge amount of b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch , that b@@ y@@ cat@@ ch in turn gets ground up and turned into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p food ."
"And sometimes , many of these v@@ es@@ sel@@ s — man@@ ned by s@@ la@@ ves — are cat@@ ching these so@@ -@@ called &quot; &quot; tr@@ ash fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would love to see on a ree@@ f , gr@@ in@@ ding them up and tur@@ ning them into sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p fe@@ ed — an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem literally e@@ ating itself and sp@@ it@@ ting out sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p ."
"The next most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ af@@ ood in America , and also throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est , is tun@@ a ."
So tun@@ a is this ul@@ tim@@ ate global fish .
These huge manag@@ ement areas have to be ob@@ ser@@ ved in order for tun@@ a to be well manag@@ ed .
"O@@ ur own manag@@ ement area , called a Re@@ gi@@ on@@ al F@@ i@@ sh@@ er@@ ies M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation , is called I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T , the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion for the Con@@ serv@@ ation of A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic T@@ un@@ as ."
"The great nat@@ ur@@ al@@ ist C@@ ar@@ l S@@ a@@ fin@@ a once called it , &quot; The Inter@@ national Con@@ sp@@ ir@@ acy to C@@ at@@ ch all the T@@ un@@ as . &quot;"
"O@@ f course we &apos;ve seen incredible impro@@ v@@ ement in I@@ C@@ C@@ A@@ T in the last few years , there is tot@@ al room for impro@@ v@@ ement , but it re@@ ma@@ ins to be said that tun@@ a is a global fish , and to man@@ age it , we have to man@@ age the g@@ lo@@ be ."
"Well , we could also try to grow tun@@ a but tun@@ a is a spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ularly bad animal for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
M@@ any people don &apos;t know this but tun@@ a are war@@ m@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded .
"They can he@@ at their bo@@ dies 20 degre@@ es abo@@ ve am@@ bi@@ ent tem@@ per@@ ature , they can s@@ wi@@ m at over 40 miles an h@@ our ."
"So that pretty much e@@ li@@ min@@ ates all the adv@@ ant@@ ages of far@@ ming a fish , right ?"
"A far@@ med fish is — or a fish is col@@ d-@@ bloo@@ ded , it doesn &apos;t move too much ."
That &apos;s a great thing for growing prot@@ e@@ in .
"But if you &apos;ve got this cra@@ zy , w@@ il@@ d cre@@ ature that s@@ w@@ im@@ s at 40 miles an h@@ our and he@@ ats its blood — not a great can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture ."
The next cre@@ ature — most con@@ sum@@ ed se@@ af@@ ood in America and throu@@ gh@@ out the W@@ est — is s@@ al@@ m@@ on .
"Now s@@ al@@ m@@ on got its pl@@ under@@ ing , too , but it didn &apos;t really nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily happen through fi@@ sh@@ ing ."
This is my home state of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut .
Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut used to be home to a lot of w@@ il@@ d s@@ al@@ m@@ on .
"But if you look at this map of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , every do@@ t on that map is a d@@ am ."
"There are over 3@@ ,000 d@@ am@@ s in the state of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut ."
"I often say this is why people in Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut are so up@@ ti@@ ght — ( Laughter ) If somebody could just un@@ b@@ loc@@ k Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut &apos;s ch@@ i , I feel that we could have an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely better world ."
"But I made this particular com@@ ment at a con@@ ven@@ tion once of national par@@ ks off@@ ic@@ ers , and this guy from Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a si@@ d@@ led up to me , he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you ou@@ gh@@ t@@ n &apos;t be so hard on your Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut , c@@ ause we here in Nor@@ th C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a , we got 3@@ 5@@ ,000 d@@ am@@ s . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic , it &apos;s an inter@@ national ep@@ ide@@ m@@ ic ."
"And there are d@@ am@@ s every@@ where , and these are preci@@ se@@ ly the things that stop w@@ il@@ d s@@ al@@ m@@ on from re@@ ach@@ ing their sp@@ aw@@ ning gr@@ ounds ."
"So as a result , we &apos;ve turned to a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , and s@@ al@@ m@@ on is one the most success@@ ful , at least from a numbers point of view ."
"When they first started far@@ ming s@@ al@@ m@@ on , it could take as many as six p@@ ounds of w@@ il@@ d fish to make a single p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ m@@ on ."
"The industry has , to its cre@@ d@@ it , gre@@ at@@ ly impro@@ ved ."
"They &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten it bel@@ ow two to one , al@@ though it &apos;s a little bit of a che@@ at because if you look at the way a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture fe@@ ed is produc@@ ed , they &apos;re meas@@ uring p@@ el@@ le@@ ts — p@@ ounds of p@@ el@@ le@@ ts per p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ m@@ on ."
Th@@ ose p@@ el@@ le@@ ts are in turn re@@ duc@@ ed fish .
"So the ac@@ tual — what &apos;s called the F@@ I@@ F@@ O , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say ."
"But in any case , cre@@ d@@ it to the industry , it has lo@@ wer@@ ed the amount of fish per p@@ ound of s@@ al@@ m@@ on ."
P@@ ro@@ b@@ le@@ m is we &apos;ve also gone cra@@ zy with the amount of s@@ al@@ m@@ on that we &apos;re produc@@ ing .
A@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture is the fa@@ st@@ est growing food system on the planet .
It &apos;s growing at something like seven percent per year .
"And so even though we &apos;re doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still k@@ illing a lot of these little fish ."
"And it &apos;s not just fish that we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding fish to , we &apos;re also fe@@ e@@ ding fish to ch@@ ick@@ ens and pi@@ gs ."
"So we &apos;ve got ch@@ ick@@ ens and they &apos;re e@@ ating fish , but we@@ ir@@ dly , we also have fish that are e@@ ating ch@@ ick@@ ens ."
"Because the b@@ y@@ produc@@ ts of ch@@ ick@@ ens — fe@@ a@@ thers , blood , b@@ one — get ground up and f@@ ed to fish ."
"So I often won@@ der , is there a fish that ate a ch@@ ic@@ ken that ate a fish ?"
"It &apos;s sort of a re@@ working of the ch@@ ic@@ ken and e@@ g@@ g thing . An@@ y@@ way — ( Laughter ) All together , though , it res@@ ults in a terri@@ ble m@@ ess ."
What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons of w@@ il@@ d cre@@ at@@ ures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
"That &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the sea each and every year ."
The last of the four is a kind of am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous thing .
"It &apos;s what the industry call@@ s &quot; &quot; wh@@ it@@ e@@ fish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish that get cy@@ cl@@ ed into this wh@@ it@@ e@@ fish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , I think , is through that cl@@ as@@ si@@ c piece of American cul@@ in@@ ary innovation , the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich ."
So the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich actually started as h@@ ali@@ but .
"And it started because a local fr@@ an@@ ch@@ ise o@@ w@@ ner found that when he ser@@ ved his M@@ c@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d &apos;s on F@@ ri@@ day , no@@ body came ."
"Because it was a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c community , they needed fish ."
"So he went to R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring you a fish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich , going to be made out of h@@ ali@@ but . &quot;"
"@@ R@@ ay K@@ ro@@ c said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work ."
"I want to do a H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger , and there &apos;s going to be a sli@@ ce of p@@ ine@@ app@@ le on a bu@@ n ."
"But let &apos;s do this , let &apos;s have a be@@ t ."
"Wh@@ os@@ ever s@@ and@@ w@@ ich sel@@ ls more , that will be the win@@ ning s@@ and@@ w@@ ich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sa@@ d for the ocean that the H@@ ul@@ a B@@ ur@@ ger didn &apos;t w@@ in ."
So he made his h@@ ali@@ but s@@ and@@ w@@ ich .
"@@ Un@@ fortun@@ ately though , the s@@ and@@ w@@ ich came in at 30 c@@ ents ."
"@@ R@@ ay wanted the s@@ and@@ w@@ ich to come in at 25 c@@ ents , so he turned to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic co@@ d ."
We all know what happened to A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic co@@ d in New Eng@@ land .
"So now the F@@ il@@ et@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ish s@@ and@@ w@@ ich is made out of Al@@ as@@ k@@ a pol@@ loc@@ k , it &apos;s the lar@@ gest f@@ in fish fi@@ sh@@ ery in the United States , 2 to 3 billion p@@ ounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year ."
"If we go through the pol@@ loc@@ k , the next choice is probably going to be ti@@ l@@ ap@@ ia ."
T@@ il@@ ap@@ ia is one of those fish no@@ body ever heard of 20 years ago .
"It &apos;s actually a very effici@@ ent conver@@ ter of plant prot@@ e@@ in into animal prot@@ e@@ in , and it &apos;s been a go@@ d@@ s@@ end to the third world ."
"It &apos;s actually a tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously sust@@ ain@@ able solution , it goes from an e@@ g@@ g to an ad@@ ult in n@@ ine months ."
"The problem is that when you look about the W@@ est , it doesn &apos;t do what the W@@ est wan@@ ts it to do ."
It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called an o@@ ily fish pro@@ fi@@ le .
It doesn &apos;t have the E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s that we all think are going to make us live fore@@ ver .
So what do we do ?
"I mean , first of all , what about this po@@ or fish , the clu@@ pe@@ i@@ ds ?"
The fish that re@@ present a huge part of that 20 to 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons .
"Well , one possi@@ bility that a lot of con@@ serv@@ a@@ tion@@ ists have rais@@ ed is could we e@@ at them ?"
C@@ ould we e@@ at them direc@@ tly instead of fe@@ e@@ ding them to s@@ al@@ m@@ on ?
There are ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents for it .
"They are tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously fu@@ el effici@@ ent to bring to market , a fr@@ action of the fu@@ el cost of say , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , and at the very top of the car@@ b@@ on effici@@ ency scale ."
"They also are ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 r@@ ich , a great sour@@ ce for E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A ."
So that is a pot@@ ential .
"And if we were to go down that rou@@ te what I would say is , instead of p@@ ay@@ ing a few b@@ uc@@ ks a p@@ ound — or a few b@@ uc@@ ks a ton , really — and making it into a@@ qu@@ a@@ fe@@ ed , could we hal@@ ve the cat@@ ch and dou@@ ble the pr@@ ice for the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men and make that our way of tre@@ ating these particular fish ?"
"O@@ ther possi@@ bility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bi@@ val@@ ves , partic@@ ularly mus@@ sel@@ s ."
"Now , mus@@ sel@@ s are very high in E@@ P@@ A and D@@ H@@ A , they &apos;re similar to can@@ ned tun@@ a ."
They &apos;re also extre@@ me@@ ly fu@@ el effici@@ ent .
T@@ o bring a p@@ ound of mus@@ sel@@ s to market is about a th@@ ir@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the car@@ b@@ on as requ@@ i@@ red to bring be@@ ef to market .
"They requ@@ ire no for@@ age fish , they actually get their ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s by fil@@ ter@@ ing the water of micro@@ al@@ ga@@ e ."
"In fact , that &apos;s where ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish ."
"M@@ ic@@ ro@@ al@@ ga@@ e make the ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , they &apos;re only bio@@ con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated in fish ."
Mus@@ sel@@ s and other bi@@ val@@ ves do tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous amoun@@ ts of water fil@@ tra@@ tion .
A single mus@@ se@@ l can fil@@ ter do@@ z@@ ens of g@@ all@@ ons every single day .
And this is incredi@@ bly important when we look at the world .
"@@ Right now , n@@ it@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation , over@@ use of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ ates in our wat@@ er@@ ways are ca@@ using tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous al@@ g@@ al b@@ lo@@ oms ."
"O@@ ver 40@@ 0 new de@@ ad z@@ ones have been created in the last 20 years , tre@@ m@@ end@@ ous sour@@ ces of mar@@ ine life death ."
We also could look at not a fish at all .
We could look at a ve@@ ge@@ table .
"We could look at se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , the k@@ el@@ ps , all these different vari@@ e@@ ties of things that can be high in ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s , can be high in prot@@ e@@ ins , tre@@ m@@ end@@ ously good things ."
They fil@@ ter the water just like mus@@ sel@@ s do .
"And we@@ ir@@ dly enough , it turns out that you can actually fe@@ ed this to co@@ ws ."
"Now , I &apos;m not a big f@@ an of cat@@ tle ."
"But if you wanted to keep growing cat@@ tle in a time and place where water resources are lim@@ ited , you &apos;re growing se@@ a@@ we@@ ed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — major consi@@ der@@ ation ."
And the last fish is a question mar@@ k .
We have the ability to create a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ red fish that cre@@ ates a net g@@ ain of mar@@ ine prot@@ e@@ in for us .
"This cre@@ ature would have to be ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an , it would have to be fast growing , it would have to be ad@@ ap@@ table to a changing climate and it would have to have that o@@ ily fish pro@@ fi@@ le , that E@@ P@@ A , D@@ H@@ A , ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ id pro@@ fi@@ le that we &apos;re looking for ."
This ex@@ ists kind of on paper .
I have been re@@ por@@ ting on these sub@@ jects for 15 years .
"E@@ very time I do a new story , somebody t@@ ells me , &quot; &quot; We can do all that . We can do it . We &apos;ve fi@@ gu@@ red it all out ."
We can produce a fish that &apos;s a net g@@ ain of mar@@ ine prot@@ e@@ in and has ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3@@ s . &quot; &quot; Gre@@ at .
It doesn &apos;t see@@ m to be getting sc@@ al@@ ed up .
It is time to scale this up .
"If we do , 30 million me@@ tri@@ c t@@ ons of se@@ af@@ ood , a third of the world cat@@ ch , st@@ ays in the water ."
So I gu@@ ess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
We t@@ end to go with our appe@@ ti@@ t@@ es rather than our min@@ ds .
"But if we went with this , or some con@@ fig@@ ur@@ ation of it , we might have a little more of this ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I ess@@ entially became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
"If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvi@@ ous that the two h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ her@@ es are completely se@@ par@@ ate from one another ."
E@@ x@@ c@@ use me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a jo@@ y .

I am an ener@@ g@@ y-@@ being connected to the energy all around me through the consci@@ ous@@ ness of my right h@@ em@@ i@@ sp@@ here .
