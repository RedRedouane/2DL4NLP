"When I was 1@@ 1 , I remem@@ ber w@@ ak@@ ing up one morning to the sound of jo@@ y in my h@@ ouse ."
"M@@ y father was li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to B@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws on his small , gra@@ y radi@@ o ."
"There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ u@@ su@@ al then , because the news m@@ os@@ tly de@@ pres@@ sed him ."
&quot; &quot; The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
"I didn &apos;t know what it me@@ ant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy ."
"&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said ."
A morning that I will never for@@ get .
A real school .
"You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and made it il@@ le@@ g@@ al for girls to go to school ."
"So for the next five years , I dre@@ s@@ sed as a bo@@ y to es@@ c@@ ort my older si@@ ster , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secre@@ t school ."
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
"E@@ ach day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would su@@ sp@@ ect where we were going ."
We would co@@ ver our bo@@ ok@@ s in gro@@ cer@@ y ba@@ gs so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
"The school was in a h@@ ouse , more than 100 of us pa@@ cked in one small li@@ ving room ."
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extre@@ m@@ ely h@@ ot in sum@@ mer .
"We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our par@@ ents ."
"F@@ rom time to time , the school would su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ous ."
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being follo@@ wed ?
Do they know where we live ?
"We were sc@@ a@@ red , but still , school was where we wanted to be ."
I was very lu@@ ck@@ y to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters were t@@ rea@@ su@@ red .
M@@ y grand@@ father was an extra@@ ordinary man for his time .
"A to@@ tal ma@@ ver@@ i@@ ck from a re@@ mot@@ e pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , he in@@ sist@@ ed that his daughter , my mo@@ m , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father ."
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
"She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our h@@ ouse into a school for girls and women in our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od ."
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to rec@@ ei@@ ve an education .
"There was no question that his children would rec@@ ei@@ ve an education , inclu@@ ding his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , de@@ sp@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , de@@ sp@@ ite the ris@@ ks ."
"T@@ o him , there was great@@ er ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children ."
"D@@ u@@ ring T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years , I remem@@ ber there were times I would get so f@@ ru@@ st@@ rat@@ ed by our life and always being sc@@ a@@ red and not see@@ ing a future ."
"I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ i@@ st@@ en , my daughter , you can l@@ ose everything you own in your life ."
Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be for@@ ced to leave your home during a war .
"But the one thing that will always re@@ main with you is what is here , and if we have to sel@@ l our blo@@ od to pay your school fe@@ es , we will ."
So do you still not want to contin@@ ue ? &quot; &quot; T@@ o@@ day I am 2@@ 2 .
I was ra@@ ised in a country that has been dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by dec@@ ad@@ es of war .
"F@@ e@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it be@@ yon@@ d high school , and had my family not been so comm@@ itt@@ ed to my education , I would be one of them ."
"In@@ stead , I st@@ and here a p@@ rou@@ d gra@@ du@@ ate of M@@ i@@ dd@@ le@@ bu@@ ry C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"( Applause ) Wh@@ en I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , was am@@ ong the first to c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ late me ."
"He not only bra@@ gs about my college de@@ g@@ ree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stre@@ ets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l ."
( Applause ) M@@ y family beli@@ ev@@ es in me .
"I dre@@ am big , but my family dre@@ am@@ s even bi@@ gg@@ er for me ."
"That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ ba@@ s@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n to educ@@ ate women ."
"That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ oun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sk@@ y for girls to go to school ."
The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with am@@ b@@ ition gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing at op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
"And I see their par@@ ents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , de@@ sp@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e A@@ h@@ m@@ ed . That &apos;s not his real na@@ me , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ m@@ ed is the father of one of my students ."
"@@ L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their village , and they liter@@ ally mis@@ sed being k@@ il@@ led by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes ."
"As he ar@@ ri@@ ved home , the phone r@@ ang , a v@@ oi@@ ce war@@ ning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again ."
"&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wi@@ sh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and ba@@ ck@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realiz@@ e about Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , and this is something that is of@@ ten dis@@ mis@@ sed in the W@@ est , that behind most of us who succ@@ e@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ z@@ es the val@@ ue in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his success ."
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers are@@ n &apos;t k@@ ey in our success .
"In fact , they &apos;re of@@ ten the in@@ iti@@ al and con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing neg@@ oti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , but in the con@@ t@@ ex@@ t of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , we must have the supp@@ ort of men ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an , girls who went to school numb@@ ered in the hund@@ re@@ ds — remem@@ ber , it was il@@ le@@ g@@ al ."
"But today , more than three million girls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
( Applause ) Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americ@@ ans see the f@@ ra@@ g@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much be@@ yon@@ d the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s &apos; with@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ al .
"But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , when I see the students in my school and their par@@ ents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them , who en@@ coura@@ ge them , I see a pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ st@@ ing change ."
"T@@ o me , Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan is a country of ho@@ pe and b@@ oun@@ d@@ less possi@@ bil@@ ities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e me , they are dre@@ am@@ ing big ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"@@ Just ab@@ solutely ama@@ zing , every single di@@ ve ."
D@@ is@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s right into the ba@@ ck@@ ground .
"So , he &apos;s b@@ lu@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it ba@@ ck@@ wards ."
"One , two , three ."
"When I was seven years old , I saw my first publi@@ c ex@@ ec@@ ution ."
"If anything se@@ em@@ ed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated ."
"E@@ ven though I was really for@@ tu@@ nate to get out , many other Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ ans have not been so lu@@ ck@@ y ."
"E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an in@@ st@@ ant ."
"We are all K@@ ore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , due to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion ."
A@@ m I S@@ ou@@ th K@@ ore@@ an or Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ an ?
So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e .
I was so surpri@@ sed that a to@@ tal st@@ rang@@ er ca@@ red enough to ask .
I realiz@@ ed that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life .
This is a kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten we desig@@ ned in 200@@ 7 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten to be a cir@@ cle .
It &apos;s a kind of en@@ d@@ less circu@@ lation on top of the ro@@ of .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we desig@@ n this ?
"The princi@@ pa@@ l of this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a han@@ d@@ rai@@ l . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s im@@ possible . &quot; &quot; But he in@@ sist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sti@@ cking out from the ed@@ ge of the ro@@ of ?"
But we could keep that idea around the tre@@ es .
There are three tre@@ es pop@@ ping through .
And we were allowed to call this ro@@ pe as a han@@ d@@ rai@@ l .
"But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them ."
They f@@ all into the net .
"And you get more , and more , more ."
( Laughter ) S@@ om@@ e@@ times 40 children are around a tree .
"The bo@@ y on the b@@ ran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tree so he is e@@ ating the tree ."
"( Laughter ) And at the time of an ev@@ ent , they sit on the ed@@ ge ."
It looks so ni@@ ce from under@@ ne@@ ath .
M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys in the z@@ o@@ o .
( Laughter ) F@@ ee@@ ding time .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the ro@@ of as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the ro@@ of , not only under@@ ne@@ ath the ro@@ of ."
"And if the ro@@ of is too high , you see only the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing ."
And the le@@ g wa@@ shing place — there are many kinds of water tap@@ s .
"You see with the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble tu@@ b@@ es , you want to sp@@ ra@@ y water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite nor@@ mal ."
"But if you look at this , the bo@@ y is not wa@@ shing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s put@@ ting water into his bo@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year ."
And there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between inside and outside .
So it means basically this ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture is a ro@@ of .
And also there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y between cla@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
So there is no ac@@ ou@@ stic bar@@ ri@@ er at all .
"When you put many children in a qui@@ et bo@@ x , some of them get really ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"But in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , there is no reason they get ner@@ v@@ ous ."
Because there is no b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y .
"And the princi@@ pa@@ l says if the bo@@ y in the cor@@ ner doesn &apos;t want to sta@@ y in the room , we let him go ."
"He will come back even@@ tually , because it &apos;s a cir@@ cle , it comes back ."
"( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of o@@ cc@@ a@@ sion , u@@ su@@ ally children try to hi@@ de some@@ where ."
"But here , just they leave and come back ."
It &apos;s a natural process .
"And secon@@ dly , we con@@ sider no@@ i@@ se very important ."
You know that children s@@ le@@ ep better in no@@ i@@ se .
They don &apos;t s@@ le@@ ep in a qui@@ et space .
"And in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten , these children show ama@@ zing con@@ cent@@ ration in cla@@ ss ."
"And you know , our kind gre@@ w up in the ju@@ ng@@ le with no@@ i@@ se ."
They need no@@ i@@ se .
"And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y ba@@ r ."
You are not supp@@ osed to be in si@@ l@@ ence .
"And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control ."
"You know , it &apos;s completely open ."
And you should know that we can go s@@ ki@@ ing in -@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es in win@@ ter .
In sum@@ mer you go s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
The s@@ and is 50 de@@ gre@@ es .
You never m@@ el@@ t in ra@@ in .
"So , children are supp@@ osed to be outside ."
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divi@@ de cla@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
They are supp@@ osed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A cla@@ s@@ s@@ room .
And there are always some tre@@ es in the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room .
A mon@@ k@@ ey trying to fi@@ sh another mon@@ k@@ ey from ab@@ ove .
( Laughter ) M@@ on@@ ke@@ ys . ( Laughter )
And each cla@@ s@@ s@@ room has at lea@@ st one sk@@ y@@ light .
And this is where S@@ ant@@ a C@@ la@@ us comes down at the time of Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s .
"This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ sha@@ ped kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten ."
The building is only five met@@ ers ta@@ ll with seven flo@@ ors .
"And of course , the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing he@@ ight is very low ."
So you have to con@@ sider sa@@ f@@ ety .
"So , we put our children , a daughter and a son ."
They tried to go in .
He h@@ it his head .
He &apos;s ok@@ ay . H@@ is sk@@ u@@ ll is quite strong .
He is re@@ si@@ li@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is sa@@ fe to ju@@ m@@ p off .
And then we put other children .
"The tra@@ ffi@@ c j@@ am is a@@ w@@ ful in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o , as you know ."
"( Laughter ) The dri@@ ver in front , she needs to learn how to dri@@ ve ."
"Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of dang@@ er ."
"And in this kind of o@@ cc@@ a@@ sion , they learn to help each other ."
This is society . This is the kind of op@@ port@@ un@@ ity we are l@@ os@@ ing these days .
"Now , this d@@ ra@@ wing is sho@@ wing the movement of a bo@@ y between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 ."
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
"And this bo@@ y did 6@@ ,000 met@@ ers in the morning ."
But the surpri@@ se is yet to come .
"The children in this kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten do 4@@ ,000 met@@ ers on average ."
And these children have the high@@ est a@@ th@@ le@@ tic ab@@ il@@ ities am@@ ong many kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ s .
"The princi@@ pa@@ l says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tra@@ in them . We leave them on top of the ro@@ of ."
"M@@ y point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t prot@@ ect them too much , and they need to tu@@ m@@ ble some@@ times ."
They need to get some in@@ ju@@ ry .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
And this is one of the att@@ emp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challeng@@ es is to in@@ nov@@ ate fund@@ am@@ en@@ tally in education .
"But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ th@@ ra@@ l@@ led to in education ."
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seri@@ ously .
"C@@ an I ask you to p@@ lease rec@@ all a time when you really loved something — a mo@@ vi@@ e , an al@@ bu@@ m , a song or a book — and you re@@ com@@ men@@ ded it wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really li@@ ked , and you anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed that re@@ action , you wa@@ ited for it , and it came back , and the person ha@@ ted it ?"
"So , by way of int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion , that is the ex@@ act same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I tea@@ ch high school ma@@ th ."
"I sel@@ l a produc@@ t to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is for@@ ced by la@@ w to buy it ."
"I mean , it &apos;s just a l@@ os@@ ing prop@@ os@@ ition ."
"So there &apos;s a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about students that I see , a u@@ se@@ ful st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe about you all ."
"I could give you gu@@ ys an al@@ g@@ eb@@ ra@@ -@@ two fi@@ nal ex@@ am , and I would exp@@ ect no high@@ er than a 2@@ 5 percent pa@@ ss rate ."
And both of these fac@@ ts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call ma@@ th education in the U.S. today .
"T@@ o start with , I &apos;d like to b@@ rea@@ k ma@@ th down into two cat@@ e@@ g@@ ories ."
One is compu@@ tation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten .
"For example , fac@@ t@@ or@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ ti@@ cs with lead@@ ing c@@ oe@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ents great@@ er than one ."
"This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , pro@@ vi@@ ded you have a really strong grou@@ n@@ ding in reas@@ oning . M@@ ath reas@@ oning — we &apos;ll call it the app@@ lic@@ ation of ma@@ th proc@@ es@@ ses to the world around us — this is hard to tea@@ ch ."
"This is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal fiel@@ ds ."
"This is also something that , the way we tea@@ ch it in the U.S@@ ."
all but en@@ su@@ res they won &apos;t re@@ tain it .
"So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to cl@@ ose with , why this is an ama@@ zing time to be a ma@@ th teacher ."
"So first , five sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s that you &apos;re doing ma@@ th reas@@ oning wrong in your cla@@ s@@ s@@ room ."
One is a lack of in@@ iti@@ ative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You fin@@ ish your lec@@ ture blo@@ ck and im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely you have five hands going up asking you to re@@ -@@ explain the enti@@ re thing at their de@@ s@@ ks .
S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents lack per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
"They lack re@@ ten@@ tion ; you find yourself re@@ -@@ expla@@ ining con@@ cep@@ ts three months later , wh@@ o@@ le@@ s@@ al@@ e ."
"There &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ b@@ es 9@@ 9 percent of my students ."
And then the other one percent is ea@@ g@@ er@@ ly looking for the for@@ mu@@ la to app@@ ly in that sit@@ u@@ ation .
This is really de@@ struc@@ tive .
"D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ il@@ ch , cre@@ at@@ or of &quot; &quot; D@@ ea@@ d@@ wo@@ od &quot; &quot; and other ama@@ zing T@@ V sho@@ ws , has a really good descri@@ p@@ tion for this ."
"He s@@ wor@@ e off cre@@ ating con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry d@@ ram@@ a , sho@@ ws set in the present day , because he saw that when people f@@ ill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ resp@@ ect , it sha@@ p@@ es the ne@@ u@@ ral pa@@ th@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they exp@@ ect simple problems ."
"He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ pati@@ ence with ir@@ re@@ sol@@ ution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ pati@@ ent with things that don &apos;t re@@ sol@@ ve quickly ."
"You exp@@ ect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ ra@@ p up in 2@@ 2 minutes , three comm@@ er@@ cial b@@ re@@ ak@@ s and a la@@ u@@ gh tra@@ ck ."
"And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is that simple ."
I am very con@@ cer@@ ned about this because I &apos;m going to re@@ ti@@ re in a world that my students will ru@@ n .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I tea@@ ch this way .
"I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s — particu@@ larly mas@@ s@@ -@@ ad@@ op@@ ted t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s — tea@@ ch ma@@ th reas@@ oning and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , it &apos;s fun@@ cti@@ ona@@ lly equi@@ val@@ ent to tur@@ ning on &quot; &quot; T@@ wo and a H@@ al@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and cal@@ ling it a day ."
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ous@@ ness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
It app@@ lies equ@@ ally to ma@@ th .
"@@ N@@ oti@@ ce , first of all here , that you have exactly three piec@@ es of information there , each of which will figure into a for@@ mu@@ la some@@ where , even@@ tually , which the student will then comp@@ ute ."
I believe in real life .
"And ask yourself , what problem have you sol@@ ved , ever , that was wor@@ th sol@@ ving where you knew all of the given information in adv@@ ance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ pl@@ us of information and you had to fil@@ ter it out , or you didn &apos;t have su@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent information and had to go find some ."
I &apos;m sure we all ag@@ ree that no problem wor@@ th sol@@ ving is like that .
"And the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book , I think , kno@@ ws how it &apos;s ha@@ m@@ stri@@ ng@@ ing students because , watch this , this is the p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce problem set ."
"When it comes time to do the ac@@ tual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just s@@ w@@ app@@ ing out numbers and t@@ we@@ ak@@ ing the con@@ t@@ ex@@ t a little bit ."
"And if the student still doesn &apos;t recogni@@ ze the st@@ am@@ p this was m@@ ol@@ ded from , it hel@@ p@@ fully expla@@ ins to you what sam@@ ple problem you can re@@ turn to to find the for@@ mu@@ la ."
"You could liter@@ ally , I mean this , pa@@ ss this particular un@@ it without kno@@ wing any physics , just kno@@ wing how to dec@@ o@@ de a t@@ ex@@ t@@ book . That &apos;s a sha@@ me ."
So I can di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the problem a little more speci@@ fi@@ cally in ma@@ th .
Here &apos;s a really co@@ ol problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a sk@@ i li@@ ft .
"But what you have here is actually four se@@ pa@@ rate lay@@ ers , and I &apos;m cu@@ ri@@ ous which of you can see the four se@@ pa@@ rate lay@@ ers and , particu@@ larly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed together and pres@@ ent@@ ed to the student all at once , how that cre@@ ates this im@@ pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
I &apos;ll de@@ f@@ ine them here : You have the vi@@ su@@ al .
"You also have the ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal struc@@ ture , talking about g@@ ri@@ ds , measu@@ re@@ ments , la@@ b@@ els , point@@ s , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing ."
"You have sub@@ st@@ ep@@ s , which all le@@ ad to what we really want to talk about : which sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ."
So I ho@@ pe you can see .
"I really ho@@ pe you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a comp@@ el@@ ling question , a comp@@ el@@ ling answer , but we &apos;re pa@@ ving a s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h , st@@ rai@@ ght pat@@ h from one to the other and c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ la@@ ting our students for how well they can step over the small cra@@ cks in the way ."
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
"So I want to put to you that if we can se@@ pa@@ rate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving ."
"So right here I start with the vi@@ su@@ al , and I im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely ask the question : W@@ hi@@ ch sec@@ tion is the ste@@ e@@ pe@@ st ?"
And this star@@ ts con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion because the vi@@ su@@ al is created in such a way where you can de@@ f@@ end two ans@@ w@@ ers .
"So you get people argu@@ ing against each other , fri@@ end ver@@ su@@ s fri@@ end , in pai@@ r@@ s , jour@@ na@@ ling , w@@ hat@@ ever ."
And then even@@ tually we realiz@@ e it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the s@@ ki@@ er in the lower le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand side of the scre@@ en or the s@@ ki@@ er just ab@@ ove the mi@@ d line .
"And we realiz@@ e how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D la@@ b@@ els to talk about them more ea@@ si@@ ly ."
"And then as we start to de@@ f@@ ine what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realiz@@ e it would be ni@@ ce to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really na@@ r@@ row it down , speci@@ fi@@ cally what that means ."
"And then and only then , we th@@ row down that ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal struc@@ ture ."
"The ma@@ th ser@@ ves the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion doesn &apos;t serve the ma@@ th ."
"And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that n@@ ine out of 10 cla@@ s@@ ses are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing ."
"But if you need to , your students can then devel@@ op those sub@@ st@@ ep@@ s together ."
"@@ Do you gu@@ ys see how this , right here , com@@ pa@@ red to that — which one cre@@ ates that pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving , that ma@@ th reas@@ oning ?"
"It &apos;s been ob@@ vi@@ ous in my p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce , to me ."
"And I &apos;ll yi@@ el@@ d the flo@@ or here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his d@@ ue@@ s ."
"He talked about the for@@ mu@@ lation of a problem being so incredi@@ bly important , and yet in my p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t inv@@ ol@@ ve them in the for@@ mu@@ lation of the problem ."
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fai@@ r@@ ly comp@@ el@@ ling el@@ ements of problems like this from my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book and re@@ build them in a way that supp@@ or@@ ts ma@@ th reas@@ oning and pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water t@@ ank .
The question is : How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ?
"F@@ irst things first , we eli@@ mi@@ nate all the sub@@ st@@ ep@@ s ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents have to devel@@ op those , they have to for@@ mu@@ late those ."
And then noti@@ ce that all the information w@@ r@@ itt@@ en on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
"@@ N@@ one of it &apos;s a dist@@ rac@@ tor , so we l@@ ose that ."
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents need to deci@@ de , &quot; &quot; A@@ ll right , well , does the he@@ ight matter ? D@@ oes the side of it matter ?"
D@@ oes the col@@ or of the val@@ ve matter ? What mat@@ ters here ? &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch an under@@ re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed question in ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m .
So now we have a water t@@ ank .
How long will it take you to f@@ ill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
"And because this is the 2@@ 1@@ st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or cli@@ p art that you so of@@ ten see in t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s , we go out and we take a picture of it ."
So now we have the real de@@ al .
How long will it take it to f@@ ill it up ?
"And then even better is we take a vi@@ de@@ o , a vi@@ de@@ o of someone fil@@ ling it up ."
"And it &apos;s fil@@ ling up s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , ag@@ on@@ iz@@ ing@@ ly s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ."
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
"S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents are looking at their wat@@ ches , ro@@ l@@ ling their ey@@ es , and they &apos;re all wonder@@ ing at some point or another , &quot; M@@ an , how long is it going to take to f@@ ill up ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?"
"And that question , off this right here , is really fu@@ n for me because , like the int@@ ro , I tea@@ ch kids — because of my in@@ experience — I tea@@ ch the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?"
"And I &apos;ve got kids who will not jo@@ in a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about ma@@ th because someone else has the for@@ mu@@ la ; someone else kno@@ ws how to work the for@@ mu@@ la better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it ."
"But here , every student is on a level pla@@ ying field of in@@ tu@@ ition ."
"E@@ very@@ one &apos;s fil@@ led something up with water before , so I get kids ans@@ wer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cally and con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tiona@@ lly inti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated jo@@ ining the con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ."
"We put nam@@ es on the bo@@ ar@@ d , atta@@ ch them to g@@ ue@@ s@@ ses , and kids have b@@ ou@@ ght in here ."
And then we fol@@ low the process I &apos;ve descri@@ bed .
"And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer k@@ ey in the back of the teacher &apos;s ed@@ ition ."
"We , instead , just watch the end of the mo@@ vi@@ e ."
"( Laughter ) And that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , because the the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal mo@@ d@@ els that always work out in the answer k@@ ey in the back of a teacher &apos;s ed@@ ition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s sc@@ ary to talk about sour@@ ces of er@@ r@@ or when the the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal does not mat@@ ch up with the p@@ rac@@ ti@@ cal ."
"But those con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions have been so val@@ u@@ able , am@@ ong the most val@@ u@@ able ."
So I &apos;m here to re@@ por@@ t some really fu@@ n g@@ am@@ es with students who come pre@@ -@@ in@@ sta@@ l@@ led with these vi@@ ru@@ ses day one of the cla@@ ss .
"@@ These are the kids who now , one se@@ me@@ ster in , I can put something on the bo@@ ar@@ d , to@@ tally new , to@@ tally fore@@ ig@@ n , and they &apos;ll have a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fu@@ n ."
"We &apos;re no longer a@@ verse to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defin@@ ed what a word problem is ."
"We &apos;re no longer inti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by ma@@ th , because we &apos;re s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly re@@ defin@@ ing what ma@@ th is ."
This has been a lot of fu@@ n .
"I en@@ coura@@ ge ma@@ th teachers I talk to to use multi@@ medi@@ a , because it bri@@ ngs the real world into your cla@@ s@@ s@@ room in high re@@ sol@@ ution and fu@@ ll col@@ or ; to en@@ coura@@ ge student in@@ tu@@ ition for that level pla@@ ying field ; to ask the sh@@ or@@ test question you possi@@ bly can and let those more speci@@ fi@@ c questions come out in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in to@@ tal , just be less hel@@ p@@ ful , because the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book is hel@@ ping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s bu@@ ying you out of your ob@@ lig@@ ation , for pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ving and ma@@ th reas@@ oning , to be less hel@@ p@@ ful ."
And why this is an ama@@ zing time to be a ma@@ th teacher right now is because we have the to@@ ols to create this high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m in our front po@@ ck@@ et .
"It &apos;s u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and fai@@ r@@ ly ch@@ ea@@ p , and the to@@ ols to di@@ stri@@ b@@ ute it fre@@ ely under open lic@@ en@@ ses has also never been che@@ ap@@ er or more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous ."
"I put a vi@@ de@@ o seri@@ es on my blo@@ g not so long ago and it got 6@@ ,000 vie@@ ws in two weeks ."
"I get ema@@ il@@ s still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never vi@@ sit@@ ed saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , y@@ eah . We had a good con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion about that ."
"O@@ h , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow ."
"I put this problem on my blo@@ g rec@@ ently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y st@@ ore , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 1@@ 9 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems ."
"And the lin@@ ear mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing inv@@ ol@@ ved in that was some good stuff for my cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , but it even@@ tually got me on &quot; &quot; Go@@ od M@@ or@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , right ?"
"And from all of this , I can only con@@ clu@@ de that people , not just students , are really hu@@ ng@@ ry for this ."
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ la@@ ry for your own in@@ tu@@ ition .
"So I just really en@@ coura@@ ge you , w@@ hat@@ ever your s@@ take is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , par@@ ent , teacher , po@@ lic@@ y mak@@ er , w@@ hat@@ ever — in@@ si@@ st on better ma@@ th cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m ."
We need more pati@@ ent problem sol@@ ver@@ s . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produc@@ ed by the Q@@ u@@ ad@@ ro C@@ or@@ po@@ ration of W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
It &apos;s a piece of pla@@ stic with a R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ ha@@ ck ant@@ en@@ na atta@@ ched to it .
So that &apos;s just a fu@@ n little example here of the sor@@ ts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
"It &apos;s like , are science and p@@ lu@@ mb@@ ing com@@ pati@@ ble ?"
"And if it looks a lot like a B@@ u@@ i@@ ck hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap , it &apos;s because it is ."
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ c@@ ap ready to go .
"In the case of G@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his tel@@ es@@ co@@ pe to S@@ at@@ ur@@ n ."
"And that , in fact , turns out to be true ."
There was a lot of people there .
"@@ Here &apos;s the V@@ ir@@ g@@ in M@@ ary on the ba@@ ck@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off ."
Thank you .
"T@@ wo years ago , I st@@ ood on the TED sta@@ ge in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ia ."
I sp@@ oke very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly about one of my p@@ rou@@ de@@ st cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
"B@@ e@@ fore that time , I had never been away from my home in Ma@@ la@@ w@@ i ."
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
"O@@ n the sta@@ ge that day , I was so ner@@ v@@ ous ."
"M@@ y English lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it ."
"( Laughter ) I had never been sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by so many a@@ z@@ u@@ ng@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )"
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
"But well , I &apos;m feel@@ ing good right now ."
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
"All sist@@ ers , ex@@ cep@@ ting me ."
This is me with my da@@ d when I was a little bo@@ y .
"B@@ e@@ fore I disco@@ vered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple far@@ mer in a country of poor far@@ m@@ ers ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e everyone else , we gre@@ w mai@@ ze ."
One year our for@@ tun@@ e turned very bad .
In 200@@ 1 we experienc@@ ed an a@@ w@@ ful fam@@ ine .
W@@ i@@ thin five months all Ma@@ la@@ wi@@ ans beg@@ an to star@@ ve to death .
"M@@ y family ate one me@@ al per day , at ni@@ ght ."
O@@ n@@ ly three s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws of n@@ si@@ ma for each one of us .
The fo@@ od pas@@ ses through our bo@@ di@@ es .
We drop down to nothing .
"In Ma@@ la@@ w@@ i , the secon@@ dar@@ y school , you have to pay school fe@@ es ."
"Because of the hu@@ ng@@ er , I was for@@ ced to drop out of school ."
I looked at my father and looked at those d@@ ry fiel@@ ds .
It was the future I cou@@ ldn &apos;t ac@@ cept .
"I f@@ el@@ t very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so I was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to do anything possible to rec@@ ei@@ ve education ."
So I went to a li@@ bra@@ ry .
"I read bo@@ ok@@ s , science bo@@ ok@@ s , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally physics ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used di@@ ag@@ ram@@ s and pic@@ tures to learn the words around them .
A@@ no@@ ther book put that kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge in my hands .
It said a win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll could pu@@ m@@ p water and gener@@ ate electri@@ city .
"P@@ um@@ p water me@@ ant ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , a de@@ f@@ en@@ se against hu@@ ng@@ er , which we were experiencing by that time ."
So I decided I would build one win@@ d@@ mi@@ ll for myself .
"But I didn &apos;t have materi@@ als to use , so I went to a sc@@ ra@@ p y@@ ar@@ d where I found my materi@@ als ."
"M@@ any people , inclu@@ ding my mother , said I was cra@@ z@@ y ."
"( Laughter ) I found a tra@@ c@@ tor f@@ an , sho@@ ck ab@@ sor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ p@@ es ."
"@@ U@@ sing a bi@@ c@@ y@@ cle f@@ r@@ ame and an old bi@@ c@@ y@@ cle d@@ y@@ nam@@ o , I built my machine ."
It was one light at first .
"And then four li@@ ghts , with s@@ wit@@ ches , and even a circu@@ it b@@ re@@ ak@@ er , mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed after an electri@@ c b@@ ell ."
A@@ no@@ ther machine pu@@ m@@ ps water for ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation .
Q@@ ue@@ ues of people start l@@ ining up at my h@@ ouse ( Laughter ) to char@@ ge their mo@@ bi@@ le phone .
( Applause ) I could not get ri@@ d of them .
"( Laughter ) And the re@@ port@@ ers came too , which le@@ ad to blo@@ gg@@ ers and which le@@ ad to a call from something called TED ."
I had never seen an ai@@ r@@ plan@@ e before .
I had never s@@ le@@ pt in a h@@ ot@@ el .
"So , on sta@@ ge that day in A@@ ru@@ sh@@ a , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;"
"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the A@@ fri@@ c@@ ans , and the poor who are stru@@ gg@@ ling with your dre@@ am@@ s ."
G@@ od ble@@ ss .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
"I say to you , trust yourself and believe ."
"W@@ hat@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
We re@@ tain just 2@@ 5 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about en@@ jo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e s@@ oun@@ ds .
"This , for example , is my tu@@ m@@ ble dr@@ y@@ er ."
"Now sound is my pas@@ sion , it &apos;s my life ."
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relation@@ ship between science and human val@@ ues .
"Now , it &apos;s gener@@ ally underst@@ ood that questions of morality — questions of good and evi@@ l and right and wrong — are questions about which science of@@ fi@@ ci@@ ally has no op@@ ini@@ on ."
"It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we val@@ ue , but it can never tell us what we ou@@ ght to val@@ ue ."
"And , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th li@@ ving for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is wor@@ th d@@ ying for ? &quot;"
&quot; What con@@ stit@@ utes a good life ? &quot;
"So , I &apos;m going to ar@@ g@@ ue that this is an il@@ lu@@ sion — that the se@@ pa@@ ration between science and human val@@ ues is an il@@ lu@@ sion — and actually quite a dang@@ er@@ ous one at this point in human history ."
"Now , it &apos;s of@@ ten said that science cannot give us a f@@ oun@@ dation for morality and human val@@ ues , because science de@@ als with fac@@ ts , and fac@@ ts and val@@ ues seem to b@@ el@@ ong to different s@@ ph@@ er@@ es ."
It &apos;s of@@ ten thought that there &apos;s no descri@@ p@@ tion of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ou@@ ght to be .
But I think this is quite c@@ lear@@ ly un@@ true .
V@@ al@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are fac@@ ts about the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have e@@ thi@@ cal ob@@ lig@@ ations to@@ ward ro@@ cks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for ro@@ cks ?
"It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think ro@@ cks can su@@ ff@@ er . And if we &apos;re more con@@ cer@@ ned about our f@@ el@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es than we are about in@@ sec@@ ts , as in@@ de@@ ed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re ex@@ pos@@ ed to a great@@ er range of potenti@@ al happiness and su@@ ffer@@ ing ."
"Now , the c@@ ru@@ cial thing to noti@@ ce here is that this is a fac@@ tual c@@ lai@@ m : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ ue@@ d the relation@@ ship between bio@@ logical comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity and the possi@@ bil@@ ities of experience well then we could be wrong about the in@@ ner lives of in@@ sec@@ ts ."
"And there &apos;s no noti@@ on , no ver@@ sion of human morality and human val@@ ues that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ ci@@ ble to a con@@ cer@@ n about con@@ sci@@ ous experience and its possible changes ."
"E@@ ven if you get your val@@ ues from religi@@ on , even if you think that good and evi@@ l ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely rela@@ te to conditions after death — ei@@ ther to an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of happiness with G@@ od or an et@@ er@@ n@@ ity of su@@ ffer@@ ing in h@@ ell — you are still con@@ cer@@ ned about con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness and its changes ."
"And to say that such changes can per@@ si@@ st after death is itself a fac@@ tual c@@ lai@@ m , which , of course , may or may not be true ."
"Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a contin@@ u@@ um of such fac@@ ts ."
"We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a fai@@ led state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot fe@@ ed their children , where st@@ rang@@ ers cannot find the ba@@ sis for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful col@@ la@@ bo@@ ration , where people are mu@@ r@@ der@@ ed in@@ di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nately ."
"And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this contin@@ u@@ um to@@ wards something quite a bit more i@@ d@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c , to a place where a con@@ fer@@ ence like this is even con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able ."
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to how to move in this space .
W@@ ould ad@@ ding ch@@ ol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
P@@ ro@@ ba@@ bly not .
"W@@ ould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evi@@ l ey@@ e , so that when bad things happened to them they im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely bl@@ ame their ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors ? P@@ ro@@ ba@@ bly not ."
"There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human commun@@ ities fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths ."
And morality rela@@ t@@ es to these tru@@ ths .
"So , in talking about val@@ ues we are talking about fac@@ ts ."
"Now , of course our sit@@ u@@ ation in the world can be underst@@ ood at many lev@@ els — from the level of the gen@@ ome on up to the level of economic systems and political ar@@ rang@@ ements ."
"But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of nec@@ ess@@ ity , talking about the human brain ."
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realiz@@ ed in the brain — w@@ hat@@ ever happens after death .
"E@@ ven if the su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bomb@@ er does get 7@@ 2 vi@@ r@@ g@@ ins in the af@@ ter@@ life , in this life , his perso@@ na@@ lity — his rather un@@ for@@ tu@@ nate perso@@ na@@ lity — is the produc@@ t of his brain ."
"So the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as in@@ de@@ ed it does , it changes us by chang@@ ing our bra@@ ins ."
"And so ther@@ e@@ fore w@@ hat@@ ever cul@@ tu@@ ral vari@@ ation there is in how human beings fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh can , at lea@@ st in princi@@ ple , be underst@@ ood in the con@@ t@@ ex@@ t of a ma@@ tu@@ ring science of the mind — neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , psycho@@ logy , et@@ c ."
"So , what I &apos;m argu@@ ing is that val@@ ue &apos;s re@@ duc@@ ed to fac@@ ts — to fac@@ ts about the con@@ sci@@ ous experience of con@@ sci@@ ous beings ."
And we can ther@@ e@@ fore vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
"And I think of this as kind of a moral lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape , with pe@@ ak@@ s and val@@ le@@ ys that cor@@ respon@@ d to differences in the well-being of con@@ sci@@ ous cre@@ atures , both perso@@ nal and col@@ lec@@ tive ."
"And one thing to noti@@ ce is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we ra@@ rely ac@@ c@@ ess , that few people ac@@ c@@ ess ."
And these a@@ wait our disco@@ very .
P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps some of these states can be app@@ rop@@ ri@@ at@@ ely called my@@ sti@@ cal or spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al .
P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps there are other states that we can &apos;t ac@@ c@@ ess because of how our min@@ ds are struc@@ tured but other min@@ ds possi@@ bly could ac@@ c@@ ess them .
"Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scienti@@ fi@@ c ans@@ w@@ ers to every con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able moral question ."
"I don &apos;t think , for in@@ stance , that you will one day con@@ sul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bom@@ b I@@ ran &apos;s nu@@ clear fac@@ il@@ ities , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the fu@@ ll cost of TED as a bu@@ siness ex@@ pen@@ se ."
"( Laughter ) But if questions aff@@ ect human well-being then they do have ans@@ w@@ ers , whether or not we can find them ."
"And just ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ing this — just ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ing that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to the question of how humans fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions of human co@@ oper@@ ation in the future ."
"For in@@ stance , there are 2@@ 1 states in our country where cor@@ po@@ ral p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment in the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room is le@@ g@@ al , where it is le@@ g@@ al for a teacher to be@@ at a child with a wo@@ o@@ den bo@@ ar@@ d , hard , and ra@@ is@@ ing large b@@ ru@@ is@@ es and bli@@ st@@ ers and even b@@ re@@ ak@@ ing the sk@@ in ."
"And hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of children , inci@@ d@@ en@@ tally , are sub@@ jec@@ ted to this every year ."
"The lo@@ c@@ ations of these en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts , I think , will fai@@ l to surpri@@ se you ."
We &apos;re not talking about Con@@ nec@@ ti@@ c@@ ut .
And the ra@@ tiona@@ le for this behavior is exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly religi@@ ous .
"The cre@@ at@@ or of the universe h@@ im@@ self has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , le@@ st we sp@@ oil the child — this is in P@@ ro@@ ver@@ b@@ s 1@@ 3 and 20 , and I believe , 2@@ 3 ."
"But we can ask the ob@@ vi@@ ous question : I@@ s it a good idea , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , to sub@@ ject children to pain and violence and publi@@ c hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation as a way of en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing heal@@ thy em@@ oti@@ onal develop@@ ment and good behavior ?"
"( Laughter ) I@@ s there any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that this question has an answer , and that it mat@@ ters ?"
"Now , many of you might wor@@ ry that the noti@@ on of well-being is truly un@@ defin@@ ed , and see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly per@@ pe@@ tually open to be re@@ -@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ ue@@ d ."
"And so , how ther@@ e@@ fore can there be an ob@@ jec@@ tive noti@@ on of well-being ?"
"Well , con@@ sider by anal@@ o@@ gy , the con@@ cept of physical health ."
The con@@ cept of physical health is un@@ defin@@ ed .
"As we just heard from M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ p@@ ec@@ ter , it has changed over the years ."
Wh@@ en this sta@@ tue was car@@ ved the average life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 8@@ 0 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ ddle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to ru@@ n a ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on at age 200 will be con@@ si@@ der@@ ed a pro@@ found dis@@ ab@@ il@@ ity .
P@@ eople will sen@@ d you do@@ na@@ tions when you &apos;re in that con@@ dition .
"( Laughter ) N@@ oti@@ ce that the fact that the con@@ cept of health is open , gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it vac@@ u@@ ous ."
The dist@@ in@@ ction between a heal@@ thy person and a de@@ ad one is about as clear and con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
A@@ no@@ ther thing to noti@@ ce is there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape : There may be equi@@ val@@ ent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ; there may be equi@@ val@@ ent ways to organiz@@ e a human society so as to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing .
"Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ m@@ ine an ob@@ jec@@ tive morality ?"
Well think of how we talk about fo@@ od : I would never be t@@ emp@@ ted to ar@@ g@@ ue to you that there must be one right fo@@ od to e@@ at .
There is c@@ lear@@ ly a range of materi@@ als that con@@ stit@@ ute heal@@ thy fo@@ od .
But there &apos;s ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess a clear dist@@ in@@ ction between fo@@ od and po@@ i@@ son .
"The fact that there are many right ans@@ w@@ ers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is fo@@ od ? &quot; &quot; does not t@@ emp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nu@@ tr@@ ition ."
M@@ any people wor@@ ry that a univer@@ sa@@ l morality would requi@@ re moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that ad@@ mit of no ex@@ cep@@ tions .
"So , for in@@ stance , if it &apos;s really wrong to li@@ e , it must always be wrong to li@@ e , and if you can find an ex@@ cep@@ tion , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral tru@@ th ."
Why would we think this ?
"C@@ on@@ sider , by anal@@ o@@ gy , the game of ch@@ ess ."
"Now , if you &apos;re going to pla@@ y good ch@@ ess , a princi@@ ple like , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t l@@ ose your Q@@ ue@@ en , &quot; &quot; is very good to fol@@ low ."
But it c@@ lear@@ ly ad@@ mit@@ s some ex@@ cep@@ tions .
There are mom@@ ents when l@@ os@@ ing your Q@@ ue@@ en is a bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant thing to do .
There are mom@@ ents when it is the only good thing you can do .
"And yet , ch@@ ess is a do@@ main of perf@@ ect ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vity ."
The fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
"Now , this bri@@ ngs us to the sor@@ ts of mo@@ ves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral s@@ ph@@ ere ."
Con@@ sider the great problem of women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can co@@ ver them up .
"Now , it is the position , gener@@ ally speak@@ ing , of our intel@@ lec@@ tual commun@@ ity that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in B@@ os@@ ton or P@@ al@@ o A@@ l@@ to , who are we to say that the p@@ rou@@ d d@@ en@@ iz@@ ens of an an@@ ci@@ ent culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters to live in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ?"
"And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to be@@ at them with le@@ ng@@ ths of ste@@ el c@@ able , or th@@ row b@@ att@@ ery ac@@ id in their fac@@ es if they dec@@ line the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of being s@@ mo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?"
"Well , who are we not to say this ?"
Wh@@ o are we to pret@@ end that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non@@ -@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ mental about a p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce like this ?
"I &apos;m not talking about vol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry w@@ ear@@ ing of a v@@ ei@@ l — women should be able to w@@ ear w@@ hat@@ ever they want , as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned ."
"But what does vol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry mean in a commun@@ ity where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first im@@ pul@@ se , rather of@@ ten , is to mu@@ r@@ der her out of sha@@ me ?"
"@@ Just let that fact det@@ o@@ nate in your brain for a min@@ ute : Y@@ our daughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is k@@ ill her ."
What are the chan@@ ces that re@@ pres@@ ents a p@@ eak of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing ?
"Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perf@@ ect sol@@ ution in our own society ."
"For in@@ stance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a ne@@ w@@ s@@ st@@ and almost any@@ where in the civi@@ li@@ zed world ."
"Now , gr@@ ant@@ ed , for many men it may requi@@ re a de@@ g@@ ree in ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y to see something wrong with these imag@@ es ."
"( Laughter ) But if we are in a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; I@@ s this the perf@@ ect ex@@ pres@@ sion of psycho@@ logical bal@@ ance with resp@@ ect to vari@@ ab@@ les like you@@ th and beau@@ ty and women &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the op@@ ti@@ mal environment in which to rai@@ se our children ?"
"P@@ ro@@ ba@@ bly not . O@@ K , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spec@@ tru@@ m between these two extre@@ m@@ es that re@@ pres@@ ents a place of better bal@@ ance ."
"( Applause ) P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps there are many such pla@@ ces — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pe@@ ak@@ s on the moral lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape ."
But the thing to noti@@ ce is that there will be many more ways not to be on a p@@ eak .
"Now the i@@ ron@@ y , from my per@@ spec@@ tive , is that the only people who seem to gener@@ ally ag@@ ree with me and who think that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions are religi@@ ous de@@ ma@@ go@@ g@@ ues of one form or another ."
"And of course they think they have right ans@@ w@@ ers to moral questions because they got these ans@@ w@@ ers from a v@@ oi@@ ce in a whi@@ r@@ l@@ w@@ ind , not because they made an intellig@@ ent anal@@ y@@ sis of the cau@@ ses and con@@ dition of human and an@@ ima@@ l well-being ."
"In fact , the en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce of religi@@ on as a l@@ ens through which most people view moral questions has se@@ pa@@ rat@@ ed most moral talk from real questions of human and an@@ ima@@ l su@@ ffer@@ ing ."
This is why we sp@@ end our time talking about things like ga@@ y mar@@ ri@@ age and not about gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de or nu@@ clear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or po@@ ver@@ ty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely con@@ se@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the de@@ ma@@ go@@ g@@ ues are right about one thing : We need a univer@@ sa@@ l con@@ cep@@ tion of human val@@ ues .
"Now , what stan@@ ds in the way of this ?"
"Well , one thing to noti@@ ce is that we do something different when talking about morality — es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally s@@ ecu@@ lar , acade@@ mic , scienti@@ st ty@@ p@@ es ."
Wh@@ en talking about morality we val@@ ue differences of op@@ ini@@ on in a way that we don &apos;t in any other are@@ a of our lives .
"So , for in@@ stance the D@@ a@@ lai L@@ am@@ a gets up every morning me@@ dit@@ ating on compassion , and he thin@@ ks that hel@@ ping other human beings is an int@@ e@@ gra@@ l comp@@ on@@ ent of human happiness ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y ; T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y was very f@@ on@@ d of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and t@@ or@@ tu@@ ring and k@@ il@@ ling young women ."
"So , we app@@ ear to have a gen@@ u@@ ine difference of op@@ ini@@ on about how to prof@@ it@@ ab@@ ly use one &apos;s time ."
"( Laughter ) M@@ ost W@@ est@@ ern intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als look at this sit@@ u@@ ation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the D@@ a@@ lai L@@ am@@ a to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y to be really wrong about that ad@@ mit@@ s of a real argu@@ ment that potenti@@ ally f@@ al@@ ls within the pur@@ view of science ."
"He lik@@ es cho@@ co@@ late , he lik@@ es v@@ an@@ il@@ la ."
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should per@@ su@@ a@@ de the other . &quot; &quot; N@@ oti@@ ce that we don &apos;t do this in science .
O@@ n the left you have E@@ d@@ ward W@@ itt@@ en .
He &apos;s a string the@@ ori@@ st .
"If you ask the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ sts around who is the smar@@ test physi@@ ci@@ st around , in my experience half of them will say E@@ d W@@ itt@@ en ."
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
"( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics con@@ fer@@ ence and said , &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us ."
It doesn &apos;t re@@ so@@ nate with me . It &apos;s not how I ch@@ ose to view the universe at a small scal@@ e .
"I &apos;m not a f@@ an . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physi@@ ci@@ st ; I don &apos;t understand string theory ."
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ und@@ y of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to b@@ el@@ ong to any string theory clu@@ b that would have me as a mem@@ ber .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we are talking about fac@@ ts certain op@@ ini@@ ons must be ex@@ clu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a do@@ main of exper@@ ti@@ se .
That is what it is for kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge to cou@@ nt .
"@@ How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves that in the moral s@@ ph@@ ere there is no such thing as moral exper@@ ti@@ se , or moral tal@@ ent , or moral g@@ eni@@ us even ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ "
that every op@@ ini@@ on has to cou@@ nt ? How have we con@@ v@@ in@@ ced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these sub@@ jects wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ?
D@@ oes the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an have a point of view on physics that is wor@@ th con@@ si@@ der@@ ing ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ig@@ nor@@ ance any less ob@@ vi@@ ous on the sub@@ ject of human well-being ?
"( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now ."
"It needs people like ourselves to ad@@ mit that there are right and wrong ans@@ w@@ ers to questions of human fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shing , and morality rela@@ t@@ es to that do@@ main of fac@@ ts ."
"It is possible for individu@@ als , and even for whole cul@@ tures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have belie@@ f@@ s and de@@ si@@ res that reli@@ ab@@ ly le@@ ad to ne@@ ed@@ less human su@@ ffer@@ ing ."
Just ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ing this will trans@@ form our dis@@ course about morality .
"We live in a world in which the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies between na@@ tions mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing ."
"We live in a world fil@@ led with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ inv@@ ent@@ ed ; it will always be ea@@ si@@ er to b@@ rea@@ k things than to fi@@ x them ."
"It seems to me , ther@@ e@@ fore , pat@@ ently ob@@ vi@@ ous that we can no more resp@@ ect and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ a@@ st differences in noti@@ ons of human well-being than we can resp@@ ect or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate v@@ a@@ st differences in the noti@@ ons about how disease sp@@ rea@@ ds , or in the sa@@ f@@ ety stan@@ dar@@ ds of buil@@ di@@ ngs and ai@@ r@@ plan@@ es ."
We simply must con@@ ver@@ ge on the ans@@ w@@ ers we give to the most important questions in human life .
"And to do that , we have to ad@@ mit that these questions have ans@@ w@@ ers ."
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ n@@ der@@ son : So , some com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble material there ."
"W@@ he@@ ther in this au@@ dience or people el@@ se@@ where in the world , hear@@ ing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ ra@@ ge thing , after as well , some of them ."
L@@ ang@@ u@@ a@@ ge seems to be really important here .
"When you &apos;re talking about the v@@ ei@@ l , you &apos;re talking about women dre@@ s@@ sed in cl@@ ot@@ h ba@@ gs ."
"I &apos;ve li@@ ved in the M@@ us@@ li@@ m world , sp@@ ok@@ en with a lot of M@@ us@@ li@@ m women ."
"And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a cel@@ eb@@ ration of fe@@ ma@@ le speci@@ al@@ ness , it hel@@ ps build that and it &apos;s a resul@@ t of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is argu@@ ab@@ ly a so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated psycho@@ logical view — &quot; that ma@@ le lu@@ st is not to be tru@@ sted . &quot;"
"S@@ am H@@ ar@@ ris : Y@@ eah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sent@@ ence , wat@@ ching the c@@ lo@@ ck ti@@ cking , but the question is : What is vol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry in a con@@ t@@ ex@@ t where men have certain exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , and you &apos;re gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ ed to be tre@@ ated in a certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ ei@@ l yourself ?"
"And so , if any@@ one in this room wanted to w@@ ear a v@@ ei@@ l , or a very fun@@ ny ha@@ t , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be f@@ ree to vol@@ un@@ ta@@ ri@@ ly do w@@ hat@@ ever we want , but we have to be hon@@ est about the con@@ st@@ ra@@ int@@ s that these women are pla@@ ced under ."
"And so I think we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be so ea@@ ger to always take their word for it , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally when it &apos;s 1@@ 20 de@@ gre@@ es out and you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing a fu@@ ll bur@@ q@@ a ."
C@@ A : A lot of people want to believe in this con@@ cept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
"I think I underst@@ ood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimen@@ sional , where we all have to think the same ."
"P@@ a@@ int your picture of what ro@@ l@@ ling the c@@ lo@@ ck 50 years for@@ ward , 100 years for@@ ward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ an@@ c@@ ing moral progress with rich@@ ness ."
"S@@ H : Well , I think once you ad@@ mit that we are on the pat@@ h to@@ ward understanding our min@@ ds at the level of the brain in some important de@@ tai@@ l , then you have to ad@@ mit that we are going to understand all of the positive and neg@@ ative qu@@ al@@ ities of ourselves in much great@@ er de@@ tai@@ l ."
"So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social em@@ oti@@ on like empa@@ thy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the fac@@ tors that en@@ coura@@ ge it — whether they &apos;re g@@ ene@@ tic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we beg@@ in to sh@@ ine light on that we are in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly going to con@@ ver@@ ge on that fact space ."
"So , everything is not going to be up for gra@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ il@@ ing my daughter from bir@@ th is just as good as teach@@ ing her to be con@@ fi@@ dent and well-@@ educ@@ ated in the con@@ t@@ ex@@ t of men who do de@@ si@@ re women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that compu@@ l@@ s@@ ory ve@@ il@@ ing is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to s@@ can the bra@@ ins of everyone inv@@ ol@@ ved and actually inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ate them .
Do people love their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are c@@ lear@@ ly right ans@@ w@@ ers to that .
"C@@ A : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you pre@@ pa@@ red to shi@@ ft your in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tive curr@@ ent ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment on some of these is@@ sue@@ s ?"
"S@@ H : Well y@@ eah , mo@@ du@@ l@@ o one ob@@ vi@@ ous fact , that you can love someone in the con@@ t@@ ex@@ t of a truly d@@ el@@ u@@ sional belie@@ f system ."
"So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my ga@@ y son was going to go to h@@ ell if he found a bo@@ y@@ fri@@ end , I chop@@ ped his head off . And that was the most compas@@ sio@@ nate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts ali@@ g@@ ned , y@@ es I think you could probably be feel@@ ing the em@@ oti@@ on of love ."
"But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a lar@@ ger con@@ t@@ ex@@ t ."
"It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feel@@ ing ec@@ sta@@ sy and then blo@@ wing h@@ im@@ self up on a b@@ us ."
"C@@ A : S@@ am , this is a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion I would actually love to contin@@ ue for hours ."
"We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED ."
S@@ H : R@@ e@@ ally an hon@@ or . Thank you .

B@@ lo@@ cks have nam@@ es .
"@@ Just look at Google M@@ ap@@ s here . There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 14 , 15 , 16 , 1@@ 7 , 1@@ 8 , 1@@ 9 ."
"All of these blo@@ cks have nam@@ es , and the stre@@ ets are just the un@@ nam@@ ed spa@@ ces in between the blo@@ cks ."
"And you say then , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , then how do you know your home ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ i@@ stri@@ ct E@@ ight ."
"There &apos;s B@@ lo@@ ck 1@@ 7 , h@@ ouse number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; O@@ K , but walking around the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od , I noti@@ ced that the h@@ ouse numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; O@@ f course they do . They go in the order in which they were built ."
The first h@@ ouse ever built on a blo@@ ck is h@@ ouse number one .
The second h@@ ouse ever built is h@@ ouse number two .
"Th@@ ir@@ d is h@@ ouse number three . It &apos;s easy .

"So , for example , there are do@@ ct@@ ors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you heal@@ thy ."
"So , any mon@@ th you are heal@@ thy you pay them , and when you &apos;re si@@ ck you don &apos;t have to pay them because they fai@@ led at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re heal@@ thy , not si@@ ck ."
"( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the do@@ w@@ n@@ be@@ at , the beginning of the mu@@ si@@ cal ph@@ ra@@ se : one , two , three , four ."
