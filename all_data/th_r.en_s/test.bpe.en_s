T@@ o@@ day I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ exp@@ ected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology in@@ du@@ st@@ ry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by pa@@ ying att@@ ention to ...
... pa@@ ying att@@ ention to c@@ ro@@ w@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing .
It &apos;s just a qui@@ ck vi@@ de@@ o of what we do .
H@@ u@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to lo@@ ad .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just s@@ ki@@ p — I &apos;ll just s@@ ki@@ p through the vi@@ de@@ o instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( M@@ u@@ sic ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
O@@ kay . ( Laughter )
S@@ o@@ lar technology is ...
"O@@ h , that &apos;s all my time ?"
O@@ kay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"So I want to start by o@@ ffer@@ ing you a f@@ ree no@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h life ha@@ ck , and all it requi@@ res of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes ."
"But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ d@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body ."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sma@@ l@@ ler ?
S@@ om@@ e@@ times we hold on@@ to our ar@@ ms like this .
S@@ om@@ e@@ times we sp@@ read out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay att@@ ention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
"So , we &apos;re really f@@ as@@ ci@@ nat@@ ed with body language , and we &apos;re particu@@ larly interest@@ ed in other people &apos;s body language ."
"You know , we &apos;re interest@@ ed in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an a@@ w@@ k@@ ward inter@@ action , or a s@@ mi@@ le , or a con@@ t@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous g@@ lan@@ ce , or maybe a very a@@ w@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a han@@ d@@ sha@@ ke ."
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or : Here they are ar@@ ri@@ ving at N@@ u@@ mb@@ er 10 .
E@@ ven the B@@ B@@ C and The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es .
"So ob@@ vi@@ ously when we think about non@@ ver@@ bal behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scienti@@ sts — it &apos;s language , so we think about comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ation ."
"When we think about comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ation , we think about inter@@ ac@@ tions ."
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make swe@@ ep@@ ing ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
"And those ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments can predic@@ t really mean@@ ing@@ ful life out@@ comes like who we hi@@ re or pr@@ om@@ ot@@ e , who we ask out on a d@@ ate ."
"For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i Am@@ ba@@ dy , a resear@@ ch@@ er at T@@ u@@ f@@ ts Uni@@ ver@@ sity , sho@@ ws that when people watch 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second s@@ oun@@ d@@ less cli@@ ps of real physi@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ pati@@ ent inter@@ ac@@ tions , their ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the physi@@ ci@@ an &apos;s ni@@ cen@@ ess predic@@ t whether or not that physi@@ ci@@ an will be sue@@ d ."
"If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . R@@ ight ?"
"We are also in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thou@@ ghts and our feel@@ ings and our physi@@ o@@ logy ."
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
"I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logi@@ st . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I tea@@ ch at a comp@@ et@@ itive bu@@ siness school , so it was in@@ ev@@ it@@ able that I would become interest@@ ed in power d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
I became es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally interest@@ ed in non@@ ver@@ bal ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance .
And what are non@@ ver@@ bal ex@@ pres@@ sions of power and dom@@ in@@ ance ?
"So in the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , they are about expan@@ ding ."
"So you make yourself big , you stre@@ t@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically op@@ en@@ ing up ."
It &apos;s about op@@ en@@ ing up .
"This ex@@ pres@@ sion , which is known as pri@@ de , J@@ es@@ si@@ c@@ a T@@ racy has studi@@ ed ."
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
"So if someone is being really power@@ ful with us , we t@@ end to make ourselves sma@@ l@@ ler . We don &apos;t mi@@ r@@ r@@ or them ."
"So I &apos;m wat@@ ching this behavior in the cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , and what do I noti@@ ce ?"
"When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of sp@@ read out ."
"You have other people who are vi@@ r@@ tually col@@ lap@@ sing when they come in . A@@ s so@@ on they come in , you see it ."
I noti@@ ce a couple of things about this .
So women are much more lik@@ ely to do this kind of thing than men .
"W@@ om@@ en feel ch@@ ron@@ i@@ cally less power@@ ful than men , so this is not surpri@@ sing ."
"And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A cla@@ s@@ s@@ room , because parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion count@@ s for half the gra@@ de ."
So bu@@ siness schools have been stru@@ gg@@ ling with this gen@@ der gra@@ de ga@@ p .
"So I started to won@@ der , you know , ok@@ ay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing ."
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
"So , for example , we s@@ mi@@ le when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re for@@ ced to s@@ mi@@ le by h@@ ol@@ ding a pen in our te@@ et@@ h like this , it makes us feel happy ."
So it goes both ways .
"So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our min@@ ds change our bo@@ di@@ es , but is it also true that our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ?"
"And when I say min@@ ds , in the case of the power@@ ful , what am I talking about ?"
So what do the min@@ ds of the power@@ ful ver@@ su@@ s the power@@ less look like ?
"So power@@ ful people t@@ end to be , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more con@@ fi@@ dent , more op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic ."
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at g@@ am@@ es of chan@@ ce .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more ris@@ ks .
"But really , power is also about how you re@@ act to stress ."
"So do you want the high@@ -@@ power lead@@ er that &apos;s dom@@ in@@ ant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stress re@@ ac@@ tive ?"
"P@@ ro@@ ba@@ bly not , right ?"
"So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at lea@@ st at the fac@@ i@@ al level , and also that ro@@ le changes can shape the mind ."
"So what happens , ok@@ ay , you take a ro@@ le change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tiny inter@@ v@@ ention ?"
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be s@@ itt@@ ing .
And here are the lo@@ w@@ -@@ power pos@@ es .
"So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small ."
"When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your nec@@ k , you &apos;re really prot@@ ec@@ ting yourself ."
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"So again , two minutes , and you get these changes ."
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ tis@@ ol .
"So it seems that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves ."
"A@@ l@@ so , our bo@@ di@@ es change our min@@ ds ."
"And so we think where you want to use this is ev@@ alu@@ ative sit@@ u@@ ations , like social thre@@ at sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"A@@ g@@ ain , this is not about you talking to other people ."
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . O@@ kay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being rec@@ or@@ ded .
"So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led ."
P@@ eople ha@@ te this .
"We then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them ."
They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the hy@@ pothe@@ sis . They &apos;re bl@@ ind to the conditions .
It &apos;s about the pres@@ ence that they &apos;re bri@@ ng@@ ing to the spe@@ ec@@ h .
These kinds of things .
"So this is what &apos;s dri@@ ving the eff@@ ect , or medi@@ ating the eff@@ ect ."
"So I said , f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"When I was 1@@ 9 , I was in a really bad c@@ ar ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I was th@@ ro@@ wn out of a c@@ ar , ro@@ l@@ led se@@ ver@@ al times ."
I was th@@ ro@@ wn from the c@@ ar .
"I knew my I@@ Q because I had i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied with being smar@@ t , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child ."
"So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back ."
"They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to fin@@ ish college ."
I am an im@@ pos@@ tor .
"You &apos;re going to sta@@ y , and this is what you &apos;re going to do ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did ."
"I don &apos;t feel that any@@ more , but she does , and I get that feel@@ ing ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e , she can f@@ ake it , she can become it ."
So she had changed .
"And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t f@@ ake it ti@@ ll you make it ."
F@@ ake it ti@@ ll you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and inter@@ na@@ li@@ ze .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y t@@ we@@ ak@@ s can le@@ ad to big changes .
"So , this is two minutes ."
"T@@ wo minutes , two minutes , two minutes ."
That &apos;s what you want to do .
G@@ et your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . G@@ et your cor@@ tis@@ ol down .
"D@@ on &apos;t leave that sit@@ u@@ ation feel@@ ing like , o@@ h , I didn &apos;t show them who I am ."
Thank you .
"So it &apos;s 19@@ 9@@ 5 , I &apos;m in college , and a fri@@ end and I go on a ro@@ ad tri@@ p from P@@ ro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de I@@ s@@ land to P@@ or@@ t@@ land , O@@ re@@ g@@ on ."
"And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back ro@@ a@@ ds through state par@@ ks and national fore@@ sts — basically the long@@ est rou@@ te we can possi@@ bly take ."
"And some@@ where in the middle of S@@ ou@@ th D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a , I turn to my fri@@ end and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2@@ ,000 mi@@ les ."
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Ch@@ ine@@ se charac@@ ter I keep see@@ ing by the side of the ro@@ ad ? &quot;
M@@ y fri@@ end looks at me to@@ tally bl@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
There &apos;s actually a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man in the front row who &apos;s doing a perf@@ ect im@@ itation of her look .
"( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the sig@@ ns we keep see@@ ing with the Ch@@ ine@@ se charac@@ ter on them . &quot; &quot; She just sta@@ res at me for a few mom@@ ents , and then she cra@@ cks up , because she figu@@ res out what I &apos;m talking about ."
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
"( Laughter ) R@@ ight , the famous Ch@@ ine@@ se charac@@ ter for pic@@ ni@@ c are@@ a . ( Laughter )"
"I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about sit@@ u@@ ations exactly like this — why we some@@ times mis@@ understand the sig@@ ns around us , and how we be@@ have when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature ."
"In other words , as you heard Ch@@ ris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong ."
"This might stri@@ ke you as a strange care@@ er move , but it actually has one great adv@@ anta@@ ge : no job comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about being wrong , or at lea@@ st to av@@ oi@@ d thinking about the possi@@ bility that we ourselves are wrong ."
We get it in the ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t .
We all know everybody in this room makes mis@@ takes .
"The human speci@@ es , in gener@@ al , is f@@ al@@ li@@ ble — ok@@ ay f@@ ine ."
"But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the belie@@ f@@ s I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly all of this ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t ap@@ preci@@ ation of f@@ al@@ li@@ bility goes out the win@@ do@@ w — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about ."
"And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live ."
We go to me@@ eti@@ ngs in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and v@@ ot@@ e in the present ten@@ se .
"So eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , we all kind of w@@ ind up tra@@ vel@@ ing through life , t@@ rapp@@ ed in this little bubble of feel@@ ing very right about everything ."
I think this is a problem .
"I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individu@@ als , in our perso@@ nal and profes@@ sional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vely as a culture ."
"So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of being right ."
"And second , why it &apos;s such a problem ."
"And finally , I want to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that it is possible to step outside of that feel@@ ing and that if you can do so , it is the single great@@ est moral , intel@@ lec@@ tual and cre@@ ative le@@ ap you can make ."
So why do we get stu@@ ck in this feel@@ ing of being right ?
"One reason , actually , has to do with a feel@@ ing of being wrong ."
"So let me ask you gu@@ ys something — or actually , let me ask you gu@@ ys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — em@@ oti@@ ona@@ lly — how does it feel to be wrong ?"
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ u@@ mb@@ s down .
"E@@ mb@@ ar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing . O@@ kay , wonderful , great ."
"D@@ read@@ ful , thu@@ mb@@ s down , em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing — than@@ k you , these are great ans@@ w@@ ers , but they &apos;re ans@@ w@@ ers to a different question ."
You gu@@ ys are ans@@ wer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realiz@@ e you &apos;re wrong ?
"( Laughter ) R@@ e@@ aliz@@ ing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?"
"I mean it can be de@@ v@@ a@@ sta@@ ting , it can be re@@ ve@@ lat@@ ory , it can actually be quite fun@@ ny , like my stu@@ pi@@ d Ch@@ ine@@ se charac@@ ter mis@@ take ."
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an anal@@ o@@ gy .
Do you remem@@ ber that Lo@@ on@@ y T@@ un@@ es car@@ to@@ on where there &apos;s this pa@@ the@@ tic co@@ yot@@ e who &apos;s always cha@@ sing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
"In pretty much every e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of this car@@ to@@ on , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ yot@@ e is cha@@ sing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner run@@ s off a cli@@ ff , which is f@@ ine — he &apos;s a bir@@ d , he can f@@ ly ."
"But the thing is , the co@@ yot@@ e run@@ s off the cli@@ ff right after him ."
And what &apos;s fun@@ ny — at lea@@ st if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ yot@@ e &apos;s to@@ tally f@@ ine too .
He just ke@@ ep@@ s run@@ ning — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mi@@ d-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he f@@ al@@ ls .
"When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realiz@@ e it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ yot@@ e after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down ."
"You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in tr@@ ou@@ ble , but we feel like we &apos;re on so@@ li@@ d ground ."
So I should actually cor@@ rec@@ t something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it fe@@ els like being right .
"( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a struc@@ tu@@ ral reason , why we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing of ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess ."
I call this er@@ r@@ or bl@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
"M@@ ost of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of inter@@ nal c@@ ue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late ."
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stu@@ ck inside this feel@@ ing as well — and this one is cul@@ tu@@ ral .
Th@@ ink back for a moment to el@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ ry school .
"You &apos;re s@@ itt@@ ing there in cla@@ ss , and your teacher is han@@ ding back qui@@ z pap@@ ers , and one of them looks like this ."
"This is not m@@ ine , by the way ."
"( Laughter ) So there you are in gra@@ de school , and you know exactly what to think about the ki@@ d who got this pap@@ er ."
"It &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b ki@@ d , the tr@@ ou@@ ble@@ mak@@ er , the one who never does his hom@@ e@@ work ."
"So by the time you are n@@ ine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ z@@ y , ir@@ respon@@ sible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to succ@@ e@@ ed in life is to never make any mis@@ takes ."
We learn these really bad le@@ s@@ s@@ ons really well .
"And a lot of us — and I su@@ sp@@ ect , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally a lot of us in this room — de@@ al with them by just becom@@ ing perf@@ ect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ ti@@ oni@@ sts , o@@ ver@@ -@@ achi@@ e@@ ver@@ s ."
"R@@ ight , M@@ r@@ . C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ st , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on@@ er ?"
"( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , ast@@ ro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ ma@@ ra@@ th@@ on@@ ers , it turns out ."
"O@@ kay , so f@@ ine ."
E@@ x@@ cept that then we f@@ rea@@ k out at the possi@@ bility that we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten something wrong .
"Because ac@@ cor@@ ding to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us ."
"So we just in@@ si@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smar@@ t and respon@@ sible and vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous and sa@@ fe ."
So let me tell you a story .
"A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el D@@ e@@ ac@@ on@@ ess M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ en@@ ter for a sur@@ g@@ ery ."
B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el &apos;s in B@@ os@@ ton .
It &apos;s the teach@@ ing h@@ os@@ pit@@ al for H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d — one of the best h@@ os@@ pit@@ als in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the oper@@ ating room .
"She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the sur@@ ge@@ on does his thing — stit@@ ches her back up , sen@@ ds her out to the re@@ co@@ very room ."
E@@ very@@ thing seems to have gone f@@ ine .
"And she w@@ ak@@ es up , and she looks down at h@@ er@@ self , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in ban@@ da@@ ges ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the sur@@ ge@@ on has perfor@@ m@@ ed a maj@@ or oper@@ ation on her left le@@ g instead of her right one ."
"When the vice pre@@ si@@ dent for health care qu@@ ality at B@@ et@@ h I@@ s@@ ra@@ el sp@@ oke about this inci@@ dent , he said something very interesting ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or w@@ hat@@ ever reason , the sur@@ ge@@ on simply f@@ el@@ t that he was on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of the pati@@ ent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ st@@ ing too much in the feel@@ ing of being on the cor@@ rec@@ t side of anything can be very dang@@ er@@ ous ."
This inter@@ nal sense of ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess that we all experience so of@@ ten is not a reli@@ able gu@@ i@@ de to what is actually going on in the ex@@ ter@@ nal world .
"And when we act like it is , and we stop ent@@ er@@ ta@@ ining the possi@@ bility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like du@@ mp@@ ing 200 million g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of oil into the G@@ ul@@ f of M@@ exi@@ c@@ o , or t@@ or@@ pe@@ doing the global econ@@ omy ."
So this is a hu@@ ge p@@ rac@@ ti@@ cal problem .
But it &apos;s also a hu@@ ge social problem .
Th@@ ink for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your belie@@ f@@ s just perf@@ ec@@ tly re@@ fl@@ ect reality .
"And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to sol@@ ve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with you ?"
"It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by re@@ sor@@ ting to a seri@@ es of un@@ for@@ tu@@ nate as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ."
The first thing we u@@ su@@ ally do when someone di@@ sa@@ gre@@ es with us is we just as@@ su@@ me they &apos;re ig@@ nor@@ ant .
"They don &apos;t have ac@@ c@@ ess to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our tea@@ m ."
"When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same fac@@ ts that we do and they still di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us , then we move on to a second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re i@@ di@@ ots ."
"( Laughter ) They have all the right piec@@ es of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le , and they are too mor@@ oni@@ c to put them together cor@@ rec@@ tly ."
"And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree with us have all the same fac@@ ts we do and are actually pretty smar@@ t , then we move on to a thir@@ d as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion : they know the tru@@ th , and they are d@@ eli@@ ber@@ at@@ ely dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own ma@@ lev@@ ol@@ ent pur@@ pos@@ es ."
So this is a ca@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ ph@@ e .
This atta@@ ch@@ ment to our own ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess ke@@ ep@@ s us from pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mis@@ takes when we ab@@ solutely need to and cau@@ ses us to treat each other ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"But to me , what &apos;s most ba@@ ff@@ ling and most tra@@ gi@@ c about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human ."
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our min@@ ds are just these perf@@ ec@@ tly trans@@ lu@@ c@@ ent win@@ do@@ ws and we just ga@@ ze out of them and descri@@ be the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to ga@@ ze out of the same win@@ do@@ w and see the ex@@ act same thing .
"That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredi@@ bly bor@@ ing ."
The mi@@ rac@@ le of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
"We can remem@@ ber the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place ."
"And we all do this a little differ@@ ently , which is why we can all look up at the same ni@@ ght sk@@ y and see this and also this and also this ."
"And y@@ eah , it is also why we get things wrong ."
"@@ 1@@ ,@@ 200 years before D@@ es@@ car@@ t@@ es said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think ther@@ e@@ fore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , S@@ t@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; F@@ al@@ l@@ or er@@ go su@@ m &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r ther@@ e@@ fore I am . &quot;"
"A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ ine underst@@ ood that our cap@@ ac@@ ity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sing de@@ f@@ ect in the human system , something we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate or o@@ ver@@ come ."
It &apos;s to@@ tally fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal to who we are .
"Because , un@@ like G@@ od , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there ."
"And un@@ like all of the other an@@ ima@@ ls , we are ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with trying to figure it out ."
"T@@ o me , this ob@@ se@@ s@@ sion is the sour@@ ce and ro@@ ot of all of our produc@@ ti@@ vity and cre@@ ati@@ vity ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ st year , for vari@@ ous reas@@ ons , I found myself li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a lot of e@@ pi@@ so@@ des of the P@@ u@@ bli@@ c R@@ a@@ di@@ o show This American L@@ i@@ fe ."
"And so I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing and I &apos;m li@@ st@@ en@@ ing , and at some point , I start feel@@ ing like all the stories are about being wrong ."
"And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it ."
I &apos;ve become the cra@@ z@@ y w@@ rong@@ ness la@@ dy .
"I just imag@@ ined it every@@ where , &quot; &quot; which has happened ."
"But a couple of months later , I actually had a chan@@ ce to inter@@ view I@@ ra G@@ la@@ ss , who &apos;s the h@@ ost of the show ."
"And I men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true ."
"In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a sta@@ ff , we j@@ oke that every single e@@ pi@@ so@@ de of our show has the same c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me ."
"And the c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ -@@ the@@ me is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra G@@ la@@ ss , &quot; &quot; we need this ."
"We need these mom@@ ents of surpri@@ se and re@@ ver@@ sa@@ l and w@@ rong@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , au@@ dience mem@@ b@@ ers , as li@@ st@@ en@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we e@@ at this stuff up ."
We love things like p@@ lot twi@@ sts and red h@@ er@@ ri@@ ngs and surpri@@ se en@@ di@@ ngs .
"When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong ."
"But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this ."
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
"@@ G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ u@@ sh thought he was going to inv@@ a@@ de I@@ ra@@ q , find a bun@@ ch of we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ struc@@ tion , liber@@ ate the people and bring demo@@ c@@ racy to the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ a@@ st ."

"And H@@ os@@ n@@ i M@@ u@@ ba@@ ra@@ k thought he was going to be the dic@@ tat@@ or of E@@ g@@ y@@ pt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too si@@ ck and could pa@@ ss the re@@ ig@@ ns of power on@@ to his son ."
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and mar@@ ry your high school swe@@ e@@ the@@ art and move back to your hom@@ et@@ own and rai@@ se a bun@@ ch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writ@@ ing an incredi@@ bly ner@@ dy book about a sub@@ ject everybody hat@@ es for an au@@ dience that would never materi@@ aliz@@ e .
And something else happened instead .
"( Laughter ) I mean , this is life ."
"For good and for ill , we gener@@ ate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ es us ."
"@@ No off@@ en@@ se , but this enti@@ re con@@ fer@@ ence is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able mon@@ u@@ ment to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to get stuff wrong ."
"We just spent an enti@@ re week talking about in@@ nov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ ements and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ements , but you know why we need all of those in@@ nov@@ ations and adv@@ an@@ c@@ ements and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ements ?"
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling and wor@@ l@@ d-@@ al@@ ter@@ ing — TED 19@@ 9@@ 8 — e@@ h .
"( Laughter ) D@@ i@@ dn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )"
"W@@ here &apos;s my j@@ et pa@@ ck , Ch@@ ris ? ( Laughter )"
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another con@@ fer@@ ence .
"The the@@ me of this one , as you gu@@ ys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ disco@@ very of won@@ der ."
"And to me , if you really want to re@@ disco@@ ver won@@ der , you need to step outside of that tiny , ter@@ ri@@ fied space of ri@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess and look around at each other and look out at the v@@ ast@@ ness and comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity and my@@ st@@ ery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , I don &apos;t know ."
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you gu@@ ys . ( Applause )
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challeng@@ es .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a mon@@ th .
I would never have been that adv@@ en@@ tu@@ rou@@ s before I started my 3@@ 0@@ -@@ day challeng@@ es .
It &apos;s a@@ w@@ ful .
"In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fu@@ n ."
( Applause )
"This little bo@@ y is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , when I grow up , I want to be a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great ble@@ s@@ sing as a for@@ mer pre@@ si@@ dent , because I have had an ac@@ c@@ ess that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe ."
"@@ Not only am I fami@@ li@@ ar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have vi@@ sit@@ ed more than 1@@ 45 countries in the world , and the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter has had fu@@ l@@ l-@@ time pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s in 8@@ 0 na@@ tions on Earth ."
"So our o@@ ver@@ all com@@ mit@@ ment at the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is to pr@@ om@@ ot@@ e human ri@@ ghts , and kno@@ wing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equi@@ v@@ oc@@ ation that the number one ab@@ use of human ri@@ ghts on Earth is , st@@ rang@@ ely , not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed quite of@@ ten , is the ab@@ use of women and girls ."
( Applause ) There are a couple of reas@@ ons for this that I &apos;ll men@@ tion to beg@@ in with .
"F@@ irst of all is the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of religi@@ ous scri@@ p@@ tures , ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures , in the Bi@@ ble , O@@ ld T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent , Q@@ u@@ ran and so for@@ th , and these have been mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted by men who are now in the as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant pos@@ iti@@ ons in the sy@@ na@@ go@@ g@@ ues and the ch@@ ur@@ ches and in the m@@ os@@ qu@@ es ."
And they inter@@ pre@@ t these ru@@ les to make sure that women are ordina@@ ri@@ ly re@@ le@@ g@@ ated to a secon@@ dar@@ y position com@@ pa@@ red to men in the ey@@ es of G@@ od .
This is a very seri@@ ous problem . It &apos;s ordina@@ ri@@ ly not ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sed .
But the basic thing is the scri@@ p@@ tures are mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted to keep men in an as@@ cen@@ d@@ ant position .
"That is an al@@ l-@@ per@@ v@@ a@@ sive problem , because men can ex@@ er@@ t that power and if an ab@@ u@@ sive hus@@ b@@ and or an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , for in@@ stance , want@@ s to che@@ at women , they can say that if women are not equal in the ey@@ es of G@@ od , why should I treat them as equ@@ als myself ?"
"The other very seri@@ ous bli@@ ght that cau@@ ses this problem is the exc@@ es@@ sive re@@ sort to violence , and that is increas@@ ing tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously around the world ."
"When I was in of@@ fi@@ ce as gover@@ nor of G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , one out of every 1@@ ,000 Americ@@ ans were in pri@@ son ."
"@@ No@@ wa@@ days , 7@@ .@@ 3 people per 1@@ ,000 are in pri@@ son ."
That &apos;s a se@@ v@@ en@@ fo@@ ld increase .
And we r@@ ank right al@@ ong@@ side the countries that are most ab@@ u@@ sive in all el@@ ements of human ri@@ ghts in en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing the death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty .
"If you ad@@ d that up , that &apos;s 3@@ 0@@ 7 million dollars it cos@@ ts C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a to sen@@ d a person to be ex@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed ."
"@@ Let me just go down a very few ab@@ u@@ ses of women that con@@ cer@@ n me most , and I &apos;ll be fai@@ r@@ ly bri@@ e@@ f , because I have a limit@@ ed amount of time , as you know ."
One is gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
"And some@@ times , in more extre@@ me c@@ ases but not very ra@@ re c@@ ases , they se@@ w the ori@@ fi@@ ce up so the girl can just u@@ ri@@ nate or men@@ stru@@ ate ."
"This is not a ra@@ re thing , al@@ though it &apos;s against the la@@ w in most countries ."
"In E@@ g@@ y@@ pt , for in@@ stance , 9@@ 1 percent of all the fe@@ ma@@ les that live in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt today have been se@@ x@@ u@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated in that way ."
This is a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble aff@@ lic@@ tion on all women that live in those countries .
"And this is done by mem@@ b@@ ers of her own family , so the family becomes mu@@ r@@ der@@ ers when the girl bri@@ ngs so@@ -@@ called dis@@ gra@@ ce to the family ."
"A@@ no@@ ther problem that we have in the world that rela@@ t@@ es to women particu@@ larly is s@@ la@@ very , or human tra@@ ffi@@ cking it &apos;s called no@@ wa@@ days ."
There were about 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million people so@@ ld from A@@ fri@@ c@@ a into s@@ la@@ very in the New World back in the 19@@ th century and the 18@@ th century .
There are 30 million people now li@@ ving in s@@ la@@ very .
"The United States D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment of S@@ tat@@ e now has a man@@ d@@ ate from C@@ ong@@ re@@ ss to give a re@@ por@@ t every year , and the S@@ tat@@ e D@@ ep@@ ar@@ t@@ ment re@@ por@@ ts that 8@@ 0@@ 0,000 people are so@@ ld across inter@@ national bor@@ ders every year into s@@ la@@ very , and that 8@@ 0 percent of those so@@ ld are women , into se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very ."
"In the United States right this moment , 6@@ 0,000 people are li@@ ving in human bon@@ da@@ ge , or s@@ la@@ very ."
"A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , where the C@@ ar@@ ter C@@ en@@ ter is lo@@ c@@ ated and where I tea@@ ch at E@@ m@@ ory Uni@@ ver@@ sity , they have between 200 and 3@@ 00 women , people so@@ ld into s@@ la@@ very every mon@@ th ."
It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
"If a bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner want@@ s to buy a girl that has bro@@ wn or black sk@@ in , they can do it for 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"A wh@@ it@@ e-@@ s@@ kin@@ ned girl bri@@ ngs se@@ ver@@ al times more than that , and the average bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ ner in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a and in the United States now can ear@@ n about $ 3@@ 5,000 per s@@ la@@ ve ."
"The sex tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a , exc@@ ee@@ ds the to@@ tal drug tra@@ de in A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ a , G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a ."
Swe@@ den has got a good approach to it .
"A@@ b@@ out 15 to 20 years ago , Swe@@ den decided to change the la@@ w , and women are no longer p@@ ros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed if they are in se@@ x@@ u@@ al s@@ la@@ very , but the bro@@ the@@ l o@@ w@@ n@@ ers and the p@@ im@@ ps and the ma@@ le cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are p@@ ros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , and — ( Applause ) — p@@ ros@@ tit@@ ution has gone down ."
"In the United States , we take just the op@@ pos@@ ite position ."
"For every ma@@ le ar@@ re@@ sted for il@@ le@@ g@@ al sex tra@@ de , 2@@ 5 women are ar@@ re@@ sted in the United States of America ."
"In the mil@@ it@@ ary , they are now anal@@ y@@ zing how many se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts take place ."
"O@@ n@@ ly 3@@ ,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually p@@ ros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed , and the reason is that the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fi@@ cer of any organiz@@ ation — a ship like my sub@@ mar@@ ine , or a b@@ atta@@ lion in the A@@ r@@ my or a compan@@ y in the Mar@@ in@@ es — the com@@ man@@ ding of@@ fi@@ cer has the right under la@@ w to deci@@ de whether to p@@ ros@@ ec@@ ute a rap@@ i@@ st or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for any@@ body to know that under their comm@@ and , se@@ x@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts are taking place , so they do not do it ."
That la@@ w needs to be changed .
They &apos;re not p@@ ros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ed .
Th@@ ose are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
"A@@ no@@ ther thing that &apos;s very seri@@ ous about the ab@@ use of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is some@@ times mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ ted , but for fu@@ l@@ l-@@ time emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , a woman in the United States now gets 2@@ 3 percent less than a man ."
"When I became pre@@ si@@ dent , the difference was 3@@ 9 percent ."
These are the kind of things that go on .
"If you take the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies , 2@@ 3 of them have women C@@ E@@ O@@ s , out of 5@@ 00 , and those C@@ E@@ O@@ s , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other C@@ E@@ O@@ s ."
"Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country ."
A@@ no@@ ther problem with the United States is we are the most war@@ like nation on Earth .
We have been to war with about 2@@ 5 different countries since the S@@ econ@@ d World War .
"S@@ om@@ e@@ times , we &apos;ve had sol@@ di@@ ers on the ground fi@@ gh@@ ting ."
"The other times , we &apos;ve been fl@@ ying o@@ ver@@ head drop@@ ping bomb@@ s on people ."
"O@@ ther times , of course , now , we have d@@ ron@@ es that atta@@ ck people and so for@@ th ."
"But any@@ way , those kinds of things , the re@@ sort to violence and the mis@@ inter@@ pre@@ tation of the ho@@ ly scri@@ p@@ tures are what cau@@ ses , are the basic cau@@ ses , of ab@@ use of women and girls ."
"There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not men@@ tion , and that is that in gener@@ al , men don &apos;t give a dam@@ n ."
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
"The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the ab@@ use of women and girls qui@@ et@@ ly ac@@ cep@@ ts the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed position that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y , and this is very si@@ mi@@ lar to what I knew when I was a child , when se@@ pa@@ rate but equal had exi@@ sted ."
"E@@ ven though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nation against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they en@@ jo@@ y a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed position ."
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
The average woman in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lated and so for@@ th .
Thank you very much .
"M@@ y big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lo@@ ck bil@@ lions of big ideas that are at the moment d@@ or@@ man@@ t inside us ."
And my little idea that will do that is s@@ le@@ ep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of s@@ le@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
"And I learned the hard way , the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep ."
"T@@ wo@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ half years ago , I fa@@ int@@ ed from ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion ."
"I h@@ it my head on my de@@ s@@ k . I brok@@ e my che@@ ek@@ b@@ one , I got five stit@@ ches on my right ey@@ e ."
And I beg@@ an the jour@@ ne@@ y of re@@ disco@@ ver@@ ing the val@@ ue of s@@ le@@ ep .
"And in the course of that , I studi@@ ed , I m@@ et with medi@@ cal do@@ ct@@ ors , scienti@@ sts , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more produc@@ tive , more in@@ spi@@ red , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough s@@ le@@ ep ."
"( Applause ) And we women are going to le@@ ad the way in this new re@@ vol@@ ution , this new f@@ em@@ ini@@ st issue ."
"We are liter@@ ally going to s@@ le@@ ep our way to the top , liter@@ ally ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately for men , s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation has become a vi@@ ri@@ lity sy@@ mb@@ ol ."
I was rec@@ ently having din@@ ner with a guy who bra@@ gg@@ ed that he had only g@@ ot@@ ten four hours s@@ le@@ ep the ni@@ ght before .
"And I f@@ el@@ t like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I f@@ el@@ t like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?"
"If you had g@@ ot@@ ten five , this din@@ ner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of s@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation on@@ e-@@ up@@ man@@ ship ."
"E@@ speci@@ ally here in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , if you try to make a b@@ re@@ ak@@ fa@@ st d@@ ate , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re lik@@ ely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck is too late for me , but that &apos;s ok@@ ay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few con@@ fer@@ ence cal@@ ls and me@@ et you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredi@@ bly bu@@ sy and produc@@ tive , but the tru@@ th is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant lead@@ ers in bu@@ siness , in fin@@ ance , in politi@@ cs , making ter@@ ri@@ ble deci@@ sions ."
So a high I@@ .@@ Q@@ .
"@@ does not mean that you &apos;re a good lead@@ er , because the ess@@ ence of lead@@ er@@ ship is being able to see the i@@ c@@ eb@@ er@@ g before it h@@ its the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic ."
And we &apos;ve had far too many i@@ c@@ eb@@ er@@ gs h@@ itt@@ ing our T@@ it@@ an@@ i@@ cs .
"In fact , I have a feel@@ ing that if L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers was L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers and S@@ i@@ st@@ ers , they might still be around ."
"( Applause ) W@@ hi@@ le all the bro@@ thers were bu@@ sy just being hy@@ per@@ -@@ connec@@ ted 2@@ 4 / 7 , maybe a si@@ ster would have noti@@ ced the i@@ c@@ eb@@ er@@ g , because she would have wok@@ en up from a se@@ v@@ en@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght@@ -@@ h@@ our s@@ le@@ ep and have been able to see the big picture ."
"So as we are fac@@ ing all the multi@@ ple c@@ ri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a perso@@ nal level , what &apos;s going to bring more jo@@ y , g@@ rat@@ it@@ u@@ de , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ eness in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world ."
"So I ur@@ ge you to sh@@ ut your ey@@ es and disco@@ ver the great ideas that li@@ e inside us , to sh@@ ut your eng@@ in@@ es and disco@@ ver the power of s@@ le@@ ep ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"Well , as Ch@@ ris point@@ ed out , I study the human brain , the fun@@ c@@ tions and struc@@ ture of the human brain ."
And I just want you to think for a min@@ ute about what this en@@ tail@@ s .
"@@ Here is this ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly , thre@@ e-@@ p@@ ound ma@@ ss of j@@ el@@ ly you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand , and it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space ."
It can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity and it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te itself con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ting on the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity .
"And this p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive qu@@ ality that we call self-@@ a@@ war@@ eness , which I think is the ho@@ ly gra@@ i@@ l of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence , of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , and h@@ op@@ e@@ fully , some@@ day , we &apos;ll understand how that happens ."
"O@@ K , so how do you study this my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous org@@ an ?"
"I mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of prot@@ op@@ la@@ s@@ m , inter@@ ac@@ ting with each other , and from this acti@@ vity emer@@ ges the whole spec@@ tru@@ m of ab@@ il@@ ities that we call human nature and human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness ."
How does this happen ?
"Well , there are many ways of appro@@ a@@ ching the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain ."
"One approach , the one we use main@@ ly , is to look at patients with su@@ sta@@ ined dam@@ age to a small regi@@ on of the brain , where there &apos;s been a g@@ ene@@ tic change in a small regi@@ on of the brain ."
"What then happens is not an ac@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ar@@ d re@@ duc@@ tion in all your mental cap@@ ac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cogn@@ itive ab@@ il@@ ity ."
"What you get is a high@@ ly sel@@ ec@@ tive l@@ os@@ s of one fun@@ ction , with other fun@@ c@@ tions being pre@@ ser@@ ved in@@ ta@@ ct , and this gi@@ ves you some con@@ fi@@ dence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is some@@ how inv@@ ol@@ ved in medi@@ ating that fun@@ ction ."
"So you can then map fun@@ ction on@@ to struc@@ ture , and then find out what the circu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to gener@@ ate that particular fun@@ ction ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king exam@@ pl@@ es of this .
"In fact , I &apos;m giving you three exam@@ pl@@ es , six minutes each , during this talk ."
The first example is an extra@@ ordinary sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
"If you look at the first sli@@ de there , that &apos;s the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ b@@ es , fron@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es , par@@ i@@ e@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es , O@@ K — the lo@@ b@@ es that con@@ stit@@ ute the brain ."
"And if you look , tu@@ cked away inside the in@@ ner sur@@ face of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ b@@ es — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"And that &apos;s been called the face are@@ a in the brain , because when it &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , you can no longer recogni@@ ze people &apos;s fac@@ es ."
"You can still recogni@@ ze them from their v@@ oi@@ ce and say , &quot; &quot; O@@ h y@@ eah , that &apos;s Jo@@ e , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?"
You can &apos;t even recogni@@ ze yourself in the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or .
"I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or , but you don &apos;t really recogni@@ ze yourself as yourself ."
O@@ K . Now that sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is well known as cau@@ sed by dam@@ age to the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s .
"But there &apos;s another ra@@ re sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , so ra@@ re , in fact , that very few physi@@ ci@@ ans have heard about it , not even ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logi@@ sts ."
"This is called the C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , and that is a pati@@ ent , who &apos;s o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , has had a head in@@ ju@@ ry , comes out of com@@ a , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"She &apos;s some other woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?"
"Wh@@ y would somebody — and this person is perf@@ ec@@ tly lu@@ ci@@ d and intellig@@ ent in all other resp@@ ec@@ ts , but when he se@@ es his mother , his d@@ el@@ u@@ sion ki@@ cks in and says , it &apos;s not mother ."
"Now , the most common inter@@ pre@@ tation of this , which you find in all the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s , is a F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same argu@@ ment app@@ lies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about gu@@ ys ."
"When you &apos;re a little ba@@ by , a young ba@@ by , you had a strong se@@ x@@ u@@ al att@@ rac@@ tion to your mother ."
This is the so@@ -@@ called O@@ e@@ di@@ p@@ us comp@@ le@@ x of F@@ re@@ u@@ d .
"I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view ."
"And then , as you grow up , the cor@@ te@@ x develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ b@@ its these lat@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to@@ wards your mother ."
"@@ Thank G@@ od , or you would all be se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed when you saw your mother ."
"And then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dam@@ ag@@ ing the cor@@ te@@ x , allo@@ wing these lat@@ ent se@@ x@@ u@@ al ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fl@@ am@@ ing to the sur@@ face , and su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly and in@@ exp@@ lic@@ ab@@ ly you find yourself being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ sed by your mother ."
"And you say , &quot; &quot; M@@ y G@@ od , if this is my mo@@ m , how come I &apos;m being se@@ x@@ u@@ ally turned on ?"
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only inter@@ pre@@ tation that makes sense to your dam@@ ag@@ ed brain .
"This has never made much sense to me , this argu@@ ment ."
"It &apos;s very ing@@ eni@@ ous , as all F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an argu@@ ments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , a pati@@ ent having the same d@@ el@@ u@@ sion , about his p@@ et poo@@ d@@ le . ( Laughter )"
"He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , this is not F@@ i@@ f@@ i . It looks exactly like F@@ i@@ f@@ i , but it &apos;s some other do@@ g . &quot; &quot; R@@ ight ?"
"Now , you try using the F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an ex@@ plan@@ ation there ."
"( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the lat@@ ent be@@ sti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite ab@@ sur@@ d , of course ."
"Now , what &apos;s really going on ?"
"So , to explain this cu@@ ri@@ ous dis@@ order , we look at the struc@@ ture and fun@@ c@@ tions of the nor@@ mal vi@@ su@@ al pa@@ th@@ ways in the brain ."
"@@ Nor@@ ma@@ lly , vi@@ su@@ al sig@@ nals come in , into the ey@@ eb@@ al@@ ls , go to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as in the brain ."
"There are , in fact , 30 are@@ as in the back of your brain con@@ cer@@ ned with just vision , and after proc@@ es@@ sing all that , the message goes to a small struc@@ ture called the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , where you perc@@ ei@@ ve fac@@ es ."
There are neurons there that are sen@@ s@@ itive to fac@@ es .
"You can call it the face are@@ a of the brain , right ?"
I talked about that ear@@ li@@ er .
"Now , when that are@@ a &apos;s dam@@ ag@@ ed , you l@@ ose the ab@@ il@@ ity to see fac@@ es , right ?"
"But from that are@@ a , the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into a struc@@ ture called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a in the lim@@ bic system , the em@@ oti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , and that struc@@ ture , called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , g@@ au@@ ges the em@@ oti@@ onal sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of what you &apos;re looking at ."
I@@ s it pre@@ y ? I@@ s it pre@@ dat@@ or ? I@@ s it mate ?
"O@@ r is it something ab@@ solutely tri@@ vi@@ al , like a piece of l@@ int , or a piece of cha@@ l@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? O@@ K ?"
W@@ hi@@ ch you can completely ig@@ n@@ ore .
"So if the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is exc@@ ited , and this is something important , the mes@@ sa@@ ges then c@@ as@@ ca@@ de into the au@@ ton@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
Y@@ our heart star@@ ts be@@ ating fa@@ ster .
You start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the he@@ at that you &apos;re going to create from mu@@ s@@ cu@@ lar ex@@ er@@ tion .
"And that &apos;s for@@ tu@@ nate , because we can put two elec@@ tro@@ des on your p@@ al@@ m and measure the change in sk@@ in re@@ si@@ stance produc@@ ed by swe@@ ating ."
"So I can det@@ er@@ m@@ ine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re exc@@ ited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ou@@ sed , or not , O@@ K ?"
And I &apos;ll get to that in a min@@ ute .
"So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an ob@@ ject , when he looks at his — any ob@@ ject for that matter , it goes to the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as and , ho@@ w@@ ever , and it &apos;s proc@@ es@@ sed in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and you recogni@@ ze it as a pe@@ a pl@@ ant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , O@@ K ?"
"And then the message c@@ as@@ c@@ ad@@ es into the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a , and then goes down the au@@ ton@@ omi@@ c ner@@ v@@ ous system ."
"But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wi@@ re that goes from the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a to the lim@@ bic system , the em@@ oti@@ onal c@@ ore of the brain , is c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So because the fu@@ si@@ form is in@@ ta@@ ct , the cha@@ p can still recogni@@ ze his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h y@@ eah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wi@@ re is c@@ ut to the em@@ oti@@ onal cent@@ ers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a war@@ m@@ th ? &quot; &quot; O@@ r ter@@ r@@ or , as the case may be ? R@@ ight ?"
"( Laughter ) And ther@@ e@@ fore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I ac@@ cou@@ nt for this in@@ exp@@ lic@@ able lack of em@@ oti@@ ons ?"
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pre@@ ten@@ ding to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
"Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a scre@@ en , and measure your g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se , and show pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an ob@@ ject , like a table or an u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ la . O@@ f course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at ."
"If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a p@@ in@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?"
"And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about nor@@ mal people — you start swe@@ ating ."
You don &apos;t even have to be J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh .
"( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this pati@@ ent ?"
You take the pati@@ ent and show him pic@@ tures on the scre@@ en and measure his g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se .
"T@@ ab@@ les and chai@@ r@@ s and l@@ int , nothing happens , as in nor@@ mal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ic sk@@ in respon@@ se is f@@ la@@ t ."
"There &apos;s no em@@ oti@@ onal re@@ action to his mother , because that wi@@ re going from the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as to the em@@ oti@@ onal cent@@ ers is c@@ ut ."
"So his vision is nor@@ mal because the vi@@ su@@ al are@@ as are nor@@ mal , his em@@ oti@@ ons are nor@@ mal — he &apos;ll la@@ u@@ gh , he &apos;ll c@@ ry , so on and so for@@ th — but the wi@@ re from vision to em@@ oti@@ ons is c@@ ut and ther@@ e@@ fore he has this d@@ el@@ u@@ sion that his mother is an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"It &apos;s a lo@@ vely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sible , ne@@ u@@ ral psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome and say that the stan@@ dar@@ d F@@ re@@ u@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a preci@@ se ex@@ plan@@ ation in terms of the known ne@@ u@@ ral an@@ at@@ om@@ y of the brain ."
"B@@ y the way , if this pati@@ ent then goes , and mother phon@@ es from an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent room — phon@@ es him — and he pi@@ cks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , mo@@ m , how are you ? W@@ here are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no d@@ el@@ u@@ sion through the phone ."
"Th@@ en , she appro@@ a@@ ches him after an h@@ our , he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o are you ?"
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"The reason is there &apos;s a se@@ pa@@ rate pa@@ th@@ way going from the hear@@ ing cent@@ ers in the brain to the em@@ oti@@ onal cent@@ ers , and that &apos;s not been c@@ ut by the ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So this expla@@ ins why through the phone he recogni@@ z@@ es his mother , no problem ."
"When he se@@ es her in person , he says it &apos;s an im@@ pos@@ tor ."
"O@@ K , how is all this comp@@ le@@ x circu@@ it@@ ry set up in the brain ?"
"I@@ s it nature , gen@@ es , or is it nu@@ r@@ ture ?"
And we approach this problem by con@@ si@@ der@@ ing another cu@@ ri@@ ous sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome called phant@@ om lim@@ b .
And you all know what a phant@@ om lim@@ b is .
"When an ar@@ m is am@@ pu@@ tat@@ ed , or a le@@ g is am@@ pu@@ tat@@ ed , for g@@ ang@@ ren@@ e , or you l@@ ose it in war — for example , in the I@@ ra@@ q war , it &apos;s now a seri@@ ous problem — you contin@@ ue to vi@@ vi@@ dly feel the pres@@ ence of that mis@@ sing ar@@ m , and that &apos;s called a phant@@ om ar@@ m or a phant@@ om le@@ g ."
"In fact , you can get a phant@@ om with almost any part of the body ."
"B@@ eli@@ e@@ ve it or not , even with inter@@ nal vi@@ sc@@ era ."
"I &apos;ve had patients with the ut@@ er@@ us re@@ mo@@ ved — hy@@ st@@ er@@ ec@@ t@@ omy — who have a phant@@ om ut@@ er@@ us , inclu@@ ding phant@@ om men@@ stru@@ al c@@ ram@@ ps at the app@@ rop@@ ri@@ ate time of the mon@@ th ."
"And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phant@@ om P@@ M@@ S ? &quot;"
"( Laughter ) A sub@@ ject ri@@ pe for scienti@@ fi@@ c en@@ qui@@ ry , but we ha@@ ven &apos;t pur@@ sue@@ d that ."
"O@@ K , now the next question is , what can you learn about phant@@ om li@@ mb@@ s by doing experiments ?"
"One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phant@@ om li@@ mb@@ s c@@ lai@@ m that they can move the phant@@ om ."
"It &apos;ll p@@ at his bro@@ ther on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it ri@@ ngs , it &apos;ll wa@@ ve go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ."
"@@ These are very comp@@ el@@ ling , vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ sa@@ tions ."
The pati@@ ent &apos;s not d@@ el@@ u@@ sional .
"He kno@@ ws that the ar@@ m is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling sen@@ s@@ ory experience for the pati@@ ent ."
"But ho@@ w@@ ever , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen ."
"The phant@@ om lim@@ b — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doc@@ tor , the phant@@ om lim@@ b is pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed ."
It &apos;s fi@@ x@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched spa@@ s@@ m and it &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ati@@ ng@@ ly pa@@ in@@ ful .
"If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phant@@ om lim@@ b be pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed ?"
It s@@ oun@@ ds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
"But when we were looking at the case s@@ he@@ ets , what we found was , these people with the pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed phant@@ om li@@ mb@@ s , the ori@@ gi@@ nal ar@@ m was pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed because of the per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al ner@@ ve in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"The ac@@ tual ner@@ ve supp@@ l@@ ying the ar@@ m was se@@ vered , was c@@ ut , by say , a mot@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ cle ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"So the pati@@ ent had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , which is pa@@ in@@ ful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of the pain in the ar@@ m , the sur@@ ge@@ on am@@ pu@@ tates the ar@@ m , and then you get a phant@@ om ar@@ m with the same pa@@ ins , right ?"
And this is a seri@@ ous cl@@ ini@@ cal problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become de@@ pres@@ sed .
"S@@ ome of them are dri@@ ven to su@@ i@@ ci@@ de , O@@ K ?"
"So , how do you treat this sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome ?"
"Now , why do you get a pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed phant@@ om lim@@ b ?"
"When I looked at the case s@@ he@@ et , I found that they had an ac@@ tual ar@@ m , and the ner@@ ves supp@@ l@@ ying the ar@@ m had been c@@ ut , and the ac@@ tual ar@@ m had been pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed , and l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for se@@ ver@@ al months before the am@@ pu@@ tation , and this pain then gets car@@ ried over into the phant@@ om itself ."
Why does this happen ?
"When the ar@@ m was in@@ ta@@ ct , but pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed , the brain sen@@ ds com@@ man@@ ds to the ar@@ m , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No . M@@ ove . No ."
"And this gets wi@@ red into the circu@@ it@@ ry of the brain , and we call this learned pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis , O@@ K ?"
"The brain lear@@ ns , because of this H@@ eb@@ bi@@ an , as@@ soci@@ ative l@@ ink , that the m@@ ere comm@@ and to move the ar@@ m cre@@ ates a sen@@ sa@@ tion of a pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m ."
"And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ tat@@ ed the ar@@ m , this learned pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis car@@ ries over into your body ima@@ ge and into your phant@@ om , O@@ K ?"
"Now , how do you help these patients ?"
"@@ How do you un@@ learn the learned pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis , so you can reli@@ e@@ ve him of this exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching spa@@ s@@ m of the phant@@ om ar@@ m ?"
"Well , we said , what if you now sen@@ d the comm@@ and to the phant@@ om , but give him vi@@ su@@ al fe@@ ed@@ back that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?"
"@@ Maybe you can reli@@ e@@ ve the phant@@ om pain , the phant@@ om c@@ ram@@ p ."
"@@ How do you do that ? Well , vi@@ r@@ tual reality ."
But that cos@@ ts mil@@ lions of dollars .
"So , I h@@ it on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my fund@@ ing ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
( Laughter ) O@@ K ? What you do is you create what I call a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or bo@@ x .
"You have a car@@ d@@ bo@@ ar@@ d bo@@ x with a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or in the middle , and then you put the phant@@ om — so my first pati@@ ent , D@@ er@@ ek , came in ."
He had his ar@@ m am@@ pu@@ tat@@ ed 10 years ago .
"He had a bra@@ chi@@ al av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were c@@ ut and the ar@@ m was pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed , l@@ ying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the ar@@ m was am@@ pu@@ tat@@ ed ."
"He had a phant@@ om ar@@ m , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ati@@ ng@@ ly pa@@ in@@ ful , and he cou@@ ldn &apos;t move it ."
It was a pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed phant@@ om ar@@ m .
"So he came there , and I gave him a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or like that , in a bo@@ x , which I call a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or bo@@ x , right ?"
"And the pati@@ ent put@@ s his phant@@ om left ar@@ m , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in spa@@ s@@ m , on the left side of the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or , and the nor@@ mal hand on the right side of the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or . And what does he experience ?"
"He looks at the phant@@ om being re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the nor@@ mal ar@@ m in the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or , and it looks like this phant@@ om has been re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ted ."
"&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wi@@ gg@@ le your phant@@ om — your real fi@@ ng@@ ers , or move your real fi@@ ng@@ ers while looking in the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the vi@@ su@@ al im@@ pres@@ sion that the phant@@ om is moving , right ?"
"That &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous , but the ast@@ oni@@ shing thing is , the pati@@ ent then says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my phant@@ om is moving again , and the pain , the cl@@ en@@ ching spa@@ s@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remem@@ ber , my first pati@@ ent who came in — ( Applause ) — than@@ k you . ( Applause ) M@@ y first pati@@ ent came in , and he looked in the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or , and I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at your re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of your phant@@ om . &quot; &quot; And he started gi@@ gg@@ ling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phant@@ om . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stu@@ pi@@ d . He kno@@ ws it &apos;s not real ."
"He kno@@ ws it &apos;s a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion , but it &apos;s a vi@@ vi@@ d sen@@ s@@ ory experience ."
"Now , I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand and phant@@ om . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I can &apos;t move my phant@@ om . You know that . It &apos;s pa@@ in@@ ful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; M@@ ove your nor@@ mal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , my phant@@ om is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !@@ "
And my pain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; O@@ K ?
"And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ l@@ ose your ey@@ es . &quot; &quot; He cl@@ os@@ es his ey@@ es ."
&quot; And move your nor@@ mal hand . &quot;
"&quot; O@@ h , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ K , open your ey@@ es . &quot;"
"&quot; O@@ h my G@@ od , o@@ h my G@@ od , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;"
"So , he was like a ki@@ d in a can@@ dy st@@ ore ."
"So , I said , O@@ K , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis and the c@@ riti@@ cal ro@@ le of vi@@ su@@ al in@@ put , but I &apos;m not going to get a No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze for getting somebody to move his phant@@ om lim@@ b ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely u@@ sel@@ ess ab@@ il@@ ity , if you think about it . ( Laughter )"
"But then I started realiz@@ ing , maybe other kinds of pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis that you see in ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logy , like st@@ rok@@ e , fo@@ cal d@@ y@@ st@@ oni@@ as — there may be a learned comp@@ on@@ ent to this , which you can o@@ ver@@ come with the simple de@@ vice of using a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or ."
"So , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ ek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around car@@ r@@ ying a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , D@@ er@@ ek , take it home and p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce with it for a week or two ."
"@@ Maybe , after a per@@ i@@ od of p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce , you can di@@ sp@@ en@@ se with the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or , un@@ learn the pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis , and start moving your pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ zed ar@@ m , and then , reli@@ e@@ ve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said O@@ K , and he took it home ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . T@@ ake it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phon@@ es me , and he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or bo@@ x was gone ."
"( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phant@@ om I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?"
"It &apos;s di@@ sap@@ p@@ ea@@ red . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got wor@@ ried , I said , my G@@ od , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body ima@@ ge , what about human sub@@ jects , e@@ thi@@ cs and all of that ?"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ er@@ ek , does this b@@ other you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phant@@ om ar@@ m and ther@@ e@@ fore no phant@@ om el@@ b@@ ow pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no phant@@ om fore@@ ar@@ m pain , all those pa@@ ins are gone away ."
"But the problem is I still have my phant@@ om fi@@ ng@@ ers dang@@ ling from the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der , and your bo@@ x doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the desig@@ n and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and eli@@ mi@@ nate my phant@@ om fi@@ ng@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an ."
"Now , why does this happen ?"
It &apos;s because the brain is fac@@ ed with tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous sen@@ s@@ ory con@@ f@@ lic@@ t .
It &apos;s getting mes@@ sa@@ ges from vision saying the phant@@ om is back .
"O@@ n the other hand , there &apos;s no prop@@ ri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , mu@@ sc@@ le sig@@ nals saying that there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
"And your mot@@ or comm@@ and saying there is an ar@@ m , and , because of this con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , the brain says , to h@@ ell with it , there is no phant@@ om , there is no ar@@ m , right ?"
It goes into a sort of d@@ eni@@ al — it g@@ ates the sig@@ nals .
"And when the ar@@ m di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s , the bon@@ us is , the pain di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s because you can &apos;t have di@@ se@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ed pain flo@@ ating out there , in space ."
"So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us ."
"Now , this te@@ chni@@ qu@@ e has been tried on do@@ z@@ ens of patients by other groups in H@@ el@@ sin@@ k@@ i , so it may prove to be val@@ u@@ able as a treat@@ ment for phant@@ om pain , and in@@ de@@ ed , people have tried it for st@@ rok@@ e re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation ."
"S@@ tr@@ oke you nor@@ ma@@ lly think of as dam@@ age to the fi@@ b@@ ers , nothing you can do about it ."
"But , it turns out some comp@@ on@@ ent of st@@ rok@@ e pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis is also learned pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis , and maybe that comp@@ on@@ ent can be o@@ ver@@ come using mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors ."
"This has also gone through cl@@ ini@@ cal trials , hel@@ ping lots and lots of patients ."
"O@@ K , let me s@@ wit@@ ch g@@ ear@@ s now to the thir@@ d part of my talk , which is about another cu@@ ri@@ ous phenomen@@ on called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
This was disco@@ vered by F@@ ran@@ c@@ is G@@ al@@ ton in the nin@@ et@@ e@@ en@@ th century .
He was a cou@@ s@@ in of C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ win .
"He point@@ ed out that certain people in the population , who are o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se completely nor@@ mal , had the follo@@ wing p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar@@ ity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s co@@ lo@@ red ."
"F@@ i@@ ve is bl@@ ue , seven is y@@ el@@ low , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , n@@ ine is in@@ di@@ go , O@@ K ?"
"B@@ ear in mind , these people are completely nor@@ mal in other resp@@ ec@@ ts ."
"O@@ r C sha@@ r@@ p — some@@ times , ton@@ es ev@@ oke col@@ or ."
"@@ C sha@@ r@@ p is bl@@ ue , F sha@@ r@@ p is gre@@ en , another t@@ one might be y@@ el@@ low , right ?"
Why does this happen ?
"This is called sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia . G@@ al@@ ton called it sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia , a mi@@ ng@@ ling of the sen@@ ses ."
"In us , all the sen@@ ses are dist@@ in@@ ct ."
These people mu@@ ddle up their sen@@ ses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of this problem are very int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing .
"S@@ y@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia run@@ s in families , so G@@ al@@ ton said this is a h@@ er@@ e@@ dit@@ ary ba@@ sis , a g@@ ene@@ tic ba@@ sis ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main the@@ me of this lec@@ ture , which is about cre@@ ati@@ vity — sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia is eight times more common am@@ ong ar@@ ti@@ sts , poet@@ s , nov@@ eli@@ sts and other cre@@ ative people than in the gener@@ al population ."
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been ans@@ wer@@ ed before .
"O@@ K , what is sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ? What cau@@ ses it ?"
"Well , there are many the@@ ories ."
One theory is they &apos;re just cra@@ z@@ y .
"Now , that &apos;s not really a scienti@@ fi@@ c theory , so we can for@@ get about it ."
"A@@ no@@ ther theory is they are ac@@ id j@@ un@@ ki@@ es and pothe@@ a@@ ds , right ?"
"Now , there may be some tru@@ th to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the B@@ ay A@@ re@@ a than in S@@ an D@@ i@@ e@@ go ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ K . Now , the thir@@ d theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia . A@@ ll right ?"
"So , we found that the col@@ or are@@ a and the number are@@ a are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form g@@ y@@ ru@@ s ."
"So we said , there &apos;s some ac@@ ci@@ d@@ en@@ tal c@@ ross wi@@ ring between col@@ or and numbers in the brain ."
"So , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding col@@ or , and that &apos;s why you get sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
Now remem@@ ber — why does this happen ?
Why would there be c@@ ros@@ sed wi@@ res in some people ?
R@@ em@@ em@@ ber I said it run@@ s in families ?
That gi@@ ves you the cl@@ ue .
"And that is , there is an ab@@ nor@@ mal gen@@ e , a mu@@ tation in the gen@@ e that cau@@ ses this ab@@ nor@@ mal c@@ ross wi@@ ring ."
"In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wi@@ red to everything else ."
"So , every brain regi@@ on is wi@@ red to every other regi@@ on , and these are tri@@ m@@ m@@ ed down to create the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic mo@@ du@@ lar ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture of the a@@ du@@ l@@ t brain ."
"So , if there &apos;s a gen@@ e cau@@ sing this tri@@ m@@ ming and if that gen@@ e mu@@ tates , then you get de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent tri@@ m@@ ming between ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent brain are@@ as ."
"And if it &apos;s between number and col@@ or , you get numb@@ er@@ -@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"If it &apos;s between t@@ one and col@@ or , you get ton@@ e-@@ col@@ or sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"So far , so good ."
"Now , what if this gen@@ e is ex@@ pres@@ sed every@@ where in the brain , so everything is c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ connec@@ ted ?"
"Well , think about what ar@@ ti@@ sts , nov@@ eli@@ sts and poet@@ s have in common , the ab@@ il@@ ity to eng@@ age in me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal thinking , lin@@ king see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly un@@ rela@@ ted ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the ea@@ st , and Ju@@ li@@ et is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Ju@@ li@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glo@@ wing b@@ all of fire ?"
"I mean , s@@ chi@@ z@@ o@@ ph@@ r@@ eni@@ cs do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?"
"@@ Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s war@@ m like the sun , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s nu@@ r@@ tu@@ ring like the sun ."
"In@@ st@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the lin@@ ks ."
"Now , if you as@@ su@@ me that this great@@ er c@@ ross wi@@ ring and con@@ cep@@ ts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a great@@ er prop@@ en@@ sity to@@ wards me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal thinking and cre@@ ati@@ vity in people with sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
"And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common inci@@ dence of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia am@@ ong poet@@ s , ar@@ ti@@ sts and nov@@ eli@@ sts ."
"O@@ K , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ o@@ logical view of sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ sia ."
The last de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration — can I take one min@@ ute ?
"( Applause ) O@@ K . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all sy@@ ne@@ s@@ the@@ t@@ es , but you &apos;re in d@@ eni@@ al about it ."
"@@ Here &apos;s what I call Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ pha@@ be@@ t . Just like your al@@ pha@@ be@@ t , A is A , B is B , C is C@@ ."
"D@@ i@@ ffer@@ ent sha@@ p@@ es for different phon@@ em@@ es , right ?"
"@@ Here , you &apos;ve got Mar@@ ti@@ an al@@ pha@@ be@@ t ."
"One of them is K@@ ik@@ i , one of them is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ."
W@@ hi@@ ch one is K@@ ik@@ i and which one is B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ?
How many of you think that &apos;s K@@ ik@@ i and that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a ? R@@ ai@@ se your hands .
"Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ t@@ ants ."
"( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s B@@ ou@@ b@@ a , that &apos;s K@@ ik@@ i ? R@@ ai@@ se your hands ."
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine percent of you .
