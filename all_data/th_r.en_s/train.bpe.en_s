"We live in difficult and challeng@@ ing economic times , of course ."
"And one of the first victi@@ ms of difficult economic times , I think , is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding of any kind , but cer@@ tain@@ ly in the fi@@ ring line at the moment is publi@@ c sp@@ en@@ ding for science , and particu@@ larly cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ led science and explo@@ ration ."
So I want to try and con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous and lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s thing to do .
"But I think to set the sc@@ en@@ e , I want to show — the next sli@@ de is not my att@@ emp@@ t to show the wor@@ st TED sli@@ de in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a m@@ ess ."
"( Laughter ) But actually , it &apos;s not my f@@ au@@ l@@ t ; it &apos;s from the G@@ uar@@ di@@ an ne@@ w@@ spap@@ er ."
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration of how much science cos@@ ts .
"Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for contin@@ u@@ ing to sp@@ end on cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven science and explo@@ ration , I should tell you how much it cos@@ ts ."
So this is a game called &quot; &quot; sp@@ ot the science bu@@ d@@ gets . &quot; &quot; This is the U.@@ K@@ . government sp@@ end .
"You see there , it &apos;s about 6@@ 20 billion a year ."
"The science bu@@ d@@ get is actually — if you look to your left , there &apos;s a pur@@ ple set of blo@@ b@@ s and then y@@ el@@ low set of blo@@ b@@ s ."
And it &apos;s one of the y@@ el@@ low set of blo@@ b@@ s around the big y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b .
It &apos;s about 3@@ .@@ 3 billion p@@ oun@@ ds per year out of 6@@ 20 billion .
That fun@@ ds everything in the U.@@ K@@ .
"@@ from medi@@ cal research , space explo@@ ration , where I work , at C@@ E@@ R@@ N in G@@ en@@ ev@@ a , partic@@ le physics , engine@@ ering , even ar@@ ts and human@@ ities , fund@@ ed from the science bu@@ d@@ get , which is that 3@@ .@@ 3 billion , that little , tiny y@@ el@@ low blo@@ b around the or@@ ang@@ e blo@@ b at the top left of the scre@@ en ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re argu@@ ing about .
"That perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and G@@ er@@ many and F@@ ran@@ ce ."
"@@ R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; D in to@@ tal in the econ@@ omy , publi@@ c@@ ly fund@@ ed , is about 0@@ .@@ 6 percent of G@@ D@@ P ."
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re argu@@ ing about .
"The first thing I want to say , and this is st@@ rai@@ ght from &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; is that our explo@@ ration of the solar system and the universe has sho@@ wn us that it is in@@ descri@@ ba@@ bly beautiful ."
"This is a picture that actually was sent back by the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i space pro@@ be around S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , after we &apos;d fin@@ i@@ shed fil@@ ming &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; So it isn &apos;t in the seri@@ es ."
It &apos;s of the moon E@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ la@@ du@@ s .
"So that big swe@@ ep@@ ing , white s@@ ph@@ ere in the cor@@ ner is S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , which is actually in the ba@@ ck@@ ground of the picture ."
"And that cre@@ sc@@ ent there is the moon E@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ la@@ du@@ s , which is about as big as the B@@ riti@@ sh I@@ s@@ les ."
It &apos;s about 5@@ 00 k@@ il@@ omet@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er .
"So , tiny moon ."
What &apos;s f@@ as@@ ci@@ nat@@ ing and beautiful ...
"@@ this an un@@ proc@@ es@@ sed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , st@@ rai@@ ght from S@@ at@@ ur@@ ni@@ an or@@ bit ."
"What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the lim@@ b there some fa@@ int , sort of , wi@@ sp@@ s of almost sm@@ oke ri@@ sing up from the lim@@ b ."
This is how we vi@@ su@@ aliz@@ e that in &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful gra@@ phi@@ c .
What we found out were that those fa@@ int wi@@ sp@@ s are actually f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of ice ri@@ sing up from the sur@@ face of this tiny moon .
"That &apos;s f@@ as@@ ci@@ nat@@ ing and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechan@@ ism for power@@ ing those f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins requi@@ res there to be lak@@ es of li@@ qui@@ d water bene@@ ath the sur@@ face of this moon ."
"And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wh@@ er@@ ever we find li@@ qui@@ d water , we find life ."
"So , to find strong evidence of li@@ qui@@ d , po@@ ols of li@@ qui@@ d , bene@@ ath the sur@@ face of a moon 7@@ 50 million mi@@ les away from the Earth is really quite ast@@ oun@@ ding ."
"So what we &apos;re saying , essentially , is maybe that &apos;s a ha@@ bit@@ at for life in the solar system ."
"Well , let me just say , that was a gra@@ phi@@ c . I just want to show this picture ."
That &apos;s one more picture of E@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ la@@ du@@ s .
This is when C@@ as@@ sin@@ i f@@ le@@ w bene@@ ath E@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ la@@ du@@ s .
"So it made a very low pa@@ ss , just a few hundred k@@ il@@ omet@@ ers ab@@ ove the sur@@ face ."
"And so this , again , a real picture of the ice f@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins ri@@ sing up into space , ab@@ solutely beautiful ."
But that &apos;s not the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for life in the solar system .
"That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"And again , we had to f@@ ly to the Jo@@ vi@@ an system to get any sense that this moon , as most mo@@ ons , was anything other than a de@@ ad b@@ all of ro@@ ck ."
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
"So what you &apos;re looking at is the sur@@ face of the moon Eu@@ rop@@ a , which is a thi@@ ck s@@ he@@ et of ice , probably a hundred k@@ il@@ omet@@ ers thi@@ ck ."
"But by measu@@ ring the way that Eu@@ rop@@ a inter@@ ac@@ ts with the magnetic field of J@@ up@@ it@@ er , and looking at how those cra@@ cks in the ice that you can see there on that gra@@ phi@@ c move around , we &apos;ve in@@ fer@@ red very st@@ rong@@ ly that there &apos;s an oc@@ e@@ an of li@@ qui@@ d sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ding the enti@@ re sur@@ face of Eu@@ rop@@ a ."
"So b@@ el@@ ow the ice , there &apos;s an oc@@ e@@ an of li@@ qui@@ d around the whole moon ."
"It could be hund@@ re@@ ds of k@@ il@@ omet@@ ers de@@ ep , we think ."
"We think it &apos;s s@@ al@@ t@@ water , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of J@@ up@@ it@@ er than there is in all the oc@@ e@@ ans of the Earth com@@ b@@ ined ."
"So that place , a little moon around J@@ up@@ it@@ er , is probably the pri@@ me can@@ di@@ d@@ ate for fin@@ ding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of ."
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous and beautiful disco@@ very .
O@@ ur explo@@ ration of the solar system has ta@@ u@@ ght us that the solar system is beautiful .
"It may also have point@@ ed the way to ans@@ wer@@ ing one of the most pro@@ found questions that you can possi@@ bly ask , which is : &quot; &quot; A@@ re we alone in the universe ? &quot; &quot; I@@ s there any other use to explo@@ ration and science , other than just a sense of won@@ der ?"
"Well , there is ."
"This is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s E@@ ve , D@@ ec@@ em@@ ber 2@@ 4@@ th , 19@@ 6@@ 8 , when I was about eight months old ."
It was taken by A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Ear@@ th@@ ri@@ se from A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 8 .
"A famous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that sa@@ ved 19@@ 6@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ bu@@ l@@ ent year — the student ri@@ ots in P@@ ar@@ is , the he@@ ight of the Vi@@ et@@ nam War ."
"The reason many people think that about this picture , and A@@ l G@@ ore has said it many times , actually , on the sta@@ ge at TED , is that this picture , argu@@ ab@@ ly , was the beginning of the environ@@ mental movement ."
"Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a so@@ li@@ d , im@@ mov@@ able , kind of in@@ de@@ stru@@ cti@@ ble place , but as a very small , f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le@@ -@@ looking world just h@@ ang@@ ing against the b@@ la@@ ck@@ ness of space ."
"What &apos;s also not of@@ ten said about the space explo@@ ration , about the A@@ pol@@ l@@ o pro@@ gra@@ m , is the economic con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion it made ."
"I mean while you can make argu@@ ments that it was wonderful and a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous achiev@@ ement and d@@ eli@@ vered pic@@ tures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?"
"Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ eness , the economic im@@ pa@@ ct of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o ."
The bi@@ ggest one was in 19@@ 7@@ 5 by C@@ ha@@ se E@@ con@@ omet@@ ri@@ cs .
"And it showed that for every $ 1 spent on A@@ pol@@ l@@ o , 14 came back into the U.S. econ@@ omy ."
"So the A@@ pol@@ l@@ o pro@@ gra@@ m paid for itself in in@@ spi@@ ration , in engine@@ ering , achiev@@ ement and , I think , in in@@ spi@@ ring young scienti@@ sts and engine@@ ers 14 times over ."
So explo@@ ration can pay for itself .
What about scienti@@ fi@@ c disco@@ very ?
What about dri@@ ving in@@ nov@@ ation ?
"Well , this looks like a picture of vi@@ r@@ tually nothing ."
"What it is , is a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of hy@@ d@@ ro@@ g@@ en ."
"S@@ e@@ e , back in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , 18@@ 9@@ 0s , many scienti@@ sts , many ob@@ ser@@ ver@@ s , looked at the light given off from atoms ."
And they saw strange pic@@ tures like this .
"What you &apos;re see@@ ing when you put it through a pri@@ s@@ m is that you he@@ at hy@@ d@@ ro@@ g@@ en up and it doesn &apos;t just g@@ low like a white light , it just em@@ its light at particular col@@ ors , a red one , a light bl@@ ue one , some dark bl@@ ue ones ."
Now that led to an understanding of at@@ omi@@ c struc@@ ture because the way that &apos;s expla@@ ined is atoms are a single nu@@ cle@@ us with electr@@ ons going around them .
And the electr@@ ons can only be in particular pla@@ ces .
"And when they ju@@ m@@ p up to the next place they can be , and f@@ all back down again , they e@@ mit light at particular col@@ ors ."
"And so the fact that atoms , when you he@@ at them up , only e@@ mit light at very speci@@ fi@@ c col@@ ors , was one of the k@@ ey dri@@ ver@@ s that led to the develop@@ ment of the quantum theory , the theory of the struc@@ ture of atoms ."
I just wanted to show this picture because this is re@@ mark@@ able .
This is actually a picture of the spec@@ tru@@ m of the Sun .
"And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing light ."
"And again , they only ab@@ sor@@ b light at particular col@@ ors when electr@@ ons ju@@ m@@ p up and f@@ all down , ju@@ m@@ p up and f@@ all down ."
But look at the number of black lin@@ es in that spec@@ tru@@ m .
And the el@@ ement h@@ eli@@ um was disco@@ vered just by star@@ ing at the light from the Sun because some of those black lin@@ es were found that cor@@ respon@@ ded to no known el@@ ement .
And that &apos;s why h@@ eli@@ um &apos;s called h@@ eli@@ um .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; h@@ eli@@ os &quot; &quot; — h@@ eli@@ os from the Sun .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c , and in@@ de@@ ed it was an es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c pur@@ su@@ it , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behavi@@ ors of electr@@ ons in materi@@ als like si@@ lic@@ on , for example ."
"The way that si@@ lic@@ on beha@@ ves , the fact that you can build tran@@ sist@@ ors , is a pu@@ rely quantum phenomen@@ on ."
"So without that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y-@@ dri@@ ven understanding of the struc@@ ture of atoms , which led to this rather es@@ ot@@ eri@@ c theory , quantum mechan@@ i@@ cs , then we wouldn &apos;t have tran@@ sist@@ ors , we wouldn &apos;t have si@@ lic@@ on chi@@ ps , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the ba@@ sis of our modern econ@@ omy ."
"There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful twi@@ st to that ta@@ le ."
"In &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ ders of the S@@ o@@ lar S@@ y@@ stem , &quot; &quot; we k@@ ep@@ t em@@ pha@@ si@@ zing the la@@ ws of physics are univer@@ sa@@ l ."
"It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can tran@@ sp@@ ort it , not only to the planets , but to the most dist@@ ant stars and galaxies ."
"And one of the ast@@ oni@@ shing predic@@ tions of quantum mechan@@ i@@ cs , just by looking at the struc@@ ture of atoms — the same theory that descri@@ b@@ es tran@@ sist@@ ors — is that there can be no stars in the universe that have rea@@ ched the end of their life that are bi@@ gg@@ er than , quite speci@@ fi@@ cally , 1@@ .@@ 4 times the ma@@ ss of the Sun ."
That &apos;s a li@@ mit im@@ pos@@ ed on the ma@@ ss of stars .
"You can work it out on a piece of pap@@ er in a la@@ bo@@ rat@@ ory , get a tel@@ es@@ co@@ pe , s@@ wing it to the sk@@ y , and you find that there are no de@@ ad stars bi@@ gg@@ er than 1@@ .@@ 4 times the ma@@ ss of the Sun ."
That &apos;s quite an incredible predic@@ tion .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the ed@@ ge of that ma@@ ss ?
"Well , this is a picture of it ."
"This is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; &quot; our g@@ ar@@ den &quot; &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it ."
It &apos;s just one of bil@@ lions of galaxies in the universe .
"There are a billion stars in the ga@@ la@@ c@@ tic c@@ ore , which is why it &apos;s sh@@ ining out so bri@@ ghtly ."
"This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ing galaxies ."
But that b@@ right star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
"It &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s sh@@ ining as bri@@ ghtly as the center of the galaxy with a billion sun@@ s in it ."
That &apos;s a T@@ y@@ pe I@@ a super@@ nov@@ a ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"Now that &apos;s an incredible phenomen@@ a , because it &apos;s a star that sit@@ s there ."
It &apos;s called a car@@ bon@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f .
"It sit@@ s there about , say , 1@@ .@@ 3 times the ma@@ ss of the Sun ."
"And it has a bi@@ na@@ ry compan@@ i@@ on that goes around it , so a big star , a big b@@ all of g@@ as ."
"And what it does is it su@@ cks g@@ as off its compan@@ i@@ on star , until it gets to this li@@ mit called the Ch@@ an@@ d@@ ra@@ se@@ khar li@@ mit , and then it explo@@ des ."
"And it explo@@ des , and it sh@@ in@@ es as bri@@ ghtly as a billion sun@@ s for about two weeks , and re@@ le@@ ases , not only energy , but a hu@@ ge amount of che@@ mi@@ cal el@@ ements into the universe ."
"In fact , that one is a car@@ bon@@ -@@ oxy@@ g@@ en d@@ war@@ f ."
"Now , there was no car@@ bon and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe at the Big Bang ."
And there was no car@@ bon and oxy@@ g@@ en in the universe throu@@ gh@@ out the first generation of stars .
"It was made in stars like that , lo@@ cked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ ons like that in order to re@@ con@@ d@@ en@@ se into planets , stars , new solar systems and , in@@ de@@ ed , people like us ."
"I think that &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration of the power and beau@@ ty and univer@@ s@@ ality of the la@@ ws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the struc@@ ture of atoms here on Earth ."
"This is a beautiful quot@@ e that I found — we &apos;re talking about ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity there — from A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der F@@ le@@ ming : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en I wok@@ e up just after da@@ wn on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 2@@ 8 , 19@@ 2@@ 8 , I cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t pla@@ n to re@@ vol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ iz@@ e all medicine by disco@@ ver@@ ing the world &apos;s first anti@@ bi@@ oti@@ c . &quot; &quot; Now , the ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers of the world of the atom did not int@@ end to inv@@ ent the tran@@ sist@@ or ."
"And they cer@@ tain@@ ly didn &apos;t int@@ end to descri@@ be the mechan@@ i@@ cs of super@@ nov@@ a ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ ons , which even@@ tually told us where the building blo@@ cks of life were sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ zed in the universe ."
"So , I think science can be — ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity is important ."
It can be beautiful . It can re@@ ve@@ al quite ast@@ oni@@ shing things .
"It can also , I think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most pro@@ found ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the val@@ ue of our home planet ."
This is a spec@@ ta@@ cu@@ lar picture of our home planet .
"Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet ."
"It looks like S@@ at@@ ur@@ n because , of course , it is ."
It was taken by the C@@ as@@ sin@@ i space pro@@ be .
"But it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beau@@ ty and maj@@ est@@ y of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n &apos;s ri@@ ngs , but actually because of a tiny , fa@@ int blo@@ b just h@@ ang@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath one of the ri@@ ngs ."
"And if I b@@ low it up there , you see it ."
"It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth ."
It was a picture of Earth cap@@ tured in that f@@ r@@ ame of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n .
That &apos;s our planet from 7@@ 50 million mi@@ les away .
"I think the Earth has got a strange prop@@ er@@ ty that the far@@ ther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems ."
But that is not the most dist@@ ant or most famous picture of our planet .
"It was taken by this thing , which is called the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er spa@@ c@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft ."
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scal@@ e .
The V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er is a tiny machine .
"It &apos;s curr@@ ently 10 billion mi@@ les away from Earth , tran@@ sm@@ itt@@ ing with that di@@ sh , with the power of 20 w@@ att@@ s , and we &apos;re still in con@@ ta@@ ct with it ."
"But it vi@@ sit@@ ed J@@ up@@ it@@ er , S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , U@@ ran@@ us and N@@ ep@@ tun@@ e ."
"And after it vi@@ sit@@ ed all four of those planets , C@@ arl S@@ ag@@ an , who &apos;s one of my great h@@ er@@ oes , had the wonderful idea of tur@@ ning V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er around and taking a picture of every planet it had vi@@ sit@@ ed ."
And it took this picture of Earth .
"Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; P@@ al@@ e B@@ l@@ ue D@@ ot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in that red sha@@ ft of light ."
That &apos;s Earth from four billion mi@@ les away .
"And I &apos;d like to read you what S@@ ag@@ an wrote about it , just to fin@@ ish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to descri@@ be what he saw in that picture that he had taken ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Con@@ sider again that d@@ ot ."
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
"O@@ n it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was li@@ ved out their lives ."
"The ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates of jo@@ y and su@@ ffer@@ ing thousands of con@@ fi@@ dent religi@@ ons , ide@@ o@@ logi@@ es and economic doc@@ tr@@ in@@ es , every h@@ un@@ ter and fo@@ ra@@ ger , every h@@ ero and co@@ ward , every cre@@ at@@ or and dest@@ ro@@ y@@ er of civi@@ li@@ zation , every king and p@@ ea@@ s@@ ant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , h@@ op@@ e@@ ful child , inv@@ ent@@ or and explo@@ re@@ r , every teacher of mora@@ ls , every cor@@ rup@@ t politi@@ ci@@ an , every super@@ star , every su@@ pre@@ me lead@@ er , every sa@@ int and sin@@ ner in the history of our speci@@ es , li@@ ved there , on a mot@@ e of du@@ st , su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded in a sun@@ be@@ am ."
It &apos;s been said that astron@@ omy &apos;s a hu@@ mb@@ ling and charac@@ ter@@ -@@ building experience .
There is perhaps no better de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration of the fol@@ ly of human con@@ c@@ e@@ its than this dist@@ ant ima@@ ge of our tiny world .
"T@@ o me , it under@@ s@@ co@@ res our respon@@ si@@ bility to de@@ al more kin@@ dly with one another and to pre@@ serve and ch@@ er@@ ish the p@@ al@@ e bl@@ ue d@@ ot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ au@@ ti@@ ful words about the power of science and explo@@ ration ."
"The argu@@ ment has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe ."
You could have made it in the 19@@ 20@@ s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had peni@@ c@@ il@@ l@@ in .
You could have made it in the 18@@ 9@@ 0s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the tran@@ sist@@ or .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
"@@ Su@@ rely , we know enough ."
We don &apos;t need to disco@@ ver anything else about our universe .
"@@ Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s rap@@ i@@ dly becom@@ ing a h@@ ero of m@@ ine , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who did his science at the turn of the 19@@ th century ."
He was c@@ lear@@ ly under as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t all the time .
&quot; &quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
"@@ Just explo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot; &quot; He said this , he said , &quot; &quot; No@@ thing is more fa@@ tal to the progress of the human mind than to pre@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e , that there are no my@@ st@@ eri@@ es in nature , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."

So we have gone through almost 30 charac@@ ters .
"B@@ y using this me@@ th@@ od , the first eight radi@@ cal@@ s will al@@ low you to build 3@@ 2 ."
The next group of eight charac@@ ters will build an extra 3@@ 2 .
"So with very little eff@@ ort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred charac@@ ters , which is the same as a Ch@@ ine@@ se ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year-@@ old ."
"So after we know the charac@@ ters , we start building ph@@ ra@@ ses ."
"For example , the m@@ oun@@ tain and the fire together , we have fire m@@ oun@@ tain . It &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o ."
We know Japan is the land of the ri@@ sing sun .
"This is a sun pla@@ ced with the ori@@ g@@ in , because Japan lies to the ea@@ st of China ."
"So a sun , ori@@ g@@ in together , we build Japan ."
"A person behind Japan , what do we get ?"
A J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se person .
The charac@@ ter on the left is two m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins sta@@ cked on top of each other .

"I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the Uni@@ ver@@ sity of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
Just think about this problem for a second .
"@@ Here is a lu@@ m@@ p of f@@ le@@ sh , about three p@@ oun@@ ds , which you can hold in the p@@ al@@ m of your hand ."
But it can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the v@@ ast@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ el@@ lar space .
"It can con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te the mean@@ ing of in@@ fin@@ ity , ask questions about the mean@@ ing of its own exi@@ st@@ ence , about the nature of G@@ od ."
And this is truly the most ama@@ zing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the great@@ est my@@ st@@ ery con@@ fron@@ ting human beings : How does this all come about ?
"Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons ."
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the a@@ du@@ l@@ t human brain .
"And each neur@@ on makes something like 1@@ ,000 to 1@@ 0,000 con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts with other neurons in the brain ."
"And based on this , people have cal@@ cu@@ lated that the number of per@@ mu@@ ta@@ tions and com@@ bi@@ na@@ tions of brain acti@@ vity exc@@ ee@@ ds the number of el@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ ry particles in the universe ."
"So , how do you go about stud@@ ying the brain ?"
"One approach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior ."
This is what I sp@@ oke about in the last TED .
"T@@ o@@ day I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put elec@@ tro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually rec@@ or@@ d the acti@@ vity of individu@@ al ner@@ ve cells in the brain ."
S@@ ort of ea@@ v@@ es@@ drop on the acti@@ vity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
"Now , one rec@@ ent disco@@ very that has been made by resear@@ chers in I@@ ta@@ ly , in P@@ ar@@ ma , by G@@ i@@ ac@@ om@@ o R@@ iz@@ z@@ o@@ lat@@ ti and his colle@@ ag@@ ues , is a group of neurons called mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ tal lo@@ b@@ es ."
"Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary mot@@ or comm@@ and neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years ."
These neurons will fire when a person perfor@@ ms a speci@@ fi@@ c action .
"For example , if I do that , and reach and gra@@ b an ap@@ ple , a mot@@ or comm@@ and neur@@ on in the front of my brain will fire ."
"If I reach out and pull an ob@@ ject , another neur@@ on will fire , com@@ man@@ ding me to pull that ob@@ ject ."
These are called mot@@ or comm@@ and neurons that have been known for a long time .
"But what R@@ iz@@ z@@ o@@ lat@@ ti found was a sub@@ set of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else perfor@@ ming the same action ."
"So , here is a neur@@ on that fi@@ res when I reach and gra@@ b something , but it also fi@@ res when I watch Jo@@ e rea@@ ching and gra@@ b@@ b@@ ing something ."
And this is truly ast@@ oni@@ shing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neur@@ on is ad@@ op@@ ting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s perfor@@ ming a vi@@ r@@ tual reality si@@ mu@@ lation of the other person &apos;s action .
"Now , what is the sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of these mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neurons ?"
F@@ or one thing they must be inv@@ ol@@ ved in things like im@@ itation and e@@ mu@@ lation .
Because to im@@ it@@ ate a comp@@ le@@ x act requi@@ res my brain to ad@@ op@@ t the other person &apos;s point of view .
"So , this is important for im@@ itation and e@@ mu@@ lation ."
"Well , why is that important ?"
"Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next sli@@ de ."
"So , how do you do im@@ itation ? Why is im@@ itation important ?"
"M@@ ir@@ r@@ or neurons and im@@ itation , e@@ mu@@ lation ."
"Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomen@@ on of human culture ."
"If you go back in time about &#91; 7@@ 5,000 &#93; to 10@@ 0,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 7@@ 5,000 years ago ."
"And that is , there is a su@@ d@@ den emer@@ g@@ ence and rap@@ id sp@@ read of a number of skil@@ ls that are uni@@ qu@@ e to human beings like to@@ ol use , the use of fire , the use of sh@@ el@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ab@@ il@@ ity to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pre@@ t that person &apos;s behavior ."
A@@ ll of that happened relati@@ vely quickly .
"E@@ ven though the human brain had achiev@@ ed its present size almost three or four hundred thou@@ s@@ and years ago , 10@@ 0,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly ."
"And I c@@ lai@@ m that what happened was the su@@ d@@ den emer@@ g@@ ence of a so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neur@@ on system , which allowed you to e@@ mu@@ late and im@@ it@@ ate other people &apos;s ac@@ tions ."
"So that when there was a su@@ d@@ den ac@@ ci@@ d@@ en@@ tal disco@@ very by one mem@@ ber of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular ty@@ pe of to@@ ol , instead of d@@ ying out , this sp@@ read rap@@ i@@ dly , h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tally across the population , or was tran@@ sm@@ itt@@ ed ver@@ ti@@ cally , down the gener@@ ations ."
"So , this made evolution su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly L@@ am@@ ar@@ ck@@ i@@ an , instead of D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an ."
D@@ ar@@ w@@ ini@@ an evolution is s@@ low ; it takes hund@@ re@@ ds of thousands of years .
"A po@@ lar be@@ ar , to evol@@ ve a co@@ at , will take thousands of gener@@ ations , maybe 10@@ 0,000 years ."
"A human being , a child , can just watch its par@@ ent k@@ ill another po@@ lar be@@ ar , and sk@@ in it and put the sk@@ in on its body , fu@@ r on the body , and learn it in one step . What the po@@ lar be@@ ar took 10@@ 0,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes ."
And then once it &apos;s learned this it sp@@ rea@@ ds in ge@@ omet@@ ri@@ c prop@@ or@@ tion across a population .
This is the ba@@ sis . The im@@ itation of comp@@ le@@ x skil@@ ls is what we call culture and is the ba@@ sis of civi@@ li@@ zation .
"Now there is another kind of mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neur@@ on , which is inv@@ ol@@ ved in something quite different ."
"And that is , there are mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neurons , just as there are mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neurons for action , there are mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neurons for tou@@ ch ."
"In other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , neur@@ on in the so@@ mat@@ os@@ en@@ s@@ ory cor@@ te@@ x in the sen@@ s@@ ory regi@@ on of the brain fi@@ res ."
"But the same neur@@ on , in some c@@ ases , will fire when I simply watch another person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , it &apos;s empa@@ thi@@ zing the other person being tou@@ ched ."
"So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m tou@@ ched in different lo@@ c@@ ations . D@@ i@@ ffer@@ ent neurons for different lo@@ c@@ ations ."
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being tou@@ ched in the same lo@@ c@@ ation .
"So , here again you have neurons which are en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in empa@@ thy ."
"Now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : If I simply watch another person being tou@@ ched , why do I not get con@@ fu@@ sed and liter@@ ally feel that tou@@ ch sen@@ sa@@ tion m@@ er@@ ely by wat@@ ching somebody being tou@@ ched ?"
"I mean , I empa@@ thi@@ ze with that person but I don &apos;t liter@@ ally feel the tou@@ ch ."
"Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got rec@@ ep@@ tors in your sk@@ in , tou@@ ch and pain rec@@ ep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry , you &apos;re not being tou@@ ched ."
"So , empa@@ thi@@ ze , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the tou@@ ch , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se you &apos;ll get con@@ fu@@ sed and mu@@ dd@@ led . &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back sig@@ nal that v@@ et@@ oes the sig@@ nal of the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neur@@ on pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing you from con@@ sci@@ ously experiencing that tou@@ ch ."
"But if you re@@ move the ar@@ m , you simply an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze my ar@@ m , so you put an in@@ jec@@ tion into my ar@@ m , an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ ze the bra@@ chi@@ al p@@ le@@ x@@ us , so the ar@@ m is nu@@ m@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sa@@ tions coming in , if I now watch you being tou@@ ched , I liter@@ ally feel it in my hand ."
"In other words , you have dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human beings ."
"So , I call them G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i neurons , or empa@@ thy neurons ."
( Laughter ) And this is not in some ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ori@@ cal sense .
"All that &apos;s se@@ pa@@ rating you from him , from the other person , is your sk@@ in ."
"R@@ e@@ move the sk@@ in , you experience that person &apos;s tou@@ ch in your mind ."
You &apos;ve dis@@ sol@@ ved the bar@@ ri@@ er between you and other human beings .
"And this , of course , is the ba@@ sis of much of E@@ ast@@ ern ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y , and that is there is no real in@@ depen@@ dent self , al@@ o@@ of from other human beings , in@@ spec@@ ting the world , in@@ spec@@ ting other people ."
"You are , in fact , connec@@ ted not just vi@@ a F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok and Internet , you &apos;re actually quite liter@@ ally connec@@ ted by your neurons ."
"And there is whole cha@@ ins of neurons around this room , talking to each other ."
And there is no real dist@@ in@@ cti@@ v@@ eness of your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness from somebody else &apos;s con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
And this is not mum@@ bo@@ -@@ ju@@ mb@@ o ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y .
It emer@@ ges from our understanding of basic neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"So , you have a pati@@ ent with a phant@@ om lim@@ b . If the ar@@ m has been re@@ mo@@ ved and you have a phant@@ om , and you watch somebody else being tou@@ ched , you feel it in your phant@@ om ."
"Now the ast@@ oni@@ shing thing is , if you have pain in your phant@@ om lim@@ b , you squ@@ ee@@ ze the other person &apos;s hand , mas@@ sage the other person &apos;s hand , that reli@@ ev@@ es the pain in your phant@@ om hand , almost as though the neur@@ on were ob@@ ta@@ ining reli@@ e@@ f from m@@ er@@ ely wat@@ ching somebody else being mas@@ sa@@ g@@ ed ."
"So , here you have my last sli@@ de ."
F@@ or the long@@ est time people have re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded science and human@@ ities as being dist@@ in@@ ct .
"C@@ .@@ P@@ . S@@ now sp@@ oke of the two cul@@ tures : science on the one hand , human@@ ities on the other ; never the t@@ w@@ ain sha@@ ll me@@ et ."
"So , I &apos;m saying the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or neur@@ on system under@@ lies the inter@@ face allo@@ wing you to re@@ think about is@@ sue@@ s like con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , re@@ pre@@ sen@@ tation of self , what se@@ pa@@ rat@@ es you from other human beings , what allo@@ ws you to empa@@ thi@@ ze with other human beings , and also even things like the emer@@ g@@ ence of culture and civi@@ li@@ zation , which is uni@@ qu@@ e to human beings . Thank you ."

"It &apos;s a great hon@@ or today to share with you The D@@ ig@@ ital Uni@@ verse , which was created for human@@ ity to really see where we are in the universe ."
And so I think we can ro@@ ll the vi@@ de@@ o that we have .
&#91; The H@@ ima@@ lay@@ as . &#93; ( M@@ u@@ sic ) The f@@ la@@ t h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that we &apos;ve evol@@ ved with has been a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for the in@@ fin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ oun@@ ded resour@@ ces and un@@ limit@@ ed cap@@ ac@@ ity for di@@ sp@@ os@@ al of wa@@ st@@ e .
"It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got ab@@ ove the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere and had seen the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on b@@ end back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limit@@ ed con@@ dition ."
The D@@ ig@@ ital Uni@@ verse A@@ t@@ la@@ s has been built at the American M@@ u@@ se@@ um of N@@ atu@@ ral H@@ i@@ story over the past 12 years .
"We main@@ tain that , put that together as a project to really char@@ t the universe across all scal@@ es ."
"What we see here are sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es around the Earth and the Earth in prop@@ er regi@@ st@@ ration against the universe , as we see ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A supp@@ or@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the H@@ a@@ y@@ den P@@ lan@@ e@@ ta@@ ri@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
The D@@ ig@@ ital Uni@@ verse is the ba@@ sis of our space show produc@@ tions that we do — our main space sho@@ ws in the d@@ ome .
"But what you see here is the resul@@ t of , actually , inter@@ n@@ shi@@ ps that we h@@ os@@ ted with L@@ in@@ k@@ op@@ ing Uni@@ ver@@ sity in Swe@@ den ."
"I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their gra@@ du@@ ate work , and the resul@@ t has been this sof@@ t@@ ware called Uni@@ view and a compan@@ y called S@@ C@@ I@@ S@@ S in Swe@@ den ."
"This sof@@ t@@ ware allo@@ ws inter@@ ac@@ tive use , so this ac@@ tual f@@ light pat@@ h and mo@@ vi@@ e that we see here was actually flo@@ wn live ."
"I cap@@ tured this live from my lap@@ top in a ca@@ fe called Earth M@@ att@@ ers on the Lo@@ wer E@@ a@@ st S@@ i@@ de of M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan , where I live , and it was done as a col@@ la@@ bo@@ ra@@ tive project with the R@@ u@@ bin M@@ u@@ se@@ um of H@@ ima@@ lay@@ an A@@ r@@ t for an ex@@ hi@@ bit on com@@ pa@@ ra@@ tive cosmo@@ logy ."
"And so as we move out , we see contin@@ u@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , li@@ ght@@ -@@ tra@@ v@@ el time , giving you a sense of how far away we are ."
"As we move out , the light from these dist@@ ant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essentially ba@@ cking up into the past ."
We back so far up we &apos;re finally see@@ ing a con@@ tain@@ ment around us — the af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang .
This is the W@@ M@@ A@@ P mi@@ c@@ ro@@ wa@@ ve ba@@ ck@@ ground that we see .
"We &apos;ll f@@ ly outside it here , just to see this sort of con@@ tain@@ ment ."
"If we were outside this , it would almost be mean@@ ing@@ less , in the sense as before time ."
But this our con@@ tain@@ ment of the vi@@ sible universe .
We know the universe is bi@@ gg@@ er than that which we can see .
"C@@ om@@ ing back quickly , we see here the radi@@ o s@@ ph@@ ere that we ju@@ mp@@ ed out of in the beginning , but these are pos@@ iti@@ ons , the la@@ test pos@@ iti@@ ons of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pp@@ ed , and our sun here , ob@@ vi@@ ously , with our own solar system ."
"What you &apos;re going to see — we &apos;re going to have to ju@@ m@@ p in here pretty quickly between se@@ ver@@ al or@@ ders of mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de to get down to where we see the solar system — these are the pa@@ ths of V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 1 , V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er 2 , P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 1@@ 1 and P@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er 10 , the first four spa@@ c@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to have left the solar system ."
"C@@ om@@ ing in cl@@ os@@ er , pic@@ king up Earth , or@@ bit of the M@@ o@@ on , and we see the Earth ."
"This map can be up@@ d@@ ated , and we can ad@@ d in new data ."
I know D@@ r@@ . C@@ ar@@ ol@@ y@@ n P@@ or@@ c@@ o is the cam@@ era P@@ .@@ I@@ .

This sof@@ t@@ ware allo@@ ws us to come cl@@ ose and look at parts of this .
This sof@@ t@@ ware can also be n@@ et@@ worked between dom@@ es .
"We have a gro@@ wing us@@ er ba@@ se of this , and we n@@ et@@ work dom@@ es ."
And we can n@@ et@@ work between dom@@ es and cla@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
We &apos;re actually sha@@ ring t@@ ours of the universe with the first sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ ha@@ ran plan@@ e@@ ta@@ ri@@ um in G@@ han@@ a as well as new li@@ bra@@ ries that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a and a high school in C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a .

But we can see the ha@@ ze from fi@@ res and so for@@ th in the G@@ ang@@ es val@@ ley down b@@ el@@ ow in India .
This is Ne@@ pa@@ l and T@@ i@@ be@@ t .
"And just in cl@@ os@@ ing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on — here we see a bit of the s@@ now that some of you may have had to bra@@ ve in coming out — so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much lar@@ ger con@@ dition now and a much lar@@ ger sense of what home is ."
"Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially ."
We car@@ ry that in us .

The pur@@ su@@ it of mean@@ ing is the st@@ rong@@ est .
There &apos;s a group of people in K@@ en@@ ya .
P@@ eople c@@ ross oc@@ e@@ ans to go see them .
These people are ta@@ ll .
They ju@@ m@@ p high . They w@@ ear red .
And they k@@ ill lions .
"You might be wonder@@ ing , who are these people ?"
These are the Ma@@ as@@ ai@@ s .
And you know what &apos;s co@@ ol ? I &apos;m actually one of them .
"The Ma@@ as@@ ai@@ s , the bo@@ ys are brought up to be war@@ ri@@ ors ."
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
"When I was five years old , I found out that I was eng@@ ag@@ ed to be mar@@ ried as so@@ on as I rea@@ ched pu@@ ber@@ ty ."
"M@@ y mother , my grand@@ mother , my a@@ unti@@ es , they con@@ st@@ antly re@@ min@@ ded me that your hus@@ b@@ and just pas@@ sed by ."
"( Laughter ) C@@ o@@ ol , y@@ eah ?"
And everything I had to do from that moment was to pre@@ p@@ are me to be a perf@@ ect woman at age 12 .
"M@@ y day started at 5 in the morning , mil@@ king the co@@ ws , swe@@ ep@@ ing the h@@ ouse , co@@ ok@@ ing for my si@@ bli@@ ngs , col@@ lec@@ ting water , fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od ."
I did everything that I needed to do to become a perf@@ ect wife .
I went to school not because the Ma@@ as@@ ai@@ s &apos; women or girls were going to school .
"It &apos;s because my mother was d@@ eni@@ ed an education , and she con@@ st@@ antly re@@ min@@ ded me and my si@@ bli@@ ngs that she never wanted us to live the life she was li@@ ving ."
Why did she say that ?
M@@ y father worked as a po@@ lic@@ e@@ man in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for some@@ times even two years .
"And wh@@ en@@ ever he came home , it was a different case ."
M@@ y mother worked hard in the far@@ m to grow c@@ rop@@ s so that we can e@@ at .
She rea@@ red the co@@ ws and the go@@ at@@ s so that she can care for us .
"But when my father came , he would sel@@ l the co@@ ws , he would sel@@ l the produc@@ ts we had , and he went and dr@@ ank with his friends in the bar@@ s ."
"Because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any prop@@ er@@ ty , and by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t , everything in my family any@@ way b@@ el@@ ong@@ s to my father , so he had the right ."
"And if my mother ever ques@@ ti@@ on@@ ed him , he be@@ at her , ab@@ used her , and really it was difficult ."
"When I went to school , I had a dre@@ am ."
I wanted to become a teacher .
T@@ ea@@ chers looked ni@@ ce .
"They w@@ ear ni@@ ce dre@@ s@@ ses , high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ ed sh@@ oes ."
"I found out later that they are un@@ com@@ for@@ table , but I ad@@ mi@@ red it ."
"( Laughter ) But most of all , the teacher was just writ@@ ing on the bo@@ ar@@ d — not hard work , that &apos;s what I thought , com@@ pa@@ red to what I was doing in the far@@ m ."
So I wanted to become a teacher .
"I worked hard in school , but when I was in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , it was a det@@ er@@ min@@ ing fac@@ tor ."
"In our tra@@ dition , there is a cer@@ em@@ on@@ y that girls have to under@@ go to become women , and it &apos;s a rit@@ e of pas@@ sage to wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od ."
"And then I was just fin@@ i@@ shing my ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , and that was a trans@@ ition for me to go to high school ."
This was the c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ad .
"O@@ n@@ ce I go through this tra@@ dition , I was going to become a wife ."
"Well , my dre@@ am of becom@@ ing a teacher will not come to pa@@ ss ."
So I talked — I had to come up with a pla@@ n to figure these things out .
I talked to my father . I did something that most girls have never done .
"I told my father , &quot; &quot; I will only go through this cer@@ em@@ on@@ y if you let me go back to school . &quot; &quot; The reason why , if I ran away , my father will have a sti@@ g@@ ma , people will be cal@@ ling him the father of that girl who didn &apos;t go through the cer@@ em@@ on@@ y ."
It was a sha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to car@@ ry the rest of his life .
"So he figu@@ red out . &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; ok@@ ay , you &apos;ll go to school after the cer@@ em@@ on@@ y . &quot; &quot; I did . The cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happened ."
It &apos;s a whole week long of exc@@ it@@ ement .
It &apos;s a cer@@ em@@ on@@ y . P@@ eople are en@@ jo@@ ying it .
"And the day before the ac@@ tual cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happens , we were dan@@ c@@ ing , having exc@@ it@@ ement , and through all the ni@@ ght we did not s@@ le@@ ep ."
"The ac@@ tual day came , and we wal@@ ked out of the h@@ ouse that we were dan@@ c@@ ing in . Y@@ es , we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced ."
"We wal@@ ked out to the cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ d , and there were a bun@@ ch of people wa@@ iting ."
They were all in a cir@@ cle .
"And as we dan@@ ced and dan@@ ced , and we appro@@ a@@ ched this cir@@ cle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there ."
"There was a woman s@@ itt@@ ing in the middle of it , and this woman was wa@@ iting to hold us ."
"I was the first . There were my sist@@ ers and a couple of other girls , and as I appro@@ a@@ ched her , she looked at me , and I sat down ."
"And I sat down , and I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ gs ."
"As I op@@ en@@ ed my le@@ g , another woman came , and this woman was car@@ r@@ ying a kni@@ fe ."
"And as she car@@ ried the kni@@ fe , she wal@@ ked to@@ ward me and she hel@@ d the cl@@ it@@ or@@ is , and she c@@ ut it off ."
"As you can imagine , I b@@ led . I b@@ led ."
"A@@ f@@ ter ble@@ e@@ ding for a while , I fa@@ int@@ ed ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter ."
"It &apos;s something that so many girls — I &apos;m lu@@ ck@@ y , I never di@@ ed — but many di@@ e ."
"It &apos;s p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ced , it &apos;s no an@@ es@@ the@@ sia , it &apos;s a ru@@ st@@ y old kni@@ fe , and it was difficult ."
"I was lu@@ ck@@ y because one , also , my mo@@ m did something that most women don &apos;t do ."
"Th@@ ree days later , after everybody has left the home , my mo@@ m went and brought a nu@@ r@@ se ."
We were taken care of .
"Th@@ ree weeks later , I was heal@@ ed , and I was back in high school ."
I was so det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
"Well , while I was in high school , something happened ."
I m@@ et a young g@@ ent@@ le@@ man from our village who had been to the Uni@@ ver@@ sity of O@@ re@@ g@@ on .
"This man was w@@ ear@@ ing a white t@@ -@@ shi@@ r@@ t , j@@ e@@ ans , cam@@ era , white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers — and I &apos;m talking about white s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers ."
"There is something about c@@ lo@@ the@@ s , I think , and sh@@ oes ."
"They were s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have pa@@ ved ro@@ a@@ ds . It was quite att@@ rac@@ tive ."
"I told him , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and I ad@@ mi@@ red that ."
"And he told me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you mean , you want to go ?"
"D@@ on &apos;t you have a hus@@ b@@ and wa@@ iting for you ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; D@@ on &apos;t wor@@ ry about that part ."
"@@ Just tell me how to get there . &quot; &quot; This g@@ ent@@ le@@ man , he hel@@ ped me ."
"W@@ hi@@ le I was in high school also , my da@@ d was si@@ ck ."
"He got a st@@ rok@@ e , and he was really , really si@@ ck , so he really cou@@ ldn &apos;t tell me what to do next ."
"But the problem is , my father is not the only father I have ."
"E@@ very@@ body who is my da@@ d &apos;s age , ma@@ le in the commun@@ ity , is my father by de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ t — my un@@ c@@ les , all of them — and they dic@@ tat@@ e what my future is ."
"So the news came , I app@@ li@@ ed to school and I was ac@@ cep@@ ted to R@@ an@@ dol@@ ph@@ -@@ M@@ ac@@ on W@@ o@@ man &apos;s C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in L@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ bur@@ g , V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come without the supp@@ ort of the village , because I needed to rai@@ se money to buy the air ti@@ ck@@ et ."
I got a scho@@ lar@@ ship but I needed to get myself here .
"But I needed the supp@@ ort of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had g@@ ot@@ ten an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; What a lost op@@ port@@ un@@ ity ."
This should have been given to a bo@@ y . We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; So I went back and I had to go back to the tra@@ dition .
There &apos;s a belie@@ f am@@ ong our people that morning bri@@ ngs good news .
"So I had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there &apos;s good news in the morning ."
"And in the village also , there is one chi@@ e@@ f , an el@@ der , who if he says y@@ es , everybody will fol@@ low him ."
"So I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun r@@ ose ."
"The first thing he se@@ es when he op@@ ens his door is , it &apos;s me ."
"&quot; M@@ y child , what are you doing here ? &quot;"
"&quot; Well , D@@ ad , I need help . Can you supp@@ ort me to go to America ? &quot;"
"I pr@@ om@@ ised him that I would be the best girl , I will come back , anything they wanted after that , I will do it for them ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot; &quot; He gave me a li@@ st of another 15 men that I went — 16 more men — every single morning I went and vi@@ sit@@ ed them ."
They all came together .
"The village , the women , the men , everybody came together to supp@@ ort me to come to get an education ."
"I ar@@ ri@@ ved in America . A@@ s you can imagine , what did I find ?"
I found s@@ now !
"I found W@@ al@@ -@@ Mar@@ ts , vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers , and lots of fo@@ od in the c@@ af@@ et@@ eria ."
I was in a land of pl@@ ent@@ y .
"I en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed myself , but during that moment while I was here , I disco@@ vered a lot of things ."
"I learned that that cer@@ em@@ on@@ y that I went through when I was 1@@ 3 years old , it was called fe@@ ma@@ le gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation ."
I learned that it was against the la@@ w in K@@ en@@ ya .
I learned that I did not have to tra@@ de part of my body to get an education . I had a right .
"And as we speak right now , three million girls in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a are at ris@@ k of going through this mu@@ ti@@ lation ."
I learned that my mo@@ m had a right to own prop@@ er@@ ty .
I learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
Th@@ ose things made me ang@@ ry .
I wanted to do something .
"As I went back , every time I went , I found that my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors &apos; girls were getting mar@@ ried ."
"They were getting mu@@ ti@@ lated , and here , after I gra@@ du@@ ated from here , I worked at the U.@@ N@@ . , I went back to school to get my gra@@ du@@ ate work , the con@@ st@@ ant c@@ ry of these girls was in my face ."
I had to do something .
"As I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to give back the way I had pr@@ om@@ ised you that I would come back and help you . What do you need ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s I sp@@ oke to the women , they told me , &quot; You know what we need ? We really need a school for girls . &quot;"
Because there had not been any school for girls .
"And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is rap@@ ed when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that ."
"If she got pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant before she got mar@@ ried , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that , and she &apos;s p@@ uni@@ shed ."
She &apos;s be@@ at@@ en .
"They said , &quot; &quot; We wanted to put our girls in a sa@@ fe place . &quot; &quot; A@@ s we mo@@ ved , and I went to talk to the fa@@ thers , the fa@@ thers , of course , you can imagine what they said : &quot; We want a school for bo@@ ys . &quot;"
"And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have g@@ ot@@ ten an education ."
"Wh@@ y can &apos;t they build a school for bo@@ ys , and I &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot; &quot; That made sense . And they ag@@ re@@ ed ."
"And I told them , I wanted them to show me a sig@@ n of com@@ mit@@ ment ."
And they did . They do@@ nat@@ ed land where we built the girls &apos; school .
We have .
I want you to me@@ et one of the girls in that school .
"A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine came to app@@ ly for the school , and she did not me@@ et any c@@ rit@@ eria that we had ."
"She &apos;s an or@@ pha@@ n . Y@@ es , we could have taken her for that ."
"But she was older . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
"A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine had been moving from one place — because she &apos;s an or@@ pha@@ n , she has no mother , she has no father — moving from one grand@@ mother &apos;s h@@ ouse to another one , from a@@ unti@@ es to a@@ unti@@ es . She had no sta@@ bility in her life ."
"And I looked at her , I remem@@ ber that day , and I saw something be@@ yon@@ d what I was see@@ ing in A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine ."
"And y@@ es , she was older to be in f@@ our@@ th gra@@ de ."
We gave her the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to come to the cla@@ ss .
"F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine ."
A trans@@ formation had be@@ gu@@ n in her life .
A@@ ng@@ el@@ ine want@@ s to be a pi@@ lot so she can f@@ ly around the world and make a difference .
She was not the top student when we took her .
"Now she &apos;s the best student , not just in our school , but in the enti@@ re divi@@ sion that we are in ."
That &apos;s S@@ har@@ on . That &apos;s five years later .
"That &apos;s E@@ vel@@ y@@ n . F@@ i@@ ve months later , that is the difference that we are making ."
"As a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening ."
"As we speak right now , 1@@ 2@@ 5 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ lated ."
One hundred t@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls will not be mar@@ ried when they &apos;re 12 years old .
One hundred t@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ five girls are cre@@ ating and achiev@@ ing their dre@@ am@@ s .
"This is the thing that we are doing , giving them op@@ port@@ un@@ ities where they can ri@@ se ."
"As we speak right now , women are not being be@@ at@@ en because of the re@@ vol@@ u@@ tions we &apos;ve started in our commun@@ ity ."
( Applause ) I want to challenge you today .
"You are li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to me because you are here , very op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic ."
You are somebody who is so pas@@ sio@@ nate .
You are somebody who want@@ s to see a better world .
"You are somebody who want@@ s to see that war ends , no po@@ ver@@ ty ."
You are somebody who want@@ s to make a difference .
You are somebody who want@@ s to make our tom@@ or@@ row better .
"I want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will fol@@ low you ."
B@@ e the first . P@@ eople will fol@@ low you .
B@@ e bo@@ ld . S@@ t@@ and up . B@@ e f@@ ear@@ less . B@@ e con@@ fi@@ dent .
"M@@ ove out , because as you change your world , as you change your commun@@ ity , as we believe that we are im@@ pa@@ c@@ ting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time ."
"We are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your commun@@ ity , you are going to change your country , and think about that . If you do that , and I do that , are@@ n &apos;t we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grand@@ children ?"
And we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . Thank you very much .

I have a question for you : A@@ re you religi@@ ous ?
P@@ lease rai@@ se your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religi@@ ous person .
"@@ Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent ."
I had no idea there were so many belie@@ ver@@ s at a TED Con@@ fer@@ ence .
"( Laughter ) O@@ kay , here &apos;s another question : Do you think of yourself as spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al in any way , shape or form ? R@@ ai@@ se your hand ."
"O@@ kay , that &apos;s the maj@@ ority ."
M@@ y T@@ al@@ k today is about self-@@ tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dence .
It &apos;s just a basic fact about being human that some@@ times the self seems to just m@@ el@@ t away .
"And when that happens , the feel@@ ing is ec@@ sta@@ tic and we reach for me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors of up and down to explain these feel@@ ings ."
We talk about being up@@ li@@ f@@ ted or el@@ ev@@ ated .
Now it &apos;s really hard to think about anything ab@@ st@@ rac@@ t like this without a good con@@ cre@@ te me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or .
So here &apos;s the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or I &apos;m o@@ ffer@@ ing today .
"Th@@ ink about the mind as being like a h@@ ouse with many ro@@ om@@ s , most of which we &apos;re very fami@@ li@@ ar with ."
But some@@ times it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens on@@ to a staircase .
We cli@@ m@@ b the staircase and experience a state of al@@ ter@@ ed con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
"In 19@@ 0@@ 2 , the great American psycho@@ logi@@ st W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es wrote about the many vari@@ eties of religi@@ ous experience ."
He col@@ lec@@ ted all kinds of case studies .
"One of the most exc@@ iting to me is this young man , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley , had an en@@ cou@@ n@@ ter , he thought , with J@@ e@@ su@@ s in 18@@ 20 ."
And here &apos;s what B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley said about it .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) S@@ te@@ ph@@ en B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley : I thought I saw the sa@@ vi@@ or in human shape for about one second in the room , with ar@@ ms ex@@ ten@@ ded , ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing to say to me , &quot; &quot; C@@ ome . &quot; &quot; The next day I re@@ j@@ oi@@ ced with tre@@ mb@@ ling ."
M@@ y happiness was so great that I said I wanted to di@@ e .
This world had no place in my aff@@ ec@@ tions .
"P@@ re@@ vi@@ ous to this time , I was very sel@@ fi@@ sh and self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous ."
"But now I de@@ si@@ red the wel@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feel@@ ing heart , for@@ give my wor@@ st ene@@ mi@@ es ."
"@@ J@@ H : So not@@ e how B@@ ra@@ d@@ ley &apos;s p@@ et@@ ty , mora@@ li@@ stic self just di@@ es on the way up the staircase ."
And on this high@@ er level he becomes lo@@ ving and for@@ giving .
The world &apos;s many religi@@ ons have found so many ways to help people cli@@ m@@ b the staircase .
O@@ thers use psy@@ che@@ d@@ eli@@ c dru@@ gs .
This is from a 1@@ 6@@ th century A@@ z@@ te@@ c sc@@ ro@@ ll sho@@ wing a man about to e@@ at a p@@ si@@ lo@@ c@@ y@@ bin mu@@ sh@@ room and at the same moment get yan@@ ked up the staircase by a go@@ d .
L@@ ots of people find self-@@ tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dence in nature .
O@@ thers o@@ ver@@ come their self at ra@@ ves .
But here &apos;s the we@@ ir@@ de@@ st place of all : war .
"So many bo@@ ok@@ s about war say the same thing , that nothing bri@@ ngs people together like war ."
And that bri@@ ng@@ ing them together op@@ ens up the possi@@ bility of extra@@ ordinary self-@@ tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dent experi@@ ences .
I &apos;m going to pla@@ y for you an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this book by G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ ra@@ y .
G@@ ra@@ y was a sol@@ di@@ er in the American ar@@ my in World War I@@ I .
( V@@ ide@@ o ) G@@ l@@ en@@ n G@@ ra@@ y : M@@ any v@@ et@@ er@@ ans will ad@@ mit that the experience of com@@ mu@@ nal eff@@ ort in b@@ att@@ le has been the high point of their lives .
"&quot; I &quot; pas@@ ses in@@ sen@@ si@@ bly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becomes &quot; our &quot; and individu@@ al fa@@ ith l@@ os@@ es its cent@@ ral im@@ por@@ tan@@ ce ."
I believe that it is nothing less than the as@@ su@@ ran@@ ce of im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity that makes self-@@ sa@@ c@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce at these mom@@ ents so relati@@ vely easy .
"I may f@@ all , but I do not di@@ e , for that which is real in me goes for@@ ward and lives on in the com@@ ra@@ des for wh@@ om I gave up my life ."
It fe@@ els some@@ how up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
This idea that we move up was cent@@ ral in the writ@@ ing of the great F@@ ren@@ ch soci@@ o@@ logi@@ st E@@ mi@@ le D@@ ur@@ kh@@ ei@@ m .
"D@@ ur@@ kh@@ ei@@ m even called us H@@ om@@ o du@@ p@@ le@@ x , or t@@ wo@@ -@@ level man ."
The lower level he called the level of the prof@@ an@@ e .
Now prof@@ an@@ e is the op@@ pos@@ ite of sa@@ cre@@ d .
It just means ordinary or common .
And in our ordinary lives we exi@@ st as individu@@ als .
We want to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y our individu@@ al de@@ si@@ res .
We pur@@ sue our individu@@ al go@@ als .
But some@@ times something happens that tri@@ gg@@ ers a pha@@ se change .
"In@@ divi@@ du@@ als un@@ ite into a tea@@ m , a movement or a nation , which is far more than the su@@ m of its parts ."
"D@@ ur@@ kh@@ ei@@ m called this level the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d because he beli@@ ev@@ ed that the fun@@ ction of religi@@ on was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral commun@@ ity ."
D@@ ur@@ kh@@ ei@@ m beli@@ ev@@ ed that anything that un@@ it@@ es us takes on an air of sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness .
"And once people cir@@ cle around some sa@@ cre@@ d ob@@ ject or val@@ ue , they &apos;ll then work as a tea@@ m and fi@@ ght to de@@ f@@ end it ."
"D@@ ur@@ kh@@ ei@@ m wrote about a set of int@@ en@@ se col@@ lec@@ tive em@@ oti@@ ons that ac@@ comp@@ lish this mi@@ rac@@ le of E p@@ lu@@ ri@@ b@@ us un@@ um , of making a group out of individu@@ als ."
Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive jo@@ y in B@@ rit@@ ain on the day World War I@@ I en@@ ded .
"Th@@ ink of the col@@ lec@@ tive ang@@ er in T@@ a@@ h@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , which brought down a dic@@ tat@@ or ."
So let me sum@@ ma@@ ri@@ ze where we are .
I &apos;m o@@ ffer@@ ing the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or of a staircase in the mind .
I &apos;m saying we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ p@@ le@@ x and this staircase takes us up from the prof@@ an@@ e level to the level of the sa@@ cre@@ d .
So here &apos;s the mil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ dol@@ lar question for social scienti@@ sts like me : I@@ s the staircase a fe@@ ature of our evol@@ u@@ tionary desig@@ n ?
"I@@ s it a produc@@ t of natural sel@@ ec@@ tion , like our hands ?"
Well many scienti@@ sts who study religi@@ on take this view .
"The New A@@ the@@ i@@ sts , for example , ar@@ g@@ ue that religi@@ on is a set of mem@@ es , sort of pa@@ ra@@ s@@ iti@@ c mem@@ es , that get inside our min@@ ds and make us do all kinds of cra@@ z@@ y religi@@ ous stuff , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive stuff , like su@@ i@@ ci@@ de bomb@@ ing ."
"And after all , how could it ever be good for us to l@@ ose ourselves ?"
How could it ever be ad@@ ap@@ tive for any organ@@ ism to o@@ ver@@ come self-@@ inter@@ est ?
Well let me show you .
"In &quot; &quot; The D@@ es@@ c@@ ent of M@@ an , &quot; &quot; C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ win wrote a great de@@ al about the evolution of morality — where did it come from , why do we have it ."
"D@@ ar@@ win not@@ ed that many of our vi@@ r@@ tue@@ s are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups ."
But really the way to think about this is as multi@@ level sel@@ ec@@ tion .
So look at it this way : You &apos;ve got comp@@ et@@ ition going on within groups and across groups .
So here &apos;s a group of gu@@ ys on a college cre@@ w tea@@ m .
W@@ i@@ thin this tea@@ m there &apos;s comp@@ et@@ ition .
There are gu@@ ys comp@@ eting with each other .
"The s@@ lo@@ we@@ st ro@@ w@@ ers , the we@@ ak@@ est ro@@ w@@ ers , are going to get c@@ ut from the tea@@ m ."
And only a few of these gu@@ ys are going to go on in the sp@@ ort .
"So within the tea@@ m , their interest@@ s are actually p@@ itt@@ ed against each other ."
And some@@ times it would be adv@@ anta@@ ge@@ ous for one of these gu@@ ys to try to s@@ ab@@ o@@ ta@@ ge the other gu@@ ys .
Maybe he &apos;ll ba@@ d@@ m@@ ou@@ th his chi@@ e@@ f ri@@ val to the co@@ ach .
"But while that comp@@ et@@ ition is going on within the bo@@ at , this comp@@ et@@ ition is going on across bo@@ at@@ s ."
They can only win if they all pull together as a tea@@ m .
"I mean , these things sound tr@@ ite , but they are de@@ ep evol@@ u@@ tionary tru@@ ths ."
Let me il@@ lu@@ st@@ rate this for you .
"@@ Su@@ pp@@ ose we &apos;ve got a group of little organ@@ is@@ ms — they can be ba@@ ct@@ eria , they can be ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers ; it doesn &apos;t matter what — and let &apos;s supp@@ ose that this little group here , they evol@@ ved to be co@@ oper@@ ative ."
"And as you &apos;ll see in this si@@ mu@@ lation , as they inter@@ act they g@@ ain point@@ s , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ led in size , you &apos;ll see them sp@@ l@@ it , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws ."
"We start with just one gre@@ en , and as it inter@@ ac@@ ts it ga@@ ins we@@ al@@ th or point@@ s or fo@@ od ."
"And in sh@@ ort order , the co@@ oper@@ at@@ ors are done for ."
The fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders have taken over .
If a group cannot sol@@ ve the fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ der problem then it cannot rea@@ p the bene@@ f@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation and group sel@@ ec@@ tion cannot get started .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
"In fact , nature has sol@@ ved it many , many times ."
And nature &apos;s fav@@ or@@ ite sol@@ ution is to put everyone in the same bo@@ at .
"For example , why is it that the mit@@ o@@ chon@@ dri@@ a in every cell has its own D@@ N@@ A , to@@ tally se@@ pa@@ rate from the D@@ N@@ A in the nu@@ cle@@ us ?"
It &apos;s because they used to be se@@ pa@@ rate fre@@ e-@@ li@@ ving ba@@ ct@@ eria and they came together and became a super@@ organ@@ ism .
A super@@ organ@@ ism can basically take what it want@@ s .
And pretty so@@ on the whole population is actually com@@ pos@@ ed of these new super@@ organ@@ is@@ ms .
What I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you here is some@@ times called a maj@@ or trans@@ ition in evol@@ u@@ tionary history .
"D@@ ar@@ win &apos;s la@@ ws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of play@@ er on the field and things beg@@ in to look very different ."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some sol@@ it@@ ary wa@@ sp@@ s beg@@ an cre@@ ating little simple , pri@@ miti@@ ve ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves ."
"And it happened again , even more spec@@ ta@@ cu@@ larly , in the last hal@@ f-@@ million years when our own an@@ c@@ est@@ ors became cul@@ tu@@ ral cre@@ atures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a cam@@ p@@ fire , they divi@@ ded la@@ b@@ or , they beg@@ an pa@@ int@@ ing their bo@@ di@@ es , they sp@@ oke their own di@@ al@@ ec@@ ts , and even@@ tually they wor@@ shi@@ ped their own go@@ ds ."
"O@@ n@@ ce they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the bene@@ f@@ its of co@@ oper@@ ation lo@@ cked inside ."
"And they un@@ lo@@ cked the most power@@ ful force ever known on this planet , which is human co@@ oper@@ ation — a force for con@@ struc@@ tion and de@@ struc@@ tion ."
Lo@@ ok at the people in these phot@@ os I &apos;ve been sho@@ wing you .
Do you think they &apos;re there pur@@ su@@ ing their self-@@ inter@@ est ?
"O@@ r are they pur@@ su@@ ing com@@ mu@@ nal inter@@ est , which requi@@ res them to l@@ ose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?"
"O@@ kay , so that was my T@@ al@@ k d@@ eli@@ vered in the stan@@ dar@@ d TED way ."
And now I &apos;m going to give the whole T@@ al@@ k over again in three minutes in a more fu@@ l@@ l-@@ spec@@ tru@@ m sort of way .
"( M@@ u@@ sic ) ( V@@ ide@@ o ) J@@ ona@@ than H@@ ai@@ d@@ t : We humans have many vari@@ eties of religi@@ ous experience , as W@@ il@@ li@@ am J@@ am@@ es expla@@ ined ."
One of the most common is cli@@ mb@@ ing the secre@@ t staircase and l@@ os@@ ing ourselves .
"The staircase takes us from the experience of life as prof@@ an@@ e or ordinary up@@ wards to the experience of life as sa@@ cre@@ d , or de@@ ep@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted ."
"We are H@@ om@@ o du@@ p@@ le@@ x , as D@@ ur@@ kh@@ ei@@ m expla@@ ined ."
"And we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ p@@ le@@ x because we evol@@ ved by multi@@ level sel@@ ec@@ tion , as D@@ ar@@ win expla@@ ined ."
"If it is an ad@@ ap@@ tation , then we evol@@ ved to be religi@@ ous ."
"I mean that we evol@@ ved to see sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness all around us and to jo@@ in with others into te@@ am@@ s and cir@@ cle around sa@@ cre@@ d ob@@ jects , people and ideas ."
This is why politi@@ cs is so tri@@ bal .
"P@@ ol@@ iti@@ cs is par@@ tly prof@@ an@@ e , it &apos;s par@@ tly about self-@@ inter@@ est , but politi@@ cs is also about sa@@ cre@@ d@@ ness ."
It &apos;s about jo@@ ining with others to pur@@ sue moral ideas .
"It &apos;s about the et@@ er@@ nal stru@@ gg@@ le between good and evi@@ l , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good tea@@ m ."
"And most import@@ antly , if the staircase is real , it expla@@ ins the per@@ sist@@ ent under@@ curr@@ ent of dis@@ sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion in modern life ."
"Because human beings are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , hi@@ vi@@ sh cre@@ atures like be@@ es ."
We &apos;re be@@ es . We bu@@ sted out of the hi@@ ve during the E@@ n@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment .
We brok@@ e down the old in@@ stit@@ u@@ tions and brought liber@@ ty to the op@@ pres@@ sed .
No@@ wa@@ days we f@@ ly around like individu@@ al be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our fre@@ e@@ dom .
But some@@ times we won@@ der : I@@ s this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s mis@@ sing ?
"What &apos;s mis@@ sing is that we are H@@ om@@ o du@@ p@@ le@@ x , but modern , s@@ ecu@@ lar society was built to sa@@ tis@@ f@@ y our lower , prof@@ an@@ e selves ."
It &apos;s really com@@ for@@ table down here on the lower level .
"C@@ ome , have a se@@ at in my home ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ment center ."
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase ami@@ d all the cl@@ ut@@ ter and then to do something good and no@@ ble once you cli@@ m@@ b to the top .
I see this de@@ si@@ re in my students at the Uni@@ ver@@ sity of V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
They all want to find a cause or cal@@ ling that they can th@@ row themselves into .
They &apos;re all sear@@ ching for their staircase .
M@@ ost people long to o@@ ver@@ come p@@ et@@ tin@@ ess and become part of something lar@@ ger .
And this expla@@ ins the extra@@ ordinary re@@ son@@ ance of this simple me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or con@@ ju@@ red up ne@@ ar@@ ly 4@@ 00 years ago .
&quot; &quot; No man is an is@@ land enti@@ re of itself .
"E@@ very man is a piece of the contin@@ ent , a part of the main . &quot; &quot; J@@ H : Thank you ."
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk today about the plea@@ su@@ res of every@@ day life .
But I want to beg@@ in with a story of an un@@ u@@ su@@ al and ter@@ ri@@ ble man .
This is H@@ er@@ mann Go@@ ering .
"@@ Go@@ ering was H@@ it@@ ler &apos;s second in comm@@ and in World War I@@ I , his desig@@ nat@@ ed success@@ or ."
"And like H@@ it@@ ler , Go@@ ering f@@ an@@ ci@@ ed h@@ im@@ self a col@@ lec@@ tor of art ."
"H@@ it@@ ler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any ."
And it was his fav@@ or@@ ite ar@@ t@@ work ever .
"W@@ orld War I@@ I came to an end , and Go@@ ering was cap@@ tured , tried at N@@ u@@ re@@ mb@@ er@@ g and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely sent@@ enc@@ ed to death ."
Th@@ en the A@@ l@@ li@@ ed for@@ ces went through his col@@ lec@@ tions and found the pa@@ inti@@ ngs and went after the people who so@@ ld it to him .
"@@ V@@ an M@@ ee@@ g@@ er@@ en was char@@ g@@ ed with the c@@ ri@@ me of t@@ reason , which is itself p@@ uni@@ sha@@ ble by death ."
"S@@ i@@ x weeks into his pri@@ son sent@@ ence , v@@ an M@@ ee@@ g@@ er@@ en con@@ f@@ es@@ sed ."
But he didn &apos;t con@@ f@@ ess to t@@ reason .
"He said , &quot; &quot; I did not sel@@ l a great ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece to that N@@ a@@ z@@ i ."
I pa@@ int@@ ed it myself ; I &apos;m a for@@ ger . &quot; &quot; Now no@@ body beli@@ ev@@ ed him .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll prove it ."
"B@@ ring me a can@@ v@@ as and some pa@@ int , and I will pa@@ int a V@@ er@@ me@@ er much better than I so@@ ld that dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing N@@ a@@ z@@ i ."
He pa@@ int@@ ed a beautiful V@@ er@@ me@@ er .
And then the char@@ ges of t@@ reason were drop@@ ped .
"He had a le@@ s@@ ser char@@ ge of for@@ g@@ ery , got a year sent@@ ence and di@@ ed a h@@ ero to the D@@ ut@@ ch people ."
"There &apos;s a lot more to be said about v@@ an M@@ ee@@ g@@ er@@ en , but I want to turn now to Go@@ ering , who &apos;s pic@@ tured here being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated at N@@ u@@ re@@ mb@@ er@@ g ."
"Now Go@@ ering was , by all ac@@ count@@ s , a ter@@ ri@@ ble man ."
H@@ is American inter@@ ro@@ g@@ at@@ ors descri@@ bed him as an ami@@ c@@ able psy@@ chop@@ ath .
He had disco@@ vered after all that the pa@@ int@@ ing he thought was this was actually that .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a sho@@ ck .
"In particular , &quot; &quot; The Su@@ pp@@ er at E@@ m@@ ma@@ us &quot; &quot; which was vie@@ wed as V@@ er@@ me@@ er &apos;s fin@@ est ma@@ st@@ er@@ piece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a for@@ g@@ ery ."
"It was not that pa@@ int@@ ing , but that pa@@ int@@ ing ."
"And when that was disco@@ vered , it lost all its val@@ ue and was taken away from the mu@@ se@@ um ."
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;m a psycho@@ logi@@ sts — why do ori@@ g@@ ins matter so much ?
Why do we respon@@ d so much to our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of where something comes from ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
"M@@ any soci@@ o@@ logi@@ sts like V@@ eb@@ l@@ en and W@@ ol@@ fe would ar@@ g@@ ue that the reason why we take ori@@ g@@ ins so seri@@ ously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ b@@ s , because we &apos;re focu@@ sed on sta@@ tu@@ s ."
"A@@ m@@ ong other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how power@@ ful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an ori@@ gi@@ nal than a for@@ g@@ ery because there &apos;s always going to be fe@@ wer ori@@ gi@@ nals than for@@ g@@ eri@@ es ."
"@@ that humans are , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , natural born essenti@@ ali@@ sts ."
"What I mean by this is we don &apos;t just respon@@ d to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them ."
"R@@ a@@ ther , our respon@@ se is con@@ diti@@ on@@ ed on our belie@@ f@@ s , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hi@@ d@@ den nature is ."
"I want to su@@ ggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we re@@ act to things ."
"So I want to su@@ ggest that plea@@ sure is de@@ ep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for high@@ er level plea@@ su@@ res like art , but even the most see@@ mi@@ ng@@ ly simple plea@@ su@@ res are aff@@ ected by our belie@@ f@@ s about hi@@ d@@ den es@@ sen@@ ces ."
So take fo@@ od .
W@@ ould you e@@ at this ?
"Well , a good answer is , &quot; &quot; It depen@@ ds . What is it ? &quot; &quot; S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s por@@ k , but not be@@ e@@ f ."
F@@ ew of you would e@@ at it if it &apos;s a ra@@ t or a human .
S@@ ome of you would e@@ at it only if it &apos;s a st@@ rang@@ ely co@@ lo@@ red piece of to@@ f@@ u .
That &apos;s not so surpri@@ sing .
But what &apos;s more interesting is how it ta@@ st@@ es to you will depen@@ d c@@ riti@@ cally on what you think you &apos;re e@@ ating .
So one de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration of this was done with young children .
"@@ How do you make children not just be more lik@@ ely to e@@ at car@@ rot@@ s and dr@@ ink mil@@ k , but to get more plea@@ sure from e@@ ating car@@ rot@@ s and dr@@ in@@ king mil@@ k — to think they ta@@ st@@ e better ?"
How do you get a@@ du@@ l@@ ts to really en@@ jo@@ y w@@ ine ?
This was rec@@ ently done with a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c twi@@ st .
In front of them on a scre@@ en is information about the w@@ ine .
"E@@ very@@ body , of course , dr@@ in@@ ks exactly the same w@@ ine ."
"But if you believe you &apos;re dr@@ in@@ king ex@@ pen@@ sive stuff , parts of the brain as@@ soci@@ ated with plea@@ sure and re@@ ward light up like a Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s tree ."
"It &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more plea@@ su@@ ra@@ ble , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way ."
O@@ r take sex .
These are sti@@ mul@@ i I &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
"And if you simply show people these pic@@ tures , they &apos;ll say these are fai@@ r@@ ly att@@ rac@@ tive people ."
"You probably think the picture on the left is ma@@ le , the one on the right is fe@@ ma@@ le ."
"If that belie@@ f turns out to be mis@@ taken , it will make a difference ."
"It will make a difference if you were to disco@@ ver that the person you &apos;re looking at with lu@@ st is actually a dis@@ gu@@ ised ver@@ sion of your son or daughter , your mother or father ."
"If you like somebody , they look better to you ."
This is why sp@@ ou@@ ses in happy mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ es t@@ end to think that their hus@@ b@@ and or wife looks much better than any@@ one else thin@@ ks that they do .
( Laughter ) A particu@@ larly d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c example of this comes from a ne@@ u@@ ro@@ logical dis@@ order known as C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
So C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is a dis@@ order where you get a speci@@ fi@@ c d@@ el@@ u@@ sion .
"Now of@@ ten , a resul@@ t of C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is tra@@ gi@@ c ."
But there &apos;s at lea@@ st one case where C@@ ap@@ gra@@ s sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome had a happy en@@ ding .
This was rec@@ or@@ ded in 19@@ 3@@ 1 .
The golf clu@@ b@@ s were o@@ w@@ ned by Jo@@ h@@ n F@@ . K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy and so@@ ld for thre@@ e-@@ quar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ ction .
The bubble gu@@ m was che@@ wed up by po@@ p star B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y S@@ pe@@ ar@@ s and so@@ ld for se@@ ver@@ al hund@@ re@@ ds of dollars .
"And in fact , there &apos;s a th@@ ri@@ ving market in the parti@@ ally e@@ at@@ en fo@@ od of b@@ el@@ o@@ ved people ."
( Laughter ) The sh@@ oes are perhaps the most val@@ u@@ able of all .
"A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to an un@@ con@@ fi@@ r@@ m@@ ed re@@ por@@ t , a S@@ au@@ di mil@@ li@@ o@@ nai@@ re o@@ ffer@@ ed 10 million dollars for this pai@@ r of sh@@ oes ."
They were the ones th@@ ro@@ wn at G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ u@@ sh at an I@@ ra@@ q@@ i pre@@ ss con@@ fer@@ ence se@@ ver@@ al years ago .
"W@@ ith my colle@@ ag@@ ues G@@ e@@ or@@ ge Ne@@ w@@ man and G@@ i@@ l D@@ i@@ es@@ en@@ dru@@ ck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , mat@@ ters for the ob@@ jects that people like ."
"So in one of our experiments , we asked people to na@@ me a famous person who they a@@ do@@ red , a li@@ ving person they a@@ do@@ red ."
So one answer was G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey .
"Th@@ en we asked them , &quot; How much would you pay for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ at@@ er ? &quot;"
And the answer is a fai@@ r amount — more than you would pay for a brand new swe@@ at@@ er or a swe@@ at@@ er o@@ w@@ ned by somebody who you didn &apos;t ad@@ ore .
Th@@ en we asked other groups of sub@@ jects — we gave them different re@@ stri@@ c@@ tions and different conditions .
"So for in@@ stance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , you can buy the swe@@ at@@ er , but you can &apos;t tell any@@ body you own it , and you can &apos;t re@@ sel@@ l it . &quot; &quot; That drop@@ s the val@@ ue of it , su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ing that that &apos;s one reason why we like it ."
"But what really cau@@ ses an eff@@ ect is you tell people , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , you could re@@ sel@@ l it , you could bo@@ a@@ st about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly wa@@ shed . &quot; &quot; That cau@@ ses a hu@@ ge drop in the val@@ ue ."
"As my wife put it , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve wa@@ shed away the C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey co@@ oti@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go back to art ."
"But I don &apos;t want a du@@ plic@@ ate , even if I can &apos;t tell the difference ."
"That &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , I &apos;m a s@@ no@@ b and want to bo@@ a@@ st about having an ori@@ gi@@ nal ."
Wh@@ o here lik@@ es the work of J@@ ac@@ k@@ son P@@ ol@@ lo@@ ck ?
"O@@ kay . Wh@@ o here , it does nothing for them ?"
They just don &apos;t like it .
And they then re@@ por@@ ted that her father was co@@ a@@ ching her .
"When this came out on tel@@ evi@@ sion , the val@@ ue of her art drop@@ ped to nothing ."
"It was the same art , physi@@ cally , but the history had changed ."
So he got J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell to take his million dol@@ lar viol@@ in down to a W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ . sub@@ way sta@@ tion and st@@ and in the cor@@ ner and see how much money he would make .
And here &apos;s a bri@@ e@@ f cli@@ p of this .
"( Vi@@ ol@@ in music ) Af@@ ter being there for thre@@ e-@@ quar@@ ters of an h@@ our , he made 3@@ 2 dollars ."
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
"@@ App@@ ar@@ ently to really en@@ jo@@ y the music of J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell , you have to know you &apos;re li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to J@@ os@@ hu@@ a B@@ ell ."
Because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the vi@@ de@@ o — she comes up .
So she &apos;s st@@ un@@ ned that he &apos;s standing in a sub@@ way sta@@ tion .
So she &apos;s stru@@ ck with p@@ ity .
She rea@@ ches into her pur@@ se and hands him a 20 .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second example from music is from Jo@@ h@@ n C@@ age &apos;s moder@@ ni@@ st com@@ position , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;"
And people have different vie@@ ws on this .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
"( Laughter ) F@@ or a dol@@ lar 9@@ 9 , you can li@@ st@@ en to that si@@ l@@ ence , which is different than other for@@ ms of si@@ l@@ ence . ( Laughter )"
"Now I &apos;ve been talking so far about plea@@ sure , but what I want to su@@ ggest is that everything I &apos;ve said app@@ lies as well to pain ."
"And how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your belie@@ f@@ s about the ess@@ ence of it , aff@@ ect how it hu@@ r@@ ts ."
One lo@@ vely experiment was done by K@@ ur@@ t G@@ ra@@ y and D@@ an W@@ e@@ g@@ ner .
And they gave them a seri@@ es of pa@@ in@@ ful electri@@ c sho@@ cks .
So it was a seri@@ es of five pa@@ in@@ ful sho@@ cks .
"The second sho@@ ck fe@@ els less pa@@ in@@ ful , because you get a bit used to it ."
"The thir@@ d drop@@ s , the f@@ our@@ th , the fi@@ f@@ th ."
The pain gets less .
"In the other con@@ dition , they &apos;re told that the person in the next room is sho@@ cking them on pur@@ p@@ ose — kno@@ ws they &apos;re sho@@ cking them ."
The first sho@@ ck hu@@ r@@ ts like h@@ ell .
"The second sho@@ ck hu@@ r@@ ts just as much , and the thir@@ d and the f@@ our@@ th and the fi@@ f@@ th ."
"The most extre@@ me example of this is that in some c@@ ases , pain under the right circu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces can trans@@ form into plea@@ sure ."
"The point was ni@@ c@@ ely sum@@ ma@@ ri@@ zed by the p@@ oet Jo@@ h@@ n M@@ il@@ ton who wrote , &quot; &quot; The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a he@@ a@@ ven of h@@ ell , a h@@ ell of he@@ a@@ ven . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you ."
( Applause )
And finally I en@@ ded up en@@ count@@ ering psycho@@ logy by chan@@ ce .
"I was at a sk@@ i re@@ sort in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land without any money to actually en@@ jo@@ y myself , because the s@@ now had m@@ el@@ ted and I didn &apos;t have money to go to a mo@@ vi@@ e . But I found that on the — I read in the ne@@ w@@ spap@@ ers that there was to be a pre@@ sen@@ tation by someone in a place that I &apos;d seen in the center of Z@@ u@@ rich , and it was about fl@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ ers &#91; that &#93; he was going to talk ."
And the man who talked at that even@@ ing lec@@ ture was very interesting .
And this se@@ em@@ ed very interesting to me .
And I started read@@ ing his bo@@ ok@@ s after that lec@@ ture .
"And that was C@@ arl J@@ un@@ g , wh@@ ose na@@ me or work I had no idea about ."
Th@@ en I came to this country to study psycho@@ logy and I started trying to understand the ro@@ ots of happiness .
"This is a ty@@ pi@@ cal resul@@ t that many people have pres@@ ent@@ ed , and there are many vari@@ ations on it ."
"But this , for in@@ stance , sho@@ ws that about 30 percent of the people sur@@ v@@ ey@@ ed in the United States since 19@@ 5@@ 6 say that their life is very happy ."
And that ha@@ sn &apos;t changed at all .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as the perso@@ nal income , on a scal@@ e that has been hel@@ d con@@ st@@ ant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate for inf@@ lation , has more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ led , almost tri@@ pl@@ ed , in that per@@ i@@ od ."
"But you find essentially the same results , nam@@ ely , that after a certain basic point — which cor@@ respon@@ ds more or less to just a few 1@@ ,000 dollars ab@@ ove the mini@@ mu@@ m po@@ ver@@ ty level — incre@@ ases in material well-being don &apos;t seem to aff@@ ect how happy people are ."
"In fact , you can find that the lack of basic resour@@ ces , material resour@@ ces , con@@ tri@@ b@@ utes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material resour@@ ces does not increase happiness ."
"So my research has been focu@@ sed more on — after fin@@ ding out these things that actually cor@@ respon@@ ded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where — in every@@ day life , in our nor@@ mal experience — do we feel really happy ?"
"And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I beg@@ an to look at cre@@ ative people — first ar@@ ti@@ sts and scienti@@ sts , and so for@@ th — trying to understand what made them feel that it was wor@@ th essentially sp@@ en@@ ding their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t exp@@ ect ei@@ ther f@@ ame or for@@ tun@@ e , but which made their life mean@@ ing@@ ful and wor@@ th doing ."
This was one of the lead@@ ing com@@ pos@@ ers of American music back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
And the inter@@ view was 40 pa@@ ges long .
But this little ex@@ cer@@ pt is a very good sum@@ ma@@ ry of what he was saying during the inter@@ view .
And it descri@@ b@@ es how he fe@@ els when com@@ pos@@ ing is going well .
And he says by descri@@ b@@ ing it as an ec@@ sta@@ tic state .
"Now , &quot; &quot; ec@@ sta@@ sy &quot; &quot; in G@@ re@@ ek me@@ ant simply to st@@ and to the side of something ."
And then it became essentially an anal@@ o@@ gy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary every@@ day rou@@ tin@@ es .
So ec@@ sta@@ sy is essentially a ste@@ pp@@ ing into an al@@ ter@@ nati@@ ve reality .
"And it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations that we look up to as having been p@@ in@@ na@@ c@@ les of human achiev@@ ement — whether it &apos;s China , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , the H@@ in@@ du civi@@ li@@ zation , or the Ma@@ y@@ as , or E@@ g@@ y@@ pti@@ ans — what we know about them is really about their ec@@ sta@@ si@@ es , not about their every@@ day life ."
"We know the tem@@ pl@@ es they built , where people could come to experience a different reality ."
"We know about the circu@@ ses , the are@@ na@@ s , the the@@ at@@ ers ."
"@@ These are the re@@ ma@@ ins of civi@@ li@@ z@@ ations and they are the pla@@ ces that people went to experience life in a more con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed , more or@@ der@@ ed form ."
"Now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this ar@@ ena , which is built like a G@@ re@@ ek am@@ phi@@ the@@ atre , is a place for ec@@ sta@@ sy also ."
We are parti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing in a reality that is different from that of the every@@ day life that we &apos;re used to .
But this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
"He needs just a piece of pap@@ er where he can put down little mar@@ ks , and as he does that , he can imagine s@@ oun@@ ds that had not exi@@ sted before in that particular com@@ bi@@ nation ."
"So once he gets to that point of beginning to create , like J@@ en@@ ni@@ f@@ er did in her im@@ pro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tion , a new reality — that is , a moment of ec@@ sta@@ sy — he ent@@ ers that different reality ."
Now he says also that this is so int@@ en@@ se an experience that it fe@@ els almost as if he didn &apos;t exi@@ st .
And that s@@ oun@@ ds like a kind of a r@@ om@@ an@@ tic ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation .
"But actually , our ner@@ v@@ ous system is in@@ cap@@ able of proc@@ es@@ sing more than about 1@@ 10 b@@ its of information per second ."
"And in order to hear me and understand what I &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 b@@ its per second ."
That &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
You can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
"Well , when you are really inv@@ ol@@ ved in this completely eng@@ ag@@ ing process of cre@@ ating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ ention left over to mon@@ it@@ or how his body fe@@ els , or his problems at home ."
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hu@@ ng@@ ry or ti@@ red .
"H@@ is body di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s , his i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s from his con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough att@@ ention , like n@@ one of us do , to really do well something that requi@@ res a lot of con@@ cent@@ ration , and at the same time to feel that he exi@@ sts ."
So exi@@ st@@ ence is tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ri@@ ly su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded .
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
"Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I wouldn &apos;t feel any a@@ we or won@@ der , because I can &apos;t comp@@ ose . ( Laughter ) So what it &apos;s telling you here is that ob@@ vi@@ ously this au@@ to@@ ma@@ tic , sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous process that he &apos;s descri@@ b@@ ing can only happen to someone who is very well tra@@ ined and who has developed te@@ chni@@ qu@@ e ."
And it has become a kind of a tru@@ ism in the study of cre@@ ati@@ vity that you can &apos;t be cre@@ ating anything with less than 10 years of te@@ chni@@ cal@@ -@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge im@@ m@@ er@@ sion in a particular field .
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cs or music , it takes that long to be able to beg@@ in to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before ."
"Now , when that happens , he says the music just flo@@ ws out ."
And because all of these people I started inter@@ vie@@ wing — this was an inter@@ view which is over 30 years old — so many of the people descri@@ bed this as a sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous flow that I called this ty@@ pe of experience the &quot; &quot; flow experience . &quot; &quot; And it happens in different re@@ al@@ ms .
"For in@@ stance , a p@@ oet descri@@ b@@ es it in this form ."
This is by a student of m@@ ine who inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the lead@@ ing writ@@ ers and poet@@ s in the United States .
"And it descri@@ b@@ es the same eff@@ or@@ t@@ less , sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ing that you get when you en@@ ter into this ec@@ sta@@ tic state ."
"This p@@ oet descri@@ b@@ es it as op@@ en@@ ing a door that flo@@ at@@ s in the sk@@ y — a very si@@ mi@@ lar descri@@ p@@ tion to what A@@ l@@ ber@@ t Einstein gave as to how he imag@@ ined the for@@ ces of relati@@ vity , when he was stru@@ gg@@ ling with trying to understand how it worked ."
But it happens in other acti@@ v@@ ities .
"For in@@ stance , this is another student of m@@ ine , Su@@ san J@@ ac@@ k@@ son from Au@@ st@@ ra@@ li@@ a , who did work with some of the lead@@ ing a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es in the world ."
"And you see here in this descri@@ p@@ tion of an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c sk@@ at@@ er , the same essential descri@@ p@@ tion of the phenomen@@ o@@ logy of the in@@ ner state of the person ."
"You don &apos;t think ; it goes au@@ to@@ mati@@ cally , if you m@@ er@@ ge yourself with the music , and so for@@ th ."
"It happens also , actually , in the most rec@@ ent book I wrote , called &quot; &quot; Go@@ od B@@ u@@ siness , &quot; &quot; where I inter@@ vie@@ wed some of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had been n@@ omi@@ nat@@ ed by their pe@@ ers as being both very successful and very e@@ thi@@ cal , very soci@@ ally respon@@ sible ."
You see that these people de@@ f@@ ine success as something that hel@@ ps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
"And like all of these successful and respon@@ sible C@@ E@@ O@@ s say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a mean@@ ing@@ ful and successful job ."
A@@ nit@@ a R@@ od@@ di@@ ck is another one of these C@@ E@@ O@@ s we inter@@ vie@@ wed .
"She is the f@@ oun@@ der of B@@ o@@ dy S@@ h@@ op , the natural cos@@ me@@ ti@@ cs king ."
It &apos;s kind of a pas@@ sion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
"This is an interesting little quot@@ e from M@@ as@@ ar@@ u I@@ buk@@ a , who was at that time starting out S@@ on@@ y without any money , without a produc@@ t — they didn &apos;t have a produc@@ t , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea ."
"And the idea he had was to es@@ ta@@ bli@@ sh a place of work where engine@@ ers can feel the jo@@ y of techno@@ logical in@@ nov@@ ation , be a@@ ware of their mis@@ sion to society and work to their heart &apos;s con@@ t@@ ent ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t improve on this as a good example of how flow ent@@ ers the work@@ place .
"Now , when we do studies — we have , with other colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world , done over 8@@ ,000 inter@@ vie@@ ws of people — from D@@ om@@ ini@@ can mon@@ ks , to bl@@ ind nun@@ s , to H@@ ima@@ lay@@ an cli@@ mb@@ ers , to N@@ av@@ a@@ j@@ o s@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ ds — who en@@ jo@@ y their work ."
"And re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the culture , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of education or w@@ hat@@ ever , there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow ."
"You know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time di@@ sap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s , you for@@ get yourself , you feel part of something lar@@ ger ."
"And once the conditions are present , what you are doing becomes wor@@ th doing for its own sak@@ e ."
"In our studies , we re@@ present the every@@ day life of people in this simple s@@ che@@ me ."
"And we can measure this very preci@@ sel@@ y , actually , because we give people electr@@ oni@@ c pa@@ g@@ ers that go off 10 times a day , and wh@@ en@@ ever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about ."
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of sk@@ ill that they feel they have at that moment .
"So for each person we can es@@ ta@@ bli@@ sh an average , which is the center of the di@@ ag@@ ra@@ m ."
"That would be your mean level of challenge and sk@@ ill , which will be different from that of any@@ body else ."
"But you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle ."
"If we know what that set point is , we can predic@@ t fai@@ r@@ ly accu@@ rat@@ ely when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challeng@@ es are high@@ er than average and skil@@ ls are high@@ er than average ."
And then the other are@@ as become less and less positive .
A@@ rou@@ sa@@ l is still good because you are o@@ ver@@ -@@ challeng@@ ed there .
"C@@ on@@ tro@@ l is also a good place to be , because there you feel com@@ for@@ table , but not very exc@@ ited ."
It &apos;s not very challeng@@ ing any more .
"And if you want to en@@ ter flow from control , you have to increase the challeng@@ es ."
So those two are ide@@ al and comp@@ le@@ men@@ ta@@ ry are@@ as from which flow is easy to go into .
The other com@@ bi@@ na@@ tions of challenge and sk@@ ill become progre@@ ssi@@ vely less op@@ ti@@ mal .
"B@@ ore@@ dom beg@@ ins to be very a@@ ver@@ sive and ap@@ a@@ thy becomes very neg@@ ative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your skil@@ ls , there &apos;s no challenge ."
"The lar@@ gest single con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to that experience is wat@@ ching tel@@ evi@@ sion ; the next one is being in the ba@@ th@@ room , s@@ itt@@ ing ."
"E@@ ven though some@@ times wat@@ ching tel@@ evi@@ sion about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a pro@@ gra@@ m you really want to watch and you get fe@@ ed@@ back from it ."
So the question we are trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss — and I &apos;m way over time — is how to put more and more of every@@ day life in that flow chan@@ ne@@ l .
And that is the kind of challenge that we &apos;re trying to understand .
"And some of you ob@@ vi@@ ously know how to do that sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ously without any ad@@ vice , but un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately a lot of people don &apos;t ."
"And that &apos;s what our man@@ d@@ ate is , in a way , to do ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I have an inter@@ est in education .
S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are being seven ?
"I &apos;ve got two kids ; he &apos;s 2@@ 1 now , my daughter &apos;s 16 ."
He didn &apos;t want to come to Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es .
"They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life ."
The brain isn &apos;t divi@@ ded into com@@ par@@ tm@@ ents .
"Because you are , are@@ n &apos;t you ?"
"If I &apos;m co@@ ok@@ ing , the door is sh@@ ut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the ho@@ ok , if she comes in I get an@@ no@@ y@@ ed ."
"T@@ ake her to a dan@@ ce school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happened ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was ."
We wal@@ ked in this room and it was fu@@ ll of people like me .
P@@ eople who had to move to think . &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o had to move to think .
"We are built out of very small stuff , and we are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a very large cosmo@@ s , and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at ei@@ ther of those scal@@ es , and that &apos;s because our bra@@ ins ha@@ ven &apos;t evol@@ ved to understand the world at that scal@@ e ."
"In@@ stead , we &apos;re t@@ rapp@@ ed on this very thin sli@@ ce of perc@@ ep@@ tion right in the middle ."
So take the col@@ ors of our world .
But we &apos;re not see@@ ing all the wa@@ ves out there .
"In fact , what we see is less than a 10 tri@@ l@@ li@@ on@@ th of what &apos;s out there ."
"Now , it &apos;s not that these things are in@@ h@@ er@@ ently un@@ see@@ able ."
"S@@ nak@@ es inclu@@ de some inf@@ ra@@ red in their reality , and hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es inclu@@ de ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let in their view of the world , and of course we build ma@@ chin@@ es in the da@@ sh@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds of our car@@ s to pi@@ ck up on sig@@ nals in the radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ enc@@ y range , and we built ma@@ chin@@ es in h@@ os@@ pit@@ als to pi@@ ck up on the X@@ -@@ ra@@ y range ."
"But you can &apos;t sense any of those by yourself , at lea@@ st not yet , because you don &apos;t come equi@@ pp@@ ed with the prop@@ er sen@@ s@@ ors ."
"Now , what this means is that our experience of reality is con@@ st@@ ra@@ ined by our bio@@ logy , and that goes against the common sense noti@@ on that our ey@@ es and our ear@@ s and our fi@@ ng@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are just pic@@ king up the ob@@ jec@@ tive reality that &apos;s out there ."
"In@@ stead , our bra@@ ins are sam@@ pl@@ ing just a little bit of the world ."
"So in the bl@@ ind and de@@ a@@ f world of the ti@@ ck , the important sig@@ nals are tem@@ per@@ ature and b@@ ut@@ y@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id ; in the world of the black gh@@ ost kni@@ fe@@ fi@@ sh , its sen@@ s@@ ory world is la@@ vi@@ sh@@ ly co@@ lo@@ red by electri@@ cal fiel@@ ds ; and for the e@@ cho@@ lo@@ c@@ ating b@@ at , its reality is con@@ struc@@ ted out of air com@@ pres@@ sion wa@@ ves ."
"That &apos;s the sli@@ ce of their ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem that they can pi@@ ck up on , and we have a word for this in science ."
"Now , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , every an@@ ima@@ l as@@ sum@@ es that its um@@ wel@@ t is the enti@@ re ob@@ jec@@ tive reality out there , because why would you ever stop to imagine that there &apos;s something be@@ yon@@ d what we can sense ."
Let &apos;s do a con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ne@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ er on this .
I@@ mag@@ ine that you are a blo@@ od@@ h@@ ound do@@ g .
Y@@ our whole world is about sm@@ el@@ ling .
"You &apos;ve got a long sn@@ out that has 200 million sc@@ ent rec@@ ep@@ tors in it , and you have w@@ et n@@ os@@ tri@@ ls that att@@ rac@@ t and tra@@ p sc@@ ent molecules , and your n@@ os@@ tri@@ ls even have s@@ l@@ its so you can take big n@@ os@@ e@@ fu@@ ls of air ."
E@@ very@@ thing is about sm@@ ell for you .
"So one day , you stop in your tra@@ cks with a re@@ ve@@ lation ."
"You look at your human o@@ w@@ ner and you think , &quot; &quot; What is it like to have the p@@ iti@@ ful , im@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ shed n@@ ose of a human ?"
( Laughter ) What is it like when you take a fe@@ eb@@ le little n@@ os@@ e@@ ful of air ?
"@@ How can you not know that there &apos;s a c@@ at 100 y@@ ar@@ ds away , or that your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or was on this very sp@@ ot six hours ago ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So because we &apos;re humans , we &apos;ve never experienc@@ ed that world of sm@@ ell , so we don &apos;t mi@@ ss it , because we are fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly s@@ et@@ t@@ led into our um@@ wel@@ t ."
"But the question is , do we have to be stu@@ ck there ?"
"So as a neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , I &apos;m interest@@ ed in the way that technology might exp@@ and our um@@ wel@@ t , and how that &apos;s going to change the experience of being human ."
"So the way this works is , you take a mi@@ c@@ ro@@ phone and you di@@ g@@ iti@@ ze the sig@@ nal , and you put an elec@@ tro@@ de stri@@ p direc@@ tly into the in@@ ner ear ."
"Wh@@ y ? It &apos;s because these techno@@ logi@@ es speak the language of S@@ i@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ ley , and it &apos;s not exactly the same di@@ al@@ ect as our natural bio@@ logical sense org@@ ans ."
But the fact is that it works ; the brain figu@@ res out how to use the sig@@ nals just f@@ ine .
"Now , how do we understand that ?"
"Well , here &apos;s the big secre@@ t : Y@@ our brain is not hear@@ ing or see@@ ing any of this ."
Y@@ our brain is lo@@ cked in a v@@ au@@ l@@ t of si@@ l@@ ence and dar@@ k@@ ness inside your sk@@ u@@ ll .
"All it ever se@@ es are elec@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sig@@ nals that come in along different data c@@ ab@@ les , and this is all it has to work with , and nothing more ."
And this is a very e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent kind of machine .
"It &apos;s essentially a gener@@ al pur@@ p@@ ose comp@@ ut@@ ing de@@ vice , and it just takes in everything and figu@@ res out what it &apos;s going to do with it , and that , I think , fre@@ es up M@@ other N@@ ature to tin@@ k@@ er around with different sor@@ ts of in@@ put chan@@ n@@ els ."
The brain figu@@ res out what to do with the data that comes in .
"And when you look across the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom , you find lots of per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al de@@ vi@@ ces ."
"So s@@ nak@@ es have he@@ at p@@ its with which to det@@ ect inf@@ ra@@ red , and the gh@@ ost kni@@ fe@@ fi@@ sh has elec@@ tro@@ rec@@ ep@@ tors , and the star@@ -@@ n@@ osed mo@@ le has this ap@@ pen@@ da@@ ge with 2@@ 2 fi@@ ng@@ ers on it with which it fe@@ els around and con@@ struc@@ ts a 3@@ D mo@@ de@@ l of the world , and many bir@@ ds have mag@@ n@@ et@@ ite so they can ori@@ ent to the magnetic field of the planet ."
So what this means is that nature doesn &apos;t have to contin@@ u@@ ally re@@ desig@@ n the brain .
"In@@ stead , with the princi@@ pl@@ es of brain oper@@ ation es@@ ta@@ bli@@ shed , all nature has to wor@@ ry about is desig@@ ning new per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ als ."
O@@ kay . So what this means is this : The le@@ s@@ son that sur@@ fac@@ es is that there &apos;s nothing really speci@@ al or fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal about the bio@@ logy that we come to the table with .
It &apos;s just what we have in@@ h@@ er@@ ited from a comp@@ le@@ x ro@@ ad of evolution .
"But it &apos;s not what we have to sti@@ ck with , and our best pro@@ of of princi@@ ple of this comes from what &apos;s called sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ stit@@ ution ."
"Now , that might sound sp@@ ecu@@ la@@ tive , but the first pap@@ er de@@ mon@@ st@@ rating this was published in the jour@@ nal N@@ ature in 19@@ 6@@ 9 ."
Why the fore@@ head ? Because you &apos;re not using it for much else .
"The most modern in@@ car@@ nation is called the bra@@ in@@ por@@ t , and this is a little elec@@ tro@@ g@@ ri@@ d that sit@@ s on your t@@ ong@@ ue , and the vi@@ de@@ o fe@@ ed gets turned into these little elec@@ tro@@ ta@@ cti@@ le sig@@ nals , and bl@@ ind people get so good at using this that they can th@@ row a b@@ all into a ba@@ sk@@ et , or they can na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate comp@@ le@@ x ob@@ sta@@ cle cour@@ ses ."
They can come to see through their t@@ ong@@ ue .
"Now , that s@@ oun@@ ds completely in@@ san@@ e , right ?"
"But remem@@ ber , all vision ever is is elec@@ tro@@ che@@ mi@@ cal sig@@ nals cour@@ sing around in your brain ."
Y@@ our brain doesn &apos;t know where the sig@@ nals come from .
It just figu@@ res out what to do with them .
"And we wanted to do this , given the power and u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity of por@@ table comp@@ ut@@ ing , we wanted to make sure that this would ru@@ n on cell phon@@ es and ta@@ bl@@ ets , and also we wanted to make this a w@@ ea@@ ra@@ ble , something that you could w@@ ear under your c@@ lo@@ thing ."
So here &apos;s the con@@ cept .
"So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing , my sound is getting cap@@ tured by the ta@@ ble@@ t , and then it &apos;s getting ma@@ pp@@ ed on@@ to a v@@ est that &apos;s co@@ vered in vib@@ rat@@ ory mot@@ ors , just like the mot@@ ors in your cell phone . So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing ,@@ "
the sound is getting trans@@ lated to a patt@@ ern of vi@@ bra@@ tion on the v@@ est .
"Now , this is not just con@@ cep@@ tual : this ta@@ ble@@ t is tran@@ sm@@ itt@@ ing B@@ lue@@ to@@ ot@@ h , and I &apos;m w@@ ear@@ ing the v@@ est right now ."
So as I &apos;m speak@@ ing — ( Applause ) — the sound is getting trans@@ lated into d@@ y@@ na@@ mic patt@@ er@@ ns of vi@@ bra@@ tion .
I &apos;m feel@@ ing the son@@ ic world around me .
"So , we &apos;ve been te@@ st@@ ing this with de@@ a@@ f people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feel@@ ing , they can start understanding the language of the v@@ est ."
So this is J@@ ona@@ than . He &apos;s 3@@ 7 years old . He has a ma@@ ster &apos;s de@@ g@@ ree .
"He was born prof@@ oun@@ dly de@@ a@@ f , which means that there &apos;s a part of his um@@ wel@@ t that &apos;s u@@ na@@ v@@ ai@@ la@@ ble to him ."
"So we had J@@ ona@@ than tra@@ in with the v@@ est for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fi@@ f@@ th day ."
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t No@@ vi@@ ch : You .
S@@ N : W@@ here . W@@ here .
D@@ E : J@@ ona@@ than is able to trans@@ late this comp@@ lic@@ ated patt@@ ern of vi@@ bra@@ tions into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
S@@ N : T@@ ou@@ ch . T@@ ou@@ ch .
"Now , this technology has the potenti@@ al to be a g@@ am@@ e-@@ chang@@ er , because the only other sol@@ ution for de@@ af@@ ness is a co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ pl@@ ant , and that requi@@ res an inv@@ a@@ sive sur@@ g@@ ery ."
"And this can be built for 40 times che@@ ap@@ er than a co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ pl@@ ant , which op@@ ens up this technology glob@@ ally , even for the poorest countries ."
"Now , we &apos;ve been very en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed by our results with sen@@ s@@ ory sub@@ stit@@ ution , but what we &apos;ve been thinking a lot about is sen@@ s@@ ory ad@@ dition ."
"@@ How could we use a technology like this to ad@@ d a completely new kind of sense , to exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t ?"
"For example , could we fe@@ ed re@@ al@@ -@@ time data from the Internet direc@@ tly into somebody &apos;s brain , and can they devel@@ op a direc@@ t perc@@ ep@@ tual experience ?"
So here &apos;s an experiment we &apos;re doing in the la@@ b .
"Th@@ en , two b@@ ut@@ t@@ ons app@@ ear , and he has to make a cho@@ ice ."
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
"He doesn &apos;t know that what we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding is re@@ al@@ -@@ time data from the st@@ o@@ ck market , and he &apos;s making buy and sel@@ l deci@@ sions ."
( Laughter ) And the fe@@ ed@@ back is telling him whether he did the right thing or not .
"And what we &apos;re see@@ ing is , can we exp@@ and the human um@@ vel@@ t so that he comes to have , after se@@ ver@@ al weeks , a direc@@ t perc@@ ep@@ tual experience of the economic mov@@ ements of the planet ."
So we &apos;ll re@@ por@@ t on that later to see how well this goes .
"( Laughter ) Here &apos;s another thing we &apos;re doing : D@@ u@@ ring the tal@@ ks this morning , we &apos;ve been au@@ to@@ mati@@ cally sc@@ rap@@ ing T@@ wit@@ ter for the TE@@ D@@ 20@@ 15 ha@@ sh@@ ta@@ g , and we &apos;ve been doing an au@@ to@@ mat@@ ed senti@@ ment anal@@ y@@ sis , which means , are people using positive words or neg@@ ative words or ne@@ ut@@ ral ?"
"And while this has been going on , I have been feel@@ ing this , and so I am p@@ lu@@ gg@@ ed in to the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate em@@ oti@@ on of thousands of people in real time , and that &apos;s a new kind of human experience , because now I can know how everyone &apos;s doing and how much you &apos;re lo@@ ving this ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a bi@@ gg@@ er experience than a human can nor@@ ma@@ lly have .
We &apos;re also expan@@ ding the um@@ vel@@ t of p@@ il@@ ots .
"So in this case , the v@@ est is stre@@ am@@ ing n@@ ine different measu@@ res from this qu@@ ad@@ cop@@ ter , so pit@@ ch and ya@@ w and ro@@ ll and ori@@ en@@ tation and he@@ ad@@ ing , and that im@@ pro@@ ves this pi@@ lot &apos;s ab@@ il@@ ity to f@@ ly it ."
"It &apos;s essentially like he &apos;s ex@@ ten@@ ding his sk@@ in up there , far away ."
And that &apos;s just the beginning .
"What we &apos;re en@@ vi@@ si@@ oning is taking a modern co@@ ck@@ pit fu@@ ll of g@@ au@@ ges and instead of trying to read the whole thing , you feel it ."
"We live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between ac@@ c@@ es@@ sing big data and experiencing it ."
So I think there &apos;s really no end to the possi@@ bil@@ ities on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on for human expan@@ sion .
"@@ Just imagine an ast@@ ro@@ na@@ ut being able to feel the o@@ ver@@ all health of the Inter@@ national S@@ pa@@ ce S@@ tation , or , for that matter , having you feel the in@@ vi@@ sible states of your own health , like your blo@@ od su@@ ga@@ r and the state of your mi@@ c@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome , or having 3@@ 6@@ 0@@ -@@ de@@ g@@ ree vision or see@@ ing in inf@@ ra@@ red or ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ."
"So the k@@ ey is this : A@@ s we move into the future , we &apos;re going to incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly be able to choose our own per@@ i@@ ph@@ er@@ al de@@ vi@@ ces ."
"We no longer have to wait for M@@ other N@@ ature &apos;s sen@@ s@@ ory gi@@ f@@ ts on her tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es , but instead , like any good par@@ ent , she &apos;s given us the to@@ ols that we need to go out and de@@ f@@ ine our own tra@@ jec@@ t@@ ory ."
"So the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?"
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ n@@ der@@ son : Can you feel it ? D@@ E : Y@@ eah .
"A@@ c@@ tually , this was the first time I f@@ el@@ t ap@@ pla@@ use on the v@@ est ."
It &apos;s ni@@ ce . It &apos;s like a mas@@ sage . ( Laughter ) C@@ A : T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going cra@@ z@@ y . T@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s going ma@@ d .
So that st@@ o@@ ck market experiment .
"D@@ E : Well , that &apos;s right , I wouldn &apos;t have to writ@@ e to N@@ I@@ H any@@ more ."
So what that tells us is that the cor@@ te@@ x is kind of a on@@ e-@@ tri@@ ck pon@@ y .
It just run@@ s certain kinds of compu@@ ta@@ tions on things .
"And when we look around at things like bra@@ il@@ le , for example , people are getting information through bu@@ m@@ ps on their fi@@ ng@@ ers ."
So I don &apos;t think we have any reason to think there &apos;s a the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal li@@ mit that we know the ed@@ ge of .
"C@@ A : If this ch@@ ec@@ ks out , you &apos;re going to be d@@ el@@ u@@ g@@ ed ."
There are so many possible app@@ lic@@ ations for this .
"A@@ re you ready for this ? What are you most exc@@ ited about , the direc@@ tion it might go ?"
"So this is a way of just feel@@ ing the state of something , just like the way you know the state of your body as you &apos;re standing around ."
"So I think he@@ av@@ y ma@@ chin@@ ery , sa@@ f@@ ety , feel@@ ing the state of a fac@@ t@@ ory , of your equi@@ pm@@ ent , that &apos;s one place it &apos;ll go right away ."
"C@@ A : D@@ a@@ vi@@ d E@@ ag@@ le@@ man , that was one min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing talk . Thank you very much ."
"D@@ E : Thank you , Ch@@ ris . ( Applause )"
It &apos;s really a fai@@ lu@@ re to det@@ ect a certain kind of dang@@ er .
And that respon@@ se is part of the problem .
"I am u@@ na@@ ble to mar@@ sha@@ l this respon@@ se , and I &apos;m giving this talk ."
It &apos;s as though we st@@ and before two do@@ ors .
O@@ ur computer har@@ d@@ ware and sof@@ t@@ ware just st@@ op@@ s getting better for some reason .
Now take a moment to con@@ sider why this might happen .
What could stop us from doing this ?
A fu@@ l@@ l-@@ scal@@ e nu@@ clear war ?
A global pan@@ de@@ mic ?
A@@ n ast@@ er@@ oi@@ d im@@ pa@@ ct ?
Ju@@ sti@@ n Bi@@ eb@@ er becom@@ ing pre@@ si@@ dent of the United States ?
But that isn &apos;t the most lik@@ ely sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o .
It &apos;s not that our ma@@ chin@@ es will become sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ously ma@@ lev@@ ol@@ ent .
Just think about how we rela@@ te to ants .
We don &apos;t ha@@ te them .
"Now , I su@@ sp@@ ect this seems far@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched to many of you ."
And there are only three of them .
I@@ nt@@ el@@ lig@@ ence is a matter of information proc@@ es@@ sing in physical systems .
The second as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion is that we will keep going .
We will contin@@ ue to improve our intellig@@ ent ma@@ chin@@ es .
We want to cu@@ re dise@@ ases like A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s and can@@ cer .
We want to understand economic systems . We want to improve our cli@@ mate science .
"So we will do this , if we can ."
"Now , just con@@ sider the smar@@ test person who has ever li@@ ved ."
O@@ n almost everyone &apos;s sh@@ or@@ t@@ li@@ st here is Jo@@ h@@ n v@@ on Ne@@ u@@ mann .
Here we have Jo@@ h@@ n v@@ on Ne@@ u@@ mann .
And then we have you and me .
And it &apos;s important to recogni@@ ze that this is true by vi@@ r@@ tue of spe@@ ed alone .
So we &apos;re talking about the end of human dru@@ d@@ g@@ ery .
We &apos;re also talking about the end of most intel@@ lec@@ tual work .
So what would ap@@ es like ourselves do in this circu@@ m@@ stance ?
"Well , we &apos;d be f@@ ree to pla@@ y F@@ ris@@ be@@ e and give each other mas@@ sa@@ ges ."
This is a win@@ ner@@ -@@ tak@@ e-@@ all sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o .
"And if you ha@@ ven &apos;t noti@@ ced , 50 years is not what it used to be ."
This is how long we &apos;ve had the i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
This is how long &quot; &quot; The S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ ons &quot; &quot; has been on tel@@ evi@@ sion .
G@@ et ready . &quot; &quot; And now we &apos;re just count@@ ing down the months until the mo@@ ther@@ ship lan@@ ds ?
We would feel a little more ur@@ g@@ enc@@ y than we do .
"&quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re feel@@ ing de@@ pres@@ sed ? Just sha@@ ke it off ; it &apos;s all in your head . &quot;"
"Now , a@@ du@@ l@@ ts get tri@@ cked this way as well , all the time ."
"You see , that &apos;s why so many people fun@@ ction b@@ el@@ ow their ac@@ tual potenti@@ al ."
Why ? Because of poor em@@ oti@@ onal hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e .
T@@ o ru@@ mi@@ nate means to che@@ w over .
He had vi@@ sible tu@@ m@@ ors all over his body .
And he had to start a har@@ sh course of che@@ mo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
I want to make a case .
He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavi@@ o@@ ral science .
I bring you into a room .
"He ga@@ ther@@ ed his parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ants and said : &quot; I &apos;m going to time you , how quickly you can sol@@ ve this problem . &quot;"
In@@ c@@ enti@@ vi@@ ze them .
It du@@ l@@ ls thinking and blo@@ cks cre@@ ati@@ vity .
"And I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even cl@@ ose ."
"R@@ e@@ wards , by their very nature , na@@ r@@ row our focu@@ s , con@@ cent@@ rate the mind ; that &apos;s why they work in so many c@@ ases ."
Let me tell you why this is so important .
"I &apos;m not telling a story , I &apos;m making a case ."
Do you know who sp@@ on@@ so@@ red this research ?
The good news is that the scienti@@ sts who &apos;ve been stud@@ ying moti@@ v@@ ation have given us this new approach .
A@@ ut@@ on@@ omy : the ur@@ ge to direc@@ t our own lives .
Ma@@ st@@ ery : the de@@ si@@ re to get better and better at something that mat@@ ters .
I want to talk today only about au@@ ton@@ omy .
"In the 20@@ th century , we came up with this idea of man@@ ag@@ ement ."
M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement did not e@@ man@@ ate from nature .
S@@ om@@ ebody inv@@ ent@@ ed it .
"But if you want eng@@ ag@@ ement , self-@@ direc@@ tion works better ."
How many of you have heard of the compan@@ y A@@ t@@ la@@ ssi@@ an ?
And they do something incredi@@ bly co@@ ol .
"A@@ ut@@ on@@ omy , ma@@ st@@ ery and pur@@ p@@ ose , the building blo@@ cks of a new way of doing things ."
"A few years later , another enc@@ y@@ cl@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ a got started ."
The dri@@ ve to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part .
We already know this .
Jo@@ e K@@ o@@ wan : I have sta@@ ge f@@ right .
"I &apos;ve always had sta@@ ge f@@ right , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit ."
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 2@@ 7 .
I had this ir@@ ra@@ ti@@ onal fear .
There were like 20 people there .
"But I took a de@@ ep b@@ re@@ ath , and I sig@@ ned up to pla@@ y , and I f@@ el@@ t pretty good ."
"Now , when you experience fear , your sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic ner@@ v@@ ous system ki@@ cks in ."
"I mean , your ner@@ v@@ ous system is an i@@ di@@ ot ."
And something good did happen — I had the tin@@ i@@ est little g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of that au@@ dience connec@@ tion that I was h@@ op@@ ing for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness .
"That only seems au@@ th@@ en@@ tic when I have sta@@ ge f@@ right , and the more ner@@ v@@ ous I was , the better the song would be . E@@ as@@ y ."
"B@@ y having a song that expla@@ ined what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the au@@ dience per@@ mis@@ sion to think about it ."
"And even@@ tually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to pla@@ y the sta@@ ge f@@ right song at all ."
"E@@ x@@ cept for when I was really ner@@ v@@ ous , like now . ( Laughter ) W@@ ould it be ok@@ ay if I play@@ ed the sta@@ ge f@@ right song for you ?"
( Applause ) Can I have a si@@ p of water ?
"I@@ mag@@ ine , if you will — a gi@@ ft ."
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big — about the size of a golf b@@ all .
So en@@ vision what it looks like all w@@ rapp@@ ed up .
"But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you ."
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel loved and ap@@ preci@@ ated like never before and re@@ con@@ n@@ ect with friends and ac@@ qu@@ a@@ int@@ an@@ ces you ha@@ ven &apos;t heard from in years .
A@@ do@@ ration and ad@@ mi@@ ration will o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m you .
It will re@@ cal@@ i@@ b@@ rate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ de@@ f@@ ine your sense of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ ality and fa@@ ith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ pas@@ sed v@@ it@@ ality and energy .
"You &apos;ll exp@@ and your v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ la@@ ry , me@@ et new people , and you &apos;ll have a heal@@ thi@@ er li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le ."
And get this — you &apos;ll have an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ week vac@@ ation of doing ab@@ solutely nothing .
You &apos;ll e@@ at count@@ less g@@ our@@ m@@ et me@@ als .
F@@ lo@@ w@@ ers will ar@@ ri@@ ve by the tru@@ ck@@ lo@@ ad .
"P@@ eople will say to you , &quot; You look great . H@@ a@@ ve you had any work done ? &quot;"
And you &apos;ll have a li@@ fe@@ time supp@@ ly of good dru@@ gs .
"You &apos;ll be challeng@@ ed , in@@ spi@@ red , moti@@ v@@ ated and hu@@ mb@@ led ."
Y@@ our life will have new mean@@ ing .
"P@@ ea@@ ce , health , ser@@ en@@ ity , happiness , ni@@ r@@ v@@ ana ."
The pri@@ ce ?
"@@ $ 5@@ 5,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible de@@ al ."
B@@ y now I know you &apos;re d@@ ying to know what it is and where you can get one .
D@@ oes A@@ ma@@ z@@ on car@@ ry it ?
D@@ oes it have the App@@ le lo@@ go on it ?
I@@ s there a wa@@ iting li@@ st ?
Not lik@@ ely .
This gi@@ ft came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all w@@ rapp@@ ed up — not quite so pretty .
"And this , and then this ."
"It was a ra@@ re ge@@ m — a brain tu@@ m@@ or , he@@ m@@ ang@@ i@@ ob@@ la@@ st@@ om@@ a — the gi@@ ft that ke@@ ep@@ s on giving ."
"And while I &apos;m ok@@ ay now , I wouldn &apos;t wi@@ sh this gi@@ ft for you ."
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It prof@@ oun@@ dly al@@ ter@@ ed my life in ways I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect in all the ways I just sha@@ red with you .
"So the next time you &apos;re fac@@ ed with something that &apos;s un@@ exp@@ ected , un@@ wanted and un@@ certain , con@@ sider that it just may be a gi@@ ft ."
( Applause )
( Laughter ) I was af@@ rai@@ d of wom@@ an@@ ho@@ od .
"@@ Not that I &apos;m not af@@ rai@@ d now , but I &apos;ve learned to pret@@ end ."
I &apos;ve learned to be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble .
"In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting to@@ ols to help me de@@ al with this fear ."
Let me explain .
"B@@ ac@@ k in the &apos; 5@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , when I was gro@@ wing up , little girls were supp@@ osed to be kind and thou@@ ght@@ ful and pretty and g@@ ent@@ le and so@@ ft , and we were supp@@ osed to fit into ro@@ les that were sort of sha@@ do@@ w@@ y — really not quite clear what we were supp@@ osed to be ."
( Laughter ) There were pl@@ ent@@ y of ro@@ le mo@@ d@@ els all around us .
"We had our mothers , our a@@ un@@ ts , our cou@@ sin@@ s , our sist@@ ers , and of course , the e@@ ver@@ -@@ present medi@@ a bomb@@ ar@@ ding us with imag@@ es and words , telling us how to be ."
Now my mother was different .
"She was a hom@@ e@@ mak@@ er , but she and I didn &apos;t go out and do gir@@ li@@ e things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me p@@ ink out@@ f@@ its ."
"In@@ stead , she knew what I needed , and she b@@ ou@@ ght me a book of car@@ to@@ ons ."
And I just ate it up .
"I dre@@ w , and I dre@@ w , and since I knew that hu@@ m@@ or was ac@@ cep@@ table in my family , I could d@@ ra@@ w , do what I wanted to do , and not have to per@@ form , not have to speak — I was very sh@@ y — and I could still get appro@@ val ."
I was la@@ un@@ ched as a car@@ to@@ oni@@ st .
"Now when we &apos;re young , we don &apos;t always know . We know there are ru@@ les out there , but we don &apos;t always know — we don &apos;t per@@ form them right , even though we are im@@ pr@@ int@@ ed at bir@@ th with these things , and we &apos;re told what the most important col@@ or in the world is ."
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supp@@ osed to be in .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re told what to w@@ ear — ( Laughter ) — and how to do our hair — ( Laughter ) — and how to be@@ have .
Now the ru@@ les that I &apos;m talking about are con@@ st@@ antly being mon@@ it@@ o@@ red by the culture .
"We &apos;re being cor@@ rec@@ ted , and the pri@@ ma@@ ry po@@ lic@@ em@@ en are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the tra@@ dition ."
We pa@@ ss it down from generation to generation .
Not only that — we always have this v@@ ag@@ ue noti@@ on that something &apos;s exp@@ ected of us .
"And on top of all off these ru@@ les , they keep chang@@ ing ."
"( Laughter ) We don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on half the time , so it put@@ s us in a very ten@@ u@@ ous position . ( Laughter )"
"Now if you don &apos;t like these ru@@ les , and many of us don &apos;t — I know I didn &apos;t , and I still don &apos;t , even though I fol@@ low them half the time , not quite a@@ ware that I &apos;m follo@@ wing them — what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with hu@@ m@@ or ?"
H@@ um@@ or re@@ lies on the tra@@ ditions of a society .
"It takes what we know , and it twi@@ sts it ."
"It takes the co@@ des of behavior and the co@@ des of dre@@ ss , and it makes it un@@ exp@@ ected , and that &apos;s what eli@@ c@@ its a la@@ u@@ gh ."
Now what if you put together women and hu@@ m@@ or ?
I think you can get change .
"Because women are on the ground flo@@ or , and we know the tra@@ ditions so well , we can bring a different v@@ oi@@ ce to the table ."
Now I started d@@ ra@@ wing in the middle of a lot of chao@@ s .
I gre@@ w up not far from here in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton D@@ .@@ C@@ .
"@@ during the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts movement , the as@@ sa@@ ssi@@ na@@ tions , the W@@ at@@ er@@ g@@ ate hear@@ ings and then the f@@ em@@ ini@@ st movement , and I think I was d@@ ra@@ wing , trying to figure out what was going on ."
"And then also my family was in chao@@ s , and I dre@@ w to try to bring my family together — ( Laughter ) — try to bring my family together with la@@ u@@ ghter ."
It didn &apos;t work .
"M@@ y par@@ ents got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced , and my si@@ ster was ar@@ re@@ sted ."
But I found my place .
"I found that I didn &apos;t have to w@@ ear high he@@ els , I didn &apos;t have to w@@ ear p@@ ink , and I could feel like I fit in ."
"Now when I was a little older , in my 20@@ s , I realiz@@ ed there are not many women in car@@ to@@ oning ."
"And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe I can b@@ rea@@ k the little g@@ la@@ ss c@@ e@@ il@@ ing of car@@ to@@ oning , &quot; &quot; and so I did . I became a car@@ to@@ oni@@ st ."
"And then I thought — in my 4@@ 0s I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t I do something ?"
"I always loved political car@@ to@@ ons , so why don &apos;t I do something with the con@@ t@@ ent of my car@@ to@@ ons to make people think about the stu@@ pi@@ d ru@@ les that we &apos;re follo@@ wing as well as la@@ u@@ gh ? &quot; &quot; Now my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particu@@ larly — ( Laughter ) — my per@@ spec@@ tive is a particu@@ larly American per@@ spec@@ tive ."
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
"E@@ ven though I &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed a lot , I still think like an American woman ."
"But I believe that the ru@@ les that I &apos;m talking about are univer@@ sa@@ l , of course — that each culture has its different co@@ des of behavior and dre@@ ss and tra@@ ditions , and each woman has to de@@ al with these same things that we do here in the U.S@@ ."
"C@@ on@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , we have ."
"W@@ om@@ en , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tra@@ dition ."
We have ama@@ zing ant@@ en@@ nae .
"Now my work lat@@ ely has been to col@@ la@@ bo@@ rate with inter@@ national car@@ to@@ oni@@ sts , which I so en@@ jo@@ y , and it &apos;s given me a great@@ er ap@@ preci@@ ation for the power of car@@ to@@ ons to get at the tru@@ th , to get at the is@@ sue@@ s quickly and succ@@ in@@ c@@ tly ."
"And not only that , it can get to the vie@@ wer through not only the intel@@ l@@ ect , but through the heart ."
"M@@ y work also has allowed me to col@@ la@@ bo@@ rate with women car@@ to@@ oni@@ sts from across the world — countries such as S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ bi@@ a , I@@ ran , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey , A@@ r@@ g@@ ent@@ ina , F@@ ran@@ ce — and we have sat together and la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed and talked and sha@@ red our difficul@@ ti@@ es ."
And these women are working so hard to get their v@@ oi@@ ces heard in some very difficult circu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces .
But I feel ble@@ s@@ sed to be able to work with them .
"And we talk about how women have such strong perc@@ ep@@ tions , because of our ten@@ u@@ ous position and our ro@@ le as tra@@ diti@@ on@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s , that we can have the great potenti@@ al to be chang@@ e-@@ ag@@ ents ."
"And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one la@@ u@@ gh at a time ."
Thank you .

But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
"We stu@@ mb@@ led on your vi@@ de@@ o on deci@@ ma@@ ls , and it got through ."
The ones I started were much more pri@@ miti@@ ve .
And the K@@ ha@@ n A@@ c@@ ade@@ my vi@@ de@@ os are there .
G@@ re@@ en means the student &apos;s already pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ ent .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
( Applause )
What are the mes@@ sa@@ ges we tell the women that work with and for us ?
"I left S@@ an F@@ ran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o , where I live , on M@@ on@@ day , and I was getting on the plan@@ e for this con@@ fer@@ ence ."
The three of us take this cla@@ ss together .
W@@ om@@ en do not neg@@ oti@@ ate for themselves in the work@@ force .
"O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously . Why are you even asking ? &quot; &quot; If you ask women why they did a good job , what they &apos;ll say is someone hel@@ ped them , they got lu@@ ck@@ y , they worked really hard ."
"B@@ o@@ y , it mat@@ ters a lot ."
But it &apos;s not that simple .
"And he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students ."
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone li@@ ked H@@ o@@ ward .
This is the comp@@ lic@@ ation .
The data sho@@ ws this very c@@ lear@@ ly .
P@@ hy@@ ll@@ is R@@ o@@ dri@@ g@@ ue@@ z : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people con@@ sider an un@@ u@@ su@@ al fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship .
And it is .
"And yet , it fe@@ els natural to us now ."
"I first learned that my son had been in the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ en@@ ter on the morning of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 1@@ th , 200@@ 1 ."
We didn &apos;t know if he had per@@ i@@ shed yet until 3@@ 6 hours later .
"A@@ t the time , we knew that it was political ."
"We were af@@ rai@@ d of what our country was going to do in the na@@ me of our son — my hus@@ b@@ and , O@@ r@@ lan@@ do , and I and our family ."
"And when I saw it — and yet , through the sho@@ ck , the ter@@ ri@@ ble sho@@ ck , and the ter@@ ri@@ ble ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on in our lives , liter@@ ally , we were not v@@ eng@@ e@@ ful ."
"And a couple of weeks later when Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i was in@@ dic@@ ted on six count@@ s of con@@ spi@@ racy to com@@ mit ter@@ ror@@ ism , and the U.S. government called for a death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty for him , if con@@ vi@@ c@@ ted , my hus@@ b@@ and and I sp@@ oke out in op@@ position to that , publi@@ c@@ ly ."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh that and through human ri@@ ghts groups , we were brought together with se@@ ver@@ al other victi@@ ms &apos; families ."
"When I saw A@@ i@@ cha in the medi@@ a , coming over when her son was in@@ dic@@ ted , and I thought , &quot; &quot; What a bra@@ ve woman ."
S@@ om@@ e@@ day I want to me@@ et that woman when I &apos;m st@@ rong@@ er . &quot; &quot; I was still in de@@ ep g@@ ri@@ e@@ f ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the stre@@ ng@@ th .
"I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other ."
"Because , when people heard that my son was a victi@@ m , I got im@@ medi@@ ate sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy ."
"But when people learned what her son was accu@@ sed of , she didn &apos;t get that sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy ."
But her su@@ ffer@@ ing is equal to m@@ ine .
"So we m@@ et in No@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and A@@ i@@ cha will now tell you how that came about ."
"( T@@ ran@@ s@@ la@@ tor ) A@@ i@@ cha el@@ -@@ W@@ af@@ i : Go@@ od af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , la@@ di@@ es and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men ."
I am the mother of Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as M@@ ous@@ sa@@ ou@@ i .
And I asked the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation of H@@ u@@ man R@@ i@@ ghts to put me in tou@@ ch with the par@@ ents of the victi@@ ms .
So they int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed me to five families .
"And I saw P@@ hy@@ ll@@ is , and I wat@@ ched her ."
She was the only mother in the group .
"The others were bro@@ thers , sist@@ ers ."
"And I saw in her ey@@ es that she was a mother , just like me ."
I su@@ ffer@@ ed a lot as a mother .
I was mar@@ ried when I was 14 .
"I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 16 ."
So the story with Z@@ ac@@ ari@@ as was too much really .
"And I still su@@ ff@@ er , because my son is like he &apos;s bu@@ ried ali@@ ve ."
I know she really c@@ ried for her son .
But she kno@@ ws where he is .
"M@@ y son , I don &apos;t know where he is ."
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s ali@@ ve . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s t@@ or@@ tured .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
"So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my su@@ ffer@@ ing is something positive for other women ."
"For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change ."
"It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children ."
We must be han@@ d-@@ in@@ -@@ hand and do something together .
"It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children ."
"I talk against violence , against ter@@ ror@@ ism ."
"I go to schools to talk to young , M@@ us@@ li@@ m girls so they don &apos;t ac@@ cept to be mar@@ ried against their will very young ."
"So if I can sa@@ ve one of the young girls , and av@@ oi@@ d that they get mar@@ ried and su@@ ff@@ er as much as I did , well this is something good ."
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
"P@@ R : I would like to say that I have learned so much from A@@ i@@ cha , starting with that day we had our very first me@@ eting with other family mem@@ b@@ ers — which was a very pri@@ v@@ ate me@@ eting with sec@@ ur@@ ity , because it was No@@ v@@ em@@ ber 200@@ 2 , and , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , we were af@@ rai@@ d of the super@@ -@@ pat@@ ri@@ ot@@ ism of that time in the country — those of us family mem@@ b@@ ers ."
But we were all so ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why does she want to me@@ et us ? &quot;
And then she was ner@@ v@@ ous .
&quot; Why did we want to me@@ et her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
"B@@ e@@ fore we knew each others &apos; nam@@ es , or anything , we had em@@ bra@@ ced and w@@ ep@@ t ."
"Th@@ en we sat in a cir@@ cle with supp@@ ort , with help , from people experienc@@ ed in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ."
"And A@@ i@@ cha started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is gu@@ il@@ ty or in@@ no@@ c@@ ent , but I want to tell you how sor@@ ry I am for what happened to your families ."
"I know what it is to su@@ ff@@ er , and I feel that if there is a c@@ ri@@ me , a person should be tried fai@@ r@@ ly and p@@ uni@@ shed . &quot; &quot; But she rea@@ ched out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an i@@ c@@ e-@@ b@@ re@@ ak@@ er ."
"And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connec@@ ted as human beings ."
B@@ y the end of the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on — it was about three hours after l@@ un@@ ch — we &apos;d f@@ el@@ t as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
"Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so gener@@ ous under these present circu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had ."
"I never had m@@ et someone with such a hard life , from such a to@@ tally different culture and environment from my own ."
"And I feel that we have a speci@@ al connec@@ tion , which I val@@ ue very much ."
"And I think it &apos;s all about being af@@ rai@@ d of the other , but making that step and then realiz@@ ing , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , this wasn &apos;t so hard ."
"Wh@@ o else can I me@@ et that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot; &quot; So , A@@ i@@ cha , do you have a couple of words for con@@ clu@@ sion ?"
Because our time is up .
"( Laughter ) ( T@@ ran@@ s@@ la@@ tor ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other ."
"You have to be gener@@ ous , and your hear@@ ts must be gener@@ ous , your mind must be gener@@ ous ."
You must be t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant .
You have to fi@@ ght against violence .
And I ho@@ pe that some@@ day we &apos;ll all live together in p@@ ea@@ ce and resp@@ ec@@ ting each other .
This is what I wanted to say .

"In 200@@ 8 , C@@ y@@ cl@@ one N@@ ar@@ g@@ is de@@ v@@ a@@ sta@@ ted M@@ yan@@ ma@@ r ."
M@@ il@@ lions of people were in se@@ v@@ ere need of help .
The U.@@ N@@ . wanted to ru@@ sh people and supp@@ lies to the are@@ a .
"But there were no ma@@ ps , no ma@@ ps of ro@@ a@@ ds , no ma@@ ps sho@@ wing h@@ os@@ pit@@ als , no way for help to reach the c@@ y@@ cl@@ one victi@@ ms ."
"When we look at a map of Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es or L@@ on@@ don , it is hard to believe that as of 200@@ 5 , only 15 percent of the world was ma@@ pp@@ ed to a ge@@ o@@ -@@ co@@ d@@ able level of de@@ tai@@ l ."
The U.@@ N@@ . ran he@@ ad@@ first into a problem that the maj@@ ority of the world &apos;s popu@@ l@@ ous fac@@ es : not having de@@ tail@@ ed ma@@ ps .
But help was coming .
"A@@ t Google , 40 vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers used a new sof@@ t@@ ware to map 1@@ 20@@ ,000 k@@ il@@ omet@@ ers of ro@@ a@@ ds , 3@@ ,000 h@@ os@@ pit@@ als , logi@@ sti@@ cs and reli@@ e@@ f point@@ s ."
And it took them four days .
The new sof@@ t@@ ware they used ? Google M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er .
Google M@@ ap@@ mak@@ er is a technology that em@@ po@@ w@@ ers each of us to map what we know lo@@ cally .
"P@@ eople have used this sof@@ t@@ ware to map everything from ro@@ a@@ ds to ri@@ ver@@ s , from schools to lo@@ cal bu@@ sin@@ es@@ ses , and vi@@ de@@ o st@@ o@@ res to the cor@@ ner st@@ ore ."
M@@ ap@@ s matter .
No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze nom@@ ine@@ e H@@ er@@ nan@@ do D@@ e S@@ ot@@ o recogni@@ zed that the k@@ ey to economic li@@ f@@ to@@ ff for most develop@@ ing countries is to tap the v@@ a@@ st amou@@ nt@@ s of un@@ cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ed land .
"For example , a tri@@ l@@ lion dollars of real es@@ tat@@ e re@@ ma@@ ins un@@ cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ed in India alone ."
"In the last year alone , thousands of us@@ ers in 1@@ 70 countries have ma@@ pp@@ ed mil@@ lions of piec@@ es of information , and created a map of a level of de@@ tai@@ l never thought vi@@ able ."
And this was made possible by the power of pas@@ sio@@ nate us@@ ers every@@ where .
Let &apos;s look at some of the ma@@ ps being created by us@@ ers right now .
"So , as we speak , people are ma@@ pp@@ ing the world in these 1@@ 70 countries ."
You can see B@@ ri@@ d@@ get in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a who just ma@@ pp@@ ed a ro@@ ad in S@@ ene@@ g@@ al .

"This is a vi@@ ct@@ ory of thousands of us@@ ers , in hund@@ re@@ ds of c@@ ities , one us@@ er , one ed@@ it at a time ."
This is an inv@@ itation to the 70 percent of our un@@ ma@@ pp@@ ed planet .

"So , I was in the h@@ os@@ pit@@ al for a long time ."
"And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chai@@ r@@ man of the bur@@ n de@@ par@@ t@@ ment was very exc@@ ited to see me — said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , I have a f@@ anta@@ stic new treat@@ ment for you . &quot; &quot; I was very exc@@ ited . I wal@@ ked with him to his of@@ fi@@ ce ."
"And he expla@@ ined to me that , when I s@@ have , I have little black d@@ ots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face I was ba@@ dly bur@@ ned so I have no hair , and this cre@@ ates lack of sy@@ m@@ met@@ ry ."
And what &apos;s the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea he had ?
He was going to tat@@ too little black d@@ ots on the right side of my face and make me look very sy@@ m@@ met@@ ri@@ c .
It s@@ oun@@ ded interesting . He asked me to go and s@@ have .
"@@ Let me tell you , this was a strange way to s@@ have , because I thought about it and I realiz@@ ed that the way I was sha@@ ving then would be the way I would s@@ have for the rest of my life — because I had to keep the wi@@ d@@ th the same ."
"When I got back to his of@@ fi@@ ce , I wasn &apos;t really sure ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot; &quot; So he showed me some pic@@ tures of little che@@ eks with little black d@@ ots — not very in@@ forma@@ tive ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?"
"What would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , don &apos;t wor@@ ry about it , &quot; &quot; he said ."
&quot; We have la@@ s@@ ers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . &quot;
"But I was still con@@ cer@@ ned , so I said , &quot; &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; And then came one of the bi@@ ggest gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ ps of my life ."
"This is coming from a J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh guy , all right , so that means a lot ."
"( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ an , what &apos;s wrong with you ?"
Do you en@@ jo@@ y looking non@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ met@@ ri@@ c ?
Do you have some kind of per@@ ver@@ ted plea@@ sure from this ?
Do women feel p@@ ity for you and have sex with you more fre@@ qu@@ ently ? &quot; &quot; N@@ one of those happened .
"And this was very surpri@@ sing to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treat@@ ments — there were many treat@@ ments I decided not to do — and I never got this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p to this ex@@ t@@ ent ."
But I decided not to have this treat@@ ment .
"And I went to his de@@ put@@ y and asked him , &quot; &quot; What was going on ?"
"W@@ here was this gu@@ il@@ t tri@@ p coming from ? &quot; &quot; And he expla@@ ined that they have done this proc@@ e@@ du@@ re on two patients already , and they need the thir@@ d pati@@ ent for a pap@@ er they were writ@@ ing ."
( Laughter ) Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a s@@ ch@@ mu@@ ck .
"R@@ ight , that &apos;s what he seems like ."
But let me give you a different per@@ spec@@ tive on the same story .
"A few years ago , I was run@@ ning some of my own experiments in the la@@ b ."
"And when we ru@@ n experiments , we u@@ su@@ ally ho@@ pe that one group will be@@ have differ@@ ently than another ."
"So we had one group that I h@@ op@@ ed their perfor@@ man@@ ce would be very high , another group that I thought their perfor@@ man@@ ce would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got — I was very happy — a@@ side from one person ."
There was one person in the group that was supp@@ osed to have very high perfor@@ man@@ ce that was actually perfor@@ ming ter@@ ri@@ bly .
"And he pul@@ led the whole mean down , dest@@ ro@@ ying my sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of the test ."
So I looked care@@ fully at this guy .
He was 20@@ -@@ some years older than any@@ body else in the sam@@ ple .
And I remember@@ ed that the old and d@@ run@@ k@@ en guy came one day to the la@@ b want@@ ing to make some easy c@@ as@@ h and this was the guy .
&quot; &quot; F@@ anta@@ stic ! &quot; &quot; I thought . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s th@@ row him out .
"Wh@@ o would ever inclu@@ de a d@@ run@@ k@@ en guy in a sam@@ ple ? &quot; &quot; But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; &quot; What would have happened if this d@@ run@@ k@@ en guy was not in that con@@ dition ?"
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
"W@@ ould we have th@@ ro@@ wn him out then ? &quot; &quot; We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; &quot; F@@ anta@@ stic ! What a smar@@ t guy who is perfor@@ ming this low , &quot; &quot; because he would have pul@@ led the mean of the group lower , giving us even st@@ rong@@ er sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal results than we could ."
So we decided not to th@@ row the guy out and to r@@ er@@ u@@ n the experiment .
"But you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est , basically kind of bring two point@@ s to the fore@@ ground for me ."
"The first one is that in life we en@@ cou@@ n@@ ter many people who , in some way or another , try to tat@@ too our fac@@ es ."
They just have the in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves that get them to be bl@@ in@@ ded to reality and give us ad@@ vice that is in@@ h@@ er@@ ently bi@@ as@@ ed .
"And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recogni@@ ze , and we see that it happens ."
"@@ Maybe we don &apos;t recogni@@ ze it every time , but we understand that it happens ."
"The most difficult thing , of course , is to recogni@@ ze that some@@ times we too are bl@@ in@@ ded by our own in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves ."
"And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult le@@ s@@ son to take into ac@@ cou@@ nt ."
Because we don &apos;t see how con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us .
"When I was doing these experiments , in my mind , I was hel@@ ping science ."
I was eli@@ mi@@ nat@@ ing the data to get the true patt@@ ern of the data to sh@@ ine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
"In my mind , I was actually a kni@@ ght trying to help science move along ."
But this was not the case .
I was actually inter@@ fer@@ ing with the process with lots of good int@@ en@@ tions .
"And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the c@@ ases in our lives where con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est work on us , and try not to trust our own in@@ tu@@ ition to o@@ ver@@ come it , but to try to do things that pre@@ v@@ ent us from f@@ al@@ ling pre@@ y to these behavi@@ ors , because we can create lots of un@@ de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble circu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces ."
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
"I mean , this is all very de@@ pres@@ sing , right — people have con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts of inter@@ est , we don &apos;t see it , and so on ."
"The positive per@@ spec@@ tive , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the de@@ ep mechan@@ is@@ ms of why we fai@@ l and where we fai@@ l , we can actually ho@@ pe to fi@@ x things ."
"And that , I think , is the ho@@ pe . Thank you very much ."
( Applause )
You all know the tru@@ th of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think the in@@ tu@@ ition that inequ@@ ality is divi@@ sive and soci@@ ally cor@@ ros@@ i@@ ve has been around since before the F@@ ren@@ ch R@@ evolution .
"What &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can comp@@ are societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequ@@ ality does ."
I &apos;m going to take you through that data and then explain why the lin@@ ks I &apos;m going to be sho@@ wing you exi@@ st .
"But first , see what a mi@@ ser@@ able lot we are ."
( Laughter ) I want to start though with a pa@@ ra@@ do@@ x .
This sho@@ ws you life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y against g@@ ross national income — how rich countries are on average .
"And you see the countries on the right , like Nor@@ way and the U@@ S@@ A , are twi@@ ce as rich as I@@ s@@ ra@@ el , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al on the left ."
And it makes no difference to their life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y at all .
There &apos;s no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship there .
"But if we look within our societies , there are extra@@ ordinary social gra@@ di@@ ents in health run@@ ning right across society ."
"This , again , is life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y ."
"@@ These are small are@@ as of Eng@@ land and W@@ al@@ es — the poorest on the right , the rich@@ est on the left ."
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
E@@ ven the people just b@@ el@@ ow the top have less good health than the people at the top .
"So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them ."
"The ex@@ plan@@ ation of that pa@@ ra@@ do@@ x is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at rela@@ tive income or social position , social sta@@ tu@@ s — where we are in relation to each other and the size of the g@@ ap@@ s between us ."
"And as so@@ on as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely won@@ der : what happens if we wi@@ den the differences , or com@@ pre@@ ss them , make the income differences bi@@ gg@@ er or sma@@ l@@ ler ?"
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m not using any hy@@ pothe@@ ti@@ cal data .
I &apos;m taking data from the U.@@ N@@ . — it &apos;s the same as the World B@@ ank has — on the scal@@ e of income differences in these rich developed market democra@@ ci@@ es .
"The measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad it , is how much rich@@ er the top 20 percent than the bot@@ tom 20 percent in each country ."
"And you see in the more equal countries on the left — Japan , F@@ in@@ land , Nor@@ way , Swe@@ den — the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bot@@ tom 20 percent ."
"But on the more un@@ equal end — U.@@ K@@ . , P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al , U@@ S@@ A , S@@ ing@@ ap@@ ore — the differences are twi@@ ce as big ."
"O@@ n that measure , we are twi@@ ce as un@@ equal as some of the other successful market democra@@ ci@@ es ."
Now I &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
"We col@@ lec@@ ted data on problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bot@@ tom of the social la@@ d@@ der ."
"I@@ nter@@ nati@@ ona@@ lly com@@ pa@@ ra@@ ble data on life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y , on kids &apos; ma@@ ths and liter@@ ac@@ y s@@ co@@ res , on inf@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity rat@@ es , h@@ omi@@ ci@@ de rat@@ es , prop@@ or@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son , te@@ ena@@ ge bir@@ th@@ rat@@ es , lev@@ els of trust , o@@ be@@ sity , mental il@@ l@@ ness — which in stan@@ dar@@ d di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic cla@@ ssi@@ fic@@ ation inclu@@ des drug and al@@ co@@ h@@ ol ad@@ dic@@ tion — and social mo@@ bility ."
We put them all in one in@@ de@@ x .
They &apos;re all we@@ i@@ gh@@ ted equ@@ ally .
W@@ here a country is is a sort of average sc@@ ore on these things .
"And there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequ@@ ality I &apos;ve just sho@@ wn you , which I sha@@ ll use over and over again in the data ."
The more un@@ equal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
It &apos;s an extra@@ ordina@@ ri@@ ly cl@@ ose cor@@ relation .
"But if you look at that same in@@ de@@ x of health and social problems in relation to G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a , g@@ ross national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no cor@@ relation any@@ more ."
"We were a little bit wor@@ ried that people might think we &apos;d been cho@@ os@@ ing problems to su@@ it our argu@@ ment and just man@@ u@@ fac@@ tured this evidence , so we also did a pap@@ er in the B@@ riti@@ sh M@@ e@@ di@@ cal J@@ our@@ nal on the U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F in@@ de@@ x of child well-being ."
It has 40 different comp@@ on@@ ents put together by other people .
"It con@@ ta@@ ins whether kids can talk to their par@@ ents , whether they have bo@@ ok@@ s at home , what im@@ m@@ uni@@ zation rat@@ es are like , whether there &apos;s bu@@ ll@@ ying at school ."
E@@ very@@ thing goes into it .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequ@@ ality .
K@@ i@@ ds do worse in the more un@@ equal societies .
H@@ i@@ gh@@ ly sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant relation@@ ship .
"But once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in relation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relation@@ ship , no su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion of a relation@@ ship ."
What all the data I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you so far says is the same thing .
The average well-being of our societies is not depen@@ dent any longer on national income and economic growth .
"That &apos;s very important in poo@@ re@@ r countries , but not in the rich developed world ."
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much .
I &apos;m going to show you some of the se@@ pa@@ rate b@@ its of our in@@ de@@ x .
"@@ Here , for in@@ stance , is trust ."
It &apos;s simply the prop@@ or@@ tion of the population who ag@@ ree most people can be tru@@ sted .
It comes from the World V@@ al@@ ues S@@ ur@@ v@@ ey .
"You see , at the more un@@ equal end , it &apos;s about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others ."
"But in the more equal societies , it ri@@ ses to 60 or 6@@ 5 percent ."
"And if you look at measu@@ res of inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in commun@@ ity life or social cap@@ ital , very si@@ mi@@ lar relation@@ shi@@ ps cl@@ os@@ ely rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality ."
"I may say , we did all this work twi@@ ce ."
"We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a se@@ pa@@ rate test bed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 American states — asking just the same question : do the more un@@ equal states do worse on all these kinds of measu@@ res ?"
So here is trust from a gener@@ al social sur@@ v@@ ey of the fe@@ der@@ al government rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality .
V@@ ery si@@ mi@@ lar sc@@ at@@ ter over a si@@ mi@@ lar range of lev@@ els of trust .
S@@ ame thing is going on .
B@@ a@@ sically we found that almost anything that &apos;s rela@@ ted to trust inter@@ nati@@ ona@@ lly is rela@@ ted to trust am@@ ong@@ st the 50 states in that se@@ pa@@ rate test bed .
We &apos;re not just talking about a f@@ luk@@ e .
This is mental il@@ l@@ ness .
W@@ H@@ O put together figu@@ res using the same di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic inter@@ vie@@ ws on ran@@ dom sam@@ pl@@ es of the population to al@@ low us to comp@@ are rat@@ es of mental il@@ l@@ ness in each society .
This is the percent of the population with any mental il@@ l@@ ness in the pre@@ c@@ e@@ ding year .
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that — whole societies with three times the level of mental il@@ l@@ ness of others .
"And again , cl@@ os@@ ely rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality ."
This is violence .
"@@ These red d@@ ots are American states , and the bl@@ ue tri@@ ang@@ les are C@@ ana@@ di@@ an pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces ."
But look at the scal@@ e of the differences .
It goes from 15 h@@ omi@@ ci@@ des per million up to 150 .
This is the prop@@ or@@ tion of the population in pri@@ son .
"There &apos;s a about a ten@@ fo@@ ld difference there , lo@@ g scal@@ e up the side ."
But it goes from about 40 to 4@@ 00 people in pri@@ son .
That relation@@ ship is not main@@ ly dri@@ ven by more c@@ ri@@ me .
"In some pla@@ ces , that &apos;s part of it ."
"But most of it is about more p@@ un@@ itive sent@@ enc@@ ing , har@@ sh@@ er sent@@ enc@@ ing ."
And the more un@@ equal societies are more lik@@ ely also to re@@ tain the death p@@ ena@@ l@@ ty .
Here we have children drop@@ ping out of high school .
"A@@ g@@ ain , quite big differences ."
"E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordina@@ ri@@ ly dam@@ ag@@ ing , if you &apos;re talking about using the tal@@ ents of the population ."
This is social mo@@ bility .
It &apos;s actually a measure of mo@@ bility based on income .
"B@@ a@@ sically , it &apos;s asking : do rich fa@@ thers have rich s@@ ons and poor fa@@ thers have poor s@@ ons , or is there no relation@@ ship between the two ?"
"And at the more un@@ equal end , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much more important — in the U.@@ K@@ . , U@@ S@@ A ."
"And in S@@ can@@ di@@ na@@ vi@@ an countries , fa@@ thers &apos; income is much less important ."
There &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
"And as we like to say — and I know there are a lot of Americ@@ ans in the au@@ dience here — if Americ@@ ans want to live the American dre@@ am , they should go to D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve sho@@ wn you just a few things in it@@ ali@@ cs here .
I could have sho@@ wn a number of other problems .
They &apos;re all problems that t@@ end to be more common at the bot@@ tom of the social gra@@ di@@ ent .
"But there are en@@ d@@ less problems with social gra@@ di@@ ents that are worse in more un@@ equal countries — not just a little bit worse , but anything from twi@@ ce as common to 10 times as common ."
"Th@@ ink of the ex@@ pen@@ se , the human cost of that ."
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you ear@@ li@@ er where we put it all together to make two point@@ s .
"One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , w@@ hat@@ ever the out@@ come , seem to be the more un@@ equal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nor@@ di@@ c countries and Japan ."
So what we &apos;re looking at is gener@@ al social dis@@ fun@@ ction rela@@ ted to inequ@@ ality .
"It &apos;s not just one or two things that go wrong , it &apos;s most things ."
"The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bot@@ tom , Swe@@ den and Japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sor@@ ts of ways ."
"The position of women , how cl@@ os@@ ely they keep to the nu@@ clear family , are on op@@ pos@@ ite ends of the pol@@ es in terms of the rich developed world ."
But another really important difference is how they get their great@@ er equ@@ ality .
"S@@ we@@ den has hu@@ ge differences in ear@@ ni@@ ngs , and it na@@ r@@ ro@@ ws the ga@@ p through ta@@ x@@ ation , gener@@ al wel@@ f@@ are state , gener@@ ous bene@@ f@@ its and so on ."
Japan is rather different though .
It star@@ ts off with much sma@@ l@@ ler differences in ear@@ ni@@ ngs before ta@@ x .
It has lower ta@@ x@@ es .
It has a sma@@ l@@ ler wel@@ f@@ are state .
"And in our anal@@ y@@ sis of the American states , we find rather the same con@@ tra@@ st ."
"There are some states that do well through re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion , some states that do well because they have sma@@ l@@ ler income differences before ta@@ x ."
"So we con@@ clu@@ de that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your great@@ er equ@@ ality , as long as you get there some@@ how ."
"I am not talking about perf@@ ect equ@@ ality , I &apos;m talking about what exi@@ sts in rich developed market democra@@ ci@@ es ."
A@@ no@@ ther really surpri@@ sing part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are aff@@ ected by inequ@@ ality .
There seems to be some tru@@ th in Jo@@ h@@ n D@@ on@@ ne &apos;s &quot; No man is an is@@ land . &quot;
"And in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to comp@@ are how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y ."
This is just one example .
It &apos;s inf@@ ant mor@@ tal@@ ity .
S@@ ome Swe@@ des very kin@@ dly cla@@ ssi@@ fied a lot of their inf@@ ant de@@ a@@ ths ac@@ cor@@ ding to the B@@ riti@@ sh regi@@ ster of gener@@ al soci@@ oe@@ con@@ omi@@ c cla@@ ssi@@ fic@@ ation .
"And so it &apos;s ana@@ ch@@ ron@@ is@@ ti@@ cally a cla@@ ssi@@ fic@@ ation by fa@@ thers &apos; oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions , so single par@@ ents go on their own ."
"But then where it says &quot; &quot; low social cla@@ ss , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s un@@ skil@@ led man@@ u@@ al oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions ."
"It goes through to@@ wards the skil@@ led man@@ u@@ al oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions in the middle , then the j@@ uni@@ or non@@ -@@ man@@ u@@ al , going up high to the profes@@ sional oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions — do@@ ct@@ ors , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , direc@@ tors of lar@@ ger compan@@ ies ."
You see there that Swe@@ den does better than B@@ rit@@ ain all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
The bi@@ ggest differences are at the bot@@ tom of society .
"But even at the top , there seems to be a small bene@@ fit to being in a more equal society ."
We show that on about five different s@@ ets of data co@@ ver@@ ing educ@@ ati@@ onal out@@ comes and health in the United States and inter@@ nati@@ ona@@ lly .
"And that seems to be the gener@@ al picture — that great@@ er equ@@ ality makes most difference at the bot@@ tom , but has some bene@@ f@@ its even at the top ."
But I should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial eff@@ ec@@ ts of inequ@@ ality .
"M@@ ore to do with feel@@ ings of super@@ i@@ ority and inf@@ eri@@ ority , of being val@@ ue@@ d and de@@ val@@ ue@@ d , resp@@ ected and dis@@ resp@@ ected ."
"And of course , those feel@@ ings of the sta@@ tu@@ s comp@@ et@@ ition that comes out of that dri@@ ves the con@@ sum@@ er@@ ism in our society ."
It also lea@@ ds to sta@@ tu@@ s in@@ sec@@ ur@@ ity .
"We wor@@ ry more about how we &apos;re ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed and seen by others , whether we &apos;re re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as att@@ rac@@ tive , cle@@ ver , all that kind of thing ."
"The soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ alu@@ ative ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ alu@@ ative ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments ."
"I@@ nter@@ es@@ ti@@ ng@@ ly , some pa@@ ra@@ lle@@ l work going on in social psycho@@ logy : some people re@@ vie@@ wed 20@@ 8 different studies in which vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers had been inv@@ ited into a psycho@@ logical la@@ bo@@ rat@@ ory and had their stress h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , their respon@@ ses to doing stre@@ s@@ s@@ ful ta@@ s@@ ks , measu@@ red ."
"And in the re@@ view , what they were interest@@ ed in see@@ ing is what kind of stre@@ s@@ ses most reli@@ ab@@ ly rai@@ se lev@@ els of cor@@ tis@@ ol , the cent@@ ral stress h@@ or@@ m@@ one ."
And the con@@ clu@@ sion was it was ta@@ s@@ ks that inclu@@ ded soci@@ al@@ -@@ ev@@ alu@@ ative thre@@ at — thre@@ at@@ s to self-@@ e@@ ste@@ e@@ m or social sta@@ tu@@ s in which others can neg@@ ati@@ vely ju@@ dge your perfor@@ man@@ ce .
Th@@ ose kind of stre@@ s@@ ses have a very particular eff@@ ect on the physi@@ o@@ logy of stress .
Now we have been c@@ riti@@ ci@@ zed .
"O@@ f course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surpri@@ sing ."
"I should tell you though that when people c@@ riti@@ ci@@ ze us for pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing data , we never pi@@ ck and choose data ."
"We have an ab@@ sol@@ ute ru@@ le that if our data sour@@ ce has data for one of the countries we &apos;re looking at , it goes into the anal@@ y@@ sis ."
"O@@ ur data sour@@ ce deci@@ des whether it &apos;s reli@@ able data , we don &apos;t ."
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se that would int@@ ro@@ duce bi@@ as .
What about other countries ?
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equ@@ ality in the acade@@ mic pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed jour@@ nals .
"This isn &apos;t con@@ fin@@ ed to these countries here , hi@@ ding a very simple de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration ."
"The same countries , the same measure of inequ@@ ality , one problem after another ."
Why don &apos;t we control for other fac@@ tors ?
Well we &apos;ve sho@@ wn you that G@@ N@@ P per cap@@ it@@ a doesn &apos;t make any difference .
"And of course , others using more so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated me@@ tho@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have contro@@ l@@ led for po@@ ver@@ ty and education and so on ."
What about cau@@ s@@ ality ?
C@@ or@@ relation in itself doesn &apos;t prove cau@@ s@@ ality .
We sp@@ end a good bit of time .
"And in@@ de@@ ed , people know the cau@@ sa@@ l lin@@ ks quite well in some of these out@@ comes ."
"The big change in our understanding of dri@@ ver@@ s of ch@@ ron@@ ic health in the rich developed world is how important ch@@ ron@@ ic stress from social sour@@ ces is aff@@ ec@@ ting the im@@ mun@@ e system , the car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar system ."
"O@@ r for in@@ stance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more un@@ equal societies is because people are sen@@ s@@ itive to being looked down on ."
"I should say that to de@@ al with this , we &apos;ve got to de@@ al with the pos@@ t@@ -@@ ta@@ x things and the pre@@ -@@ ta@@ x things ."
"We &apos;ve got to con@@ st@@ ra@@ in income , the bon@@ us culture in@@ comes at the top ."
I think we must make our b@@ os@@ ses ac@@ cou@@ n@@ table to their emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es in any way we can .
I think the tak@@ e-@@ home message though is that we can improve the real qu@@ ality of human life by re@@ duc@@ ing the differences in in@@ comes between us .
"@@ Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly we have a han@@ d@@ le on the psy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial well-being of whole societies , and that &apos;s exc@@ iting ."
Thank you .

"D@@ oes it app@@ ly to others , or does it app@@ ly to us ?"
This is another look at the tree of life .
"In this picture , I &apos;ve put a bu@@ sh with a center b@@ ran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ st@@ ing speci@@ es at the ti@@ ps of those b@@ ran@@ ches has succ@@ ee@@ ded in evol@@ u@@ tionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has de@@ mon@@ st@@ rat@@ ed a f@@ it@@ ness to its environment ."
"The human part of this b@@ ran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interest@@ ed in ."
We b@@ ran@@ ch off of a common an@@ c@@ est@@ or to modern ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
"In the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 2@@ 5 different speci@@ es of hom@@ ini@@ ds ."

"We have been here for about 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."
"It may seem like we &apos;re quite re@@ mot@@ e from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic ma@@ chin@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same ."
Do you realiz@@ e that we can take adv@@ anta@@ ge and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the ma@@ chin@@ ery of a common ba@@ ct@@ eri@@ um to produce the prot@@ e@@ in of human in@@ sul@@ in used to treat diab@@ eti@@ cs ?

"And speak@@ ing of ba@@ ct@@ eria , do you realiz@@ e that each of us car@@ ries in our g@@ ut more ba@@ ct@@ eria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?"
Maybe 10 times more .
"I mean think of it , when A@@ nt@@ oni@@ o D@@ ama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ ima@@ ge , do you think about the ba@@ ct@@ eria ?"
O@@ ur g@@ ut is a wonder@@ fully h@@ os@@ pit@@ able environment for those ba@@ ct@@ eria .

"They help in the di@@ g@@ es@@ tion of essential nu@@ tri@@ ents , and they prot@@ ect you against certain dise@@ ases ."
But what will come in the future ?
A@@ re we at some kind of evol@@ u@@ tionary equi@@ po@@ i@@ se as a speci@@ es ?
"O@@ r , are we dest@@ ined to become something different — something , perhaps , even better ad@@ ap@@ ted to the environment ?"
"Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago — the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years — the first sig@@ ns of prot@@ o@@ -@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi@@ -@@ cel@@ led organ@@ is@@ ms , perhaps as much as 8@@ 00 or a billion years ago — and then the human speci@@ es , finally emer@@ g@@ ing in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years ."

"I &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ tim@@ ents of G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ur@@ ns , who was perfor@@ ming still in L@@ as V@@ e@@ g@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s ."

"S@@ tan@@ ding before him is a g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl ."
"She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for su@@ per sex . &quot;"

"( Laughter ) I came to realiz@@ e , as a physi@@ ci@@ an , that I was working to@@ ward a go@@ al which was different from the go@@ al of evolution — not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly con@@ tra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory , just different ."
I was trying to pre@@ serve the body .
I wanted to keep us heal@@ thy .
I wanted to re@@ st@@ ore health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and heal@@ thy lives .
"E@@ vol@@ ution is all about pas@@ sing on the gen@@ ome to the next generation , ad@@ ap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation ."
"F@@ rom an evol@@ u@@ tionary point of view , you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter ro@@ ck@@ ets desig@@ ned to sen@@ d the g@@ ene@@ tic pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the se@@ a ."
"I think we would all understand the senti@@ ment that W@@ o@@ o@@ dy A@@ ll@@ en ex@@ pres@@ sed when he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to achi@@ e@@ ve im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity through my work ."
I want to achi@@ e@@ ve it through not d@@ ying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ vol@@ ution does not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly fav@@ or the long@@ est@@ -@@ li@@ ved .
"It doesn &apos;t nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly fav@@ or the bi@@ ggest or the st@@ rong@@ est or the fa@@ ste@@ st , and not even the smar@@ test ."
E@@ vol@@ ution fav@@ ors those cre@@ atures best ad@@ ap@@ ted to their environment .
That is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
"A@@ t the bot@@ tom of the oc@@ e@@ an , ba@@ ct@@ eria that are ther@@ mo@@ phi@@ li@@ c and can survi@@ ve at the stea@@ m v@@ ent he@@ at that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se produce , if fi@@ sh were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de co@@ ok@@ ed fi@@ sh , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , have man@@ ag@@ ed to make that a h@@ os@@ pit@@ able environment for them ."
"So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particu@@ larly as we look a@@ head to the next pha@@ se , I would say that there are a number of possi@@ bil@@ ities ."
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
We have rea@@ ched a kind of equi@@ po@@ i@@ se .
"And the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , man@@ ag@@ ed to pre@@ serve a lot of gen@@ es that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be sel@@ ected out and be re@@ mo@@ ved from the population ."
"And secon@@ dly , we as a speci@@ es have so con@@ figu@@ red our environment that we have man@@ ag@@ ed to make it ad@@ ap@@ t to us as well as we ad@@ ap@@ t to it ."
"And by the way , we im@@ mi@@ g@@ rate and circu@@ late and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the i@@ so@@ lation that is nec@@ ess@@ ary for evolution to take place ."
"A second possi@@ bility is that there will be evolution of the tra@@ diti@@ onal kind , natural , im@@ pos@@ ed by the for@@ ces of nature ."
"And the argu@@ ment here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , but they are in@@ ex@@ o@@ ra@@ ble ."
"And as far as i@@ so@@ lation goes , when we as a speci@@ es do col@@ on@@ iz@@ e dist@@ ant planets , there will be the i@@ so@@ lation and the environ@@ mental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way ."
"But there &apos;s a thir@@ d possi@@ bility , an enti@@ c@@ ing , int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possi@@ bility ."
"I call it ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ i@@ ded and ch@@ os@@ en by us as individu@@ als in the cho@@ i@@ ces that we will make ."
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
"C@@ on@@ sider , first , the reality that people today , in some cul@@ tures , are making cho@@ i@@ ces about their off@@ sp@@ ring ."
"They &apos;re , in some cul@@ tures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more ma@@ les than fe@@ ma@@ les ."
"It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individu@@ al and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing ."
"Th@@ ink also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the g@@ ene@@ tic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cu@@ re or pre@@ v@@ ent dise@@ ases ."
What if you could make the g@@ ene@@ tic changes to eli@@ mi@@ nate diab@@ et@@ es or A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s or re@@ duce the ris@@ k of can@@ cer or eli@@ mi@@ nate st@@ rok@@ e ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es ?
"If we look a@@ head , these kind of changes are going to be incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly possible ."
"The H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ ject started in 19@@ 90 , and it took 1@@ 3 years ."
It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollars .
"The year after it was fin@@ i@@ shed in 200@@ 4 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months ."
"T@@ o@@ day , you can have a complet@@ e se@@ qu@@ ence of the three billion ba@@ se pai@@ r@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week ."
"It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ dol@@ lar human gen@@ ome , and it will be incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble for everyone ."
"@@ Just a week ago , the N@@ ati@@ onal A@@ c@@ ade@@ my of Eng@@ ine@@ ering a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ rap@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze to F@@ ran@@ c@@ is A@@ r@@ no@@ ld and W@@ il@@ le@@ m S@@ tem@@ mer , two scienti@@ sts who in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently developed te@@ chni@@ qu@@ es to en@@ coura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work fa@@ ster and to le@@ ad to de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble prot@@ e@@ ins in a more e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent way — what F@@ ran@@ ces A@@ r@@ no@@ ld cal@@ ls &quot; &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot; &quot; A couple of years ago , the L@@ as@@ k@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze was a@@ war@@ ded to the scienti@@ st S@@ h@@ in@@ ya Y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an a@@ du@@ l@@ t sk@@ in cell , a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ last , and by man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ting just four gen@@ es , he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to re@@ ver@@ t to a p@@ lu@@ ri@@ potenti@@ al stem cell — a cell potenti@@ ally cap@@ ab@@ le@@ "
of becom@@ ing any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
"The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in ba@@ ct@@ eria can make vi@@ ru@@ ses that will not only prot@@ ect you against themselves , but in@@ duce im@@ mun@@ ity against other vi@@ ru@@ ses ."

Can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ ba@@ cc@@ o ?
"@@ These are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be e@@ ver@@ more possible ."
I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little changes .
"You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ sp@@ ring ?"
"What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ v@@ a , or change the ne@@ w@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed e@@ g@@ g , and give your off@@ sp@@ ring a better chan@@ ce at a heal@@ thi@@ er life — eli@@ mi@@ nate the diab@@ et@@ es , eli@@ mi@@ nate the he@@ mo@@ phi@@ li@@ a , re@@ duce the ris@@ k of can@@ cer ?"
Wh@@ o doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
"And then , that same anal@@ y@@ tic technology , that same eng@@ ine of science that can produce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent disease , will also ena@@ ble us to ad@@ op@@ t super@@ -@@ att@@ ri@@ b@@ utes , hy@@ per@@ -@@ cap@@ ac@@ ities — that better mem@@ ory ."
"Wh@@ y not have the qui@@ ck w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ ni@@ ngs , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next generation of the W@@ at@@ son machine ?"
Why not have the qui@@ ck t@@ wit@@ ch mu@@ sc@@ le that will ena@@ ble you to ru@@ n fa@@ ster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ ble .
"And when we are at a position where we can pa@@ ss it on to the next generation , and we can ad@@ op@@ t the att@@ ri@@ b@@ utes we want , we will have con@@ ver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution ."
"We &apos;ll take a process that nor@@ ma@@ lly might requi@@ re 10@@ 0,000 years , and we can com@@ pre@@ ss it down to a thou@@ s@@ and years — and maybe even in the next 100 years ."
"@@ These are cho@@ i@@ ces that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them ."
"W@@ ill we use these cho@@ i@@ ces to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?"
"O@@ r , will we sel@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely choose different att@@ ri@@ b@@ utes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?"
"W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more ro@@ bu@@ st and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?"
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
"And most prof@@ oun@@ dly of all , will we ever be able to devel@@ op the wi@@ s@@ dom , and to in@@ h@@ er@@ it the wi@@ s@@ dom , that we &apos;ll need to make these cho@@ i@@ ces wi@@ sel@@ y ?"

"One thing the world needs , one thing this country de@@ s@@ per@@ at@@ ely needs is a better way of conduc@@ ting our political de@@ bat@@ es ."
We need to re@@ disco@@ ver the lost art of democra@@ tic argu@@ ment .
I have a su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion .
But we too ra@@ rely ar@@ ti@@ cu@@ late and de@@ f@@ end and ar@@ g@@ ue about those big moral questions in our politi@@ cs .
So what I would like to do today is have something of a dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion .
"F@@ irst , let me take a famous ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er who wrote about those questions of ju@@ stice and morality , give you a very sh@@ ort lec@@ ture on A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le of an@@ ci@@ ent A@@ th@@ ens , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s theory of ju@@ stice , and then have a dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion here to see whether A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le &apos;s ideas actually in@@ form the way we think and ar@@ g@@ ue about questions today ."
"So , are you ready for the lec@@ ture ?"
"A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le , ju@@ stice means giving people what they de@@ serve ."
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lec@@ ture .
"( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous enough ."
The real questions beg@@ in when it comes to argu@@ ing about who de@@ ser@@ ves what and why .
T@@ ake the example of fl@@ utes .
Su@@ pp@@ ose we &apos;re di@@ stri@@ b@@ ut@@ ing fl@@ utes .
Wh@@ o should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people — What would you say ?
Wh@@ o should get the best fl@@ ute ?
You can just call it out .
( Au@@ dience : R@@ an@@ dom . ) M@@ i@@ cha@@ el S@@ an@@ de@@ l : A@@ t ran@@ dom . You would do it by lot@@ ter@@ y .
O@@ r by the first person to ru@@ sh into the ha@@ ll to get them .
How many say the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?
( Laughter ) But here &apos;s a har@@ der question .
"Wh@@ y do you think , those of you who v@@ ot@@ ed this way , that the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers ?"
P@@ et@@ er : The great@@ est bene@@ fit to all .
M@@ S : The great@@ est bene@@ fit to all .
We &apos;ll hear better music if the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
That &apos;s P@@ et@@ er ? ( Au@@ dience : P@@ et@@ er . ) M@@ S : A@@ ll right .
"Well , it &apos;s a good reason ."
We &apos;ll all be better off if good music is play@@ ed rather than ter@@ ri@@ ble music .
"But P@@ et@@ er , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le doesn &apos;t ag@@ ree with you that that &apos;s the reason ."
That &apos;s all right .
A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best fl@@ utes should go to the best fl@@ ute play@@ ers .
"He says that to reason about just di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of a thing , we have to reason about , and some@@ times ar@@ g@@ ue about , the pur@@ p@@ ose of the thing , or the social acti@@ vity — in this case , mu@@ si@@ cal perfor@@ man@@ ce ."
"And the point , the essential nature , of mu@@ si@@ cal perfor@@ man@@ ce is to produce ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ent music ."
It &apos;ll be a happy b@@ y@@ produc@@ t that we &apos;ll all bene@@ fit .
"But when we think about ju@@ stice , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the acti@@ vity in question and the qu@@ al@@ ities that are wor@@ th hon@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ mi@@ ring and recogni@@ zing ."
"Now , fl@@ utes may seem ... the di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of fl@@ utes may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al case ."
Let &apos;s take a con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry example of the di@@ sp@@ ute about ju@@ stice .
It had to do with golf .
"C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin — a few years ago , C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin — did any of you hear about him ?"
"He was a very good gol@@ f@@ er , but he had a dis@@ ab@@ il@@ ity ."
"He had a bad le@@ g , a circu@@ lat@@ ory problem , that made it very pa@@ in@@ ful for him to wal@@ k the course ."
"In fact , it car@@ ried ris@@ k of in@@ ju@@ ry ."
"He asked the P@@ G@@ A , the P@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ sional G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers &apos; A@@ s@@ soci@@ ation , for per@@ mis@@ sion to use a golf cart in the P@@ G@@ A t@@ our@@ nam@@ ents ."
"They said , &quot; &quot; No ."
"Now that would give you an un@@ fai@@ r adv@@ anta@@ ge . &quot; &quot; He sue@@ d , and his case went all the way to the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the la@@ w says that the dis@@ ab@@ led must be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ated , pro@@ vi@@ ded the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dation does not change the essential nature of the acti@@ vity ."
"He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a great gol@@ f@@ er ."
I want to comp@@ et@@ e .
But I need a golf cart to get from one h@@ ole to the next . &quot; &quot; Su@@ pp@@ ose you were on the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
Su@@ pp@@ ose you were deci@@ ding the ju@@ stice of this case .
How many here would say that C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
"And how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?"
"All right , let &apos;s take a pol@@ l , show of hands ."
How many would ru@@ le in fav@@ or of C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin ?
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
"All right , we have a good divi@@ sion of op@@ ini@@ on here ."
"S@@ om@@ e@@ one who would not gr@@ ant C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ?"
"R@@ ai@@ se your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a mi@@ c@@ ro@@ phone ."
( Au@@ dience : It &apos;d be an un@@ fai@@ r adv@@ anta@@ ge . ) M@@ S : It would be an un@@ fai@@ r adv@@ anta@@ ge if he gets to ri@@ de in a golf cart .
"All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart wor@@ ry about an un@@ fai@@ r adv@@ anta@@ ge ."
How would you answer the ob@@ jec@@ tion ?
"Y@@ es , all right ."
Au@@ dience : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
C@@ har@@ li@@ e : The cart &apos;s not part of the game .
M@@ S : But what about walking from h@@ ole to h@@ ole ?
C@@ har@@ li@@ e : It doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king the course is not part of the game of golf ?
"C@@ har@@ li@@ e : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t ."
"M@@ S : A@@ ll right . S@@ ta@@ y there , C@@ har@@ li@@ e ."
( Laughter ) Wh@@ o has an answer for C@@ har@@ li@@ e ?
"All right , who has an answer for C@@ har@@ li@@ e ?"
What would you say ?
"A@@ u@@ dience : The en@@ du@@ ran@@ ce el@@ ement is a very important part of the game , walking all those h@@ ol@@ es ."
M@@ S : W@@ al@@ king all those h@@ ol@@ es ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ( Au@@ dience : A@@ b@@ solutely . ) M@@ S : What &apos;s your na@@ me ? ( Au@@ dience : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n . ) M@@ S : W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"C@@ har@@ li@@ e , what do you say to W@@ ar@@ re@@ n ?"
C@@ har@@ ley : I &apos;ll sti@@ ck to my ori@@ gi@@ nal the@@ sis .
W@@ ar@@ re@@ n : I am not a gol@@ f@@ er .
"C@@ har@@ ley : And I am . ( M@@ S : O@@ kay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s interesting ."
"In the case , in the lower cour@@ t , they brought in gol@@ f@@ ing great@@ s to t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y on this very issue ."
I@@ s walking the course essential to the game ?
And they brought in J@@ ac@@ k N@@ i@@ ck@@ la@@ us and A@@ r@@ no@@ ld P@@ al@@ mer .
And what do you supp@@ ose they all said ?
Y@@ es . They ag@@ re@@ ed with W@@ ar@@ re@@ n .
"They said , y@@ es , walking the course is st@@ ren@@ u@@ ous physical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ."
The f@@ ati@@ g@@ ue fac@@ tor is an important part of golf .
And so it would change the fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal nature of the game to give him the golf cart .
"Now , noti@@ ce , something interesting — Well , I should tell you about the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t first ."
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t decided .
What do you supp@@ ose they said ?
"They said y@@ es , that C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin must be pro@@ vi@@ ded a golf cart ."
"S@@ even to two , they ru@@ led ."
"What was interesting about their ru@@ ling and about the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion we &apos;ve just had is that the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion about the right , the ju@@ stice , of the matter depen@@ ded on figu@@ ring out what is the essential nature of golf ."
And the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t ju@@ sti@@ ces w@@ re@@ st@@ led with that question .
"And Ju@@ stice S@@ t@@ ev@@ ens , writ@@ ing for the maj@@ ority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small b@@ all from one place into a h@@ ole in as few st@@ rok@@ es as possible , and that walking was not essential , but inci@@ d@@ en@@ tal ."
"Now , there were two dis@@ sent@@ ers , one of wh@@ om was Ju@@ stice S@@ cal@@ ia ."
"He wouldn &apos;t have gr@@ ant@@ ed the cart , and he had a very interesting dis@@ sent ."
It &apos;s interesting because he re@@ jec@@ ted the A@@ rist@@ ot@@ eli@@ an pre@@ mi@@ se under@@ l@@ ying the maj@@ ority &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
&quot; &quot; T@@ o say that something is essential is ordina@@ ri@@ ly to say that it is nec@@ ess@@ ary to the achiev@@ ement of a certain ob@@ ject .
Ju@@ stice S@@ cal@@ ia &apos;s op@@ ini@@ on is ques@@ tiona@@ ble for two reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , no real sp@@ or@@ ts f@@ an would talk that way ."
"( Laughter ) If we had thought that the ru@@ les of the sp@@ or@@ ts we care about are m@@ er@@ ely ar@@ bit@@ ra@@ ry , rather than desig@@ ned to call for@@ th the vi@@ r@@ tue@@ s and the ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ences that we think are wor@@ thy of ad@@ mi@@ ring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the out@@ come of the game ."
It &apos;s also ob@@ jec@@ tiona@@ ble on a second ground .
"O@@ n the face of it , it se@@ em@@ ed to be — this de@@ b@@ ate about the golf cart — an argu@@ ment about fai@@ r@@ ness , what &apos;s an un@@ fai@@ r adv@@ anta@@ ge ."
"But if fai@@ r@@ ness were the only thing at s@@ take , there would have been an easy and ob@@ vi@@ ous sol@@ ution ."
"But l@@ etting everyone ri@@ de in a cart would have been , I su@@ sp@@ ect , more ana@@ the@@ ma to the gol@@ f@@ ing great@@ s and to the P@@ G@@ A , even than making an ex@@ cep@@ tion for C@@ a@@ se@@ y Mar@@ tin ."
Why ?
Let me put the point as d@@ eli@@ cat@@ ely as possible : G@@ ol@@ f@@ ers are a little sen@@ s@@ itive about the a@@ th@@ le@@ tic sta@@ tu@@ s of their game .
"( Laughter ) Af@@ ter all , there &apos;s no run@@ ning or ju@@ mp@@ ing , and the b@@ all stan@@ ds still . ( Laughter )"
"So if gol@@ f@@ ing is the kind of game that can be play@@ ed while ri@@ ding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to con@@ f@@ er on the gol@@ f@@ ing great@@ s the sta@@ tu@@ s that we con@@ f@@ er , the hon@@ or and re@@ cognition that goes to truly great a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es ."
"That il@@ lu@@ st@@ rat@@ es that with golf , as with fl@@ utes , it &apos;s hard to deci@@ de the question of what ju@@ stice requi@@ res , without grap@@ pl@@ ing with the question , &quot; &quot; What is the essential nature of the acti@@ vity in question , and what qu@@ al@@ ities , what ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ences connec@@ ted with that acti@@ vity , are wor@@ thy of hon@@ or and re@@ cognition ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s take a fi@@ nal example that &apos;s pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent in con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry political de@@ b@@ ate : sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age ."
"There are those who fav@@ or state re@@ cognition only of tra@@ diti@@ onal mar@@ ri@@ age between one man and one woman , and there are those who fav@@ or state re@@ cognition of sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age ."
How many here fav@@ or the first po@@ lic@@ y : the state should recogni@@ ze tra@@ diti@@ onal mar@@ ri@@ age only ?
"And how many fav@@ or the second , sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age ?"
"The op@@ pon@@ ents of sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age say that the pur@@ p@@ ose of mar@@ ri@@ age , fund@@ am@@ en@@ tally , is pro@@ cre@@ ation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wor@@ thy of hon@@ or@@ ing and recogni@@ zing and en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing ."
"So with fl@@ utes , with golf car@@ ts , and even with a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely con@@ te@@ sted question like sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age , A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le has a point ."
V@@ ery hard to ar@@ g@@ ue about ju@@ stice without first argu@@ ing about the pur@@ p@@ ose of social in@@ stit@@ u@@ tions and about what qu@@ al@@ ities are wor@@ thy of hon@@ or and re@@ cognition .
"So let &apos;s step back from these c@@ ases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the United States , and for that matter , around the world ."
"There is a ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y to think that if we eng@@ age too direc@@ tly with moral questions in politi@@ cs , that &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement , and for that matter , a re@@ ci@@ pe for int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on ."
"So better to sh@@ y away from , to ig@@ n@@ ore , the moral and the religi@@ ous con@@ vi@@ c@@ tions that people bring to civi@@ c life ."
"That , it seems to me , is a way to beg@@ in to re@@ st@@ ore the art of democra@@ tic argu@@ ment ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
"@@ Thank you very much . Th@@ an@@ ks . Thank you . Ch@@ ris . Th@@ an@@ ks , Ch@@ ris . Ch@@ ris A@@ n@@ der@@ son : F@@ rom fl@@ utes to golf cour@@ se@@ s@@ "
to sam@@ e-@@ sex mar@@ ri@@ age — that was a g@@ eni@@ us l@@ ink .
"Now look , you &apos;re a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of open education ."
Y@@ our lec@@ ture seri@@ es was one of the first to do it big .
What &apos;s your vision for the next pha@@ se of this ?
"M@@ S : Well , I think that it is possible ."
"C@@ A : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , inv@@ iting questions , but with people from China and India jo@@ ining in ?"
"M@@ S : R@@ ight . We did a little bit of it here with 1@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 people in L@@ ong B@@ each , and we do it in a cla@@ s@@ s@@ room at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d with about 1@@ ,000 students ."
"W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and argu@@ ing , eng@@ ag@@ ing seri@@ ously with big moral questions , ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing cul@@ tu@@ ral differences and con@@ n@@ ect through a live vi@@ de@@ o ho@@ ok@@ up , students in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing and M@@ u@@ mb@@ ai and in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge , M@@ as@@ sa@@ chu@@ s@@ et@@ ts and create a global cla@@ s@@ s@@ room ."
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
"So I work in marketing , which I love , but my first pas@@ sion was physics , a pas@@ sion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gra@@ y hair ."
So he ta@@ u@@ ght me that physics is co@@ ol because it teach@@ es us so much about the world around us .
So qui@@ ck show of hands — who studi@@ ed some marketing in univer@@ sity ?
Wh@@ o studi@@ ed some physics in univer@@ sity ?
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good . And at school ?
"O@@ kay , lots of you ."
"So , h@@ op@@ e@@ fully this will bring back some happy , or possi@@ bly some sli@@ ghtly di@@ stu@@ r@@ b@@ ing mem@@ ories ."
"So , physics and marketing ."
We &apos;ll start with something very simple — Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s L@@ a@@ w : &quot; The force equ@@ als ma@@ ss times ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation . &quot;
This is something that perhaps T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ lin@@ es should have studi@@ ed a bit more care@@ fully before they ran this cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n .
"( Laughter ) But if we re@@ ar@@ range this for@@ mu@@ la quickly , we can get to ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation equ@@ als force over ma@@ ss , which means that for a lar@@ ger partic@@ le — a lar@@ ger ma@@ ss — it requi@@ res more force to change its direc@@ tion ."
"It &apos;s the same with b@@ ran@@ ds : the more mas@@ sive a brand , the more ba@@ g@@ ga@@ ge it has , the more force is needed to change its pos@@ iti@@ oning ."
And that &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons why A@@ r@@ thu@@ r A@@ n@@ der@@ sen ch@@ ose to la@@ un@@ ch A@@ cc@@ en@@ ture rather than try to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the world that A@@ n@@ der@@ sen &apos;s could st@@ and for something other than ac@@ count@@ an@@ c@@ y .
"It expla@@ ins why H@@ o@@ over found it very difficult to per@@ su@@ a@@ de the world that it was more than vac@@ u@@ um cle@@ an@@ ers , and why compan@@ ies like Uni@@ le@@ ver and P &@@ am@@ p@@ ; G keep b@@ ran@@ ds se@@ pa@@ rate , like A@@ ri@@ el and P@@ ri@@ ng@@ les and D@@ ove rather than having one gi@@ ant par@@ ent brand ."
"The marketing is , the bi@@ gg@@ er a brand , the more difficult it is to re@@ position it ."
So think about a port@@ fo@@ li@@ o of b@@ ran@@ ds or maybe new b@@ ran@@ ds for new v@@ en@@ tures .
"Now , who remem@@ b@@ ers H@@ e@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y princi@@ ple ?"
G@@ etting a little more te@@ chni@@ cal now .
"So this says that it &apos;s im@@ possible , by defin@@ ition , to measure exactly the state — i@@ .@@ e@@ . , the position — and the m@@ omen@@ tum of a partic@@ le , because the act of measu@@ ring it , by defin@@ ition , changes it ."
"So to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an el@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ ry partic@@ le and you sh@@ ine a light on it , then the phot@@ on of light has m@@ omen@@ tum , which kno@@ cks the partic@@ le , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it ."
"B@@ y measu@@ ring it , the act of measu@@ re@@ ment changes it ."
The act of observ@@ ation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
"So with the act of ob@@ ser@@ ving con@@ sum@@ ers , changes their behavior ."
"Th@@ ink about the group of mom@@ s who are talking about their wonderful children in a focu@@ s group , and almost n@@ one of them buy lots of j@@ un@@ k fo@@ od ."
"And yet , M@@ c@@ D@@ ona@@ ld &apos;s sel@@ ls hund@@ re@@ ds of mil@@ lions of bur@@ g@@ ers every year ."
"Y@@ et , at Google , we know it &apos;s the numb@@ er@@ -@@ one sear@@ ched for cat@@ e@@ g@@ ory ."
"So lu@@ ck@@ i@@ ly , the science — no , sor@@ ry — the marketing is getting ea@@ si@@ er ."
"@@ L@@ u@@ ck@@ i@@ ly , with now better point@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ s@@ al@@ e tra@@ cking , more di@@ g@@ ital medi@@ a con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , you can measure more what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do ."
"So the physics is you can never accu@@ rat@@ ely and exactly measure a partic@@ le , because the observ@@ ation changes it ."
"The marketing is — the message for marketing is — that try to measure what con@@ sum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate they &apos;ll do ."
"What this means is you can ga@@ ther more and more data around a hy@@ pothe@@ sis or a pos@@ iti@@ oning , and it will stre@@ ng@@ then it , but it will not con@@ clu@@ si@@ vely prove it ."
And only one con@@ tra@@ ry data point can b@@ low your theory out of the water .
So if we take an example — P@@ to@@ le@@ my had do@@ z@@ ens of data point@@ s to supp@@ ort his theory that the planets would ro@@ tat@@ e around the Earth .
It only took one ro@@ bu@@ st observ@@ ation from C@@ oper@@ ni@@ cu@@ s to b@@ low that idea out of the water .
"T@@ ake B@@ P — they spent mil@@ lions of p@@ oun@@ ds over many years building up its cre@@ d@@ enti@@ als as an environ@@ men@@ tally fri@@ en@@ dly brand , but then one little ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
Th@@ ink about T@@ o@@ yot@@ a .
"It was , for a long time , re@@ vered as the most reli@@ able of car@@ s , and then they had the big rec@@ all inci@@ dent ."
"And T@@ ig@@ er W@@ o@@ o@@ ds , for a long time , the perf@@ ect brand am@@ ba@@ s@@ sa@@ d@@ or ."
"Well , you know the story ."
"( Laughter ) So the physics is that you cannot prove a hy@@ pothe@@ sis , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ prove it — any hy@@ pothe@@ sis is sha@@ k@@ y ."
"And the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve inv@@ est@@ ed in your brand , one bad week can under@@ m@@ ine dec@@ ad@@ es of good work ."
So be really care@@ ful to try and av@@ oi@@ d the scre@@ w@@ -@@ up@@ s that can under@@ m@@ ine your brand .
"And la@@ st@@ ly , to the sli@@ ghtly ob@@ s@@ cu@@ re world of entropy — the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs ."
"This says that entropy , which is a measure of the dis@@ order of a system , will always increase ."
The same is true of marketing .
"If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much contro@@ l@@ led by one marketing man@@ ag@@ er could pretty much de@@ f@@ ine a brand ."
"But where we are today , things have changed ."
You can get a strong brand ima@@ ge or a message and put it out there like the Con@@ serv@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty did ear@@ li@@ er this year with their elec@@ tion pos@@ ter .
But then you l@@ ose control of it .
"W@@ ith the kind of di@@ g@@ ital com@@ ment cre@@ ation and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion to@@ ols that are av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble now to every con@@ su@@ mer , it &apos;s im@@ possible to control where it goes ."
"Y@@ our brand star@@ ts being dis@@ per@@ sed , ( Laughter ) it gets more cha@@ oti@@ c . ( Laughter )"
It &apos;s out of your control . ( Laughter )
I actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
"But while this may be un@@ s@@ et@@ t@@ ling for mark@@ et@@ ers , it &apos;s actually a good thing ."
"This di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of brand energy gets your brand cl@@ os@@ er to the people , more in with the people ."
"It makes this di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of energy a democra@@ ti@@ zing force , which is ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely good for your brand ."
"So , the le@@ s@@ son from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it &apos;s a fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal la@@ w ."
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dis@@ per@@ sed .
"You can &apos;t fi@@ ght it , so em@@ bra@@ ce it and find a way to work with it ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"We are going to take a qui@@ ck v@@ o@@ ya@@ ge over the cogn@@ itive history of the 20@@ th century , because during that century , our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed d@@ ram@@ ati@@ cally ."
"As you all know , the car@@ s that people d@@ ro@@ ve in 1900 have al@@ ter@@ ed because the ro@@ a@@ ds are better and because of technology ."
"And our min@@ ds have al@@ ter@@ ed , too ."
"Now , this d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c change was d@@ ra@@ wn to my att@@ ention through mas@@ sive I@@ .@@ Q@@ . ga@@ ins over time , and these have been truly mas@@ sive ."
"That is , we don &apos;t just get a few more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts ."
We get far more questions right on I@@ .@@ Q@@ . te@@ sts than each succ@@ ee@@ ding generation back to the time that they were inv@@ ent@@ ed .
"In@@ de@@ ed , if you sc@@ ore the people a century ago against modern nor@@ ms , they would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 70 ."
"If you sc@@ ore us against their nor@@ ms , we would have an average I@@ .@@ Q@@ . of 1@@ 30 ."
Now this has ra@@ ised all sor@@ ts of questions .
W@@ ere our im@@ medi@@ ate an@@ c@@ est@@ ors on the ver@@ ge of mental re@@ tar@@ dation ?
Because 70 is nor@@ ma@@ lly the sc@@ ore for mental re@@ tar@@ dation .
O@@ r are we on the ver@@ ge of all being gi@@ f@@ ted ?
Because 1@@ 30 is the c@@ ut@@ ting line for gi@@ f@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"Now I &apos;m going to try and ar@@ g@@ ue for a thir@@ d al@@ ter@@ nati@@ ve that &apos;s much more il@@ lu@@ mi@@ nat@@ ing than ei@@ ther of those , and to put this into per@@ spec@@ tive , let &apos;s imagine that a Mar@@ ti@@ an came down to Earth and found a ru@@ ined civi@@ li@@ zation ."
"And this Mar@@ ti@@ an was an ar@@ cha@@ eo@@ logi@@ st , and they found s@@ co@@ res , tar@@ get s@@ co@@ res , that people had used for sho@@ ot@@ ing ."
"And first they looked at 18@@ 6@@ 5 , and they found that in a min@@ ute , people had only put one bu@@ l@@ let in the bu@@ ll@@ se@@ ye ."
"And then they found , in 18@@ 9@@ 8 , that they &apos;d put about five bu@@ ll@@ ets in the bu@@ ll@@ se@@ ye in a min@@ ute ."
And then about 19@@ 1@@ 8 they put a hundred bu@@ ll@@ ets in the bu@@ ll@@ se@@ ye .
"And in@@ iti@@ ally , that ar@@ cha@@ eo@@ logi@@ st would be ba@@ ff@@ led ."
"They would say , look , these te@@ sts were desig@@ ned to find out how much people were stea@@ dy of hand , how ke@@ en their ey@@ e@@ sight was , whether they had control of their we@@ ap@@ on ."
How could these perfor@@ man@@ ces have es@@ ca@@ lated to this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous de@@ g@@ ree ?
"Well we now know , of course , the answer ."
"And , in other words , it was the equi@@ pm@@ ent that was in the hands of the average sol@@ di@@ er that was respon@@ sible , not great@@ er ke@@ en@@ ness of ey@@ e or stea@@ d@@ iness of hand ."
"Now what we have to imagine is the mental ar@@ ti@@ ll@@ ery that we have pi@@ cked up over those hundred years , and I think again that another thin@@ k@@ er will help us here , and that &apos;s L@@ u@@ ri@@ a ."
"He found that they were re@@ sist@@ ant to de@@ duc@@ ing the hy@@ pothe@@ ti@@ cal , to sp@@ ecu@@ la@@ ting about what might be , and he found finally that they didn &apos;t de@@ al well with ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tions or using logi@@ c on those ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tions ."
Now let me give you a sam@@ ple of some of his inter@@ vie@@ ws .
He talked to the head man of a person in ru@@ ral R@@ us@@ sia .
"They &apos;d only had , as people had in 1900 , about four years of scho@@ ol@@ ing ."
"And he asked that particular person , what do c@@ ro@@ ws and fi@@ sh have in common ?"
"And the f@@ el@@ low said , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solutely nothing ."
"You know , I can e@@ at a fi@@ sh . I can &apos;t e@@ at a c@@ row ."
A c@@ row can p@@ ec@@ k at a fi@@ sh .
"The other is a bir@@ d . &quot; &quot; And he was interest@@ ed , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , in what he could do with those con@@ cre@@ te ob@@ jects ."
"And then L@@ u@@ ri@@ a went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; There are no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
H@@ am@@ bur@@ g is a city in G@@ er@@ many .
"And L@@ u@@ ri@@ a said , &quot; &quot; But what do my words im@@ p@@ ly ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s a small village , and there &apos;s no room for cam@@ els . &quot; &quot; In other words , he was un@@ w@@ il@@ ling to treat this as anything but a con@@ cre@@ te problem , and he was used to cam@@ els being in villa@@ ges , and he was quite u@@ na@@ ble to use the hy@@ pothe@@ ti@@ cal , to ask h@@ im@@ self what if there were no cam@@ els in G@@ er@@ many ."
"And L@@ u@@ ri@@ a said , &quot; &quot; A@@ t the Nor@@ th P@@ ole , there is always s@@ now ."
"Wh@@ er@@ ever there is always s@@ now , the be@@ ar@@ s are white ."
"What col@@ or are the be@@ ar@@ s at the Nor@@ th P@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; And the respon@@ se was , &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch a thing is to be s@@ et@@ t@@ led by t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y ."
They wer@@ en &apos;t w@@ il@@ ling to eng@@ age in this .
"One of them said to L@@ u@@ ri@@ a , &quot; &quot; How can we sol@@ ve things that are@@ n &apos;t real problems ?"
N@@ one of these problems are real .
And let me give you a few il@@ lu@@ st@@ ra@@ tions .
"F@@ irst , almost all of us today get a high school di@@ pl@@ om@@ a ."
"That is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of forma@@ l education , and 5@@ 2 percent of Americ@@ ans have actually experienc@@ ed some ty@@ pe of ter@@ ti@@ ary education ."
You can &apos;t do science without prop@@ os@@ ing hy@@ pothe@@ ses .
You can &apos;t do science without making it logi@@ cally con@@ sist@@ ent .
"They were things like , what are the cap@@ it@@ als of the 4@@ 4 or 45 states that exi@@ sted at that time ?"
"When they looked at the exam@@ s that the state of O@@ hi@@ o gave in 19@@ 90 , they were all about ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tions ."
"They were things like , why is the lar@@ gest city of a state ra@@ rely the cap@@ ital ?"
They put it in H@@ ar@@ ris@@ bur@@ g rather than P@@ hi@@ la@@ d@@ el@@ phi@@ a .
So the ten@@ or of education has changed .
"We are educ@@ ating people to take the hy@@ pothe@@ ti@@ cal seri@@ ously , to use ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tions , and to l@@ ink them logi@@ cally ."
What about emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ?
"Well , in 1900 , three percent of Americ@@ ans p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ced profes@@ sions that were cogn@@ iti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding ."
O@@ n@@ ly three percent were la@@ w@@ y@@ ers or do@@ ct@@ ors or teachers .
"T@@ o@@ day , 3@@ 5 percent of Americ@@ ans p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce cogn@@ iti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions , not only to the profes@@ sions prop@@ er like la@@ w@@ y@@ er or doc@@ tor or scienti@@ st or lec@@ tu@@ re@@ r , but many , many sub@@ -@@ profes@@ sions having to do with being a te@@ chni@@ ci@@ an , a computer pro@@ gr@@ am@@ mer ."
A whole range of profes@@ sions now make cogn@@ itive de@@ man@@ ds .
And it &apos;s not just that we have many more people in cogn@@ iti@@ vely de@@ man@@ ding profes@@ sions .
The profes@@ sions have been up@@ gra@@ ded .
"C@@ om@@ p@@ are the doc@@ tor in 1900 , who really had only a few tri@@ cks up his s@@ le@@ e@@ ve , with the modern gener@@ al p@@ rac@@ t@@ iti@@ on@@ er or speci@@ ali@@ st , with years of scienti@@ fi@@ c tra@@ ining ."
They went far be@@ yon@@ d that 1900 ban@@ k@@ er .
They had to get comp@@ lic@@ ated C@@ D@@ O@@ -@@ squ@@ a@@ red in order to b@@ und@@ le de@@ b@@ t together and make de@@ b@@ t look as if it were actually a prof@@ it@@ able as@@ set .
O@@ r take a far@@ mer today .
I take the far@@ m man@@ ag@@ er of today as very different from the far@@ mer of 1900 .
It &apos;s also been the up@@ gra@@ ding of ta@@ s@@ ks like la@@ w@@ y@@ er and doc@@ tor and what have you that have made de@@ man@@ ds on our cogn@@ itive fac@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
I &apos;m pri@@ ma@@ ri@@ ly a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er .
"Now over the last century , in developed na@@ tions like America , moral de@@ b@@ ate has es@@ ca@@ lated because we take the hy@@ pothe@@ ti@@ cal seri@@ ously , and we also take univer@@ s@@ als seri@@ ously and look for logical connec@@ tions ."
"When I came home in 19@@ 5@@ 5 from univer@@ sity at the time of Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , a lot of people came home at that time and started having argu@@ ments with their par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents ."
"M@@ y father was born in 18@@ 8@@ 5 , and he was mil@@ dly ra@@ ci@@ ally bi@@ as@@ ed ."
( Laughter ) But he did have a sense that black people were inf@@ eri@@ or .
"And when we said to our par@@ ents and grand@@ par@@ ents , &quot; How would you feel if tom@@ or@@ row morning you wok@@ e up black ? &quot;"
they said that is the du@@ m@@ best thing you &apos;ve ever said .
"In other words , they were fi@@ x@@ ed in the con@@ cre@@ te mo@@ res and att@@ it@@ u@@ des they had in@@ h@@ er@@ ited ."
How would you feel about that ?
"And if someone of the older generation says , well , our government takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not w@@ il@@ ling to take the hy@@ pothe@@ ti@@ cal seri@@ ously ."
"O@@ r take an I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ c father wh@@ ose daughter has been rap@@ ed , and he fe@@ els he &apos;s hon@@ or@@ -@@ b@@ ound to k@@ ill her ."
They &apos;re just in@@ h@@ er@@ ited mo@@ res .
"T@@ o@@ day we would say something like , well , imagine you were kno@@ cked un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous and so@@ d@@ omi@@ zed ."
"And he would say , well that &apos;s not in the K@@ o@@ ran ."
That &apos;s not one of the princi@@ pl@@ es I &apos;ve got .
"Well you , today , univer@@ s@@ aliz@@ e your princi@@ pl@@ es ."
You state them as ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tions and you use logi@@ c on them .
"You have to say , well , b@@ la@@ ck@@ ness of sk@@ in , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t su@@ ff@@ er just for that ."
It must be that b@@ la@@ cks are some@@ how ta@@ int@@ ed .
"And you can get moral argu@@ ment off the ground , then , because you &apos;re not tre@@ ating moral princi@@ pl@@ es as con@@ cre@@ te ent@@ ities ."
"You &apos;re tre@@ ating them as univer@@ s@@ als , to be ren@@ der@@ ed con@@ sist@@ ent by logi@@ c ."
That &apos;s what in@@ iti@@ ally got me going on cogn@@ itive history .
"If you look at the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test , you find the ga@@ ins have been great@@ est in certain are@@ as ."
There are other parts of the I@@ .@@ Q@@ . test b@@ att@@ ery that are about using logi@@ c on ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tions .
"And in 1900 , people could do simple anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es ."
"That is , if you said to them , cat@@ s are like w@@ il@@ d@@ cat@@ s ."
What are do@@ gs like ?
They would say w@@ ol@@ ves .
"But by 1960 , people could atta@@ ck R@@ a@@ ven &apos;s on a much more so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated level ."
"If you said , we &apos;ve got two squ@@ a@@ res follo@@ wed by a tri@@ ang@@ le , what follo@@ ws two cir@@ c@@ les ?"
They could say a se@@ mi@@ cir@@ cle .
"@@ Just as a tri@@ ang@@ le is half of a squ@@ are , a se@@ mi@@ cir@@ cle is half of a cir@@ cle ."
"B@@ y 20@@ 10 , college gra@@ du@@ ates , if you said two cir@@ c@@ les follo@@ wed by a se@@ mi@@ cir@@ cle , two si@@ x@@ te@@ ens follo@@ wed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 ."
"Now , I should say one thing that &apos;s very dis@@ hear@@ ten@@ ing ."
We ha@@ ven &apos;t made progress on all fron@@ ts .
"We &apos;ve noti@@ ced , in a tr@@ end am@@ ong young Americ@@ ans , that they read less history and less liter@@ ature and less material about fore@@ ig@@ n lan@@ ds , and they &apos;re essentially a@@ hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal ."
They live in the bubble of the present .
They don &apos;t know the K@@ ore@@ an War from the war in Vi@@ et@@ nam .
They don &apos;t know who was an ally of America in World War I@@ I .
"Th@@ ink how different America would be if every American knew that this is the fi@@ f@@ th time W@@ est@@ ern ar@@ mi@@ es have gone to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan to put its h@@ ouse in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four pre@@ vi@@ ous o@@ cc@@ a@@ sions ."
"( Laughter ) And that is , they had ba@@ rely left , and there wasn &apos;t a tra@@ ce in the s@@ and ."
O@@ r imagine how different things would be if most Americ@@ ans knew that we had been li@@ ed into four of our last six war@@ s .
But I don &apos;t want to end on a p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ stic not@@ e .
"@@ L@@ or@@ d C@@ ur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people ba@@ thing in the Nor@@ th S@@ e@@ a , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell me what white bo@@ di@@ es the lower or@@ ders have ? &quot; &quot; A@@ s if they were a re@@ pti@@ le ."
"A@@ n ima@@ ge is wor@@ th more than a thou@@ s@@ and words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few imag@@ es that I rec@@ ently cap@@ tured ."
"So by now , my talk is already 6@@ ,000 words long , and I feel like I should stop here ."
"What I am trying to do as a phot@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ er , as an ar@@ ti@@ st , is to bring the world of art and science together ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it is an ima@@ ge of a so@@ ap bubble cap@@ tured at the very moment where it &apos;s bur@@ st@@ ing , as you can see in this ima@@ ge , whether it &apos;s a universe made of tiny little be@@ a@@ ds of oil pa@@ int , strange li@@ qui@@ ds that be@@ have in very p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar ways , or pa@@ int that is mo@@ d@@ el@@ ed by cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al for@@ ces , I &apos;m always trying to l@@ ink those two fiel@@ ds together ."
"And yet , they do it in a very different way ."
Let me de@@ mon@@ st@@ rate this based on three pro@@ jects .
The first one has to do with making sound vi@@ sible .
"Now as you may know , sound tra@@ vel@@ s in wa@@ ves , so if you have a speak@@ er , a speak@@ er actually does nothing else than taking the au@@ di@@ o sig@@ nal , trans@@ form it into a vi@@ bra@@ tion , which is then tran@@ sp@@ or@@ ted through the air , is cap@@ tured by our ear , and trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed into an au@@ di@@ o sig@@ nal again ."
"Now I was thinking , how can I make those sound wa@@ ves vi@@ sible ?"
So I came up with the follo@@ wing se@@ tu@@ p .
"I took a speak@@ er , I pla@@ ced a thin f@@ oil of pla@@ stic on top of that speak@@ er , and then I ad@@ ded tiny little c@@ r@@ y@@ sta@@ ls on top of that speak@@ er ."
"And now , if I would pla@@ y a sound through that speak@@ er , it would cause the c@@ r@@ y@@ sta@@ ls to move up and down ."
"Now this happens very fa@@ st , in the bl@@ ink of an ey@@ e , so , together with L@@ G , we cap@@ tured this moti@@ on with a cam@@ era that is able to cap@@ ture more than 3@@ ,000 f@@ ram@@ es per second ."
Let me show you what this looks like .
( M@@ u@@ sic : &quot; &quot; T@@ ear@@ drop &quot; &quot; by M@@ as@@ sive A@@ t@@ ta@@ ck ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much .
"I ag@@ ree , it looks pretty ama@@ zing ."
But I have to tell you a fun@@ ny story .
I got an in@@ door sun@@ bur@@ n doing this while sho@@ ot@@ ing in Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es .
"Now in Lo@@ s A@@ ng@@ el@@ es , you could get a dec@@ ent sun@@ bur@@ n just on any of the be@@ a@@ ches , but I got m@@ ine in@@ do@@ ors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing at 3@@ ,000 f@@ ram@@ es per second , you need to have a si@@ lly amount of light , lots of li@@ ghts ."
"What was so fun@@ ny about it was that the speak@@ er was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the P@@ h@@ ant@@ om of the O@@ per@@ a for the rest of the week ."
Let me now turn to another project which inv@@ ol@@ ves less har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ stan@@ ces .
H@@ as any@@ one of you heard of fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ?
"A@@ h , some of you have . E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent ."
S@@ h@@ ould I s@@ ki@@ p that part ?
( Laughter ) F@@ er@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oi@@ ly con@@ sist@@ enc@@ y .
"And it &apos;s got tiny little particles of me@@ tal in it , which makes it magnetic ."
"So if I now put this li@@ qui@@ d into a magnetic field , it would change its ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance ."
Now I &apos;ve got a live de@@ mon@@ st@@ ration over here to show this to you .
"So I &apos;ve got a cam@@ era point@@ ing down at this pla@@ te , and under@@ ne@@ ath that pla@@ te , there is a magne@@ t ."
Now I &apos;m going to ad@@ d some of that fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id to that magne@@ t .
Let &apos;s just sli@@ ghtly move it to the right and maybe focu@@ s it a little bit more . E@@ x@@ cel@@ l@@ ent .
So what you can see now is that the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id has for@@ m@@ ed sp@@ ik@@ es .
Th@@ ose are just stan@@ dar@@ d wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors that you would pa@@ int with .
"So what happened now is , when the wat@@ er@@ col@@ or was flo@@ wing into the struc@@ ture , the wat@@ er@@ col@@ ors do not mi@@ x with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id ."
That &apos;s because the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id itself is hy@@ d@@ ro@@ pho@@ bic .
That means it doesn &apos;t mi@@ x with the water .
So that was the second project .
"Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?"
D@@ id he dr@@ ink half a bot@@ t@@ le of whi@@ sk@@ ey and then d@@ ra@@ w the hal@@ lu@@ ci@@ nation he got from being d@@ run@@ k on@@ to pap@@ er ?
"@@ Maybe you have experienc@@ ed some of those prop@@ er@@ ti@@ es before , but I am talking about the physical prop@@ er@@ ti@@ es , not the other ones ."
"So when I open the bot@@ t@@ le , the al@@ co@@ h@@ ol molecules would sp@@ read in the air , and that &apos;s because al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is a very v@@ o@@ la@@ ti@@ le sub@@ stance ."
"And at the same time , al@@ co@@ h@@ ol is high@@ ly fl@@ am@@ ma@@ ble ."
And it was with those two prop@@ er@@ ti@@ es that I was able to create the imag@@ es that you &apos;re see@@ ing right now .
Let me de@@ mon@@ st@@ rate this over here .
And what I have here is an emp@@ ty g@@ la@@ ss v@@ es@@ se@@ l .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
And now I &apos;m going to f@@ ill it with oxy@@ g@@ en and whi@@ sk@@ ey .
A@@ d@@ d some more .
Now we just wait for a few secon@@ ds for the molecules to sp@@ read inside the bot@@ t@@ le .
"It goes really fa@@ st , and it &apos;s not that im@@ pres@@ sive ."
"So the imag@@ es that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a fl@@ ame st@@ op@@ ped in time while it is tra@@ vel@@ ing through the bot@@ t@@ le , and you have to imagine it was f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed around 18@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es ."
So that &apos;s how those imag@@ es were made .
( Applause ) Thank you .
"So , I have now showed you three pro@@ jects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?"
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
I@@ s it just a wa@@ st@@ e of whi@@ sk@@ ey ?
"Th@@ ose three pro@@ jects , they &apos;re based on very simple scienti@@ fi@@ c phenomen@@ a , such as magne@@ tis@@ m , the sound wa@@ ves , or over here , the physical prop@@ er@@ ti@@ es of a sub@@ stance , and what I &apos;m trying to do is I &apos;m trying to use these phenomen@@ a and show them in a p@@ oe@@ tic and un@@ seen way , and ther@@ e@@ fore inv@@ ite the vie@@ wer to pa@@ use for a moment and think about all the beau@@ ty that is con@@ st@@ antly sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ding us ."
Thank you very much .

"O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time , at the age of 2@@ 4 , I was a student at S@@ t@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n &apos;s M@@ e@@ di@@ cal C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore ."
I was a g@@ ue@@ st student during one mon@@ th of a publi@@ c health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set forever .
"The course was good , but it was not the course con@@ t@@ ent in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set ."
"It was the b@@ ru@@ tal realiz@@ ation , the first morning , that the Indi@@ an students were better than me ."
"( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d ."
I loved sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs from a young age .
And I studi@@ ed very much in Swe@@ den .
I used to be in the u@@ pp@@ er quar@@ ter of all cour@@ ses I att@@ en@@ ded .
"But in S@@ t@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n &apos;s , I was in the lower quar@@ ter ."
And the fact was that Indi@@ an students studi@@ ed har@@ der than we did in Swe@@ den .
"They read the t@@ ex@@ t@@ book twi@@ ce , or three times or four times ."
In Swe@@ den we read it once and then we went par@@ t@@ ying .
"( L@@ au@@ gh@@ er ) And that , to me , that perso@@ nal experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I gre@@ w up with was changed ."
And I realiz@@ ed that perhaps the W@@ est@@ ern world will not contin@@ ue to d@@ omi@@ nate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of perso@@ nal experience .
It &apos;s that realiz@@ ation of someone you me@@ et that really made you change your ideas about the world .
"It &apos;s not the sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs , al@@ though I tried to make it fun@@ ny ."
"And I will now , here , on@@ sta@@ ge , try to predic@@ t when that will happen — that A@@ sia will re@@ g@@ ain its dom@@ in@@ ant position as the lead@@ ing part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years ."
"And I will do that by trying to predic@@ t preci@@ sel@@ y at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will reach that of the W@@ est ."
"And I don &apos;t mean the whole econ@@ omy , because to grow an econ@@ omy of India to the size of U.@@ K@@ . — that &apos;s a piece of c@@ ake , with one billion people ."
"But I want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per mon@@ th , in India and China , when will that have rea@@ ched that of U.@@ K@@ . and the United States ?"
But I will start with a hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal ba@@ ck@@ ground .
And you can see my map if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 1858 .
1858 was a year of great techno@@ logical adv@@ an@@ c@@ ement in the W@@ est .
"That was the year when Q@@ ue@@ en Vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ a was able , for the first time , to comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate with P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an , through the T@@ ran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic T@@ el@@ e@@ gra@@ phi@@ c C@@ able ."
And they were the first to &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter &quot; &quot; tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ ti@@ cally .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful Google and Internet , to find the t@@ ex@@ t of the tel@@ e@@ gra@@ m sent back from P@@ re@@ si@@ dent B@@ u@@ chan@@ an to Q@@ ue@@ en Vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ a ."
"And it ends like this : &quot; &quot; This tel@@ e@@ graph is a f@@ anta@@ stic in@@ stru@@ ment to di@@ ff@@ use religi@@ on , civi@@ li@@ zation , liber@@ ty and la@@ w throu@@ gh@@ out the world . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ose are ni@@ ce words . But I got sort of cu@@ ri@@ ous of what he me@@ ant with liber@@ ty , and liber@@ ty for wh@@ om ."
And we will think about that when we look at the wi@@ der picture of the world in 1858 .
Because 1858 was also wat@@ er@@ shed year in the history of A@@ sia .
1858 was the year when the coura@@ ge@@ ous up@@ ri@@ sing against the fore@@ ig@@ n oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion of India was de@@ fe@@ ated by the B@@ riti@@ sh for@@ ces .
And India was up to 8@@ 9 years more of fore@@ ig@@ n d@@ omi@@ nation .
1858 in China was the vi@@ ct@@ ory in the O@@ pi@@ um War by the B@@ riti@@ sh for@@ ces .
"And that me@@ ant that fore@@ ig@@ n@@ ers , as it said in the treat@@ y , were allowed to tra@@ de fre@@ ely in China ."
It me@@ ant pa@@ ying with op@@ i@@ um for Ch@@ ine@@ se go@@ o@@ ds .
And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sig@@ n the H@@ ar@@ ris T@@ re@@ at@@ y and ac@@ cept tra@@ de on fav@@ o@@ ra@@ ble con@@ dition for the U.S.
"And they were thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by those black shi@@ ps there , that had been in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o har@@ b@@ or over the last year ."
"But , Japan , in con@@ tra@@ st to India and China , main@@ ta@@ ined its national so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ nt@@ y ."
And let &apos;s see how much difference that can make .
"And I will do that by bri@@ ng@@ ing these bub@@ b@@ les back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country ."
The size of the bubble here is the population .
"O@@ n this a@@ x@@ is , as I used to have income per person in com@@ pa@@ ra@@ ble dol@@ lar ."
"And on that a@@ x@@ is I have life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y , the health of people ."
And I also bring an in@@ nov@@ ation here .
"I have trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed the la@@ ser be@@ am into an ec@@ o@@ logical , rec@@ y@@ cla@@ ble ver@@ sion here , in gre@@ en India ."
"( Applause ) And we will see , you know ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok here , 1858 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom was rich@@ er over there ."
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
"A@@ c@@ tually if we go back into the hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal rec@@ or@@ d , there was a time hund@@ re@@ ds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even ab@@ ove that of Eu@@ ro@@ pe ."
"But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of fore@@ ig@@ n d@@ omi@@ nation , and India had been de@@ -@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed ."
And you can see that the countries who were gro@@ wing their econ@@ omy was United States and United K@@ ing@@ dom .
"And they were also , by the end of the century , getting heal@@ thy , and Japan was starting to cat@@ ch up ."
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it star@@ ts to move there ?
"But really , really natural so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ nt@@ y was good for Japan ."
And Japan is trying to move up there .
"And it &apos;s the new century now . H@@ e@@ al@@ th is getting better , United K@@ ing@@ dom , United States ."
But care@@ ful now — we are appro@@ a@@ ching the F@@ irst World War .
"And the F@@ irst World War , you know , we &apos;ll see a lot of de@@ a@@ ths and economi@@ cal problems here ."
United K@@ ing@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the S@@ pan@@ ish f@@ lu also .
"And then after the F@@ irst World War , they contin@@ ue up ."
"S@@ ti@@ ll under fore@@ ig@@ n d@@ omi@@ nation , and without so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ nt@@ y , India and China are down in the cor@@ ner ."
Not much has happened .
They have gro@@ wn their population but not much more .
"In the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that Japan is going to a per@@ i@@ od of war , with lower life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y ."
"And the S@@ econ@@ d World War was really a ter@@ ri@@ ble ev@@ ent , also economi@@ cally for Japan ."
But they did re@@ co@@ ver quite fa@@ st af@@ ter@@ wards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 19@@ 4@@ 7 India finally ga@@ ined its in@@ depen@@ dence .
"And they could rai@@ se the Indi@@ an f@@ la@@ g and become a so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ n nation , but in very big difficul@@ ti@@ es down there ."
( Applause ) In 19@@ 4@@ 9 we saw the emer@@ g@@ ence of the modern China in a way which surpri@@ sed the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after in@@ depen@@ dence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Ch@@ il@@ dren started to go to school .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th ser@@ vi@@ ces were pro@@ vi@@ ded .
"This is the G@@ re@@ at L@@ ea@@ p F@@ or@@ ward , when China f@@ ell down ."
It was cent@@ ral plan@@ ning by M@@ ao T@@ se T@@ un@@ g .
"@@ China re@@ co@@ vered . Th@@ en they said , &quot; Ne@@ ver@@ more , stu@@ pi@@ d cent@@ ral plan@@ ning . &quot;"
"But they went up here , and India was trying to fol@@ low ."
And they were cat@@ ching up in@@ de@@ ed .
"And both countries had the better health , but still a very low econ@@ omy ."
"And we came to 19@@ 7@@ 8 , and M@@ ao T@@ se T@@ un@@ g di@@ ed , and a new guy turned up from the left ."
And it was D@@ eng X@@ i@@ a@@ op@@ ing coming out here .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t matter if a c@@ at is white or black , as long as it cat@@ ches mi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; Because cat@@ ching mi@@ ce is what the two cat@@ s wanted to do ."
"And you can see the two cat@@ s being here , China and India , want@@ ing to cat@@ ch the mi@@ ces over there , you know ."
"And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their econ@@ omy ."
And the market re@@ for@@ mer was successful there .
In &apos; 9@@ 2 India follo@@ ws with a market re@@ form .
"And they go quite cl@@ os@@ ely together , and you can see that the si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are great@@ er than the differences with them ."
And here they mar@@ ch on . And will they cat@@ ch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the — ( Applause ) the a@@ ver@@ ag@@ es there — this is the average of China .
"If I would sp@@ l@@ it China , look here , S@@ h@@ ang@@ hai has already cat@@ ched up ."
S@@ h@@ ang@@ hai is already there .
And it &apos;s heal@@ thi@@ er than the United States .
"But on the other hand , G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou , one of the poorest in@@ land pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces of China , is there ."
"And if I sp@@ l@@ it G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou into ur@@ b@@ an and ru@@ ral , the ru@@ ral part of G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou goes down there ."
"You see this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous inequ@@ ity in China , in the mi@@ d@@ st of fa@@ st economic growth ."
"And if I would also look at India , you have another ty@@ pe of inequ@@ ity , actually , in India ."
"The ge@@ o@@ gra@@ phi@@ cal , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ gra@@ phi@@ cal difference is not so big ."
"@@ U@@ t@@ ta@@ r P@@ ra@@ de@@ sh , the bi@@ ggest of the states here , is poo@@ re@@ r and has a lower health than the rest of India ."
"@@ K@@ er@@ al@@ a is fl@@ ying on top there , mat@@ ching United States in health , but not in econ@@ omy ."
"And here , Ma@@ ha@@ ra@@ sh@@ tra , with M@@ u@@ mb@@ ai , is for@@ g@@ ing for@@ ward ."
"Now in India , the big inequ@@ ities are within the state , rather than between the states ."
"And that is not a bad thing , in itself ."
"If you have a lot inequ@@ ity , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ gra@@ phi@@ cal inequ@@ ities can be more difficult in the long ter@@ m to de@@ al with , than if it is in the same are@@ a where you have a growth center relati@@ vely cl@@ ose to where poor people are li@@ ving ."
"@@ No , there is one more inequ@@ ity . Lo@@ ok there , United States ."
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , they brok@@ e my f@@ r@@ ame ."
"W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ . went out here ."
M@@ y friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new lead@@ er in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton who is really con@@ cer@@ ned about the health system .
"And I can understand him , because W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ .@@ C@@ ."
is so rich over there but they are not as heal@@ thy as K@@ er@@ al@@ a .
"It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?"
"( Applause ) I can see a bu@@ siness op@@ port@@ un@@ ity for K@@ er@@ al@@ a , hel@@ ping fi@@ x the health system in the United States ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the le@@ g@@ end down there .
"And when you see the two gi@@ ant cat@@ s here , pu@@ shing for@@ ward , you see that in between them and a@@ head of them , is the whole emer@@ g@@ ing economi@@ es of the world , which Th@@ o@@ ma@@ s F@@ ri@@ ed@@ man so cor@@ rec@@ tly called the &quot; &quot; f@@ la@@ t world . &quot; &quot; You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is put@@ ting for@@ ward , but in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , and other parts , as in ru@@ ral G@@ u@@ iz@@ h@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low econ@@ omy ."
We have an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous di@@ sp@@ ar@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are pu@@ shing for@@ wards very fa@@ st .
"Now , back to my pro@@ jec@@ tions ."
Wh@@ en will it cat@@ ch up ? I have to go back to very con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal graph .
"I will show income per person on this a@@ x@@ is instead , poor down here , rich up there ."
"And then time here , from 1858 I start the world ."
And we sha@@ ll see what will happen with these countries .
"You see , China under fore@@ ig@@ n d@@ omi@@ nation actually lo@@ wer@@ ed their income and came down to the Indi@@ an level here ."
Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as U.@@ K@@ . and United States is getting rich@@ er and rich@@ er .
"And after S@@ econ@@ d World War , United States is rich@@ er than U.@@ K@@ ."
But in@@ depen@@ dence is coming here .
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wth is starting , economic re@@ form ."
"@@ G@@ ro@@ wth is fa@@ ster , and with pro@@ jec@@ tion from I@@ M@@ F you can see where you exp@@ ect them to be in 20@@ 14 ."
"Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en will the cat@@ ch up take place ? &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok at , look at the United States ."
Can you see the bubble ?
"The bub@@ b@@ les , not my bub@@ b@@ les , but the fin@@ an@@ cial bub@@ b@@ les ."
That &apos;s the d@@ ot co@@ m bubble . This is the L@@ e@@ h@@ man B@@ ro@@ thers do@@ or@@ step there .
You see it came down there .
"And it seems this is another ro@@ ck coming down there , you know ."
"So they doesn &apos;t seem to go this way , these countries ."
"They seem to go in a more hu@@ m@@ ble growth way , you know ."
And people interest@@ ed in growth are tur@@ ning their ey@@ es to@@ wards A@@ sia .
I can comp@@ are to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
"You see , Japan did it like that ."
We ad@@ d Japan to it .
And there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that fa@@ st cat@@ ch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
"@@ Japan did it like this , until fu@@ ll cat@@ ch up , and then they fol@@ low with the other high@@ -@@ income economi@@ es ."
"But the real pro@@ jec@@ tions for those ones , I would like to give it like this ."
"C@@ an be worse , can be better ."
"It &apos;s always difficult to predic@@ t , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally about the future ."
"Now , a hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predic@@ t about the past ."
( Laughter ) I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
"I@@ ne@@ qu@@ al@@ ities in China and India I con@@ sider really the big ob@@ sta@@ cle because to bring the enti@@ re population into growth and p@@ ros@@ per@@ ity is what will create a domestic market , what will av@@ oi@@ d social in@@ sta@@ bility , and which will make use of the enti@@ re cap@@ ac@@ ity of the population ."
"So , social inv@@ est@@ ments in health , education and inf@@ ra@@ struc@@ ture , and electri@@ city is really what is needed in India and China ."
"You know the cli@@ mate . We have great inter@@ national exper@@ ts within India telling us that the cli@@ mate is chang@@ ing , and ac@@ tions has to be taken , o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se China and India would be the countries most to su@@ ff@@ er from cli@@ mate change ."
And I con@@ sider India and China the best par@@ tn@@ ers in the world in a good global cli@@ mate po@@ lic@@ y .
"But they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ g@@ ely created , and I can ag@@ ree on that ."
But what I &apos;m really wor@@ ried about is war .
"W@@ ill the for@@ mer rich countries really ac@@ cept a completely changed world econ@@ omy , and a shi@@ ft of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to A@@ sia ?"
"And will A@@ sia be able to han@@ d@@ le that new position of being in char@@ ge of being the most mi@@ gh@@ ty , and the gover@@ n@@ ors of the world ?"
"So , always av@@ oi@@ d war , because that always pu@@ sh@@ es human beings ba@@ ck@@ ward ."
"Now if these inequ@@ al@@ ities , cli@@ mate and war can be av@@ oi@@ ded , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening ."
"And that vision that I got as a young student , 19@@ 7@@ 2 , that Indi@@ ans can be much better than Swe@@ des , is just about to happen ."
"And it will happen preci@@ sel@@ y the year 20@@ 4@@ 8 in the later part of the sum@@ mer , in Ju@@ ly , more preci@@ sel@@ y , the 2@@ 7@@ th of Ju@@ ly ."
"( Applause ) The 2@@ 7@@ th of Ju@@ ly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 10@@ 0@@ th bir@@ th@@ day ."
( Laughter ) And I exp@@ ect to speak in the first se@@ s@@ sion of the 3@@ 9@@ th TED India .
G@@ et your bo@@ ok@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"H@@ i . So , this cha@@ p here , he thin@@ ks he can tell you the future ."
"H@@ is na@@ me is N@@ os@@ tra@@ dam@@ us , al@@ though here the Sun have made him look a little bit like S@@ e@@ an Con@@ n@@ ery . ( Laughter ) And like most of you , I su@@ sp@@ ect , I don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future ."
"I don &apos;t believe in pre@@ cognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predic@@ t something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a f@@ luk@@ e , and we only hear about the f@@ luk@@ es and about the fre@@ ak@@ s ."
We don &apos;t hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong .
"Now we exp@@ ect that to happen with si@@ lly stories about pre@@ cognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in acade@@ mi@@ a and in medicine , and in this environment , it cos@@ ts lives ."
"So fi@@ r@@ st@@ ly , thinking just about pre@@ cognition , as it turns out , just last year a resear@@ ch@@ er called D@@ ar@@ y@@ l B@@ e@@ m conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of pre@@ cogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers in under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students , and this was published in a pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic jour@@ nal and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , well , fai@@ r enough , but I think that &apos;s a f@@ luk@@ e , that &apos;s a f@@ rea@@ k , because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that under@@ gra@@ du@@ ate students had pre@@ cogn@@ itive po@@ w@@ ers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a jour@@ nal ."
"And in fact , we know that that &apos;s true , because se@@ ver@@ al different groups of research scienti@@ sts tried to re@@ plic@@ ate the fin@@ di@@ ngs of this pre@@ cognition study , and when they sub@@ m@@ itt@@ ed it to the ex@@ act same jour@@ nal , the jour@@ nal said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;re not interest@@ ed in publi@@ shing re@@ plic@@ ation . We &apos;re not interest@@ ed in your neg@@ ative data . &quot; &quot; So this is already evidence of how , in the acade@@ mic liter@@ ature , we will see a bi@@ as@@ ed sam@@ ple of the true picture of all of the scienti@@ fi@@ c studies that have been conducted ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the d@@ ry acade@@ mic field of psycho@@ logy .
"It also happens in , for example , can@@ cer research ."
"So in Mar@@ ch , 20@@ 12 , just one mon@@ th ago , some resear@@ chers re@@ por@@ ted in the jour@@ nal N@@ ature how they had tried to re@@ plic@@ ate 5@@ 3 different basic science studies looking at potenti@@ al treat@@ ment tar@@ gets in can@@ cer , and out of those 5@@ 3 studies , they were only able to success@@ fully re@@ plic@@ ate six ."
F@@ or@@ ty@@ -@@ seven out of those 5@@ 3 were un@@ re@@ plic@@ able .
And they say in their dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion that this is very lik@@ ely because fre@@ ak@@ s get published .
"P@@ eople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the o@@ cc@@ a@@ sions when it works they will publi@@ sh , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t ."
"And their first re@@ com@@ men@@ dation of how to fi@@ x this problem , because it is a problem , because it sen@@ ds us all down bl@@ ind al@@ le@@ ys , their first re@@ com@@ men@@ dation of how to fi@@ x this problem is to make it ea@@ si@@ er to publi@@ sh neg@@ ative results in science , and to change the in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves so that scienti@@ sts are en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed to p@@ ost more of their neg@@ ative results in publi@@ c ."
But it doesn &apos;t just happen in the very d@@ ry world of pre@@ cl@@ ini@@ cal basic science can@@ cer research .
"It also happens in the very real , f@@ le@@ sh and blo@@ od of acade@@ mic medicine . So in 198@@ 0 , some resear@@ chers did a study on a drug called l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and this was an anti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic drug , a drug that supp@@ re@@ s@@ ses ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart atta@@ ck , they &apos;re quite lik@@ ely to have ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , so if we give them a drug that supp@@ re@@ s@@ ses ab@@ nor@@ mal heart r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , this will increase the chan@@ ces of them survi@@ ving ."
"@@ Ear@@ ly on its develop@@ ment , they did a very small tri@@ al , just under a hundred patients ."
"F@@ i@@ f@@ ty patients got l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de , and of those patients , 10 di@@ ed ."
"A@@ no@@ ther 50 patients got a du@@ m@@ my pla@@ c@@ eb@@ o su@@ ga@@ r p@@ ill with no ac@@ tive ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent , and only one of them di@@ ed ."
"So they ri@@ ghtly re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded this drug as a fai@@ lu@@ re , and its comm@@ er@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , and because its comm@@ er@@ cial develop@@ ment was st@@ op@@ ped , this tri@@ al was never published ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other compan@@ ies had the same idea about dru@@ gs that would pre@@ v@@ ent ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart atta@@ cks ."
"@@ These dru@@ gs were brought to market . They were pre@@ scri@@ bed very wi@@ d@@ ely because heart atta@@ cks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these dru@@ gs also cau@@ sed an increas@@ ed rate of death that before we det@@ ected that sa@@ f@@ ety sig@@ nal , over 10@@ 0,000 people di@@ ed un@@ nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly in America from the pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion of anti@@ -@@ ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic dru@@ gs ."
"Now actually , in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the resear@@ chers who did that 198@@ 0 study , that early study , published a me@@ a cul@@ p@@ a , an ap@@ o@@ logy to the scienti@@ fi@@ c commun@@ ity , in which they said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en we car@@ ried out our study in 198@@ 0 , we thought that the increas@@ ed death rate that oc@@ cur@@ red in the l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de group was an eff@@ ect of chan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; The develop@@ ment of l@@ or@@ ca@@ ini@@ de was ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed for comm@@ er@@ cial reas@@ ons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publi@@ c@@ ation bi@@ as ."
"That &apos;s the te@@ chni@@ cal ter@@ m for the phenomen@@ on where un@@ f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ing data gets lost , gets un@@ published , is left mis@@ sing in action , and they say the results descri@@ bed here &quot; might have pro@@ vi@@ ded an early war@@ ning of tr@@ ou@@ ble a@@ head . &quot;"
Now these are stories from basic science .
"@@ These are stories from 20 , 30 years ago ."
The acade@@ mic publi@@ shing environment is very different now .
"There are acade@@ mic jour@@ nals like &quot; &quot; T@@ ri@@ als , &quot; &quot; the open ac@@ c@@ ess jour@@ nal , which will publi@@ sh any tri@@ al conducted in humans re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of whether it has a positive or a neg@@ ative resul@@ t ."
But this problem of neg@@ ative results that go mis@@ sing in action is still very pre@@ val@@ ent . In fact it &apos;s so pre@@ val@@ ent that it c@@ ut@@ s to the c@@ ore of evi@@ d@@ enc@@ e-@@ based medicine .
"So this is a drug called re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine , and this is a drug that I myself have pre@@ scri@@ bed . It &apos;s an anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ant ."
"And I &apos;m a very ner@@ dy doc@@ tor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug . I read the one study that was published that showed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was better than pla@@ c@@ eb@@ o , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was just as good as any other anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ant , and because this pati@@ ent ha@@ dn &apos;t done well on those other anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants , I thought , well , re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try ."
"But it turned out that I was mis@@ led . In fact , seven trials were conducted com@@ par@@ ing re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine against a du@@ m@@ my pla@@ c@@ eb@@ o su@@ ga@@ r p@@ ill . One of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were neg@@ ative and they were left un@@ published ."
"Th@@ ree trials were published com@@ par@@ ing re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine against other anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants in which re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients &apos; wor@@ th of data was col@@ lec@@ ted which showed that re@@ bo@@ x@@ et@@ ine was worse than those other treat@@ ments , and those trials were not published ."
I f@@ el@@ t mis@@ led .
"Now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extre@@ m@@ ely un@@ u@@ su@@ al example , and I wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of ch@@ er@@ r@@ y-@@ pic@@ king and sel@@ ec@@ tive re@@ fer@@ enc@@ ing that I &apos;m accu@@ sing other people of ."
"But it turns out that this phenomen@@ on of publi@@ c@@ ation bi@@ as has actually been very , very well studi@@ ed ."
So here is one example of how you approach it .
"The cla@@ s@@ sic mo@@ de@@ l is , you get a bun@@ ch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conducted and complet@@ ed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published any@@ where in the acade@@ mic liter@@ ature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants that were appro@@ ved over a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ year per@@ i@@ od by the F@@ D@@ A ."
They took all of the trials which were sub@@ m@@ itt@@ ed to the F@@ D@@ A as part of the appro@@ val pa@@ c@@ ka@@ ge .
"So that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these dru@@ gs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing au@@ th@@ ori@@ zation ."
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic liter@@ ature . And this is what they found .
"It was pretty much a 5@@ 0@@ -@@ 50 sp@@ l@@ it . H@@ al@@ f of these trials were positive , half of them were neg@@ ative , in reality ."
"But when they went to look for these trials in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic liter@@ ature , what they found was a very different picture ."
"O@@ n@@ ly three of the neg@@ ative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published ."
"Now if we just f@@ li@@ ck back and for@@ th between those two , you can see what a sta@@ gg@@ ering difference there was between reality and what do@@ ct@@ ors , patients , com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers of health ser@@ vi@@ ces , and acade@@ mi@@ cs were able to see in the pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ vie@@ wed acade@@ mic liter@@ ature ."
"We were mis@@ led , and this is a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic f@@ la@@ w in the c@@ ore of medicine ."
"In fact , there have been so many studies conducted on publi@@ c@@ ation bi@@ as now , over a hundred , that they &apos;ve been col@@ lec@@ ted in a sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ view , published in 20@@ 10 , that took every single study on publi@@ c@@ ation bi@@ as that they could find ."
P@@ u@@ bli@@ c@@ ation bi@@ as aff@@ ec@@ ts every field of medicine .
"A@@ b@@ out half of all trials , on average , go mis@@ sing in action , and we know that positive fin@@ di@@ ngs are around twi@@ ce as lik@@ ely to be published as neg@@ ative fin@@ di@@ ngs ."
This is a can@@ cer at the c@@ ore of evi@@ d@@ enc@@ e-@@ based medicine .
"If I f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed a co@@ in 100 times but then with@@ hel@@ d the results from you from half of those t@@ os@@ ses , I could make it look as if I had a co@@ in that always came up he@@ a@@ ds ."
But that wouldn &apos;t mean that I had a t@@ wo@@ -@@ he@@ ad@@ ed co@@ in .
That would mean that I was a chan@@ cer and you were an i@@ di@@ ot for l@@ etting me get away with it . ( Laughter ) But this is exactly what we bl@@ in@@ dly t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate in the whole of evi@@ d@@ enc@@ e-@@ based medicine .
"And to me , this is research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"If I conducted one study and I with@@ hel@@ d half of the data point@@ s from that one study , you would ri@@ ghtly accu@@ se me , essentially , of research f@@ ra@@ u@@ d ."
"And yet , for some reason , if somebody conduc@@ ts 10 studies but only publi@@ sh@@ es the five that give the resul@@ t that they want , we don &apos;t con@@ sider that to be research mis@@ conduc@@ t ."
"And when that respon@@ si@@ bility is di@@ ff@@ used between a whole n@@ et@@ work of resear@@ chers , acade@@ mi@@ cs , in@@ du@@ st@@ ry sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors , jour@@ nal e@@ dit@@ ors , for some reason we find it more ac@@ cep@@ table , but the eff@@ ect on patients is dam@@ ning ."
"And this is happening right now , today ."
"This is a drug called T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu . T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu is a drug which gover@@ nm@@ ents around the world have spent bil@@ lions and bil@@ lions of dollars on st@@ o@@ ck@@ p@@ il@@ ing , and we &apos;ve st@@ o@@ ck@@ p@@ il@@ ed T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu in pan@@ ic , in the belie@@ f that it will re@@ duce the rate of comp@@ lic@@ ations of in@@ flu@@ en@@ za ."
"C@@ om@@ plic@@ ations is a medi@@ cal e@@ u@@ ph@@ e@@ mis@@ m for p@@ ne@@ u@@ mon@@ ia and death . ( Laughter ) Now when the C@@ o@@ ch@@ ran@@ e sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic re@@ vie@@ w@@ ers were trying to col@@ l@@ ect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether T@@ ami@@ f@@ lu actually did this or not , they found that se@@ ver@@ al of those trials were un@@ published ."
The results were u@@ na@@ v@@ ai@@ la@@ ble to them .
"And when they started ob@@ ta@@ ining the writ@@ e@@ up@@ s of those trials through vari@@ ous different means , through F@@ re@@ e@@ dom of In@@ formation A@@ ct re@@ qu@@ est@@ s , through ha@@ ra@@ s@@ sing vari@@ ous different organiz@@ ations , what they found was in@@ con@@ sist@@ ent ."
"And when they tried to get a hold of the cl@@ ini@@ cal study re@@ por@@ ts , the 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ pa@@ ge long do@@ cu@@ ments that have the best possible ren@@ dition of the information , they were told they wer@@ en &apos;t allowed to have them ."
"And if you want to read the fu@@ ll cor@@ respon@@ dence and the ex@@ cu@@ ses and the ex@@ plan@@ ations given by the drug compan@@ y , you can see that w@@ r@@ itt@@ en up in this week &apos;s ed@@ ition of P@@ L@@ O@@ S M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine ."
"And the most sta@@ gg@@ ering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recogni@@ ze that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to su@@ ff@@ er f@@ ake fi@@ x@@ es ."
We &apos;ve had people pret@@ end that this is a problem that &apos;s been fi@@ x@@ ed .
"F@@ irst of all , we had trials regi@@ st@@ ers , and everybody said , o@@ h , it &apos;s ok@@ ay . We &apos;ll get everyone to regi@@ ster their trials , they &apos;ll p@@ ost the prot@@ oc@@ ol , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then af@@ ter@@ wards we &apos;ll be able to ch@@ ec@@ k and see if all the trials which have been conducted and complet@@ ed have been published ."
But people didn &apos;t b@@ other to use those regi@@ st@@ ers .
"And so then the Inter@@ national C@@ om@@ m@@ itt@@ e@@ e of M@@ e@@ di@@ cal J@@ our@@ nal E@@ dit@@ ors came along , and they said , o@@ h , well , we will hold the line ."
"We won &apos;t publi@@ sh any jour@@ nals , we won &apos;t publi@@ sh any trials , un@@ less they &apos;ve been regi@@ st@@ ered before they beg@@ an ."
"But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 200@@ 8 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by jour@@ nals e@@ dit@@ ed by mem@@ b@@ ers of the I@@ C@@ M@@ J@@ E wer@@ en &apos;t prop@@ er@@ ly regi@@ st@@ ered , and a quar@@ ter of them wer@@ en &apos;t regi@@ st@@ ered at all ."
"And then finally , the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct was pas@@ sed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conduc@@ ts a tri@@ al must p@@ ost the results of that tri@@ al within one year ."
"And in the B@@ M@@ J , in the first ed@@ ition of J@@ an@@ uar@@ y , 20@@ 12 , you can see a study which looks to see if people k@@ ep@@ t to that ru@@ ling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so ."
This is a di@@ sa@@ ster .
We cannot know the true eff@@ ec@@ ts of the medic@@ in@@ es that we pre@@ scri@@ be if we do not have ac@@ c@@ ess to all of the information .
And this is not a difficult problem to fi@@ x .
"We need to force people to publi@@ sh all trials conducted in humans , inclu@@ ding the older trials , because the F@@ D@@ A A@@ men@@ d@@ ment A@@ ct only as@@ ks that you publi@@ sh the trials conducted after 200@@ 8 , and I don &apos;t know what world it is in which we &apos;re only p@@ rac@@ ti@@ c@@ ing medicine on the ba@@ sis of trials that complet@@ ed in the past two years ."
"We need to publi@@ sh all trials in humans , inclu@@ ding the older trials , for all dru@@ gs in curr@@ ent use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fi@@ x@@ ed ."
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
P@@ u@@ ll the k@@ not .
The phenomen@@ on you saw here for a bri@@ e@@ f moment is called quantum lev@@ itation and quantum lo@@ cking .
And the ob@@ ject that was lev@@ it@@ ating here is called a superconductor .
"@@ Su@@ per@@ conduc@@ ti@@ vity is a quantum state of matter , and it oc@@ cur@@ s only b@@ el@@ ow a certain c@@ riti@@ cal tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"Now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomen@@ on ; it was disco@@ vered 100 years ago ."
"H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , only rec@@ ently , due to se@@ ver@@ al techno@@ logical adv@@ an@@ c@@ ements , we are now able to de@@ mon@@ st@@ rate to you quantum lev@@ itation and quantum lo@@ cking ."
"So , a superconductor is defin@@ ed by two prop@@ er@@ ti@@ es ."
"The first is z@@ ero electri@@ cal re@@ si@@ stance , and the second is the ex@@ pul@@ sion of a magnetic field from the int@@ eri@@ or of the superconductor ."
"That s@@ oun@@ ds comp@@ lic@@ ated , right ?"
But what is electri@@ cal re@@ si@@ stance ?
"So , electri@@ city is the flow of electr@@ ons inside a material ."
"And these electr@@ ons , while flo@@ wing , they col@@ li@@ de with the atoms , and in these col@@ li@@ sions they l@@ ose a certain amount of energy ."
"And they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate this energy in the form of he@@ at , and you know that eff@@ ect ."
"H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , inside a superconductor there are no col@@ li@@ sions , so there is no energy dis@@ si@@ pa@@ tion ."
It &apos;s quite re@@ mark@@ able . Th@@ ink about it .
"In cla@@ ssi@@ cal physics , there is always some fri@@ ction , some energy l@@ os@@ s ."
"But not here , because it is a quantum eff@@ ect ."
"But that &apos;s not all , because superconduc@@ tors don &apos;t like magnetic fiel@@ ds ."
"So a superconductor will try to ex@@ pe@@ l magnetic field from the inside , and it has the means to do that by circu@@ la@@ ting curr@@ ents ."
"Now , the com@@ bi@@ nation of both eff@@ ec@@ ts — the ex@@ pul@@ sion of magnetic fiel@@ ds and z@@ ero electri@@ cal re@@ si@@ stance — is exactly a superconductor ."
"But the picture isn &apos;t always perf@@ ect , as we all know , and some@@ times st@@ ran@@ ds of magnetic field re@@ main inside the superconductor ."
"Now , under prop@@ er conditions , which we have here , these st@@ ran@@ ds of magnetic field can be t@@ rapp@@ ed inside the superconductor ."
"And these st@@ ran@@ ds of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te qu@@ ant@@ ities ."
Why ? Because it is a quantum phenomen@@ on . It &apos;s quantum physics .
And it turns out that they be@@ have like quantum particles .
"In this mo@@ vi@@ e here , you can see how they flow one by one dis@@ cre@@ t@@ ely ."
"This is st@@ ran@@ ds of magnetic field . These are not particles , but they be@@ have like particles ."
"So , this is why we call this eff@@ ect quantum lev@@ itation and quantum lo@@ cking ."
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
"Well , first there are st@@ ran@@ ds of magnetic field left inside , but now the superconductor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their mov@@ ements dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which b@@ re@@ ak@@ s the superconduc@@ ti@@ vity state ."
"So what it actually does , it lo@@ cks these st@@ ran@@ ds , which are called flu@@ x@@ ons , and it lo@@ cks these flu@@ x@@ ons in place ."
"And by doing that , what it actually does is lo@@ cking itself in place ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their con@@ figu@@ ration ."
So we get quantum lo@@ cking . And let me show you how this works .
"I have here a superconductor , which I w@@ rapp@@ ed up so it &apos;d sta@@ y co@@ ld long enough ."
"And when I place it on top of a re@@ gu@@ lar magne@@ t , it just sta@@ ys lo@@ cked in mi@@ dai@@ r ."
"( Applause ) Now , this is not just lev@@ itation . It &apos;s not just re@@ pul@@ sion ."
"I can re@@ ar@@ range the flu@@ x@@ ons , and it will be lo@@ cked in this new con@@ figu@@ ration ."
"@@ L@@ ik@@ e this , or move it sli@@ ghtly to the right or to the left ."
"So , this is quantum lo@@ cking — actually lo@@ cking — thre@@ e-@@ dimen@@ sional lo@@ cking of the superconductor ."
"O@@ f course , I can turn it up@@ side down , and it will re@@ main lo@@ cked ."
"Now , now that we understand that this so@@ -@@ called lev@@ itation is actually lo@@ cking , Y@@ eah , we understand that ."
"You won &apos;t be surpri@@ sed to hear that if I take this circu@@ lar magne@@ t , in which the magnetic field is the same all around , the superconductor will be able to fre@@ ely ro@@ tat@@ e around the a@@ x@@ is of the magne@@ t ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because as long as it ro@@ tates , the lo@@ cking is main@@ ta@@ ined ."
You see ? I can ad@@ just and I can ro@@ tat@@ e the superconductor .
"We have fri@@ cti@@ on@@ less moti@@ on . It is still lev@@ it@@ ating , but can move fre@@ ely all around ."
"So , we have quantum lo@@ cking and we can lev@@ it@@ ate it on top of this magne@@ t ."
"But how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many magnetic st@@ ran@@ ds are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?"
"Well , we can cal@@ cu@@ late it , and it turns out , quite a lot ."
One hundred billion st@@ ran@@ ds of magnetic field inside this thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch dis@@ k .
"But that &apos;s not the ama@@ zing part yet , because there is something I ha@@ ven &apos;t told you yet ."
"And , y@@ eah , the ama@@ zing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a mi@@ c@@ ron thi@@ ck . It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely thin ."
"And this extre@@ m@@ ely thin lay@@ er is able to lev@@ it@@ ate more than 7@@ 0,000 times its own we@@ ight ."
It &apos;s a re@@ mark@@ able eff@@ ect . It &apos;s very strong .
"Now , I can ex@@ t@@ end this circu@@ lar magne@@ t , and make w@@ hat@@ ever tra@@ ck I want ."
"For example , I can make a large circu@@ lar rai@@ l here ."
"And when I place the superconduc@@ ting dis@@ k on top of this rai@@ l , it mo@@ ves fre@@ ely ."
"( Applause ) And again , that &apos;s not all . I can ad@@ just its position like this , and ro@@ tat@@ e , and it fre@@ ely mo@@ ves in this new position ."
And I can even try a new thing ; let &apos;s try it for the first time .
"I can take this dis@@ k and put it here , and while it sta@@ ys here — don &apos;t move — I will try to ro@@ tat@@ e the tra@@ ck , and h@@ op@@ e@@ fully , if I did it cor@@ rec@@ tly , it sta@@ ys su@@ sp@@ en@@ ded ."
"( Applause ) You see , it &apos;s quantum lo@@ cking , not lev@@ itation ."
"Now , while I &apos;ll let it circu@@ late for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconduc@@ tors ."
"Now — ( Laughter ) — So we now know that we are able to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount of curr@@ ents inside superconduc@@ tors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fiel@@ ds , such as needed in M@@ R@@ I ma@@ chin@@ es , partic@@ le ac@@ cel@@ er@@ at@@ ors and so on ."
"But we can also st@@ ore energy using superconduc@@ tors , because we have no dis@@ si@@ pa@@ tion ."
"And we could also produce power c@@ ab@@ les , to trans@@ f@@ er en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amou@@ nt@@ s of curr@@ ent between power sta@@ tions ."
I@@ mag@@ ine you could back up a single power sta@@ tion with a single superconduc@@ ting c@@ able .
But what is the future of quantum lev@@ itation and quantum lo@@ cking ?
"Well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example ."
"I@@ mag@@ ine you would have a dis@@ k si@@ mi@@ lar to the one I have here in my hand , thre@@ e-@@ in@@ ch di@@ am@@ et@@ er , with a single difference ."
"The superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er , instead of being half a mi@@ c@@ ron thin , being two mil@@ li@@ met@@ ers thin , quite thin ."
"This t@@ wo@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ met@@ er@@ -@@ thin superconduc@@ ting lay@@ er could hold 1@@ ,000 ki@@ lo@@ gr@@ am@@ s , a small c@@ ar , in my hand ."
A@@ ma@@ zing . Thank you .

"I &apos;m here today to talk about a di@@ stu@@ r@@ b@@ ing question , which has an equ@@ ally di@@ stu@@ r@@ b@@ ing answer ."
"M@@ y top@@ ic is the secre@@ ts of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to ta@@ ck@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ ks : Why does she sta@@ y ?"
Why would any@@ one sta@@ y with a man who be@@ at@@ s her ?
"I &apos;m not a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ st , a social work@@ er or an exper@@ t in domestic violence ."
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 2@@ 2 . I had just gra@@ du@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge .
I had mo@@ ved to New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity for my first job as a writ@@ er and e@@ dit@@ or at S@@ ev@@ ent@@ e@@ en ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine .
"I had my first ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment , my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pre@@ ss car@@ d , and I had a very big secre@@ t ."
"M@@ y secre@@ t was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ad@@ ed with h@@ ol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ point bu@@ ll@@ ets point@@ ed at my head by the man who I thought was my s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times ."
The man who I loved more than any@@ body on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill me more times than I can even remem@@ ber .
"I &apos;m here to tell you the story of cra@@ z@@ y love , a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ ised as love , one that mil@@ lions of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year ."
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a ty@@ pi@@ cal domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in English from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in marketing from W@@ har@@ ton B@@ u@@ siness S@@ cho@@ ol ."
"I &apos;ve spent most of my care@@ er working for F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 5@@ 00 compan@@ ies inclu@@ ding Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son &@@ am@@ p@@ ; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son , L@@ e@@ o B@@ ur@@ n@@ et@@ t and The W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost ."
I &apos;ve been mar@@ ried for almost 20 years to my second hus@@ b@@ and and we have three kids together .
"M@@ y do@@ g is a black la@@ b , and I dri@@ ve a H@@ on@@ da O@@ d@@ y@@ s@@ se@@ y mini@@ v@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all ra@@ ces , all religi@@ ons , all income and education lev@@ els ."
It &apos;s every@@ where .
"And my second message is that everyone thin@@ ks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue ."
Not exactly .
"O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are men , and domestic ab@@ use happens only in inti@@ mate , inter@@ depen@@ dent , long@@ -@@ ter@@ m relation@@ shi@@ ps , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or exp@@ ect to find violence , which is one reason domestic ab@@ use is so con@@ fu@@ sing ."
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would sta@@ y with a man who be@@ at@@ s me , but in fact I was a very ty@@ pi@@ cal victi@@ m because of my age ."
"I was 2@@ 2 , and in the United States , women ag@@ es 16 to 2@@ 4 are three times as lik@@ ely to be domestic violence victi@@ ms as women of other ag@@ es , and over 5@@ 00 women and girls this age are k@@ il@@ led every year by ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ tn@@ ers , bo@@ y@@ friends , and hus@@ ban@@ ds in the United States ."
"I was also a very ty@@ pi@@ cal victi@@ m because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its war@@ ning sig@@ ns or its patt@@ er@@ ns ."
"I m@@ et Con@@ or on a co@@ ld , ra@@ in@@ y J@@ an@@ uar@@ y ni@@ ght ."
"He sat next to me on the New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity sub@@ way , and he started chat@@ ting me up ."
He told me two things .
"One was that he , too , had just gra@@ du@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y L@@ ea@@ g@@ ue school , and that he worked at a very im@@ pres@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et b@@ ank ."
But what made the bi@@ ggest im@@ pres@@ sion on me that first me@@ eting was that he was smar@@ t and fun@@ ny and he looked like a far@@ m bo@@ y .
"He had these big che@@ eks , these big ap@@ ple che@@ eks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ on@@ d hair , and he se@@ em@@ ed so swe@@ et ."
"One of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the il@@ lu@@ sion that I was the dom@@ in@@ ant par@@ tn@@ er in the relation@@ ship ."
He did this es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ zing me .
"We started dat@@ ing , and he loved everything about me , that I was smar@@ t , that I &apos;d gone to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d , that I was pas@@ sio@@ nate about hel@@ ping te@@ ena@@ ge girls , and my job ."
He wanted to know everything about my family and my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and my h@@ op@@ es and dre@@ am@@ s .
"C@@ on@@ or beli@@ ev@@ ed in me , as a writ@@ er and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had ."
"And he also created a ma@@ gi@@ cal at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere of trust between us by con@@ f@@ es@@ sing his secre@@ t , which was that , as a very young bo@@ y starting at age four , he had been sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physi@@ cally ab@@ used by his st@@ ep@@ father , and the ab@@ use had g@@ ot@@ ten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de , even though he was very smar@@ t , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life ."
W@@ hi@@ ch is why that I@@ v@@ y L@@ ea@@ g@@ ue de@@ g@@ ree and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right sh@@ in@@ y future me@@ ant so much to him .
"If you had told me that this smar@@ t , fun@@ ny , sen@@ s@@ itive man who a@@ do@@ red me would one day dic@@ tat@@ e whether or not I wor@@ e mak@@ e@@ up , how sh@@ ort my s@@ ki@@ r@@ ts were , where I li@@ ved , what j@@ ob@@ s I took , who my friends were and where I spent Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s , I would have la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ int of violence or control or ang@@ er in Con@@ or at the beginning ."
I didn &apos;t know that the first sta@@ ge in any domestic violence relation@@ ship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the victi@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to i@@ so@@ late the victi@@ m .
"Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; &quot; You know , he@@ y , all this R@@ om@@ e@@ o and Ju@@ li@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next pha@@ se where I i@@ so@@ late you and I ab@@ use you &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment where the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ work@@ ers who can see the b@@ ru@@ is@@ es . &quot; &quot; In@@ stead , Con@@ or came home one F@@ ri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dre@@ am job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me ,@@ "
"@@ because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove h@@ im@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ more , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his ab@@ u@@ sive , d@@ y@@ s@@ fun@@ cti@@ onal family , and move to a tiny to@@ wn in New Eng@@ land where he could start his life over with me by his side ."
"Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New Y@@ or@@ k , and my dre@@ am job , but I thought you made sa@@ c@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces for your s@@ ou@@ l@@ mate , so I ag@@ re@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan together ."
"I had no idea I was f@@ al@@ ling into cra@@ z@@ y love , that I was walking he@@ ad@@ first into a care@@ fully lai@@ d physical , fin@@ an@@ cial and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p ."
The next step in the domestic violence patt@@ ern is to int@@ ro@@ duce the thre@@ at of violence and see how she re@@ ac@@ ts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ un@@ s come in .
"As so@@ on as we mo@@ ved to New Eng@@ land — you know , that place where Con@@ nor was supp@@ osed to feel so sa@@ fe — he b@@ ou@@ ght three g@@ un@@ s ."
He k@@ ep@@ t one in the glo@@ ve com@@ par@@ t@@ ment of our c@@ ar .
"He k@@ ep@@ t one under the p@@ il@@ lo@@ ws on our bed , and the thir@@ d one he k@@ ep@@ t in his po@@ ck@@ et at all times ."
And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tra@@ u@@ ma he &apos;d experienc@@ ed as a young bo@@ y .
He needed them to feel prot@@ ected .
"But those g@@ un@@ s were really a message for me , and even though he ha@@ dn &apos;t ra@@ ised a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve dang@@ er every min@@ ute of every day ."
Con@@ or first physi@@ cally atta@@ cked me five days before our we@@ d@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
"I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance writ@@ ing as@@ sig@@ nment , and I got f@@ ru@@ st@@ rat@@ ed , and Con@@ or used my ang@@ er as an ex@@ cu@@ se to put both of his hands around my nec@@ k and to squ@@ ee@@ ze so ti@@ ghtly that I could not b@@ rea@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the chok@@ e@@ hold to h@@ it my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the w@@ all ."
"F@@ i@@ ve days later , the ten b@@ ru@@ is@@ es on my nec@@ k had just f@@ ad@@ ed , and I put on my mother &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding dre@@ ss , and I mar@@ ried him ."
"D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ i@@ ly ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much ."
"And he was very , very sor@@ ry ."
He had just been really stre@@ s@@ sed out by the we@@ d@@ ding and by becom@@ ing a family with me .
"It was an i@@ so@@ lated inci@@ dent , and he was never going to hu@@ r@@ t me again ."
It happened twi@@ ce more on the hon@@ ey@@ moon .
"The first time , I was dri@@ ving to find a secre@@ t be@@ ach and I got lost , and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly h@@ it the dri@@ ver &apos;s side win@@ do@@ w ."
"And then a few days later , dri@@ ving home from our hon@@ ey@@ moon , he got f@@ ru@@ st@@ rat@@ ed by tra@@ ffi@@ c , and he thre@@ w a co@@ ld Big Ma@@ c in my face ."
Con@@ or proc@@ ee@@ ded to be@@ at me once or twi@@ ce a week for the next two and a half years of our mar@@ ri@@ age .
I was mis@@ taken in thinking that I was uni@@ qu@@ e and alone in this sit@@ u@@ ation .
"One in three American women experi@@ ences domestic violence or sta@@ l@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ por@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million ."
"So actually , I was in very good compan@@ y ."
B@@ ac@@ k to my question : Why did I sta@@ y ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
"E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ad@@ ed g@@ un@@ s to my head , pu@@ shed me down stair@@ s , thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ ill our do@@ g , pul@@ led the k@@ ey out of the c@@ ar ig@@ n@@ ition as I d@@ ro@@ ve down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red co@@ ff@@ e@@ e gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I dre@@ s@@ sed for a job inter@@ view , I never once thought of myself as a b@@ att@@ ered wife ."
"In@@ stead , I was a very strong woman in love with a de@@ ep@@ ly tr@@ ou@@ b@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his de@@ m@@ ons ."
"The other question everybody as@@ ks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
Why didn &apos;t I wal@@ k out ? I could have left any time .
"T@@ o me , this is the sa@@ d@@ de@@ st and most pa@@ in@@ ful question that people ask , because we victi@@ ms know something you u@@ su@@ ally don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredi@@ bly dang@@ er@@ ous to leave an ab@@ us@@ er ."
Because the fi@@ nal step in the domestic violence patt@@ ern is k@@ ill her .
"O@@ ver 70 percent of domestic violence mu@@ r@@ ders happen after the victi@@ m has en@@ ded the relation@@ ship , after she &apos;s g@@ ot@@ ten out , because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to l@@ ose ."
"O@@ ther out@@ comes inclu@@ de long@@ -@@ ter@@ m sta@@ l@@ king , even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ mar@@ ries ; d@@ eni@@ al of fin@@ an@@ cial resour@@ ces ; and man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation of the family cour@@ t system to ter@@ ri@@ f@@ y the victi@@ m and her children , who are re@@ gu@@ larly for@@ ced by family cour@@ t ju@@ d@@ ges to sp@@ end un@@ super@@ vi@@ sed time with the man who be@@ at their mother ."
"And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?"
"I was able to leave , because of one fi@@ nal , sa@@ di@@ stic be@@ ating that brok@@ e through my d@@ eni@@ al ."
I realiz@@ ed that the man who I loved so much was going to k@@ ill me if I let him .
So I brok@@ e the si@@ l@@ ence .
"I told everyone : the po@@ li@@ ce , my ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors , my friends and family , to@@ tal st@@ rang@@ ers , and I &apos;m here today because you all hel@@ ped me ."
"We t@@ end to st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe victi@@ ms as g@@ ris@@ ly he@@ ad@@ lin@@ es , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive women , dam@@ ag@@ ed go@@ o@@ ds ."
"The question , &quot; &quot; Why does she sta@@ y ? &quot; &quot; is co@@ de for some people for , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s her f@@ au@@ l@@ t for sta@@ ying , &quot; &quot; as if victi@@ ms int@@ enti@@ ona@@ lly choose to f@@ all in love with men int@@ ent up@@ on dest@@ ro@@ ying us ."
"But since publi@@ shing &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y Lo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; I have heard hund@@ re@@ ds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an inv@@ alu@@ able life le@@ s@@ son from what happened , and who re@@ built lives — jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives — as emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es , wi@@ ves and mothers , lives completely f@@ ree of violence , like me ."
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very ty@@ pi@@ cal domestic violence victi@@ m and a ty@@ pi@@ cal domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or .
"I re@@ mar@@ ried a kind and g@@ ent@@ le man , and we have those three kids ."
"I have that black la@@ b , and I have that mini@@ v@@ an ."
"What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me ."
"R@@ ight now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; W@@ ow , this is f@@ as@@ ci@@ nat@@ ing , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , how stu@@ pi@@ d was she , &quot; &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you ."
I pr@@ omi@@ se you there are se@@ ver@@ al people li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to me right now who are curr@@ ently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers themselves .
"A@@ bu@@ se could be aff@@ ec@@ ting your daughter , your si@@ ster , your best fri@@ end right now ."
I was able to end my own cra@@ z@@ y love story by b@@ re@@ ak@@ ing the si@@ l@@ ence .
I &apos;m still b@@ re@@ ak@@ ing the si@@ l@@ ence today .
"It &apos;s my way of hel@@ ping other victi@@ ms , and it &apos;s my fi@@ nal re@@ qu@@ est of you ."
T@@ al@@ k about what you heard here .
A@@ bu@@ se th@@ ri@@ ves only in si@@ l@@ ence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by sh@@ ining a sp@@ ot@@ light on it .
We victi@@ ms need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secre@@ ts of domestic violence .
"S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ work@@ ers , your friends and family ."
"R@@ ec@@ a@@ st survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with fu@@ ll fu@@ tures ."
"R@@ ec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze the early sig@@ ns of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously inter@@ v@@ en@@ e , de@@ es@@ ca@@ late it , show victi@@ ms a sa@@ fe way out ."
"T@@ o@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our din@@ ner ta@@ b@@ les and our families the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful o@@ ases they should be ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
"This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water supp@@ ly that it wouldn &apos;t oc@@ cu@@ r to any@@ one to question it ."
This is my super@@ market .
"One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never brok@@ e ."
"We now have an almost un@@ limit@@ ed vari@@ ety of phon@@ es , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally in the world of cell phon@@ es ."
These are cell phon@@ es of the future .
"M@@ y fav@@ or@@ ite is the middle one — the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er , n@@ ose hair tri@@ m@@ mer , and c@@ r@@ è@@ me b@@ r@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e t@@ or@@ ch ."
So pa@@ ra@@ l@@ y@@ sis is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of having too many cho@@ i@@ ces .
Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ ca@@ lation of exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
You want b@@ ut@@ ton f@@ ly or z@@ i@@ pp@@ er f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ shed or ac@@ i@@ d-@@ wa@@ shed ?
"I had very low , no particular exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one f@@ la@@ v@@ or ."
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t have done better .
"W@@ ith a hundred different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on di@@ sp@@ la@@ y , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for fai@@ lu@@ re ."
"And so the net resul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vely , and we feel worse ."
So let me re@@ mind you .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
They actually make us worse off .
Thank you very much .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
"There is a hu@@ ge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happiness , am@@ ong resear@@ chers ."
There is a lot of happiness co@@ a@@ ching .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ i@@ er .
And my talk today will be m@@ os@@ tly about these cogn@@ itive t@@ rap@@ s .
"This app@@ lies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to scho@@ lars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mes@@ sed up as any@@ body else is ."
The first of these t@@ rap@@ s is a re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity .
"It turns out that the word &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; is just not a u@@ se@@ ful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things ."
"And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the noti@@ on of happiness ."
"I mean , this is a real cogn@@ itive tra@@ p ."
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
"Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ answer se@@ s@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a story , and that was a story — He said he &apos;d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ phon@@ y , and it was ab@@ solutely g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound ."
"And then he ad@@ ded , really quite em@@ oti@@ ona@@ lly , it ru@@ ined the whole experience ."
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the mem@@ ories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music .
"They count@@ ed for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ ined , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep ."
"There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and kno@@ ws the present , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the past , but basically it has only the present ."
"It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ a@@ ches — you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ oes it hu@@ r@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;"
"And then there is a remember@@ ing self , and the remember@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and main@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ a@@ ches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feel@@ ing lat@@ ely ? &quot;"
or &quot; &quot; How was your tri@@ p to A@@ l@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; or something like that .
"Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ ities , the experiencing self and the remember@@ ing self , and getting con@@ fu@@ sed between them is part of the m@@ ess about the noti@@ on of happiness ."
"Now , the remember@@ ing self is a st@@ or@@ y@@ tel@@ ler ."
And that really star@@ ts with a basic respon@@ se of our mem@@ ories — it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
They were asked to re@@ por@@ t on their pain every 60 secon@@ ds .
"@@ Here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ordi@@ ngs ."
"And you are asked , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o of them su@@ ffer@@ ed more ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question ."
"C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ffer@@ ed more — his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every min@@ ute of pain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more ."
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they su@@ ffer@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a surpri@@ se .
The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
"The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very c@@ riti@@ cal part of the story is how it ends ."
And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spi@@ ring or great — but one of them is this dist@@ in@@ ct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is dist@@ in@@ c@@ tly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its p@@ eak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
"Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in to@@ tal ? &quot;"
"And it was much worse for A than for B , in mem@@ ory ."
Now this is a direc@@ t con@@ f@@ lic@@ t between the experiencing self and the remember@@ ing self .
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a worse time ."
"Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ran cl@@ ini@@ cal experiments , and it has been done , and it does work — you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ i@@ gg@@ ling it too much ."
"That will cause the pati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before ."
"And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory d@@ eli@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up ."
"What defin@@ es a story are changes , sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mom@@ ents and en@@ di@@ ngs ."
"E@@ n@@ di@@ ngs are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding d@@ omi@@ nat@@ ed ."
"Now , the experiencing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ously ."
"It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other ."
And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really st@@ rai@@ ght@@ for@@ ward : They are lost forever .
M@@ ost of them are completely ig@@ no@@ red by the remember@@ ing self .
"And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should cou@@ nt , that what happens during these mom@@ ents of experience is our life ."
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
"And how to sp@@ end it would seem to be re@@ lev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remember@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us ."
"F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the t@@ wo@@ -@@ week vac@@ ation is twi@@ ce as good as the on@@ e-@@ week vac@@ ation ."
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remember@@ ing self .
The experiencing self has no v@@ oi@@ ce in this cho@@ ice .
"We actually don &apos;t choose between experi@@ ences , we choose between mem@@ ories of experi@@ ences ."
"And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future nor@@ ma@@ lly as experi@@ ences ."
We think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ed mem@@ ories .
"I have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ t@@ ent , in the ser@@ vice of our remember@@ ing self ."
And this is a bit hard to ju@@ sti@@ f@@ y I think .
"I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our mem@@ ories ?"
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the remember@@ ing self .
"Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half ."
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ c@@ y .
"Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for con@@ su@@ ming mem@@ ories , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on mem@@ ory rela@@ tive to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?"
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
"I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic drug so that you won &apos;t remem@@ ber anything ."
Why do we pi@@ ck the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
"Now , the two selves bring up two noti@@ ons of happiness ."
"There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self ."
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all — happiness for mom@@ ents is a fai@@ r@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated process .
What are the em@@ oti@@ ons that can be measu@@ red ?
"And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time ."
It is about how sa@@ tis@@ fied or p@@ le@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ ery different noti@@ on .
"A@@ ny@@ one who doesn &apos;t di@@ sti@@ ng@@ u@@ ish those noti@@ ons is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I b@@ el@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been mes@@ sing up the study of happiness for a long time in preci@@ sel@@ y this way ."
"The dist@@ in@@ ction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the remember@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two se@@ pa@@ rat@@ ely ."
"So in rec@@ ent years , we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves ."
And the main le@@ s@@ son I think that we have learned is they are really different .
"@@ Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 ."
"What that means is if you m@@ et somebody , and you were told , &quot; &quot; O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et ta@@ ll , &quot; &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?"
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y .
So the cor@@ relation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
"We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important ."
"We know that happiness is main@@ ly being sa@@ tis@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like ."
"There are other plea@@ su@@ res , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant ."
The bot@@ tom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-being .
It is a completely different noti@@ on .
"Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think st@@ rai@@ ght about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live ."
"So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer ."
"Well , it turns out that cli@@ mate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are ."
We know that .
"It is very difficult to think st@@ rai@@ ght about well-being , and I ho@@ pe I have given you a sense of how difficult it is ."
Thank you .
( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ n@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
"Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting resul@@ t came out of that G@@ al@@ l@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey ."
"When we looked at how feel@@ ings , v@@ ary with income ."
"And it turns out that , b@@ el@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans — and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large re@@ pre@@ sen@@ tati@@ ve sam@@ ple — b@@ el@@ ow an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ..@@ ."
"C@@ A : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 ."
"( Laughter ) 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progre@@ ssi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ i@@ er the poo@@ re@@ r they get ."
"A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ solutely f@@ la@@ t line ."
I mean I &apos;ve ra@@ rely seen lin@@ es so f@@ la@@ t .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money cer@@ tain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mi@@ ser@@ y , and we can measure that mi@@ ser@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly ."
"In terms of the other self , the remember@@ ing self , you get a different story ."
"The more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ tis@@ fied you are ."
That does not hold for em@@ oti@@ ons .
"C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ ny , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness ."
"If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th ."
P@@ eople are recogni@@ zing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happiness when they think of publi@@ c po@@ lic@@ y .
"This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y , I think , in years to come ."
"This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ a@@ de or two , part of national sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cs ."
"C@@ A : Well , it seems to me that this issue will — or at lea@@ st should be — the most interesting po@@ lic@@ y dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion to tra@@ ck over the next few years ."
"For the next few minutes we &apos;re going to talk about energy , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of a vari@@ ed talk ."
"I &apos;ll try to sp@@ in a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a con@@ v@@ eni@@ ent starting place ."
"The talk will be bro@@ ad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start ."
And one of the reas@@ ons is this is re@@ mark@@ able stuff .
"You take about eight or so car@@ bon atoms , about 20 hy@@ d@@ ro@@ g@@ en atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this mar@@ vel@@ ous li@@ qui@@ d : very ener@@ g@@ y-@@ d@@ en@@ se and very easy to re@@ f@@ ine into a number of very u@@ se@@ ful produc@@ ts and f@@ ue@@ ls ."
It &apos;s great stuff .
"Now , as far as it goes , there &apos;s a lot of oil out there in the world ."
Here &apos;s my little po@@ ck@@ et map of where it &apos;s all lo@@ c@@ ated .
A bi@@ gg@@ er one for you to look at .
"But this is it , this is the oil in the world ."
G@@ eo@@ logi@@ sts have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
This is about 100 tri@@ l@@ lion g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of c@@ ru@@ de oil still to be developed and produc@@ ed in the world today .
"Now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; &quot; Well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that ."
"O@@ h , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1@@ 000 met@@ ers b@@ el@@ ow where you &apos;re all s@@ itt@@ ing is one of the lar@@ gest produc@@ ing oil fiel@@ ds in the world ."
"C@@ ome talk to me about it , I &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the de@@ tail@@ s if you want ."
"So , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it ."
But what about oil ? W@@ here is it in the energy system ?
"@@ Here &apos;s a little snap@@ sh@@ ot of 150 years of oil , and it &apos;s been a dom@@ in@@ ant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years ."
"Now , here &apos;s another little secre@@ t I &apos;m going to tell you about : F@@ or the last 2@@ 5 years , oil has been pla@@ ying less and less of a ro@@ le in global energy systems ."
"There was one kind of p@@ eak oil in 198@@ 5 , when oil re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed 50 percent of global energy supp@@ ly ."
"Now , it &apos;s about 3@@ 5 percent ."
It &apos;s been dec@@ l@@ ining and I believe it will contin@@ ue to dec@@ line .
G@@ as@@ ol@@ ine con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion in the U.S. probably pe@@ ak@@ ed in 200@@ 7 and is dec@@ l@@ ining .
So oil is pla@@ ying a less sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ro@@ le every year .
"And so , 2@@ 5 years ago , there was a p@@ eak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a p@@ eak co@@ al ; and a hundred years before that , there was a p@@ eak wo@@ od ."
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
And what &apos;s been taking up the s@@ lack in the last few dec@@ ad@@ es ?
"Well , a lot of natural g@@ as and a little bit of nu@@ clear , for star@@ ters ."
And what goes on in the future ?
"Well , I think out a@@ head of us a few dec@@ ad@@ es is p@@ eak g@@ as , and be@@ yon@@ d that , p@@ eak r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les ."
"Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture ."
"Now , I &apos;m not pre@@ ten@@ ding that energy use in to@@ tal isn &apos;t increas@@ ing , it is — that &apos;s another part of the story . C@@ ome talk to me about it , we &apos;ll f@@ ill in some of the de@@ tail@@ s — but there &apos;s a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we &apos;ve been sy@@ ste@@ mati@@ cally dec@@ ar@@ bon@@ iz@@ ing our energy system ."
"E@@ ner@@ gy systems of the world becom@@ ing progre@@ ssi@@ vely — year on year , dec@@ a@@ de on dec@@ a@@ de , century on century — becom@@ ing less car@@ bon int@@ en@@ se ."
"And that contin@@ ues into the future with the r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les that we &apos;re develop@@ ing today , rea@@ ching maybe 30 percent of pri@@ ma@@ ry energy by mi@@ d century ."
"Now that might be the end of the story — O@@ kay , we just re@@ place it all with con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal r@@ ene@@ w@@ ab@@ les — but I think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that ."
And to tell the next part of the story — and this is looking out say 2@@ 100 and be@@ yon@@ d .
"What is the future of truly su@@ sta@@ i@@ na@@ ble , car@@ bon@@ -@@ f@@ ree energy ?"
"Well , we have to take a little ex@@ cur@@ sion , and we &apos;ll start in cent@@ ral T@@ ex@@ as ."
Here &apos;s a piece of li@@ me@@ st@@ one .
"I pi@@ cked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ al@@ ls , T@@ ex@@ as ."
It &apos;s about 4@@ 00 million years old .
"And it &apos;s just li@@ me@@ st@@ one , nothing really speci@@ al about it ."
"Now , here &apos;s a piece of cha@@ l@@ k ."
I pi@@ cked this up at M@@ I@@ T . It &apos;s a little you@@ ng@@ er .
"And it &apos;s different than this li@@ me@@ st@@ one , you can see that ."
"You wouldn &apos;t build a building out of this stuff , and you wouldn &apos;t try to give a lec@@ ture and writ@@ e on the cha@@ l@@ k@@ bo@@ ar@@ d with this ."
"Y@@ eah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different ."
"It &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bo@@ nate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bo@@ nate ."
What &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
"Now , if you think that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at , the story gets really ne@@ at right now ."
O@@ ff the co@@ a@@ st of C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a comes this : It &apos;s an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
"Now , mil@@ lions of ab@@ alone every year make this sh@@ ell ."
"O@@ h , by the way , just in case you wer@@ en &apos;t already g@@ ue@@ s@@ sing , it &apos;s cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bo@@ nate ."
It &apos;s the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .
But it &apos;s not the same stuff ; it &apos;s different .
"It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3@@ ,000 times tou@@ gh@@ er than this ."
"And why ? Because the lo@@ w@@ ly ab@@ alone is able to la@@ y down the cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bo@@ nate c@@ r@@ y@@ sta@@ ls in lay@@ ers , making this beautiful , i@@ ri@@ de@@ sc@@ ent mother of pe@@ arl ."
"@@ V@@ ery speci@@ aliz@@ ed material that the ab@@ alone self-@@ as@@ se@@ mb@@ les , mil@@ lions of ab@@ alone , all the time , every day , every year ."
This is pretty incredible stuff .
"All the same , what &apos;s different ?"
How the molecules are put together .
"Now , what does this have to do with energy ?"
Here &apos;s a piece of co@@ al .
And I &apos;ll su@@ ggest that this co@@ al is about as exc@@ iting as this cha@@ l@@ k .
"Now , whether we &apos;re talking about f@@ ue@@ ls or energy car@@ ri@@ ers , or perhaps nov@@ el materi@@ als for b@@ att@@ eri@@ es or f@@ ue@@ l cells , nature ha@@ sn &apos;t ever built those perf@@ ect materi@@ als yet because nature didn &apos;t need to ."
"@@ N@@ ature didn &apos;t need to because , un@@ like the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , the survival of a speci@@ es didn &apos;t depen@@ d on building those materi@@ als , until maybe now when it might just matter ."
"So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equi@@ val@@ ent of this just by re@@ ar@@ rang@@ ing the molecules differ@@ ently ."
And so that is my story .
The oil will never ru@@ n out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
It &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ lion win@@ d@@ mil@@ ls .
"It &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people inv@@ ent@@ ed ideas — they had ideas , in@@ nov@@ ations , technology — and the S@@ t@@ one A@@ ge en@@ ded , not because we ran out of st@@ ones ."
"( Laughter ) It &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s in@@ nov@@ ation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we ru@@ n out of oil ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Thank you . I have to tell you I &apos;m both challeng@@ ed and exc@@ ited .
T@@ R : Th@@ an@@ ks for the inter@@ action on a high level there .
"But if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achi@@ e@@ ve something ?"
"S@@ om@@ ebody who &apos;s working for you , or a par@@ tn@@ er , or even yourself ."
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) And you cor@@ rec@@ t me if I &apos;m wrong .
"Wh@@ o &apos;s been there ? S@@ ay , &quot; &quot; A@@ ye . &quot; &quot; Au@@ dience : A@@ ye ."
We need vari@@ ety . We need surpri@@ se .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
"In my own human@@ ity and mis@@ takes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried ."
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives .
How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we as@@ su@@ me ?
"O@@ r better , how do you explain when others are able to achi@@ e@@ ve things that seem to de@@ f@@ y all of the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions ?"
F@@ or example : Why is App@@ le so in@@ nov@@ ative ?
"Y@@ ear after year , after year , they &apos;re more in@@ nov@@ ative than all their comp@@ et@@ ition ."
"And yet , they &apos;re just a computer compan@@ y ."
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Why is it that Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing led the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l R@@ i@@ ghts M@@ o@@ v@@ ement ?
"He wasn &apos;t the only man who su@@ ffer@@ ed in pre@@ -@@ civi@@ l ri@@ ghts America , and he cer@@ tain@@ ly wasn &apos;t the only great o@@ rat@@ or of the day ."
"And this disco@@ very prof@@ oun@@ dly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even prof@@ oun@@ dly changed the way in which I oper@@ ate in it ."
"As it turns out , there &apos;s a patt@@ ern ."
And it &apos;s the complet@@ e op@@ pos@@ ite to everyone else .
"All I did was co@@ di@@ f@@ y it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simp@@ le@@ st idea ."
I call it the gol@@ den cir@@ cle .
This little idea expla@@ ins why some organiz@@ ations and some lead@@ ers are able to in@@ spi@@ re where others are@@ n &apos;t .
Let me de@@ f@@ ine the terms really quickly .
"E@@ very single person , every single organiz@@ ation on the planet kno@@ ws what they do , 100 percent ."
"But very , very few people or organiz@@ ations know why they do what they do ."
"B@@ y &quot; &quot; why , &quot; &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your pur@@ p@@ ose ?"
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belie@@ f ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
I use App@@ le because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
"They &apos;re beauti@@ fully desig@@ ned , simple to use and us@@ er fri@@ en@@ dly ."
Here &apos;s how App@@ le actually comm@@ uni@@ cat@@ es .
"&quot; &quot; E@@ very@@ thing we do , we believe in challeng@@ ing the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o ."
We believe in thinking differ@@ ently .
We just happen to make great comp@@ uters .
"But we &apos;re also perf@@ ec@@ tly com@@ for@@ table bu@@ ying an M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er from App@@ le , or a phone from App@@ le , or a D@@ V@@ R from App@@ le ."
The@@ ir comp@@ et@@ it@@ ors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these produc@@ ts .
"A few years ago , G@@ at@@ e@@ way came out with f@@ lat@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s ."
They &apos;re em@@ in@@ ently qu@@ ali@@ fied to make f@@ lat@@ -@@ scre@@ en T@@ V@@ s .
No@@ body b@@ ou@@ ght one .
It &apos;s all grou@@ n@@ ded in the ten@@ ets of bio@@ logy .
"@@ Not psycho@@ logy , bio@@ logy ."
"O@@ ur ne@@ we@@ st brain , our H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ en brain , our ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x , cor@@ respon@@ ds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level ."
The ne@@ o@@ cor@@ te@@ x is respon@@ sible for all of our ra@@ ti@@ onal and anal@@ y@@ ti@@ cal thought and language .
"The middle two sec@@ tions make up our lim@@ bic bra@@ ins , and our lim@@ bic bra@@ ins are respon@@ sible for all of our feel@@ ings , like trust and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ."
It just doesn &apos;t dri@@ ve behavior .
This is where g@@ ut deci@@ sions come from .
The go@@ al is not just to hi@@ re people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hi@@ re people who believe what you believe .
M@@ ost people don &apos;t know about S@@ am@@ ue@@ l P@@ i@@ er@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley .
"And S@@ am@@ ue@@ l P@@ i@@ er@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley had , what we as@@ su@@ me , to be the re@@ ci@@ pe for success ."
M@@ on@@ ey was no problem .
He hi@@ red the best min@@ ds money could find and the market conditions were f@@ anta@@ stic .
"The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es follo@@ wed him around every@@ where , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for L@@ ang@@ ley ."
Th@@ en how come we &apos;ve never heard of S@@ am@@ ue@@ l P@@ i@@ er@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley ?
"The difference was , O@@ r@@ vil@@ le and W@@ il@@ bu@@ r were dri@@ ven by a cause , by a pur@@ p@@ ose , by a belie@@ f ."
"They beli@@ ev@@ ed that if they could figure out this fl@@ ying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world ."
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the resul@@ t .
He was in pur@@ su@@ it of the ri@@ ches .
"And l@@ o and be@@ hold , look what happened ."
The others just worked for the pa@@ y@@ ch@@ ec@@ k .
"He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get famous , so he qu@@ it ."
But why is it important to att@@ rac@@ t those who believe what you believe ?
The next 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 % of our population are our early ad@@ op@@ ters .
"And these gu@@ ys , the in@@ nov@@ at@@ ors and the early ad@@ op@@ ters , they &apos;re com@@ for@@ table making those g@@ ut deci@@ sions ."
"And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves ."
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
"In fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe ."
"So let me give you a famous example , a famous fai@@ lu@@ re and a famous success of the la@@ w of di@@ ff@@ u@@ sion of in@@ nov@@ ation ."
It &apos;s a comm@@ er@@ cial example .
I T@@ i@@ V@@ o stuff on my piec@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ j@@ un@@ k T@@ i@@ me W@@ ar@@ ner D@@ V@@ R all the time .
They &apos;ve never made money .
"And when they went I@@ P@@ O , their st@@ o@@ ck was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then p@@ lu@@ m@@ met@@ ed , and it &apos;s never tra@@ ded ab@@ ove 10 ."
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
"In the sum@@ mer of 19@@ 6@@ 3 , 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 people showed up on the ma@@ ll in W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton to hear D@@ r@@ . K@@ ing speak ."
How do you do that ?
But he had a gi@@ ft .
How many of them showed up for him ?
They showed up for themselves .
"We follo@@ wed , not for him , but for ourselves ."
Because there are lead@@ ers and there are those who le@@ ad .
"@@ L@@ ea@@ ders hold a position of power or au@@ th@@ ority , but those who le@@ ad in@@ spi@@ re us ."
"I ’ m going around the world giving tal@@ ks about D@@ ar@@ win , and u@@ su@@ ally what I ’ m talking about is D@@ ar@@ win ’ s strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ oning ."
"Now that tit@@ le , that ph@@ ra@@ se , comes from a c@@ riti@@ c , an early c@@ riti@@ c , and this is a pas@@ sage that I just love , and would like to read for you ."
"&quot; &quot; In the theory with which we have to de@@ al , A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ g@@ nor@@ ance is the ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cer ; so that we may en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate as the fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal princi@@ ple of the whole system , that , in order to make a perf@@ ect and beautiful machine , it is not re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite to know how to make it ."
"This prop@@ os@@ ition will be found on care@@ ful ex@@ ami@@ nation to ex@@ pre@@ ss , in con@@ d@@ en@@ sed form , the essential pur@@ por@@ t of the The@@ ory , and to ex@@ pre@@ ss in a few words all M@@ r@@ . D@@ ar@@ win ’ s mean@@ ing ; who , by a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ oning , seems to think A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute I@@ g@@ nor@@ ance fully qu@@ ali@@ fied to take the place of A@@ b@@ sol@@ ute W@@ is@@ dom in the achiev@@ ements of cre@@ ative sk@@ ill . &quot; &quot; E@@ x@@ actly . E@@ x@@ actly . And it is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion ."
A cre@@ ati@@ oni@@ st p@@ am@@ ph@@ let has this wonderful pa@@ ge in it : &quot; &quot; T@@ est T@@ wo : Do you know of any building that didn ’ t have a buil@@ der ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any pa@@ int@@ ing that didn ’ t have a pa@@ in@@ ter ? Y@@ es / No .
Do you know of any c@@ ar that didn ’ t have a mak@@ er ? Y@@ es / No .
"If you ans@@ wer@@ ed &apos; Y@@ es &apos; for any of the ab@@ ove , give de@@ tail@@ s . &quot; &quot; A@@ -@@ h@@ a ! I mean , it really is a strange in@@ ver@@ sion of reas@@ oning ."
You would have thought it stan@@ ds to reason that desig@@ n requi@@ res an intellig@@ ent desig@@ ner .
But D@@ ar@@ win sho@@ ws that it ’ s just f@@ al@@ se .
"T@@ o@@ day , though , I ’ m going to talk about D@@ ar@@ win ’ s other strange in@@ ver@@ sion , which is equ@@ ally pu@@ z@@ z@@ ling at first , but in some ways just as important ."
It stan@@ ds to reason that we love cho@@ co@@ late c@@ ake because it is swe@@ et .
G@@ u@@ ys go for girls like this because they are se@@ x@@ y .
We ad@@ ore ba@@ bi@@ es because they ’ re so c@@ ute .
"And , of course , we are am@@ used by j@@ ok@@ es because they are fun@@ ny ."
This is all ba@@ ck@@ wards . It is . And D@@ ar@@ win sho@@ ws us why .
"@@ Let ’ s start with swe@@ et . O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is basically an evol@@ ved su@@ ga@@ r det@@ ec@@ tor , because su@@ ga@@ r is high energy , and it ’ s just been wi@@ red up to the pre@@ fer@@ er , to put it very c@@ ru@@ d@@ ely , and that ’ s why we like su@@ ga@@ r ."
"H@@ on@@ ey is swe@@ et because we like it , not &quot; &quot; we like it because hon@@ ey is swe@@ et . &quot; &quot; There ’ s nothing int@@ r@@ in@@ sically swe@@ et about hon@@ ey ."
"If you looked at g@@ lu@@ c@@ ose molecules ti@@ ll you were bl@@ ind , you wouldn ’ t see why they ta@@ sted swe@@ et ."
You have to look in our bra@@ ins to understand why they ’ re swe@@ et .
"So if you think first there was swe@@ et@@ ness , and then we evol@@ ved to like swe@@ et@@ ness , you ’ ve got it ba@@ ck@@ wards ; that ’ s just wrong . It ’ s the other way r@@ ound ."
Swe@@ et@@ ness was born with the wi@@ ring which evol@@ ved .
And there ’ s nothing int@@ r@@ in@@ sically se@@ x@@ y about these young la@@ di@@ es .
"And it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t , because if there were , then M@@ other N@@ ature would have a problem : How on ear@@ th do you get ch@@ im@@ ps to mate ?"
"Now you might think , a@@ h , there ’ s a sol@@ ution : hal@@ lu@@ ci@@ na@@ tions ."
"That would be one way of doing it , but there ’ s a quick@@ er way ."
"@@ Just wi@@ re the ch@@ im@@ ps up to love that look , and ap@@ par@@ ently they do ."
That ’ s all there is to it .
"O@@ ver six million years , we and the ch@@ im@@ ps evol@@ ved our different ways ."
"We became bal@@ d-@@ bo@@ di@@ ed , o@@ dd@@ ly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t ."
"If we ha@@ dn ’ t , then probably this would be the he@@ ight of se@@ x@@ iness ."
O@@ ur swe@@ et to@@ ot@@ h is an evol@@ ved and in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tual pre@@ fer@@ ence for high@@ -@@ energy fo@@ od .
It wasn ’ t desig@@ ned for cho@@ co@@ late c@@ ake .
Ch@@ o@@ co@@ late c@@ ake is a super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ us .
"The ter@@ m is o@@ wed to N@@ ik@@ o T@@ in@@ ber@@ g@@ en , who did his famous experiments with gu@@ l@@ ls , where he found that that or@@ ang@@ e sp@@ ot on the gu@@ ll ’ s be@@ ak — if he made a bi@@ gg@@ er , or@@ ang@@ er sp@@ ot the gu@@ ll chi@@ cks would p@@ ec@@ k at it even har@@ der ."
"It was a hy@@ per@@ sti@@ mul@@ us for them , and they loved it ."
"What we see with , say , cho@@ co@@ late c@@ ake is it ’ s a super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ us to t@@ w@@ eak our desig@@ n wi@@ ring ."
And there are lots of super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ i ; cho@@ co@@ late c@@ ake is one .
There &apos;s lots of super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ i for se@@ x@@ iness .
And there &apos;s even super@@ nor@@ mal sti@@ mul@@ i for c@@ ut@@ eness . Here ’ s a pretty good example .
"It ’ s important that we love ba@@ bi@@ es , and that we not be put off by , say , m@@ ess@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers ."
"So ba@@ bi@@ es have to att@@ rac@@ t our aff@@ ec@@ tion and our nu@@ r@@ tu@@ ring , and they do ."
"And , by the way , a rec@@ ent study sho@@ ws that mothers pre@@ f@@ er the sm@@ ell of the di@@ r@@ ty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own ba@@ by ."
So nature works on many lev@@ els here .
"But now , if ba@@ bi@@ es didn ’ t look the way they do — if ba@@ bi@@ es looked like this , that ’ s what we would find a@@ do@@ ra@@ ble , that ’ s what we would find — we would think , o@@ h my go@@ od@@ ness , do I ever want to hu@@ g that ."
This is the strange in@@ ver@@ sion .
"Well now , finally what about fun@@ ny . M@@ y answer is , it ’ s the same story , the same story ."
"This is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t ob@@ vi@@ ous . That ’ s why I leave it to the end ."
And I won ’ t be able to say too much about it .
"But you have to think evol@@ u@@ tiona@@ ri@@ ly , you have to think , what hard job that has to be done — it ’ s di@@ r@@ ty work , somebody ’ s got to do it — is so important to give us such a power@@ ful , in@@ built re@@ ward for it when we succ@@ e@@ ed ."
"Now , I think we &apos;ve found the answer — I and a few of my colle@@ ag@@ ues ."
It ’ s a ne@@ u@@ ral system that ’ s wi@@ red up to re@@ ward the brain for doing a g@@ ru@@ b@@ by cl@@ eri@@ cal job .
O@@ ur bu@@ mp@@ er sti@@ ck@@ er for this view is that this is the jo@@ y of de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing .
"Now I ’ m not going to have time to sp@@ ell it all out , but I ’ ll just say that only some kinds of de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ing get the re@@ ward ."
"And what we ’ re doing is we ’ re using hu@@ m@@ or as a sort of neur@@ os@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c pro@@ be by s@@ wit@@ ching hu@@ m@@ or on and off , by tur@@ ning the kno@@ b on a j@@ oke — now it ’ s not fun@@ ny ... o@@ h , now it ’ s fun@@ ni@@ er ..@@ ."
"@@ now we ’ ll turn a little bit more ... now it ’ s not fun@@ ny — in this way , we can actually learn something about the ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture of the brain , the fun@@ cti@@ onal ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture of the brain ."
M@@ at@@ the@@ w H@@ ur@@ ley is the first au@@ th@@ or of this . We call it the H@@ ur@@ ley M@@ o@@ de@@ l .
"He ’ s a computer scienti@@ st , R@@ e@@ gi@@ na@@ ld A@@ dam@@ s a psycho@@ logi@@ st , and there I am , and we ’ re put@@ ting this together into a book ."
Thank you very much .
"Now , noti@@ ce that the lead@@ er em@@ bra@@ ces him as an equal ."
It takes g@@ ut@@ s to st@@ and out like that .
So a movement must be publi@@ c .
Now we &apos;ve got m@@ omen@@ tum . This is the ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
"And what a perf@@ ect place to do that , at TED ."
( Applause )
A@@ ny@@ one ?
How about a moder@@ ate amount of stress ?
Y@@ eah . M@@ e too .
But that is not my con@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
It incre@@ ases the ris@@ k of everything from the common co@@ ld to car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar disease .
"But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change your@@ s ."
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
"And un@@ be@@ kno@@ w@@ n@@ st to you , the experim@@ en@@ ter has been tra@@ ined to ha@@ ra@@ ss you during it ."
That guy made a mis@@ take .
It &apos;s getting more oxy@@ g@@ en to your brain .
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is inv@@ ol@@ ved in .
It fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ es your brain &apos;s social in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ ts .
It even makes you more w@@ il@@ ling to help and supp@@ ort the people you care about .
But my fav@@ or@@ ite eff@@ ect on the body is actually on the heart .
P@@ eople who spent time car@@ ing for others showed ab@@ solutely no stre@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ rela@@ ted increase in d@@ ying .
"And when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty pro@@ found stat@@ ement ."
You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to han@@ d@@ le life &apos;s challeng@@ es .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ n@@ der@@ son : This is kind of ama@@ zing , what you &apos;re telling us ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ever before has the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; &quot; I am B@@ riti@@ sh &quot; &quot; eli@@ c@@ ited so much p@@ ity . ( Laughter )
"So that was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for many people , but it was also something that , over the follo@@ wing se@@ ver@@ al days , created a complet@@ e political m@@ el@@ t@@ down in my country ."
E@@ very@@ body was bl@@ am@@ ing everybody else .
That complet@@ e m@@ el@@ t@@ down was made even worse by the most tra@@ gi@@ c el@@ ement of it : lev@@ els of x@@ en@@ o@@ pho@@ bi@@ a and ra@@ ci@@ st ab@@ use in the stre@@ ets of B@@ rit@@ ain at a level that I have never seen before in my li@@ fe@@ time .
"P@@ eople are now talking about whether my country is becom@@ ing a L@@ ittle Eng@@ land , or , as one of my colle@@ ag@@ ues put it , whether we &apos;re about to become a 19@@ 5@@ 0s n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a the@@ me par@@ k flo@@ ating in the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic O@@ c@@ e@@ an ."
"( Laughter ) But my question is really , should we have the de@@ g@@ ree of sho@@ ck that we &apos;ve experienc@@ ed since ?"
O@@ r are there de@@ ep@@ er struc@@ tu@@ ral fac@@ tors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions .
"F@@ irst , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?"
"And second , what can we do about it ?"
How should we all respon@@ d ?
"So first , what does B@@ re@@ x@@ it re@@ present ?"
H@@ in@@ d@@ sight is a wonderful thing .
B@@ re@@ x@@ it teach@@ es us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
"The v@@ ot@@ e sp@@ l@@ it along lin@@ es of age , education , cla@@ ss and ge@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ y ."
"@@ G@@ eo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cally , it was L@@ on@@ don and S@@ c@@ ot@@ land that most st@@ rong@@ ly comm@@ itt@@ ed to being part of the Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an Uni@@ on , while in other parts of the country there was very strong am@@ bi@@ val@@ ence ."
"But more prof@@ oun@@ dly , the v@@ ot@@ e teach@@ es us something about the nature of politi@@ cs today ."
Con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry politi@@ cs is no longer just about right and left .
It &apos;s no longer just about ta@@ x and sp@@ end .
It &apos;s about globaliz@@ ation .
The f@@ au@@ l@@ t line of con@@ tem@@ po@@ ra@@ ry politi@@ cs is between those that em@@ bra@@ ce globaliz@@ ation and those that fear globaliz@@ ation .
But those ideas are ones that sig@@ ni@@ f@@ y fear and ali@@ ena@@ tion .
They re@@ present a re@@ treat back to@@ wards nati@@ ona@@ li@@ s@@ m and bor@@ ders in ways that many of us would re@@ ject .
The bl@@ ue are@@ as show R@@ ema@@ in and the red are@@ as L@@ ea@@ ve .
It means that we need to reach out more bro@@ ad@@ ly and understand .
"In the L@@ ea@@ ve v@@ ot@@ e , a min@@ ority have pe@@ dd@@ led the politi@@ cs of fear and hat@@ red , cre@@ ating lies and mi@@ stru@@ st around , for in@@ stance , the idea that the v@@ ot@@ e on Eu@@ ro@@ pe could re@@ duce the number of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and as@@ y@@ lu@@ m@@ -@@ se@@ ek@@ ers coming to Eu@@ ro@@ pe , when the v@@ ot@@ e on lea@@ ving had nothing to do with im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion from outside the Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an Uni@@ on ."
But for a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant maj@@ ority of the L@@ ea@@ ve v@@ ot@@ ers the con@@ cer@@ n was di@@ si@@ l@@ lu@@ si@@ on@@ ment with the political es@@ ta@@ bli@@ sh@@ ment .
This re@@ plic@@ ates around Eu@@ ro@@ pe and much of the liber@@ al democra@@ tic world .
"We see it with the ri@@ se in popu@@ lar@@ ity of D@@ ona@@ ld T@@ ru@@ m@@ p in the United States , with the gro@@ wing nati@@ ona@@ li@@ s@@ m of V@@ ik@@ tor O@@ r@@ b@@ á@@ n in H@@ u@@ ng@@ ary , with the increase in popu@@ lar@@ ity of Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en in F@@ ran@@ ce ."
The spec@@ ter of B@@ re@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies .
"For all of us who care about cre@@ ating liber@@ al , open , t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant societies , we ur@@ g@@ ently need a new vision , a vision of a more t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant , inclu@@ sive globaliz@@ ation , one that bri@@ ngs people with us rather than lea@@ ving them behind ."
That vision of globaliz@@ ation is one that has to start by a re@@ cognition of the positive bene@@ f@@ its of globaliz@@ ation .
"The con@@ sen@@ su@@ s am@@ ong@@ st economi@@ sts is that f@@ ree tra@@ de , the movement of cap@@ ital , the movement of people across bor@@ ders bene@@ fit everyone on ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ate ."
But globaliz@@ ation also has re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tive eff@@ ec@@ ts .
It cre@@ ates win@@ n@@ ers and l@@ os@@ ers .
"In 200@@ 2 , the for@@ mer S@@ ec@@ re@@ tar@@ y-@@ G@@ ener@@ al of the United N@@ ations , K@@ of@@ i A@@ n@@ nan , gave a spe@@ ec@@ h at Y@@ al@@ e Uni@@ ver@@ sity , and that spe@@ ec@@ h was on the top@@ ic of inclu@@ sive globaliz@@ ation ."
That was the spe@@ ec@@ h in which he co@@ ined that ter@@ m .
"But ami@@ d au@@ st@@ er@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ cial c@@ ri@@ sis of 200@@ 8 , the con@@ cept di@@ sap@@ p@@ ea@@ red almost without a tra@@ ce ."
G@@ lo@@ b@@ aliz@@ ation has been taken to supp@@ ort a ne@@ o@@ liber@@ al ag@@ en@@ da .
It &apos;s perc@@ ei@@ ved to be part of an el@@ ite ag@@ en@@ da rather than something that bene@@ f@@ its all .
How can we bal@@ ance on the one hand ad@@ dre@@ s@@ sing fear and ali@@ ena@@ tion while on the other hand re@@ fu@@ sing ve@@ he@@ m@@ ently to give in to x@@ en@@ o@@ pho@@ bi@@ a and nati@@ ona@@ li@@ s@@ m ?
That is the question for all of us .
"And I think , as a social scienti@@ st , that social science off@@ ers some pla@@ ces to start ."
"O@@ ur trans@@ formation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point ."
The first rela@@ t@@ es to the idea of civi@@ c education .
What stan@@ ds out from B@@ re@@ x@@ it is the ga@@ p between publi@@ c perc@@ ep@@ tion and em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal reality .
So how can we — ( Applause ) How can we re@@ build resp@@ ect for tru@@ th and evidence into our liber@@ al democra@@ ci@@ es ?
"It has to beg@@ in with education , but it has to start with the re@@ cognition that there are hu@@ ge g@@ ap@@ s ."
The second thing that I think is an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity is the idea to en@@ coura@@ ge more inter@@ action across di@@ verse commun@@ ities .
"So for in@@ stance , L@@ on@@ don and the S@@ ou@@ the@@ a@@ st have the high@@ est numbers of im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ants , and they are also by far the most t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant are@@ as ."
It &apos;s those are@@ as of the country that have the lo@@ we@@ st lev@@ els of im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion that actually are the most ex@@ clu@@ si@@ ona@@ ry and int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to@@ wards mi@@ gr@@ ants .
This il@@ lu@@ st@@ ration from the F@@ in@@ an@@ cial T@@ im@@ es pos@@ t@@ -@@ B@@ re@@ x@@ it is really stri@@ king .
The f@@ our@@ th and fi@@ nal idea I want to put for@@ ward is an idea that we need more respon@@ sible politi@@ cs .
There &apos;s very little social science evidence that com@@ pa@@ res att@@ it@@ u@@ des on globaliz@@ ation .
I am still B@@ riti@@ sh .
I am still Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an .
I am still a global c@@ iti@@ z@@ en .

O@@ n@@ ly then will we truly re@@ con@@ ci@@ le demo@@ c@@ racy and globaliz@@ ation .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real plea@@ sure to be here .
I last did a TED T@@ al@@ k I think about seven years ago or so .
I talked about spa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ u@@ ce .
"And so many people , I g@@ ue@@ ss , watch those vi@@ de@@ os ."
"P@@ eople have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ u@@ ce , which is a wonderful thing in the sh@@ ort ter@@ m — ( Laughter ) but it &apos;s pro@@ ven to be less than ide@@ al over seven years ."
And so I though I would come and try and put spa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti sa@@ u@@ ce behind me .
( Laughter ) The the@@ me of this morning &apos;s se@@ s@@ sion is Th@@ ings We M@@ ake .
And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most preci@@ ous ob@@ jects of his era .
And the man &apos;s na@@ me is C@@ arl Norden .
C@@ arl Norden was born in 18@@ 8@@ 0 .
And he was S@@ wi@@ ss .
"And of course , the S@@ wi@@ ss can be divi@@ ded into two gener@@ al cat@@ e@@ g@@ ories : those who make small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , ex@@ pen@@ sive ob@@ jects and those who han@@ d@@ le the money of those who buy small , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite , ex@@ pen@@ sive ob@@ jects ."
And C@@ arl Norden is very fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly in the for@@ mer cam@@ p .
He &apos;s an engine@@ er .
He goes to the F@@ e@@ der@@ al P@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ ec@@ h in Z@@ u@@ rich .
"In fact , one of his cla@@ s@@ s@@ mat@@ es is a young man nam@@ ed L@@ en@@ in who would go on to b@@ rea@@ k small , ex@@ pen@@ sive , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ob@@ jects ."
"And he &apos;s a S@@ wi@@ ss engine@@ er , C@@ arl ."
And I mean that in its fu@@ lle@@ st sense of the word .
"He w@@ ear@@ s thre@@ e-@@ piece su@@ its ; and he has a very , very small , important mu@@ sta@@ che ; and he is dom@@ ine@@ ering and na@@ r@@ ci@@ ssi@@ stic and dri@@ ven and has an extra@@ ordinary e@@ go ; and he works 1@@ 6@@ -@@ h@@ our days ; and he has very strong feel@@ ings about al@@ ter@@ nat@@ ing curr@@ ent ; and he fe@@ els like a sun@@ tan is a sig@@ n of moral we@@ ak@@ ness ; and he dr@@ in@@ ks lots of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ; and he does his best work s@@ itt@@ ing in his mother &apos;s kit@@ ch@@ en in Z@@ u@@ rich for hours in complet@@ e si@@ l@@ ence with nothing but a sli@@ de ru@@ le ."
"In any case , C@@ arl Norden e@@ mi@@ g@@ rat@@ es to the United States just before the F@@ irst World War and s@@ ets up sh@@ op on L@@ a@@ fa@@ y@@ et@@ te S@@ tre@@ et in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan ."
And he becomes ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with the question of how to drop bomb@@ s from an ai@@ r@@ plan@@ e .
"Now if you think about it , in the age before G@@ P@@ S and ra@@ da@@ r , that was ob@@ vi@@ ously a really difficult problem ."
It &apos;s a comp@@ lic@@ ated physics problem .
"You &apos;ve got a plan@@ e that &apos;s thousands of fe@@ et up in the air , going at hund@@ re@@ ds of mi@@ les an h@@ our , and you &apos;re trying to drop an ob@@ ject , a bom@@ b , to@@ wards some sta@@ tionary tar@@ get in the face of all kinds of win@@ ds and cl@@ ou@@ d co@@ ver and all kinds of other im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments ."
"And all sor@@ ts of people , moving up to the F@@ irst World War and between the war@@ s , tried to sol@@ ve this problem , and ne@@ ar@@ ly everybody came up sh@@ ort ."
The bomb@@ si@@ ghts that were av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble were incredi@@ bly c@@ ru@@ de .
But C@@ arl Norden is really the one who cra@@ cks the co@@ de .
And he comes up with this incredi@@ bly comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ vice .
It we@@ i@@ gh@@ s about 50 l@@ b@@ s .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bombsight .
And it has all kinds of le@@ ver@@ s and bal@@ l-@@ be@@ ar@@ ings and g@@ ad@@ gets and g@@ au@@ ges .
And he makes this comp@@ lic@@ ated thing .
"And what he allo@@ ws people to do is he makes the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er take this particular ob@@ ject , vi@@ su@@ ally sight the tar@@ get , because they &apos;re in the P@@ le@@ x@@ ig@@ la@@ s c@@ one of the bomb@@ er , and then they p@@ lu@@ g in the al@@ tit@@ u@@ de of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the plan@@ e , the spe@@ ed of the w@@ ind and the co@@ ordi@@ nat@@ es of the tar@@ get ."
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bom@@ b .
"And as Norden fam@@ ously says , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ fore that bombsight came along , bomb@@ s would rou@@ tin@@ ely mi@@ ss their tar@@ get by a mi@@ le or more . &quot; &quot; But he said , with the Mar@@ k 15 Norden bombsight , he could drop a bom@@ b into a pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft ."
Now I cannot tell you how incredi@@ bly exc@@ ited the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
It was like man@@ na from he@@ a@@ ven .
"@@ Here was an ar@@ my that had just had experience in the F@@ irst World War , where mil@@ lions of men f@@ ou@@ ght each other in the tr@@ en@@ ches , getting no@@ where , making no progress , and here someone had come up with a de@@ vice that allowed them to f@@ ly up in the s@@ ki@@ es high ab@@ ove en@@ em@@ y ter@@ rit@@ ory and dest@@ ro@@ y w@@ hat@@ ever they wanted with p@@ in@@ point accu@@ racy ."
And the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary sp@@ ends 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars — billion dollars in 19@@ 40 dollars — develop@@ ing the Norden bombsight .
"And to put that in per@@ spec@@ tive , the to@@ tal cost of the M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan project was three billion dollars ."
H@@ al@@ f as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous mil@@ it@@ ar@@ y-@@ in@@ du@@ stri@@ al project of the modern era .
"And there were people , st@@ rat@@ e@@ gi@@ sts , within the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary who gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely thought that this single de@@ vice was going to sp@@ ell the difference between de@@ fe@@ at and vi@@ ct@@ ory when it came to the b@@ att@@ le against the N@@ a@@ z@@ is and against the J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se ."
"And for Norden as well , this de@@ vice had incredible moral im@@ por@@ tan@@ ce , because Norden was a comm@@ itt@@ ed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an ."
"In fact , he would always get up@@ set when people re@@ fer@@ red to the bombsight as his inv@@ ention , because in his ey@@ es , only G@@ od could inv@@ ent things ."
He was simply the in@@ stru@@ ment of G@@ od &apos;s will .
And what was G@@ od &apos;s will ?
Well G@@ od &apos;s will was that the amount of su@@ ffer@@ ing in any kind of war be re@@ duc@@ ed to as small an amount as possible .
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It allowed you to bom@@ b only those things that you ab@@ solutely needed and wanted to bom@@ b .
"So in the years lead@@ ing up to the S@@ econ@@ d World War , the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4@@ ,000 each — again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money ."
"And they tra@@ ined 5@@ 0,000 bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers on how to use them — long ex@@ ten@@ sive , mon@@ th@@ s@@ -@@ long tra@@ ining se@@ s@@ sions — because these things are essentially anal@@ o@@ g comp@@ uters ; they &apos;re not easy to use ."
"And they make every one of those bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers take an o@@ ath , to s@@ w@@ ear that if they &apos;re ever cap@@ tured , they will not di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge a single de@@ tai@@ l of this particular de@@ vice to the en@@ em@@ y , because it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ative the en@@ em@@ y not get their hands on this ab@@ solutely essential piece of technology ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever the Norden bombsight is taken on@@ to a plan@@ e , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a seri@@ es of ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds ."
And it &apos;s car@@ ried in a bo@@ x with a can@@ v@@ as sh@@ rou@@ d over it .
And the bo@@ x is han@@ d@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed to one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds .
It &apos;s never allowed to be phot@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ ed .
"And there &apos;s a little in@@ cen@@ di@@ ary de@@ vice inside of it , so that , if the plan@@ e ever cra@@ sh@@ es , it will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed and there &apos;s no way the en@@ em@@ y can ever get their hands on it ."
The Norden bombsight is the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ rai@@ l .
So what happens during the S@@ econ@@ d World War ?
"Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the H@@ o@@ ly G@@ rai@@ l ."
"In p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce , the Norden bombsight can drop a bom@@ b into a pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perf@@ ect conditions ."
"And of course , in war@@ time , conditions are@@ n &apos;t perf@@ ect ."
"F@@ irst of all , it &apos;s really hard to use — really hard to use ."
"And not all of the people who are of those 5@@ 0,000 men who are bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ ers have the ab@@ il@@ ity to prop@@ er@@ ly pro@@ gra@@ m an anal@@ o@@ g computer ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , it b@@ re@@ ak@@ s down a lot ."
"It &apos;s fu@@ ll of all kinds of g@@ y@@ ros@@ cop@@ es and pu@@ lle@@ ys and g@@ ad@@ gets and bal@@ l-@@ be@@ ar@@ ings , and they don &apos;t work as well as they ou@@ ght to in the he@@ at of b@@ att@@ le ."
"Th@@ ir@@ dly , when Norden was making his cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions , he as@@ sum@@ ed that a plan@@ e would be fl@@ ying at a relati@@ vely s@@ low spe@@ ed at low al@@ tit@@ u@@ des ."
"Well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get sh@@ ot down ."
So they started fl@@ ying them at high al@@ tit@@ u@@ des at incredi@@ bly high spe@@ e@@ ds .
And the Norden bombsight doesn &apos;t work as well under those conditions .
"But most of all , the Norden bombsight requi@@ red the bomb@@ ar@@ di@@ er to make vi@@ su@@ al con@@ ta@@ ct with the tar@@ get ."
"But of course , what happens in real life ?"
"There are cl@@ ou@@ ds , right ."
It needs cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less sk@@ y to be really accu@@ rate .
Well how many cl@@ ou@@ d@@ less s@@ ki@@ es do you think there were ab@@ ove C@@ ent@@ ral Eu@@ ro@@ pe between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
Not a lot .
"And then to give you a sense of just how i@@ na@@ c@@ cu@@ rate the Norden bombsight was , there was a famous case in 19@@ 4@@ 4 where the A@@ l@@ lies bomb@@ ed a che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant in L@@ e@@ una , G@@ er@@ many ."
And the che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant com@@ pri@@ sed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ res .
"And over the course of 2@@ 2 bomb@@ ing mis@@ sions , the A@@ l@@ lies drop@@ ped 8@@ 5,000 bomb@@ s on this 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ re che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , using the Norden bombsight ."
Well what perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of those bomb@@ s do you think actually lan@@ ded inside the 7@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re per@@ im@@ et@@ er of the pl@@ ant ?
10 percent . 10 percent .
"And of those 10 percent that lan@@ ded , 16 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were du@@ ds ."
"The L@@ e@@ una che@@ mi@@ cal pl@@ ant , after one of the most ex@@ ten@@ sive bomb@@ ings in the history of the war , was up and run@@ ning within weeks ."
"And by the way , all those pre@@ cau@@ tions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the N@@ a@@ z@@ is ?"
"Well it turns out that C@@ arl Norden , as a prop@@ er S@@ wi@@ ss , was very ena@@ mo@@ red of G@@ er@@ man engine@@ ers ."
"So in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , he hi@@ red a whole bun@@ ch of them , inclu@@ ding a man nam@@ ed H@@ er@@ mann L@@ ong who , in 19@@ 3@@ 8 , gave a complet@@ e set of the plan@@ s for the Norden bombsight to the N@@ a@@ z@@ is ."
"So they had their own Norden bombsight throu@@ gh@@ out the enti@@ re war — which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well ."
( Laughter ) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight ?
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts .
"We live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smar@@ t people run@@ ning around , saying that they &apos;ve inv@@ ent@@ ed g@@ ad@@ gets that will forever change our world ."
They &apos;ve inv@@ ent@@ ed w@@ eb@@ sit@@ es that will al@@ low people to be f@@ ree .
"They &apos;ve inv@@ ent@@ ed some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better ."
"If you go into the mil@@ it@@ ary , you &apos;ll find lots of C@@ arl Nor@@ d@@ ens as well ."
"If you go to the P@@ en@@ ta@@ g@@ on , they will say , &quot; &quot; You know what , now we really can put a bom@@ b inside a pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ l at 20@@ ,000 ft . &quot; &quot; And you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now ."
But we need to be very clear about how little that means .
"In the I@@ ra@@ q War , at the beginning of the first I@@ ra@@ q War , the U.S. mil@@ it@@ ary , the air force , sent two squ@@ ad@@ r@@ ons of F@@ -@@ 1@@ 5@@ E F@@ i@@ ghter E@@ ag@@ les to the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i de@@ ser@@ t equi@@ pp@@ ed with these five million dol@@ lar cam@@ er@@ as that allowed them to see the enti@@ re de@@ ser@@ t flo@@ or ."
"And their mis@@ sion was to find and to dest@@ ro@@ y — remem@@ ber the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le la@@ un@@ chers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the I@@ ra@@ q@@ is were la@@ un@@ ching at the I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ is ?"
The mis@@ sion of the two squ@@ ad@@ r@@ ons was to get ri@@ d of all the S@@ cu@@ d mis@@ si@@ le la@@ un@@ chers .
"And so they f@@ le@@ w mis@@ sions day and ni@@ ght , and they drop@@ ped thousands of bomb@@ s , and they fi@@ red thousands of mis@@ si@@ les in an att@@ emp@@ t to get ri@@ d of this particular s@@ cour@@ ge ."
"And after the war was over , there was an au@@ d@@ it done — as the ar@@ my always does , the air force always does — and they asked the question : how many S@@ cu@@ ds did we actually dest@@ ro@@ y ?"
You know what the answer was ?
"@@ Z@@ ero , not a single one ."
Now why is that ?
I@@ s it because their we@@ ap@@ ons wer@@ en &apos;t accu@@ rate ?
"O@@ h no , they were bri@@ l@@ li@@ antly accu@@ rate ."
"They could have dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed this little thing right here from 2@@ 5,000 ft ."
The issue was they didn &apos;t know where the S@@ cu@@ d la@@ un@@ chers were .
"The problem with bomb@@ s and pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ ls is not getting the bom@@ b inside the pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ l , it &apos;s kno@@ wing how to find the pi@@ ck@@ le bar@@ re@@ l ."
That &apos;s always been the har@@ der problem when it comes to fi@@ gh@@ ting war@@ s .
O@@ r take the b@@ att@@ le in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
What is the sig@@ nature we@@ ap@@ on of the C@@ I@@ A &apos;s war in Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st P@@ ak@@ istan ?
It &apos;s the dr@@ one . What is the dr@@ one ?
Well it is the grand@@ son of the Norden Mar@@ k 15 bombsight .
It is this we@@ ap@@ on of de@@ v@@ a@@ sta@@ ting accu@@ racy and preci@@ sion .
"And over the course of the last six years in Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st P@@ ak@@ istan , the C@@ I@@ A has flo@@ wn hund@@ re@@ ds of dr@@ one mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those d@@ ron@@ es to k@@ ill 2@@ ,000 su@@ spec@@ ted P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ i and T@@ ali@@ b@@ an mil@@ it@@ ants ."
Now what is the accu@@ racy of those d@@ ron@@ es ?
Well it &apos;s extra@@ ordinary .
We think we &apos;re now at 9@@ 5 percent accu@@ racy when it comes to dr@@ one stri@@ k@@ es .
"@@ 9@@ 5 percent of the people we k@@ ill need to be k@@ il@@ led , right ?"
That is one of the most extra@@ ordinary rec@@ or@@ ds in the history of modern war@@ f@@ are .
But do you know what the c@@ ru@@ cial thing is ?
"In that ex@@ act same per@@ i@@ od that we &apos;ve been using these d@@ ron@@ es with de@@ v@@ a@@ sta@@ ting accu@@ racy , the number of atta@@ cks , of su@@ i@@ ci@@ de atta@@ cks and ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st atta@@ cks , against American for@@ ces in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan has increas@@ ed ten@@ fo@@ ld ."
"As we have g@@ ot@@ ten more and more e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent in k@@ il@@ ling them , they have become ang@@ ri@@ er and ang@@ ri@@ er and more and more moti@@ v@@ ated to k@@ ill us ."
I have not descri@@ bed to you a success story .
I &apos;ve descri@@ bed to you the op@@ pos@@ ite of a success story .
And this is the problem with our inf@@ atu@@ ation with the things we make .
"We think the things we make can sol@@ ve our problems , but our problems are much more comp@@ le@@ x than that ."
"The issue isn &apos;t the accu@@ racy of the bomb@@ s you have , it &apos;s how you use the bomb@@ s you have , and more import@@ antly , whether you ou@@ ght to use bomb@@ s at all ."
There &apos;s a pos@@ t@@ scri@@ pt to the Norden story of C@@ arl Norden and his f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous bombsight .
"And that is , on Au@@ gu@@ st 6 , 19@@ 45 , a B@@ -@@ 2@@ 9 bomb@@ er called the E@@ no@@ la G@@ ay f@@ le@@ w over Japan and , using a Norden bombsight , drop@@ ped a very large ther@@ mon@@ u@@ clear de@@ vice on the city of H@@ i@@ ros@@ h@@ im@@ a ."
"And as was ty@@ pi@@ cal with the Norden bombsight , the bom@@ b actually mis@@ sed its tar@@ get by 8@@ 00 ft ."
"But of course , it didn &apos;t matter ."
And that &apos;s the great@@ est i@@ ron@@ y of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight .
"@@ the air force &apos;s 1@@ .@@ 5 billion dol@@ lar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dol@@ lar bom@@ b , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , back in New Y@@ or@@ k , no one told C@@ arl Norden that his bombsight was used over H@@ i@@ ros@@ h@@ im@@ a ."
He was a comm@@ itt@@ ed Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an .
He thought he had desig@@ ned something that would re@@ duce the t@@ ol@@ l of su@@ ffer@@ ing in war .
It would have brok@@ en his heart .
( Applause )
"( Applause ) Ma@@ la@@ la started her cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n for education and st@@ ood for her ri@@ ghts in 200@@ 7 , and when her eff@@ or@@ ts were hon@@ o@@ red in 20@@ 1@@ 1 , and she was given the national you@@ th p@@ ea@@ ce pri@@ ze , and she became a very famous , very popu@@ lar young girl of her country ."
"B@@ e@@ fore that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father ."
"@@ L@@ a@@ di@@ es and g@@ ent@@ le@@ men , if we g@@ lan@@ ce to human history , the story of women is the story of in@@ ju@@ stice , inequ@@ ality , violence and explo@@ itation ."
"You see , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her bir@@ th is not cel@@ eb@@ rat@@ ed ."
"She is not wel@@ com@@ ed , ne@@ i@@ ther by father nor by mother ."
"The ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od comes and com@@ mi@@ ser@@ ates with the mother , and no@@ body c@@ ong@@ ra@@ tu@@ lat@@ es the father ."
And a mother is very un@@ com@@ for@@ table for having a girl child .
"When she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sa@@ d ."
"When she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to the second daughter , she is sho@@ cked , and in the exp@@ ec@@ tation of a son , when she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to a thir@@ d daughter , she fe@@ els gu@@ il@@ ty like a c@@ ri@@ mi@@ nal ."
"@@ Not only the mother su@@ ff@@ ers , but the daughter , the ne@@ w@@ ly born daughter , when she gro@@ ws old , she su@@ ff@@ ers too ."
"A@@ t the age of five , while she should be going to school , she sta@@ ys at home and her bro@@ thers are ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ed in a school ."
She can have fu@@ n .
"She can pla@@ y with her friends in the stre@@ ets , and she can move around in the stre@@ ets like a b@@ ut@@ ter@@ f@@ ly ."
"But when she ent@@ ers her te@@ ens , when she becomes 1@@ 3 years old , she is for@@ bi@@ d@@ den to go out of her home without a ma@@ le es@@ c@@ ort ."
She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four wal@@ ls of her home .
She is no more a f@@ ree individu@@ al .
"She becomes the so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ thers and of her family , and if she trans@@ gre@@ s@@ ses the co@@ de of that so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or , she could even be k@@ il@@ led ."
"So this bro@@ ther , he sa@@ c@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sist@@ ers at the al@@ ta@@ r of so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or ."
"A good girl is supp@@ osed to be very qui@@ et , very hu@@ m@@ ble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive ."

"If she is mar@@ ried very early , she has to ac@@ cept ."
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , she will be called di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent ."
And what happens at the end ?
"In the words of a poet@@ ess , she is we@@ d@@ ded , be@@ d@@ ded , and then she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to more s@@ ons and d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters ."
"And it is the i@@ ron@@ y of the sit@@ u@@ ation that this mother , she teach@@ es the same le@@ s@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience to her daughter and the same le@@ s@@ son of hon@@ or to her s@@ ons ."
"And this vi@@ ci@@ ous c@@ y@@ cle goes on , goes on ."
"D@@ ear bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , when Ma@@ la@@ la was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like ne@@ w@@ born children , to be hon@@ est , but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es , believe me , I got extre@@ m@@ ely hon@@ o@@ red ."
"And long before she was born , I thought about her na@@ me , and I was f@@ as@@ ci@@ nat@@ ed with a h@@ er@@ oi@@ c le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y fre@@ e@@ dom fi@@ ghter in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
"H@@ er na@@ me was Ma@@ la@@ lai of M@@ ai@@ w@@ and , and I nam@@ ed my daughter after her ."
"A few days after Ma@@ la@@ la was born , my daughter was born , my cou@@ s@@ in came — and it was a co@@ inci@@ dence — he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ ai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it tra@@ ced back to 3@@ 00 years of our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors ."
"But when I looked , all were men , and I pi@@ cked my pen , dre@@ w a line from my na@@ me , and wrote , &quot; &quot; Ma@@ la@@ la . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ed her in my school ."
"You will be asking , then , why should I men@@ tion about the ad@@ mis@@ sion of a girl in a school ?"
"Y@@ es , I must men@@ tion it ."
"It may be taken for gr@@ ant@@ ed in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l societies , in tri@@ bal societies , it &apos;s a big ev@@ ent for the life of girl ."
E@@ n@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment in a school means re@@ cognition of her i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity and her na@@ me .
A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has ent@@ ered the world of dre@@ am@@ s and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions where she can ex@@ pl@@ ore her potenti@@ als for her future life .
"I have five sist@@ ers , and n@@ one of them could go to school , and you will be ast@@ oni@@ shed , two weeks before , when I was fil@@ ling out the C@@ ana@@ di@@ an vi@@ sa form , and I was fil@@ ling out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ nam@@ es of some of my sist@@ ers ."
That was the reason that I val@@ ue@@ d my daughter .
"What my father could not give to my sist@@ ers and to his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters , I thought I must change it ."
I used to ap@@ preci@@ ate the intelligence and the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ance of my daughter .
I en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed her to go with me to different me@@ eti@@ ngs .
"And all these good val@@ ues , I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her perso@@ na@@ lity ."
"And this was not only she , only Ma@@ la@@ la ."
"I im@@ par@@ ted all these good val@@ ues to my school , girl students and bo@@ y students as well ."
I used education for e@@ man@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion .
"I ta@@ u@@ ght my girls , I ta@@ u@@ ght my girl students , to un@@ learn the le@@ s@@ son of o@@ be@@ dience ."
I ta@@ u@@ ght my bo@@ y students to un@@ learn the le@@ s@@ son of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ hon@@ or .
"D@@ ear bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , we were stri@@ ving for more ri@@ ghts for women , and we were stru@@ gg@@ ling to have more , more and more space for the women in society ."
But we came across a new phenomen@@ on .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human ri@@ ghts and particu@@ larly to women &apos;s ri@@ ghts .
It was called T@@ ali@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation .
"It means a complet@@ e neg@@ ation of women &apos;s parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion in all political , economi@@ cal and social acti@@ v@@ ities ."
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of schools were lost .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ bit@@ ed from going to school .
W@@ om@@ en were for@@ ced to w@@ ear ve@@ il@@ s and they were st@@ op@@ ped from going to the mark@@ ets .
"M@@ u@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were si@@ l@@ enc@@ ed , girls were flo@@ gg@@ ed and sing@@ ers were k@@ il@@ led ."
"She wrote a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C blo@@ g , she vol@@ un@@ te@@ ered h@@ er@@ self for the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es do@@ cu@@ men@@ ta@@ ries , and she sp@@ oke from every pla@@ t@@ form she could ."
And her v@@ oi@@ ce was the most power@@ ful v@@ oi@@ ce .
It sp@@ read like a cre@@ sc@@ en@@ do all around the world .
"And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an could not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate her cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , and on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 9 20@@ 12 , she was sh@@ ot in the head at point bl@@ ank range ."
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black h@@ ole .
"W@@ hi@@ le my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and death , I whi@@ s@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of my wife , &quot; &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I be bl@@ am@@ ed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she ab@@ rup@@ tly told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease don &apos;t bl@@ ame yourself ."
You st@@ ood for the right cause .
"You put your life at s@@ take for the cause of tru@@ th , for the cause of p@@ ea@@ ce , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in in@@ spi@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you ."
"You both were on the right pat@@ h and G@@ od will prot@@ ect her . &quot; &quot; These few words me@@ ant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again ."
"When Ma@@ la@@ la was in the h@@ os@@ pit@@ al , and she was going through the se@@ v@@ ere pa@@ ins and she had had se@@ v@@ ere he@@ a@@ da@@ ches because her fac@@ i@@ al ner@@ ve was c@@ ut down , I used to see a dark sha@@ do@@ w sp@@ read@@ ing on the face of my wife ."
But my daughter never com@@ pla@@ ined .
"She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m f@@ ine with my c@@ ro@@ ok@@ ed s@@ mi@@ le and with my numb@@ ness in my face ."
"I &apos;ll be ok@@ ay . P@@ lease don &apos;t wor@@ ry . &quot; &quot; She was a so@@ la@@ ce for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us ."
"D@@ ear bro@@ thers and sist@@ ers , we learned from her how to be re@@ si@@ li@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d to share with you that de@@ sp@@ ite being an i@@ c@@ on for the ri@@ ghts of children and women , she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old girl ."
She c@@ ries when her hom@@ e@@ work is in@@ complet@@ e .
"She quar@@ re@@ ls with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that ."
"P@@ eople ask me , what speci@@ al is in my m@@ ent@@ or@@ ship which has made Ma@@ la@@ la so bo@@ ld and so coura@@ ge@@ ous and so v@@ o@@ cal and po@@ ised ?"
"I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did ."
A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do .
"I did not cli@@ p her w@@ ings , and that &apos;s all ."
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about h@@ op@@ e@@ fully con@@ ver@@ ting fear into ho@@ pe .
"When we go to the physi@@ ci@@ an today — when we go to the doc@@ tor &apos;s of@@ fi@@ ce and we wal@@ k in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear ."
There are words that we &apos;re truly af@@ rai@@ d of .
"D@@ i@@ ab@@ et@@ es , can@@ cer , P@@ ar@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , A@@ l@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er &apos;s , heart fai@@ lu@@ re , l@@ un@@ g fai@@ lu@@ re — things that we know are de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating dise@@ ases , for which there &apos;s relati@@ vely little that can be done ."
"And what I want to la@@ y out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will m@@ el@@ t down if you think it already ha@@ sn &apos;t , and where we are cl@@ ini@@ cally today , and where we might go tom@@ or@@ row , and what some of the hu@@ r@@ d@@ les are ."
"And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 1@@ 8 minutes , I pr@@ omi@@ se ."
"I want to start with this sli@@ de , because this sli@@ de sort of tells the story the way S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine thin@@ ks of it ."
This was an issue from 200@@ 2 that they published with a lot of different ar@@ ti@@ c@@ les on the bi@@ oni@@ c human .
It was basically a re@@ gener@@ ative medicine issue .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medicine is an extra@@ ordina@@ ri@@ ly simple con@@ cept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating the pa@@ ce at which the body he@@ als itself to a cl@@ ini@@ cally re@@ lev@@ ant tim@@ es@@ cal@@ e .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
"We know that if we have a dam@@ ag@@ ed hi@@ p , you can put an ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial hi@@ p in ."
And this is the idea that S@@ ci@@ ence M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine used on their front co@@ ver .
This is the complet@@ e anti@@ the@@ sis of re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
This is not re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
R@@ e@@ gener@@ ative medicine is what B@@ u@@ siness W@@ e@@ ek put up when they did a story about re@@ gener@@ ative medicine not too long ago .
"The idea is that instead of figu@@ ring out how to am@@ eli@@ o@@ rate sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s with de@@ vi@@ ces and dru@@ gs and the like — and I &apos;ll come back to that the@@ me a few times — instead of doing that , we will re@@ gener@@ ate lost fun@@ ction of the body by re@@ gener@@ ating the fun@@ ction of org@@ ans and dam@@ ag@@ ed tis@@ sue ."
"So that at the end of the treat@@ ment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treat@@ ment ."
V@@ ery few good ideas — if you ag@@ ree that this is a good idea — very few good ideas are truly nov@@ el .
And this is just the same .
"If you look back in history , C@@ har@@ les L@@ in@@ d@@ ber@@ gh , who was better known for fl@@ ying ai@@ r@@ plan@@ es , was actually one of the first people along with A@@ le@@ x@@ is C@@ ar@@ re@@ l , one of the No@@ be@@ l L@@ au@@ re@@ ates from R@@ o@@ ck@@ e@@ f@@ el@@ ler , to beg@@ in to think about , could you culture org@@ ans ?"
"And they published this book in 19@@ 3@@ 7 , where they actually beg@@ an to think about , what could you do in bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tors to grow whole org@@ ans ?"
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exc@@ iting work that &apos;s going on .
"But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my de@@ pres@@ sion about the health care system and the need for this with you ."
"M@@ any of the tal@@ ks y@@ est@@ er@@ day talked about im@@ pro@@ ving the qu@@ ality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing po@@ ver@@ ty , and essentially increas@@ ing life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y all around the glo@@ be ."
"One of the challeng@@ es is that the rich@@ er we are , the longer we live ."
"And the longer we live , the more ex@@ pen@@ sive it is to take care of our dise@@ ases as we get older ."
This is simply the we@@ al@@ th of a country ver@@ su@@ s the percent of population over the age of 6@@ 5 .
"And you can basically see that the rich@@ er a country is , the older the people are within it ."
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particu@@ larly d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c challenge right now ?
"If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a brok@@ en an@@ k@@ le every now and again , maybe a little bit of as@@ th@@ ma ."
"If the average age in your country is 45 to 5@@ 5 , now the average person is looking at diab@@ et@@ es , ear@@ l@@ y-@@ on@@ set diab@@ et@@ es , heart fai@@ lu@@ re , cor@@ ona@@ ry ar@@ ter@@ y disease — things that are in@@ h@@ er@@ ently more difficult to treat , and much more ex@@ pen@@ sive to treat ."
Just have a look at the demo@@ gra@@ phi@@ cs in the U.S. here .
"This is from &quot; &quot; The U@@ n@@ ti@@ ed States of America . &quot; &quot; In 19@@ 30 , there were 4@@ 1 work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree ."
"@@ 4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really si@@ ck , pa@@ ying for the one re@@ ti@@ ree who was experiencing de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"In 20@@ 10 , two work@@ ers per re@@ ti@@ ree in the U.S@@ ."
"And this is mat@@ ched in every in@@ du@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed , we@@ al@@ thy country in the world ."
How can you actually aff@@ or@@ d to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age ver@@ su@@ s cost of health care .
"And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a su@@ d@@ den sp@@ ik@@ e in the cost of health care ."
"It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individu@@ al sp@@ end on your own health care , pl@@ ot@@ ted over your li@@ fe@@ time ."
"And about seven years before you &apos;re about to di@@ e , there &apos;s a sp@@ ik@@ e ."
And you can actually — ( Laughter ) — we won &apos;t get into that . ( Laughter )
"There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of dise@@ ases and experience what I would call heal@@ thy ag@@ ing ."
"I &apos;d su@@ ggest there are four things , and n@@ one of these things inclu@@ de an in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce system or a le@@ g@@ al system ."
A@@ ll those things do is change who pa@@ ys .
They don &apos;t actually change what the ac@@ tual cost of the treat@@ ment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that any@@ more . It &apos;s too de@@ pres@@ sing .
You can pre@@ v@@ ent .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously a lot of mon@@ ies should be put into pre@@ v@@ ention .
"But perhaps most interesting , to me any@@ way , and most important , is the idea of di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ ing a disease much ear@@ li@@ er on in the progre@@ s@@ sion , and then tre@@ ating the disease to cu@@ re the disease instead of tre@@ ating a sy@@ mp@@ tom ."
"Th@@ ink of it in terms of diab@@ et@@ es , for in@@ stance ."
"T@@ o@@ day , with diab@@ et@@ es , what do we do ?"
"We di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease even@@ tually , once it becomes sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic , and then we treat the sy@@ mp@@ tom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years ."
And we do O@@ K . In@@ sul@@ in &apos;s a pretty good ther@@ ap@@ y .
"But even@@ tually it st@@ op@@ s working , and diab@@ et@@ es lea@@ ds to a predic@@ table on@@ set of de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease ."
"Wh@@ y cou@@ ldn &apos;t we just in@@ ject the pan@@ cre@@ as with something to re@@ gener@@ ate the pan@@ cre@@ as early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was sy@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ?"
"And it might be a little bit ex@@ pen@@ sive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different ."
"This vi@@ de@@ o , I think , gets across the con@@ cept that I &apos;m talking about quite d@@ ram@@ ati@@ cally ."
This is a ne@@ wt re@@ -@@ gro@@ wing its lim@@ b .
"If a ne@@ wt can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?"
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important fe@@ atures about lim@@ b re@@ generation in a moment .
"But what we &apos;re talking about in re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is doing this in every org@@ an system of the body , for tis@@ sue@@ s and for org@@ ans themselves ."
"So today &apos;s reality is that if we get si@@ ck , the message is we will treat your sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s , and you need to ad@@ just to a new way of life ."
"I would p@@ ose to you that tom@@ or@@ row — and when tom@@ or@@ row is we could de@@ b@@ ate , but it &apos;s within the fore@@ see@@ able future — we will talk about re@@ gener@@ ative re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation ."
"There &apos;s a lim@@ b p@@ ros@@ the@@ tic up here , si@@ mi@@ lar actually one on the sol@@ di@@ er that &apos;s come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
There are 3@@ 70 sol@@ di@@ ers that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q that have lost li@@ mb@@ s .
"I@@ mag@@ ine if instead of fac@@ ing that , they could actually face the re@@ generation of that lim@@ b ."
It &apos;s a wi@@ ld con@@ cept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working to@@ wards that con@@ cept .
"But it &apos;s app@@ lic@@ able , again , to every org@@ an system ."
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to devel@@ op a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to s@@ wit@@ ch on proc@@ es@@ ses that we knew how to do when we were a fe@@ tu@@ s .
"A m@@ am@@ ma@@ li@@ an fe@@ tu@@ s , if it l@@ os@@ es a lim@@ b during the first tri@@ me@@ ster of pre@@ g@@ nan@@ c@@ y , will re@@ -@@ grow that lim@@ b ."
So our D@@ N@@ A has the cap@@ ac@@ ity to do these kinds of w@@ oun@@ d-@@ heal@@ ing mechan@@ is@@ ms .
"It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age ."
"In a child , before the age of about six months , if they l@@ ose their fi@@ ng@@ er@@ tip in an ac@@ ci@@ dent , they &apos;ll re@@ -@@ grow their fi@@ ng@@ er@@ tip ."
"B@@ y the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that any@@ more ."
"So to eng@@ age in that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language ."
And there are certain to@@ ols in our to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x that al@@ low us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these to@@ ols through which to con@@ verse with the body .
The first is cel@@ lu@@ lar ther@@ ap@@ ies .
"C@@ lear@@ ly , we he@@ al ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work ."
"Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ pl@@ ant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing ."
"S@@ econ@@ dly , we can use materi@@ als ."
We heard y@@ est@@ er@@ day about the im@@ por@@ tan@@ ce of new materi@@ als .
"If we can inv@@ ent materi@@ als , desig@@ n materi@@ als , or extra@@ ct materi@@ als from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materi@@ als in@@ duce the body to he@@ al itself ."
"And finally , we may be able to use smar@@ t de@@ vi@@ ces that will off@@ lo@@ ad the work of the body and al@@ low it to he@@ al ."
"I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materi@@ als ."
S@@ te@@ ve B@@ ad@@ y@@ lak — who &apos;s at the Uni@@ ver@@ sity of P@@ itt@@ s@@ bur@@ gh — about a dec@@ a@@ de ago had a re@@ mark@@ able idea .
"And that idea was that the small int@@ est@@ ine of a pi@@ g , if you thre@@ w away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to re@@ main bio@@ logi@@ cally ac@@ tive , may con@@ tain all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary fac@@ tors and sig@@ nals that would sig@@ nal the body to he@@ al itself ."
And he asked a very important question .
"He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that u@@ su@@ ally in@@ duc@@ es heal@@ ing in the small int@@ est@@ ine , and I place it some@@ where else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tis@@ sue@@ -@@ speci@@ fi@@ c respon@@ se , or would it make small int@@ est@@ ine if I tried to make a new ear ?"
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it wer@@ en &apos;t comp@@ el@@ ling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a comp@@ el@@ ling picture .
"( Laughter ) H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , for those of you that are even the sli@@ gh@@ test bit squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish — even though you may not like to ad@@ mit it in front of your friends — the li@@ ghts are down . This is a good time to look at your fe@@ et , ch@@ ec@@ k your B@@ la@@ ck@@ ber@@ ry , do anything other than look at the scre@@ en . ( Laughter )"
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer .
And al@@ though — it &apos;s good to la@@ u@@ gh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diab@@ et@@ es .
"I think a lot of times we hear about diab@@ eti@@ cs , diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , we just don &apos;t con@@ n@@ ect the ul@@ cer with the even@@ tual treat@@ ment , which is am@@ pu@@ tation , if you can &apos;t he@@ al it ."
So I &apos;m going to put the sli@@ de up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer . It &apos;s tra@@ gi@@ c .
The treat@@ ment for this is am@@ pu@@ tation .
"This is an older la@@ dy . She has can@@ cer of the li@@ ver as well as diab@@ et@@ es , and has decided to di@@ e with what &apos; s left of her body in@@ ta@@ ct ."
"And this la@@ dy decided , after a year of att@@ emp@@ ted treat@@ ment of that ul@@ cer , that she would try this new ther@@ ap@@ y that S@@ te@@ ve inv@@ ent@@ ed ."
That &apos;s what the w@@ ound looked like 1@@ 1 weeks later .
That material con@@ ta@@ ined only natural sig@@ nals .
And that material in@@ duc@@ ed the body to s@@ wit@@ ch back on a heal@@ ing respon@@ se that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more di@@ stre@@ s@@ sing sli@@ des for those of you — I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a h@@ or@@ se . The h@@ or@@ se is not in pain .
"If the h@@ or@@ se was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this sli@@ de ."
The h@@ or@@ se just has another n@@ os@@ tri@@ l that &apos;s developed because of a ri@@ ding ac@@ ci@@ dent .
"@@ Just a few weeks after treat@@ ment — in this case , taking that material , tur@@ ning it into a g@@ el , and pa@@ cking that are@@ a , and then re@@ pe@@ ating the treat@@ ment a few times — and the h@@ or@@ se he@@ als up ."
"And if you took an ul@@ tra@@ sound of that are@@ a , it would look great ."
Here &apos;s a dol@@ ph@@ in where the f@@ in &apos;s been re@@ -@@ atta@@ ched .
"There are now 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 patients around the world who have used that material to he@@ al their w@@ oun@@ ds ."
C@@ ould you re@@ gener@@ ate a lim@@ b ?
D@@ A@@ R@@ P@@ A just gave S@@ te@@ ve 15 million dollars to le@@ ad an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ in@@ stit@@ ution project to beg@@ in the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dol@@ lar picture .
This is a 7@@ 8 year-@@ old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fi@@ ng@@ er@@ tip .
R@@ em@@ em@@ ber that I men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed before the children who l@@ ose their fi@@ ng@@ er@@ ti@@ ps .
Af@@ ter treat@@ ment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is cl@@ ini@@ cally re@@ lev@@ ant today .
There are materi@@ als that do this . Here are the heart pat@@ ches .
But could you go a little fu@@ r@@ ther ?
"C@@ ould you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and re@@ move a dam@@ ag@@ ed piece of tis@@ sue , put a bio@@ -@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able material on there ?"
You can see here a little bit of heart mu@@ sc@@ le be@@ ating in a di@@ sh .
This was done by T@@ er@@ u@@ o O@@ kan@@ o at T@@ ok@@ y@@ o W@@ om@@ en &apos;s H@@ os@@ pit@@ al .
He can actually grow be@@ ating tis@@ sue in a di@@ sh .
"He chil@@ ls the di@@ sh , it changes its prop@@ er@@ ti@@ es and he pe@@ els it right out of the di@@ sh ."
It &apos;s the co@@ o@@ le@@ st stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cel@@ l-@@ based re@@ generation .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being re@@ mo@@ ved from the hi@@ p of a pati@@ ent .
"A@@ g@@ ain , if you &apos;re squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to watch ."
But this one &apos;s kind of co@@ ol .
"So this is a b@@ y@@ pa@@ ss oper@@ ation , just like what A@@ l G@@ ore had , with a difference ."
"In this case , at the end of the b@@ y@@ pa@@ ss oper@@ ation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the pati@@ ent that were re@@ mo@@ ved at the beginning of the proc@@ e@@ du@@ re being in@@ jec@@ ted direc@@ tly into the heart of the pati@@ ent ."
And I &apos;m standing up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
"@@ Here go the stem cells , right into the be@@ ating heart of the pati@@ ent ."
"And if you look really care@@ fully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a ba@@ ck@@ -@@ flu@@ sh ."
You see the cells coming back out .
"We need all sor@@ ts of new technology , new de@@ vi@@ ces , to get the cells to the right place at the right time ."
"@@ Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data ."
This was a rand@@ omi@@ zed tri@@ al .
A@@ t this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
"B@@ a@@ sically , if you take an extre@@ m@@ ely si@@ ck pati@@ ent and you give them a b@@ y@@ pa@@ ss , they get a little bit better ."
"If you give them stem cells as well as their b@@ y@@ pa@@ ss , for these particular patients , they became as@@ y@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic ."
These are now two years out .
"The co@@ o@@ le@@ st thing would be is if you could di@@ ag@@ n@@ ose the disease early , and pre@@ v@@ ent the on@@ set of the disease to a bad state ."
"This is the same proc@@ e@@ du@@ re , but now done min@@ ima@@ lly inv@@ a@@ si@@ vely , with only three h@@ ol@@ es in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply in@@ jec@@ ting stem cells through a lap@@ ar@@ os@@ cop@@ ic proc@@ e@@ du@@ re ."
There go the cells .
"We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those de@@ tail@@ s , but basically , that works too ."
"You can take patients who are less si@@ ck , and bring them back to an almost as@@ y@@ mp@@ to@@ ma@@ tic state through that kind of ther@@ ap@@ y ."
"@@ Here &apos;s another example of st@@ em@@ -@@ cell ther@@ ap@@ y that isn &apos;t quite cl@@ ini@@ cal yet , but I think very so@@ on will be ."
"This is the work of K@@ ac@@ ey Mar@@ ra from P@@ itt@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , along with a number of colle@@ ag@@ ues around the world ."
"They &apos;ve decided that li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction flu@@ id , which — in the United States , we have a lot of li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction flu@@ id ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great sour@@ ce of stem cells .
S@@ te@@ m cells are pa@@ cked in that li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction flu@@ id .
"So you could go in , you could get your tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ tu@@ ck ."
"O@@ ut comes the li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction flu@@ id , and in this case , the stem cells are i@@ so@@ lated and turned into neurons ."
A@@ ll done in the la@@ b .
"And I think fai@@ r@@ ly so@@ on , you will see patients being tre@@ ated with their own f@@ at@@ -@@ d@@ eri@@ ved , or a@@ di@@ pos@@ e-@@ d@@ eri@@ ved , stem cells ."
I talked before about the use of de@@ vi@@ ces to d@@ ram@@ ati@@ cally change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I cl@@ ose up .
This is equ@@ ally tra@@ gi@@ c .
"We have a very ab@@ i@@ ding and hear@@ t@@ b@@ re@@ ak@@ ing par@@ tn@@ er@@ ship with our colle@@ ag@@ ues at the In@@ stit@@ ute for S@@ ur@@ gi@@ cal R@@ e@@ sear@@ ch in the U@@ S A@@ r@@ my , who have to treat the now 1@@ 1@@ ,000 kids that have come back from I@@ ra@@ q ."
M@@ any of those patients are very se@@ ver@@ ely bur@@ ned .
"And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about bur@@ n , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it ."
E@@ very@@ thing that is done to treat bur@@ n — basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding approach .
"We make something over here , and then we tran@@ sp@@ l@@ ant it on@@ to the sit@@ e of the w@@ ound , and we try and get the two to take ."
"In this case here , a new , w@@ ea@@ ra@@ ble bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor has been desig@@ ned — it should be te@@ sted cl@@ ini@@ cally later this year at I@@ S@@ R — by Jo@@ er@@ g G@@ er@@ la@@ ch in P@@ itt@@ s@@ bur@@ gh ."
And that bio@@ -@@ re@@ ac@@ tor will la@@ y down in the w@@ ound bed .
The gu@@ n that you see there sp@@ ra@@ ys cells .
That &apos;s going to sp@@ ra@@ y cells over that are@@ a .
"The re@@ ac@@ tor will serve to fer@@ ti@@ li@@ ze the environment , d@@ eli@@ ver other things as well at the same time , and ther@@ e@@ fore we will se@@ ed that la@@ wn , as op@@ pos@@ ed to try the so@@ d@@ ding approach ."
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 1@@ 8 minutes is up .
"So let me fin@@ ish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news ."
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very power@@ ful work .
C@@ lear@@ ly the imag@@ es kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredi@@ bly difficult because it &apos;s high@@ ly inter@@ -@@ dis@@ ci@@ p@@ li@@ na@@ ry .
A@@ l@@ most every field of science engine@@ ering and cl@@ ini@@ cal p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce is inv@@ ol@@ ved in trying to get this to happen .
"A number of gover@@ nm@@ ents , and a number of regi@@ ons , have recogni@@ zed that this is a new way to treat disease ."
"The J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se government were perhaps the first , when they decided to inv@@ est first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field ."
It &apos;s no co@@ inci@@ dence .
Japan is the ol@@ de@@ st country on ear@@ th in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system di@@ es .
So they &apos;re put@@ ting a lot of st@@ rat@@ e@@ gi@@ c inv@@ est@@ ment focu@@ sed in this are@@ a .
"The Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an Uni@@ on , same thing ."
"@@ China , the same thing ."
China just la@@ un@@ ched a national tis@@ sue@@ -@@ engine@@ ering center .
The first year bu@@ d@@ get was 2@@ 50 million U@@ S dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a some@@ what different approach .
"( Laughter ) O@@ h , for A@@ l G@@ ore to come and be in the real world as pre@@ si@@ dent ."
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fun@@ d things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no st@@ rat@@ e@@ gi@@ c inv@@ est@@ ment to bring all of the nec@@ ess@@ ary things to be@@ ar and focu@@ s them in a care@@ ful way .
"And I &apos;m going to fin@@ ish up with a quot@@ e , maybe a little ch@@ ea@@ p sh@@ ot , at the direc@@ tor of the N@@ I@@ H , who &apos;s a very char@@ ming man ."
"M@@ y@@ self and J@@ ay V@@ ac@@ an@@ ti from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d went to vi@@ sit with him and a number of his direc@@ tors of his in@@ stit@@ ute just a few months ago , to try and con@@ v@@ in@@ ce him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 2@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and focu@@ s it , in a st@@ rat@@ e@@ gi@@ c way , to make sure we can ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ate the pa@@ ce at which these things get to patients ."
"And at the end of a very te@@ st@@ y me@@ eting , what the N@@ I@@ H direc@@ tor said was , &quot; Y@@ our vision is lar@@ ger than our app@@ et@@ ite . &quot;"
"I &apos;d like to cl@@ ose by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his app@@ et@@ ite ."
Thank you .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple re@@ qu@@ est .
"I &apos;d like all of you to pa@@ use for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched we@@ ak@@ li@@ ngs , and take st@@ o@@ ck of your mi@@ ser@@ able exi@@ st@@ ence ."
( Laughter ) Now that was the ad@@ vice that S@@ t@@ . B@@ ene@@ dic@@ t gave his rather star@@ t@@ led follo@@ w@@ ers in the fi@@ f@@ th century .
It was the ad@@ vice that I decided to fol@@ low myself when I turned 40 .
"@@ U@@ p until that moment , I had been that cla@@ s@@ sic cor@@ po@@ rate war@@ ri@@ or — I was e@@ ating too much , I was dr@@ in@@ king too much , I was working too hard and I was neg@@ lec@@ ting the family ."
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
"In particular , I decided I would try to ad@@ dre@@ ss the th@@ or@@ ny issue of work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
"So I ste@@ pp@@ ed back from the work@@ force , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children ."
But all I learned about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance from that year was that I found it quite easy to bal@@ ance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
"( Laughter ) Not a very u@@ se@@ ful sk@@ ill , es@@ p@@ eci@@ ally when the money run@@ s out ."
"So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve spent these seven years since stru@@ gg@@ ling with , stud@@ ying and writ@@ ing about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance ."
And I have four observ@@ ations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
"The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an hon@@ est de@@ b@@ ate ."
But the tr@@ ou@@ ble is so many people talk so much ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh about work@@ -@@ life bal@@ ance .
"All the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sions about f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ -@@ time or dre@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ down F@@ ri@@ days or pat@@ er@@ n@@ ity leave only serve to mas@@ k the c@@ ore issue , which is that certain job and care@@ er cho@@ i@@ ces are fund@@ am@@ en@@ tally in@@ com@@ pati@@ ble with being mean@@ ing@@ fully eng@@ ag@@ ed on a da@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ day ba@@ sis with a young family ."
Now the first step in sol@@ ving any problem is ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing the reality of the sit@@ u@@ ation you &apos;re in .
"And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there lead@@ ing lives of qui@@ et , scre@@ am@@ ing de@@ s@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at j@@ ob@@ s they ha@@ te to ena@@ ble them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ pre@@ ss people they don &apos;t like ."
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s my con@@ ten@@ tion that going to work on F@@ ri@@ day in j@@ e@@ ans and &#91; a &#93; T@@ -@@ shi@@ r@@ t isn &apos;t really getting to the nu@@ b of the issue . ( Laughter )
The second observ@@ ation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the tru@@ th that gover@@ nm@@ ents and cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions are@@ n &apos;t going to sol@@ ve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individu@@ als to take control and respon@@ si@@ bility for the ty@@ pe of lives that we want to le@@ ad .
"If you don &apos;t desig@@ n your life , someone else will desig@@ n it for you , and you may just not like their idea of bal@@ ance ."
"It &apos;s particu@@ larly important — this isn &apos;t on the World W@@ i@@ de W@@ eb , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fi@@ red — it &apos;s particu@@ larly important that you never put the qu@@ ality of your life in the hands of a comm@@ er@@ cial cor@@ po@@ ration ."
"Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad compan@@ ies — the &quot; &quot; ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s of the human s@@ ou@@ l , &quot; &quot; as I call them ."
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about all compan@@ ies .
Because comm@@ er@@ cial compan@@ ies are in@@ h@@ er@@ ently desig@@ ned to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
"It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their D@@ N@@ A ; it &apos;s what they do — even the good , well-@@ int@@ enti@@ on@@ ed compan@@ ies ."
"O@@ n the one hand , put@@ ting chil@@ d@@ care fac@@ il@@ ities in the work@@ place is wonderful and en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed ."
"O@@ n the other hand , it &apos;s a ni@@ ght@@ mare — it just means you sp@@ end more time at the blo@@ o@@ dy of@@ fi@@ ce ."
We have to be respon@@ sible for s@@ etting and en@@ for@@ c@@ ing the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies that we want in our life .
The thir@@ d observ@@ ation is we have to be care@@ ful with the time f@@ r@@ ame that we choose up@@ on which to ju@@ dge our bal@@ ance .
"B@@ e@@ fore I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a de@@ tail@@ ed , st@@ ep@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step descri@@ p@@ tion of the ide@@ al bal@@ an@@ ced day that I as@@ pi@@ red to ."
And it went like this : w@@ ake up well re@@ sted after a good ni@@ ght &apos;s s@@ le@@ ep .
H@@ a@@ ve sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g .
H@@ a@@ ve b@@ re@@ ak@@ fa@@ st with my wife and children .
H@@ a@@ ve sex again .
( Laughter ) D@@ ri@@ ve the kids to school on the way to the of@@ fi@@ ce .
Do three hours &apos; work .
P@@ la@@ y a sp@@ ort with a fri@@ end at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
M@@ e@@ et some mat@@ es in the pu@@ b for an early even@@ ing dr@@ ink .
D@@ ri@@ ve home for din@@ ner with my wife and kids .
M@@ e@@ dit@@ ate for half an h@@ our .
H@@ a@@ ve sex .
W@@ al@@ k the do@@ g . H@@ a@@ ve sex again .
G@@ o to bed .
( Applause ) How of@@ ten do you think I have that day ?
( Laughter ) We need to be re@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
"We need to el@@ ong@@ ate the time f@@ r@@ ame up@@ on which we ju@@ dge the bal@@ ance in our life , but we need to el@@ ong@@ ate it without f@@ al@@ ling into the tra@@ p of the &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I re@@ ti@@ re , when my kids have left home , when my wife has di@@ v@@ or@@ ced me , my health is fai@@ ling , I &apos;ve got no mat@@ es or interest@@ s left . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A day is too sh@@ ort ; &quot; &quot; after I re@@ ti@@ re &quot; &quot; is too long ."
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A f@@ our@@ th observ@@ ation : We need to approach bal@@ ance in a bal@@ an@@ ced way .
"A fri@@ end came to see me last year — and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story — a fri@@ end came to see me last year and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ig@@ el , I &apos;ve read your book ."
And I realiz@@ e that my life is completely out of bal@@ ance .
It &apos;s to@@ tally d@@ omi@@ nat@@ ed by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I com@@ mu@@ te two hours a day .
A@@ ll of my relation@@ shi@@ ps have fai@@ led .
There &apos;s nothing in my life ap@@ art from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a g@@ ri@@ p and sort it out .
"So I jo@@ ined a g@@ y@@ m . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now I don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a fit 10@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day of@@ fi@@ ce ra@@ t isn &apos;t more bal@@ an@@ ced ; it &apos;s more fit . ( Laughter )"
"@@ Lo@@ vely though physical ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se may be , there are other parts to life — there &apos;s the intel@@ lec@@ tual side ; there &apos;s the em@@ oti@@ onal side ; there &apos;s the spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al side ."
"And to be bal@@ an@@ ced , I believe we have to att@@ end to all of those are@@ as — not just do 50 st@@ o@@ ma@@ ch c@@ run@@ ches ."
Now that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
"Because people say , &quot; &quot; B@@ lo@@ o@@ dy h@@ ell mate , I ha@@ ven &apos;t got time to get fit ."
You want me to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and call my mother . &quot; &quot; And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be da@@ un@@ ting .
But an inci@@ dent that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new per@@ spec@@ tive .
"M@@ y wife , who is some@@ where in the au@@ dience today , called me up at the of@@ fi@@ ce and said , &quot; &quot; N@@ ig@@ el , you need to pi@@ ck our you@@ ng@@ est son &quot; &quot; — H@@ ar@@ ry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; Because she had to be some@@ where else with the other three children for that even@@ ing ."
So I left work an h@@ our early that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on and pi@@ cked H@@ ar@@ ry up at the school g@@ ates .
"We wal@@ ked down to the lo@@ cal par@@ k , mes@@ sed around on the s@@ w@@ ings , play@@ ed some si@@ lly g@@ am@@ es ."
"I then wal@@ ked him up the h@@ ill to the lo@@ cal ca@@ fe , and we sha@@ red a pi@@ z@@ za for two , then wal@@ ked down the h@@ ill to our home , and I gave him his b@@ ath and put him in his B@@ at@@ man pa@@ j@@ am@@ as ."
"I then read him a chap@@ ter of R@@ o@@ al@@ d D@@ a@@ h@@ l &apos;s &quot; &quot; J@@ am@@ es and the G@@ i@@ ant P@@ each . &quot; &quot; I then put him to bed , tu@@ cked him in , gave him a ki@@ ss on his fore@@ head and said , &quot; &quot; Go@@ od@@ ni@@ ght , mate , &quot; &quot; and wal@@ ked out of his be@@ d@@ room ."
"As I was walking out of his be@@ d@@ room , he said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad ? &quot; &quot; I went , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , mate ? &quot; &quot; He went , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot; &quot; I ha@@ dn &apos;t done anything , ha@@ dn &apos;t taken him to D@@ is@@ ne@@ y World or b@@ ou@@ ght him a P@@ lay@@ sta@@ tion ."
Now my point is the small things matter .
B@@ e@@ ing more bal@@ an@@ ced doesn &apos;t mean d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c u@@ ph@@ ea@@ val in your life .
"W@@ ith the sma@@ lle@@ st inv@@ est@@ ment in the right pla@@ ces , you can radi@@ cally trans@@ form the qu@@ ality of your relation@@ shi@@ ps and the qu@@ ality of your life ."
"M@@ ore@@ over , I think , it can trans@@ form society ."
"Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s defin@@ ition of success away from the mor@@ oni@@ cally simp@@ li@@ stic noti@@ on that the person with the most money when he di@@ es w@@ ins , to a more thou@@ ght@@ ful and bal@@ an@@ ced defin@@ ition of what a life well li@@ ved looks like ."
"And that , I think , is an idea wor@@ th sp@@ read@@ ing ."
( Applause )
I mo@@ ved to America 12 years ago with my wife T@@ er@@ ry and our two kids .
We &apos;ve inv@@ ad@@ ed every country we &apos;ve en@@ count@@ ered .
( Applause ) Because it &apos;s lea@@ ving mil@@ lions of children behind .
It actually cos@@ ts an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous amount to mo@@ p up the dam@@ age from the drop@@ out c@@ ri@@ sis .
But the drop@@ out c@@ ri@@ sis is just the tip of an i@@ c@@ eb@@ er@@ g .
America sp@@ ends more money on education than most other countries .
C@@ la@@ ss si@@ z@@ es are sma@@ l@@ ler than in many countries .
"The tr@@ ou@@ ble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direc@@ tion ."
"There are three princi@@ pl@@ es on which human life fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es , and they are con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to la@@ b@@ or and most students have to en@@ du@@ re ."
How about two children or more ? R@@ ight .
And the rest of you have seen such children .
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t they ?
What schools are en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed to do is to find out what kids can do across a very na@@ r@@ row spec@@ tru@@ m of achiev@@ ement .
I &apos;m not here to ar@@ g@@ ue against science and ma@@ th .
"A real education has to give equal we@@ ight to the ar@@ ts , the human@@ ities , to physical education ."
A@@ D@@ H@@ D .
"It &apos;s a real achiev@@ ement to put that particular ab@@ il@@ ity out , or to sti@@ f@@ le it ."
T@@ ea@@ chers are the li@@ f@@ eb@@ lo@@ od of the success of schools .
"A@@ n old fri@@ end of m@@ ine — actually very old , he &apos;s de@@ ad ."
There he is . He &apos;s di@@ eting .
The ro@@ le of a teacher is to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate learning .
They should be di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ tic . They should help .
"So in place of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , what we have is a culture of comp@@ li@@ ance ."
O@@ ur children and teachers are en@@ coura@@ g@@ ed to fol@@ low rou@@ t@@ ine al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms rather than to exc@@ ite that power of ima@@ gi@@ nation and cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"I mean , you may have a do@@ g ."
"You know , but it doesn &apos;t li@@ st@@ en to R@@ a@@ di@@ o@@ head , does it ?"
"In@@ stead , what we have is a culture of stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zation ."
That &apos;s one of the problems of the test .
No . I think there &apos;s a population of around five million in F@@ in@@ land .
M@@ any states in America have fe@@ wer people in them than that .
It &apos;s like people are sai@@ ling into a he@@ ad@@ w@@ ind all the time .
It &apos;s a human system .
E@@ very student who drop@@ s out of school has a reason for it which is ro@@ ot@@ ed in their own bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ y .
They may find it bor@@ ing .
They &apos;re very perso@@ na@@ li@@ zed .
And they work .
"C@@ ul@@ ture is an organ@@ ic ter@@ m , isn &apos;t it ?"
"In the win@@ ter of 200@@ 4 , it ra@@ ined in D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley ."
S@@ even in@@ ches of ra@@ in f@@ ell over a very sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od .
The whole flo@@ or of D@@ e@@ ath V@@ al@@ ley was car@@ p@@ et@@ ed in flo@@ w@@ ers for a while .
G@@ re@@ at lead@@ ers know that .
"And if the movement is strong enough , that &apos;s , in the best sense of the word , a re@@ vol@@ ution ."
Thank you very much .
Why do so many people reach success and then fai@@ l ?
"One of the big reas@@ ons is , we think success is a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et ."
"So we do everything that lea@@ ds up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our com@@ for@@ t z@@ one , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful ."
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go do@@ w@@ n@@ h@@ ill .
"And I can tell you this happens , because it happened to me ."
"R@@ ea@@ ching success , I worked hard , I pu@@ shed myself ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I figu@@ red , &quot; &quot; O@@ h , you know , I made it ."
"I can just sit back and rela@@ x . &quot; &quot; R@@ ea@@ ching success , I always tried to improve and do good work ."
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped because I figu@@ red , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I &apos;m good enough ."
"I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot; &quot; R@@ ea@@ ching success , I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas ."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas .
"But then I st@@ op@@ ped , because I figu@@ red I was this h@@ ot@@ -@@ sh@@ ot guy and I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have to work at ideas , they should just come like ma@@ gi@@ c ."
And the only thing that came was cre@@ ative blo@@ ck .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
"R@@ ea@@ ching success , I always focu@@ sed on cli@@ ents and pro@@ jects , and ig@@ no@@ red the money . Th@@ en all this money started p@@ our@@ ing in ."
And I got dist@@ rac@@ ted by it .
"And su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly I was on the phone to my st@@ o@@ ck@@ brok@@ er and my real es@@ tat@@ e ag@@ ent , when I should have been talking to my cli@@ ents ."
"And rea@@ ching success , I always did what I loved ."
"But then I got into stuff that I didn &apos;t love , like man@@ ag@@ ement . I am the world &apos;s wor@@ st man@@ ag@@ er , but I figu@@ red I should be doing it , because I was , after all , the pre@@ si@@ dent of the compan@@ y ."
"Well , so@@ on a black cl@@ ou@@ d for@@ m@@ ed over my head and here I was , out@@ war@@ dly very successful , but in@@ war@@ dly very de@@ pres@@ sed ."
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fi@@ x it .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a fa@@ st c@@ ar .
( Laughter ) It didn &apos;t help .
I was fa@@ ster but just as de@@ pres@@ sed .
"So I went to my doc@@ tor . I said , &quot; &quot; D@@ o@@ c , I can buy anything I want . But I &apos;m not happy . I &apos;m de@@ pres@@ sed ."
"It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me ."
"But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . But it can buy P@@ ro@@ z@@ a@@ c . &quot; &quot; And he put me on anti@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants ."
"And y@@ eah , the black cl@@ ou@@ d f@@ ad@@ ed a little bit , but so did all the work , because I was just flo@@ ating along . I cou@@ ldn &apos;t care less if cli@@ ents ever called ."
( Laughter ) And cli@@ ents didn &apos;t call . ( Laughter )
"Because they could see I was no longer ser@@ ving them , I was only ser@@ ving myself ."
So they took their money and their pro@@ jects to others who would serve them better .
"Well , it didn &apos;t take long for bu@@ siness to drop like a ro@@ ck ."
"M@@ y par@@ tn@@ er and I , Th@@ om , we had to let all our emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es go ."
"It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under ."
And that was great .
"Because with no emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es , there was no@@ body for me to man@@ age ."
So I went back to doing the pro@@ jects I loved .
"I had fu@@ n again , I worked har@@ der and , to c@@ ut a long story sh@@ ort , did all the things that took me back up to success ."
But it wasn &apos;t a qui@@ ck tri@@ p .
It took seven years .
"But in the end , bu@@ siness gre@@ w bi@@ gg@@ er than ever ."
"And when I went back to follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , the black cl@@ ou@@ d over my head di@@ sap@@ p@@ ea@@ red al@@ together ."
"And I wok@@ e up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need P@@ ro@@ z@@ a@@ c any@@ more . &quot;"
And I thre@@ w it away and ha@@ ven &apos;t needed it since .
I learned that success isn &apos;t a on@@ e-@@ way stre@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a contin@@ u@@ ous jour@@ ne@@ y .
"And if we want to av@@ oi@@ d &quot; &quot; success@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ fai@@ lu@@ re@@ -@@ sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , &quot; &quot; we just keep follo@@ wing these eight princi@@ pl@@ es , because that is not only how we achi@@ e@@ ve success , it &apos;s how we su@@ stain it ."
So here is to your contin@@ ue@@ d success .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
"C@@ an we , as a@@ du@@ l@@ ts , grow new ner@@ ve cells ?"
So this is this gra@@ y struc@@ ture in the center of the brain .
So why are these new neurons important and what are their fun@@ c@@ tions ?
"F@@ irst , we know that they &apos;re important for learning and mem@@ ory ."
The answer is y@@ es .
And we are now going to do a little qui@@ z .
A@@ re we ready ?
"O@@ K , let &apos;s go ."
So what about learning ?
In@@ cre@@ as@@ ing ?
How about stress ?
"Y@@ es , stress will dec@@ rea@@ se the produc@@ tion of new neurons in the hi@@ pp@@ oc@@ am@@ p@@ us ."
"In@@ de@@ ed , it will dec@@ rea@@ se ne@@ u@@ ro@@ gen@@ es@@ is ."
"O@@ h , wow !@@ "
How about getting older ?
"And then finally , how about run@@ ning ?"
I will let you ju@@ dge that one by yourself .
"So acti@@ vity im@@ pa@@ c@@ ts ne@@ u@@ ro@@ gen@@ es@@ is , but that &apos;s not all ."
E@@ than@@ ol — in@@ take of al@@ co@@ h@@ ol — will dec@@ rea@@ se ne@@ u@@ ro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
M@@ H : I &apos;m really interest@@ ed in the run@@ ning thing .
Do I have to ru@@ n ?
What is going to be the future of learning ?
"I do have a pla@@ n , but in order for me to tell you what that pla@@ n is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of s@@ ets the sta@@ ge ."
"I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?"
"And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from ."
"It came from about 3@@ 00 years ago , and it came from the last and the bi@@ ggest of the em@@ pi@@ res on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The B@@ riti@@ sh E@@ m@@ pi@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; I@@ mag@@ ine trying to ru@@ n the show , trying to ru@@ n the enti@@ re planet , without comp@@ uters , without tel@@ e@@ phon@@ es , with data han@@ d@@ w@@ r@@ itt@@ en on piec@@ es of pap@@ er , and tra@@ vel@@ ing by shi@@ ps ."
But the Vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ ans actually did it .
What they did was ama@@ zing .
They created a global computer made up of people .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic ad@@ mini@@ st@@ ra@@ tive machine .
"In order to have that machine run@@ ning , you need lots and lots of people ."
They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic ad@@ mini@@ st@@ ra@@ tive machine .
They must be i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal to each other .
"They must know three things : They must have good han@@ d@@ writ@@ ing , because the data is han@@ d@@ w@@ r@@ itt@@ en ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multi@@ plic@@ ation , divi@@ sion , ad@@ dition and sub@@ tra@@ ction in their head ."
They must be so i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal that you could pi@@ ck one up from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and ship them to C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and he would be in@@ st@@ antly fun@@ cti@@ onal .
The Vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ ans were great engine@@ ers .
"They engine@@ ered a system that was so ro@@ bu@@ st that it &apos;s still with us today , contin@@ u@@ ously produc@@ ing i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal people for a machine that no longer exi@@ sts ."
"The em@@ pi@@ re is gone , so what are we doing with that desig@@ n that produc@@ es these i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?"
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ cho@@ ols as we know them are ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong com@@ ment there .
"I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re brok@@ en .
It &apos;s quite fa@@ shi@@ ona@@ ble to say that the education system &apos;s brok@@ en .
It &apos;s not brok@@ en . It &apos;s wonder@@ fully con@@ struc@@ ted .
It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it any@@ more . It &apos;s out@@ d@@ ated .
What are the kind of j@@ ob@@ s that we have today ?
"Well , the cl@@ er@@ ks are the comp@@ uters ."
They &apos;re there in thousands in every of@@ fi@@ ce .
And you have people who gu@@ i@@ de those comp@@ uters to do their cl@@ eri@@ cal j@@ ob@@ s .
Th@@ ose people don &apos;t need to be able to writ@@ e beauti@@ fully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multi@@ p@@ ly numbers in their he@@ a@@ ds .
They do need to be able to read .
"In fact , they need to be able to read di@@ sc@@ er@@ ni@@ ng@@ ly ."
"Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the j@@ ob@@ s of the future are going to look like ."
"We know that people will work from wh@@ er@@ ever they want , wh@@ en@@ ever they want , in w@@ hat@@ ever way they want ."
How is pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day scho@@ ol@@ ing going to pre@@ p@@ are them for that world ?
"Well , I bu@@ mp@@ ed into this whole thing completely by ac@@ ci@@ dent ."
"I used to tea@@ ch people how to writ@@ e computer pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , 14 years ago ."
"And right next to where I used to work , there was a s@@ lu@@ m ."
"And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to writ@@ e computer pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s ?"
O@@ r should they not ?
"A@@ t the same time , we also had lots of par@@ ents , rich people , who had comp@@ uters , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with comp@@ uters ."
"And my daughter — o@@ h , su@@ rely she is extra@@ -@@ intellig@@ ent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly figu@@ red that , how come all the rich people are having these extra@@ ordina@@ ri@@ ly gi@@ f@@ ted children ?"
( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
"I made a h@@ ole in the b@@ oun@@ dar@@ y w@@ all of the s@@ lu@@ m next to my of@@ fi@@ ce , and stu@@ ck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Internet was ."
The children came run@@ ning in .
"It was three fe@@ et off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we tou@@ ch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you wi@@ sh to . &quot; &quot; And I went away ."
"A@@ b@@ out eight hours later , we found them bro@@ w@@ sing and teach@@ ing each other how to bro@@ w@@ se ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s im@@ possible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; M@@ y colle@@ ag@@ ues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple sol@@ ution ."
"One of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the m@@ ouse . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment . I went 3@@ 00 mi@@ les out of D@@ el@@ h@@ i into a really re@@ mot@@ e village where the chan@@ ces of a pas@@ sing sof@@ t@@ ware develop@@ ment engine@@ er was very little . ( Laughter ) I re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment there ."
"There was no place to sta@@ y , so I stu@@ ck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on it ."
"When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a fa@@ ster proc@@ ess@@ or and a better m@@ ouse . &quot;"
"( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me ."
"In an ir@@ rit@@ ated v@@ oi@@ ce , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to tea@@ ch ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; tea@@ ch ourselves &quot; &quot; said so ca@@ su@@ ally ."
Here &apos;s a sh@@ ort g@@ li@@ mp@@ se from those years .
That &apos;s the first day at the H@@ ole in the W@@ all .
O@@ n your right is an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
T@@ o his left is his student . She &apos;s six .
And he &apos;s teach@@ ing her how to bro@@ w@@ se .
"Th@@ en on@@ to other parts of the country , I re@@ pe@@ ated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were ."
&#91; &quot; &quot; H@@ ole in the w@@ all fil@@ m - 19@@ 9@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &#93; A@@ n ei@@ ght@@ -@@ year-@@ old telling his el@@ der si@@ ster what to do .
"And finally a girl expla@@ ining in Ma@@ ra@@ thi what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a proc@@ ess@@ or inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publi@@ shing ."
"I published every@@ where . I wrote down and measu@@ red everything , and I said , in n@@ ine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same stan@@ dar@@ d as an of@@ fi@@ ce secre@@ ta@@ ry in the W@@ est ."
I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
"But I was cu@@ ri@@ ous to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?"
"I started experim@@ ent@@ ing with other sub@@ jects , am@@ ong them , for example , p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation ."
"There &apos;s one commun@@ ity of children in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India wh@@ ose English p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would improve their j@@ ob@@ s ."
"I gave them a spe@@ e@@ ch@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ t@@ ex@@ t eng@@ ine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; K@@ e@@ ep talking into it until it ty@@ p@@ es what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this ."
C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter : N@@ ice to me@@ et you@@ .@@ C@@ hi@@ ld : N@@ ice to me@@ et you .
Su@@ g@@ at@@ a M@@ it@@ ra : The reason I en@@ ded with the face of this young la@@ dy over there is because I su@@ sp@@ ect many of you know her .
She has now jo@@ ined a call center in H@@ y@@ der@@ a@@ bad and may have t@@ or@@ tured you about your cre@@ d@@ it car@@ d bil@@ ls in a very clear English ac@@ c@@ ent .
"So then people said , well , how far will it go ?"
W@@ here does it stop ?
I decided I would dest@@ ro@@ y my own argu@@ ment by cre@@ ating an ab@@ sur@@ d prop@@ os@@ ition .
"I made a hy@@ pothe@@ sis , a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous hy@@ pothe@@ sis ."
"T@@ ami@@ l is a s@@ ou@@ th Indi@@ an language , and I said , can T@@ am@@ il@@ -@@ speak@@ ing children in a s@@ ou@@ th Indi@@ an village learn the bi@@ ot@@ e@@ chno@@ logy of D@@ N@@ A re@@ plic@@ ation in English from a stre@@ et@@ side computer ?"
"And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a z@@ ero ."
"I &apos;ll sp@@ end a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another z@@ ero ."
"I &apos;ll go back to the la@@ b and say , we need teachers ."
I found a village . It was called K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ pa@@ m in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n India .
"I put in H@@ ole in the W@@ all comp@@ uters there , do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed all kinds of stuff from the Internet about D@@ N@@ A re@@ plic@@ ation , most of which I didn &apos;t understand ."
"The children came ru@@ shing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very top@@ i@@ cal , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and di@@ ag@@ ram@@ s and che@@ mi@@ st@@ ry ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ cal me@@ th@@ od , so I app@@ li@@ ed that . I said , &quot; &quot; I ha@@ ven &apos;t the fo@@ g@@ gi@@ est idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And any@@ way , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )"
So I left them for a couple of months .
They &apos;d got a z@@ ero . I gave them a test .
"I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve underst@@ ood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I exp@@ ect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We ha@@ ven &apos;t given up ."
"We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these scre@@ ens and you keep star@@ ing at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she ra@@ ised her hand , and she says to me in brok@@ en T@@ ami@@ l and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , ap@@ art from the fact that im@@ prop@@ er re@@ plic@@ ation of the D@@ N@@ A molecu@@ le cau@@ ses disease , we ha@@ ven &apos;t underst@@ ood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I te@@ sted them ."
"I got an educ@@ ati@@ onal im@@ possi@@ bility , z@@ ero to 30 percent in two months in the tr@@ op@@ i@@ cal he@@ at with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a dec@@ a@@ de a@@ head of their time ."
A@@ b@@ sur@@ d . But I had to fol@@ low the Vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ an nor@@ m .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent is a fai@@ l .
How do I get them to pa@@ ss ? I have to get them 20 more mar@@ ks .
"I cou@@ ldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a fri@@ end that they had , a 2@@ 2@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl who was an ac@@ count@@ ant and she play@@ ed with them all the time ."
"So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; A@@ b@@ solutely not ."
"I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . U@@ se the me@@ th@@ od of the grand@@ mother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ t@@ and behind them ."
"Wh@@ en@@ ever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , wow , I mean , how did you do that ?"
"What &apos;s the next pa@@ ge ? G@@ os@@ h , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what g@@ ran@@ ni@@ es do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months ."
The s@@ co@@ res ju@@ mp@@ ed to 50 percent .
"@@ K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ pa@@ m had cau@@ ght up with my control school in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i , a rich pri@@ v@@ ate school with a tra@@ ined bi@@ ot@@ e@@ chno@@ logy teacher ."
Wh@@ en I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the pla@@ ying field .
Here &apos;s K@@ al@@ lik@@ up@@ pa@@ m .
( Ch@@ il@@ dren speak@@ ing ) Ne@@ ur@@ ons ... comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ation .
"I got the cam@@ era ang@@ le wrong . That one is just am@@ at@@ e@@ ur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate ."
A@@ t 12 .
So what are j@@ ob@@ s going to be like ?
"Well , we know what they &apos;re like today ."
"What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children p@@ our@@ ing over with their mo@@ bi@@ le phon@@ es on the one hand and then re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly going to school to pi@@ ck up their bo@@ ok@@ s with their other hand ."
What will it be tom@@ or@@ row ?
C@@ ould it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
"C@@ ould it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?"
"C@@ ould it be — a de@@ v@@ a@@ sta@@ ting question , a question that was f@@ ram@@ ed for me by N@@ i@@ cho@@ la@@ s Ne@@ g@@ rop@@ on@@ te — could it be that we are he@@ ad@@ ing to@@ wards or maybe in a future where kno@@ wing is ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ?"
But that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble . We are hom@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens .
"@@ K@@ no@@ wing , that &apos;s what di@@ sti@@ ng@@ u@@ i@@ sh@@ es us from the ap@@ es ."
But look at it this way .
It took nature 100 million years to make the ape st@@ and up and become H@@ om@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens .
"It took us only 1@@ 0,000 to make kno@@ wing ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e ."
What an achiev@@ ement that is .
But we have to int@@ e@@ g@@ rate that into our own future .
E@@ n@@ coura@@ g@@ ement seems to be the k@@ ey .
"If you look at K@@ up@@ pa@@ m , if you look at all of the experiments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , &quot; &quot; s@@ al@@ ut@@ ing learning ."
There is evidence from neur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence .
"The re@@ pti@@ li@@ an part of our brain , which sit@@ s in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it sh@@ ut@@ s down everything else , it sh@@ ut@@ s down the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the parts which learn , it sh@@ ut@@ s all of that down ."
P@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment and ex@@ ami@@ na@@ tions are seen as thre@@ at@@ s .
"We take our children , we make them sh@@ ut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; P@@ er@@ form . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?"
Because it was needed .
There was an age in the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res when you needed those people who can survi@@ ve under thre@@ at .
"When you &apos;re standing in a tr@@ en@@ ch all alone , if you could have survi@@ ved , you &apos;re ok@@ ay , you &apos;ve pas@@ sed ."
"If you didn &apos;t , you fai@@ led ."
But the A@@ ge of E@@ m@@ pi@@ res is gone .
What happens to cre@@ ati@@ vity in our age ?
We need to shi@@ ft that bal@@ ance back from thre@@ at to plea@@ sure .
I came back to Eng@@ land looking for B@@ riti@@ sh grand@@ mothers .
"I put out noti@@ ces in pap@@ ers saying , if you are a B@@ riti@@ sh grand@@ mother , if you have bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a we@@ b cam@@ era , can you give me one h@@ our of your time per week for f@@ ree ?"
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
I know more B@@ riti@@ sh grand@@ mothers than any@@ one in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the G@@ ran@@ ny C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
The G@@ ran@@ ny C@@ l@@ ou@@ d sit@@ s on the Internet .
"If there &apos;s a child in tr@@ ou@@ ble , we be@@ am a G@@ ran ."
She goes on over S@@ k@@ y@@ pe and she sor@@ ts things out .
"I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called D@@ i@@ gg@@ les in nor@@ th@@ we@@ st@@ ern Eng@@ land , de@@ ep inside a village in T@@ ami@@ l N@@ ad@@ u , India , 6@@ ,000 mi@@ les away ."
She does it with only one ag@@ e-@@ old g@@ es@@ ture .
&quot; S@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot;
O@@ kay ?
W@@ at@@ ch this .
G@@ rand@@ mother : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . You say it . You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me .
Ch@@ il@@ dren : You can &apos;t cat@@ ch me . G@@ rand@@ mother : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an@@ .@@ Ch@@ il@@ dren : I &apos;m the G@@ ing@@ er@@ b@@ read M@@ an . G@@ rand@@ mother : Well done ! V@@ ery good . S@@ M : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning as the produc@@ t of educ@@ ati@@ onal self-@@ organiz@@ ation .
"If you al@@ low the educ@@ ati@@ onal process to self-@@ organiz@@ e , then learning emer@@ ges ."
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about l@@ etting it happen .
The teacher s@@ ets the process in moti@@ on and then she stan@@ ds back in a@@ we and wat@@ ches as learning happens .
I think that &apos;s what all this is point@@ ing at .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
"Well , I int@@ end to build these S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning E@@ n@@ viron@@ ments ."
"They are basically bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and , col@@ la@@ bo@@ ration and en@@ coura@@ g@@ ement put together ."
"I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools ."
"It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of st@@ and back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action ."
( Ch@@ il@@ dren talking ) This one is in Eng@@ land .
"He main@@ ta@@ ins la@@ w and order , because remem@@ ber , there &apos;s no teacher around ."
G@@ ir@@ l : The to@@ tal number of electr@@ ons is not equal to the to@@ tal number of prot@@ ons — S@@ M : Au@@ st@@ ra@@ li@@ a G@@ ir@@ l : — giving it a net positive or neg@@ ative electri@@ cal char@@ ge .
The net char@@ ge on an i@@ on is equal to the number of prot@@ ons in the i@@ on min@@ us the number of electr@@ ons .
S@@ M : A dec@@ a@@ de a@@ head of her time .
"So S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s , I think we need a cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m of big questions ."
You already heard about that . You know what that means .
"There was a time when S@@ t@@ one A@@ ge men and women used to sit and look up at the sk@@ y and say , &quot; What are those t@@ win@@ k@@ ling li@@ ghts ? &quot;"
"They built the first cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those won@@ d@@ rou@@ s questions ."
We &apos;ve brought it down to the t@@ ang@@ ent of an ang@@ le .
But that &apos;s not se@@ x@@ y enough .
"The way you would put it to a nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a met@@ e@@ or@@ ite was coming to h@@ it the Earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ c word . It &apos;s called the t@@ ang@@ ent of an ang@@ le , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll figure it out ."
So here are a couple of imag@@ es from S@@ O@@ L@@ E@@ s .
"I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; Wh@@ en did the world beg@@ in ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds ."
This one is about what happens to the air we b@@ rea@@ the .
This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
"The teacher only ra@@ is@@ es the question , and then stan@@ ds back and ad@@ mi@@ res the answer ."
So what &apos;s my wi@@ sh ?
M@@ y wi@@ sh is that we desig@@ n the future of learning .
"We don &apos;t want to be sp@@ are parts for a great human computer , do we ?"
So we need to desig@@ n a future for learning .
"And I &apos;ve got to — h@@ ang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wor@@ ding exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important ."
M@@ y wi@@ sh is to help desig@@ n a future of learning by supp@@ or@@ ting children all over the world to tap into their won@@ der and their ab@@ il@@ ity to work together .
H@@ el@@ p me build this school .
It will be called the S@@ cho@@ ol in the C@@ l@@ ou@@ d .
It will be a school where children go on these intel@@ lec@@ tual adv@@ en@@ tures dri@@ ven by the big questions which their medi@@ at@@ ors put in .
The way I want to do this is to build a fac@@ il@@ ity where I can study this .
It &apos;s a fac@@ il@@ ity which is p@@ rac@@ ti@@ cally un@@ man@@ ned .
There &apos;s only one g@@ ran@@ ny who man@@ ag@@ es health and sa@@ f@@ ety .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cl@@ ou@@ d .
"The li@@ ghts are turned on and off by the cl@@ ou@@ d , et@@ c . , et@@ c . , everything &apos;s done from the cl@@ ou@@ d ."
But I want you for another pur@@ p@@ ose .
"You can do S@@ el@@ f-@@ O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed L@@ ear@@ ning E@@ n@@ viron@@ ments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clu@@ b@@ s ."
It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great do@@ cu@@ ment produc@@ ed by TED which tells you how to do it .
"If you would p@@ lease , p@@ lease do it across all five contin@@ ents and sen@@ d me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the S@@ cho@@ ol of C@@ l@@ ou@@ ds , and create the future of learning ."
That &apos;s my wi@@ sh .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the H@@ ima@@ lay@@ as .
"A@@ t 1@@ 2@@ ,000 fe@@ et , where the air is thin , I once built two H@@ ole in the W@@ all comp@@ uters , and the children flo@@ cked there ."
And there was this little girl who was follo@@ wing me around .
"And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child ."
"I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her qui@@ et@@ ly ."
"She su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly ra@@ ised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; G@@ et on with it . &quot;"
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good ad@@ vice .
I &apos;ll fol@@ low her ad@@ vice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . W@@ ow . ( Applause )
The universe is really big .
"We live in a galaxy , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ a@@ lax@@ y ."
There are about a hundred billion stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ a@@ lax@@ y .
"And if you take a cam@@ era and you point it at a ran@@ dom part of the sk@@ y , and you just keep the sh@@ ut@@ ter open , as long as your cam@@ era is atta@@ ched to the H@@ u@@ b@@ ble S@@ pa@@ ce T@@ el@@ es@@ co@@ pe , it will see something like this ."
E@@ very one of these little blo@@ b@@ s is a galaxy rou@@ gh@@ ly the size of our M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay — a hundred billion stars in each of those blo@@ b@@ s .
There are appro@@ x@@ i@@ mat@@ ely a hundred billion galaxies in the observ@@ able universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
"The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in do@@ g years ."
( Laughter ) W@@ hi@@ ch tells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
It &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely beautiful .
"I &apos;ve of@@ ten wonder@@ ed , what is the evol@@ u@@ tionary pres@@ sure that made our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors in the V@@ el@@ d@@ t ad@@ ap@@ t and evol@@ ve to really en@@ jo@@ y pic@@ tures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any ."
But we would also like to understand it .
"As a cosmo@@ logi@@ st , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?"
One big cl@@ ue we have is that the universe is chang@@ ing with time .
"If you looked at one of these galaxies and measu@@ red its vel@@ oc@@ ity , it would be moving away from you ."
"And if you look at a galaxy even far@@ ther away , it would be moving away fa@@ ster ."
So we say the universe is expan@@ ding .
"What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were cl@@ os@@ er together ."
"In the past , the universe was more d@@ en@@ se , and it was also h@@ ot@@ ter ."
"If you squ@@ ee@@ ze things together , the tem@@ per@@ ature goes up ."
That kind of makes sense to us .
"The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , ne@@ ar the Big Bang , was also very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
You might think that that &apos;s not a surpri@@ se .
The air in this room is very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h .
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well , maybe things just s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ed themselves out . &quot; &quot; But the conditions ne@@ ar the Big Bang are very , very different than the conditions of the air in this room ."
"In particular , things were a lot d@@ en@@ ser ."
The gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pull of things was a lot st@@ rong@@ er ne@@ ar the Big Bang .
"What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each ."
"A@@ t early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squ@@ ee@@ zed into a regi@@ on about this big — liter@@ ally — at early times ."
"And you have to imagine doing that squ@@ ee@@ zing without any im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions , without any little sp@@ ots where there were a few more atoms than some@@ where else ."
"Because if there had been , they would have col@@ lap@@ sed under the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pull into a hu@@ ge black h@@ ole ."
"@@ K@@ e@@ ep@@ ing the universe very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a d@@ eli@@ c@@ ate ar@@ rang@@ ement ."
It &apos;s a cl@@ ue that the early universe is not ch@@ os@@ en ran@@ dom@@ ly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
"So part of our understanding of this was given to us by L@@ u@@ d@@ wi@@ g B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann , an Au@@ st@@ rian physi@@ ci@@ st in the 19@@ th century ."
And B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion was that he hel@@ ped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
"It &apos;s the ran@@ dom@@ ness , the dis@@ order , the cha@@ oti@@ c@@ ness of some systems ."
B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann gave us a for@@ mu@@ la — eng@@ ra@@ ved on his tom@@ b@@ st@@ one now — that really quan@@ ti@@ fi@@ es what entropy is .
"And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can re@@ ar@@ range the con@@ stit@@ u@@ ents of a system so that you don &apos;t noti@@ ce , so that ma@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ i@@ cally it looks the same ."
"If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t noti@@ ce each individu@@ al atom ."
A low entropy con@@ figu@@ ration is one in which there &apos;s only a few ar@@ rang@@ ements that look that way .
A high entropy ar@@ rang@@ ement is one that there are many ar@@ rang@@ ements that look that way .
"This is a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally important in@@ sight because it hel@@ ps us explain the second la@@ w of ther@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ na@@ mi@@ cs — the la@@ w that says that entropy incre@@ ases in the universe , or in some i@@ so@@ lated bit of the universe ."
The reason why entropy incre@@ ases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
"That &apos;s a wonderful in@@ sight , but it lea@@ ves something out ."
"This in@@ sight that entropy incre@@ ases , by the way , is what &apos;s behind what we call the ar@@ row of time , the difference between the past and the future ."
"E@@ very difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increas@@ ing — the fact that you can remem@@ ber the past , but not the future ."
"The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you di@@ e , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increas@@ ing ."
"B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann expla@@ ined that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy ."
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
"The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion of the fact that the early universe was very , very s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ."
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cosmo@@ logi@@ sts .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough att@@ ention to ."
"It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmo@@ logi@@ st , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to ad@@ dre@@ ss ? &quot;"
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was R@@ i@@ char@@ d F@@ ey@@ n@@ man .
"@@ 50 years ago , he gave a seri@@ es of a bun@@ ch of different lec@@ tures ."
"He gave the popu@@ lar lec@@ tures that became &quot; &quot; The C@@ ha@@ rac@@ ter of P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal L@@ a@@ w . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h under@@ gra@@ ds that became &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on P@@ h@@ ysi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; He gave lec@@ tures to C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h gra@@ du@@ ate students that became &quot; &quot; The F@@ ey@@ n@@ man L@@ ec@@ tures on G@@ ra@@ v@@ itation . &quot; &quot; In every one of these bo@@ ok@@ s , every one of these s@@ ets of lec@@ tures , he em@@ pha@@ si@@ zed this pu@@ z@@ z@@ le : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?"
"So he says — I &apos;m not going to do the ac@@ c@@ ent — he says , &quot; &quot; F@@ or some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy con@@ t@@ ent , and since then the entropy has increas@@ ed ."
The ar@@ row of time cannot be completely underst@@ ood until the my@@ st@@ ery of the begin@@ ni@@ ngs of the history of the universe are re@@ duc@@ ed still fu@@ r@@ ther from sp@@ ecu@@ lation to understanding . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s our job .
"We want to know — this is 50 years ago , &quot; &quot; Su@@ rely , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figu@@ red it out by now . &quot;"
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figu@@ red it out by now .
"The reason the problem has g@@ ot@@ ten worse , rather than better , is because in 19@@ 9@@ 8 we learned something c@@ ru@@ cial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before ."
We learned that it &apos;s ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating .
The universe is not only expan@@ ding .
"If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s moving away ."
"If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away fa@@ ster ."
Indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al galaxies are spe@@ e@@ ding away from us fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster so we say the universe is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating .
"@@ U@@ n@@ like the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at lea@@ st have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy ."
It &apos;s just the idea that emp@@ ty space itself has energy .
"In every little cu@@ bic c@@ enti@@ met@@ er of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radi@@ ation or w@@ hat@@ ever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself ."
"And this energy , ac@@ cor@@ ding to Einstein , ex@@ er@@ ts a pu@@ sh on the universe ."
It is a per@@ pe@@ tual im@@ pul@@ se that pu@@ sh@@ es galaxies ap@@ art from each other .
"Because dark energy , un@@ like matter or radi@@ ation , does not di@@ l@@ ute away as the universe expan@@ ds ."
"The amount of energy in each cu@@ bic c@@ enti@@ met@@ er re@@ ma@@ ins the same , even as the universe gets bi@@ gg@@ er and bi@@ gg@@ er ."
This has c@@ ru@@ cial im@@ plic@@ ations for what the universe is going to do in the future .
"For one thing , the universe will exp@@ and forever ."
"B@@ ac@@ k when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do ."
S@@ ome people thought that the universe would re@@ col@@ lap@@ se in the future .
Einstein was f@@ on@@ d of this idea .
"But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expan@@ ding forever and ever and ever ."
"@@ 14 billion years in the past , 100 billion do@@ g years , but an in@@ fin@@ ite number of years into the future ."
"M@@ e@@ an@@ while , for all int@@ ents and pur@@ pos@@ es , space looks fin@@ ite to us ."
"S@@ pa@@ ce may be fin@@ ite or in@@ fin@@ ite , but because the universe is ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see ."
"There &apos;s a fin@@ ite regi@@ on of space that we have ac@@ c@@ ess to , sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on ."
"So even though time goes on forever , space is limit@@ ed to us ."
"F@@ i@@ nally , emp@@ ty space has a tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"In the 19@@ 7@@ 0s , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en H@@ a@@ w@@ king told us that a black h@@ ole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually em@@ its radi@@ ation when you take into ac@@ cou@@ nt quantum mechan@@ i@@ cs ."
"The cur@@ v@@ ature of spa@@ c@@ e-@@ time around the black h@@ ole bri@@ ngs to life the quantum mechan@@ i@@ cal fluctua@@ tion , and the black h@@ ole radi@@ ates ."
"A preci@@ sel@@ y si@@ mi@@ lar cal@@ cu@@ lation by H@@ a@@ w@@ king and G@@ ary G@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ ons showed that if you have dark energy in emp@@ ty space , then the whole universe radi@@ ates ."
The energy of emp@@ ty space bri@@ ngs to life quantum fluctua@@ tions .
"And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radi@@ ation will di@@ l@@ ute away , there will always be some radi@@ ation , some ther@@ mal fluctua@@ tions , even in emp@@ ty space ."
So what this means is that the universe is like a bo@@ x of g@@ as that la@@ sts forever .
Well what is the im@@ plic@@ ation of that ?
That im@@ plic@@ ation was studi@@ ed by B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann back in the 19@@ th century .
"He said , well , entropy incre@@ ases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy ."
But that &apos;s a proba@@ bi@@ li@@ stic stat@@ ement .
"It will probably increase , and the proba@@ bility is en@@ or@@ m@@ ously hu@@ ge ."
It &apos;s not something you have to wor@@ ry about — the air in this room all ga@@ ther@@ ing over one part of the room and su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ating us .
"It &apos;s very , very un@@ lik@@ ely ."
"E@@ x@@ cept if they lo@@ cked the do@@ ors and k@@ ep@@ t us here liter@@ ally forever , that would happen ."
"E@@ very@@ thing that is allowed , every con@@ figu@@ ration that is allowed to be ob@@ ta@@ ined by the molecules in this room , would even@@ tually be ob@@ ta@@ ined ."
"So B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in ther@@ mal equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um ."
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the expan@@ sion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were expla@@ ined by I@@ sa@@ a@@ c Ne@@ w@@ ton — they were ab@@ sol@@ ute ; they just stu@@ ck there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just sp@@ read out even@@ ly every@@ where — the everything molecules .
"But if you &apos;re B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann , you know that if you wait long enough , the ran@@ dom fluctua@@ tions of those molecules will o@@ cc@@ a@@ si@@ ona@@ lly bring them into lower entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions ."
"And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will exp@@ and back ."
"So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctua@@ tions into lower entropy , more organiz@@ ed sit@@ u@@ ations ."
"Well if that &apos;s true , B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann then goes on@@ to inv@@ ent two very moder@@ n@@ -@@ s@@ oun@@ ding ideas — the multi@@ verse and the an@@ th@@ rop@@ ic princi@@ ple ."
"He says , the problem with ther@@ mal equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is that we can &apos;t live there ."
"R@@ em@@ em@@ ber , life itself depen@@ ds on the ar@@ row of time ."
"We would not be able to process information , me@@ ta@@ bo@@ li@@ ze , wal@@ k and talk , if we li@@ ved in ther@@ mal equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um ."
"So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big universe , with ran@@ dom@@ ly bu@@ mp@@ ing into each other particles , there will o@@ cc@@ a@@ si@@ ona@@ lly be small fluctua@@ tions in the lower entropy states , and then they rela@@ x back ."
But there will also be large fluctua@@ tions .
"O@@ cc@@ a@@ si@@ ona@@ lly , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies ."
"So B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann says , we will only live in the part of the multi@@ verse , in the part of this in@@ fin@@ it@@ ely big set of fluc@@ tu@@ ating particles , where life is possible ."
That &apos;s the regi@@ on where entropy is low .
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
"Now your hom@@ e@@ work as@@ sig@@ nment is to really think about this , to con@@ tem@@ pla@@ te what it means ."
"C@@ arl S@@ ag@@ an once fam@@ ously said that &quot; &quot; in order to make an ap@@ ple pi@@ e , you must first inv@@ ent the universe . &quot; &quot; But he was not right ."
"In B@@ olt@@ z@@ mann &apos;s sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o , if you want to make an ap@@ ple pi@@ e , you just wait for the ran@@ dom moti@@ on of atoms to make you an ap@@ ple pi@@ e ."
"That will happen much more fre@@ qu@@ ently than the ran@@ dom moti@@ ons of atoms making you an ap@@ ple or@@ char@@ d and some su@@ ga@@ r and an o@@ ven , and then making you an ap@@ ple pi@@ e ."
So this sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o makes predic@@ tions .
And the predic@@ tions are that the fluctua@@ tions that make us are min@@ ima@@ l .
"E@@ ven if you imagine that this room we are in now exi@@ sts and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our mem@@ ories , but our im@@ pres@@ sion that outside there &apos;s something called C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h and the United States and the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ a@@ lax@@ y , it &apos;s much ea@@ si@@ er for all those im@@ pres@@ sions to ran@@ dom@@ ly fluc@@ tu@@ ate into your brain than for them actually to ran@@ dom@@ ly fluc@@ tu@@ ate into C@@ al@@ t@@ ec@@ h , the United States and the galaxy ."
"The good news is that , ther@@ e@@ fore , this sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o does not work ; it is not right ."
This sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o predic@@ ts that we should be a min@@ ima@@ l fluctua@@ tion .
"E@@ ven if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies ."
And F@@ ey@@ n@@ man also underst@@ ood this .
"F@@ ey@@ n@@ man says , &quot; &quot; F@@ rom the hy@@ pothe@@ sis that the world is a fluctua@@ tion , all the predic@@ tions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mi@@ x@@ ed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at — high entropy ."
"If our order were due to a fluctua@@ tion , we would not exp@@ ect order any@@ where but where we have just noti@@ ced it ."
We ther@@ e@@ fore con@@ clu@@ de the universe is not a fluctua@@ tion . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
"If the universe is not a fluctua@@ tion , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?"
"And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m run@@ ning out of time ."
"( Laughter ) Here is the universe that we tell you about , ver@@ su@@ s the universe that really exi@@ sts ."
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is expan@@ ding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
"If the dark energy re@@ ma@@ ins around , the stars around us will use up their nu@@ clear f@@ ue@@ l , they will stop bur@@ ning ."
They will f@@ all into black h@@ ol@@ es .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black h@@ ol@@ es .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has li@@ ved .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black h@@ ol@@ es don &apos;t last forever .
"They will ev@@ ap@@ o@@ rate , and we will be left with nothing but emp@@ ty space ."
That emp@@ ty space la@@ sts essentially forever .
"H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , you noti@@ ce , since emp@@ ty space gi@@ ves off radi@@ ation , there &apos;s actually ther@@ mal fluctua@@ tions , and it c@@ y@@ c@@ les around all the different possible com@@ bi@@ na@@ tions of the de@@ gre@@ es of fre@@ e@@ dom that exi@@ st in emp@@ ty space ."
"So even though the universe la@@ sts forever , there &apos;s only a fin@@ ite number of things that can possi@@ bly happen in the universe ."
They all happen over a per@@ i@@ od of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
"@@ N@@ u@@ mb@@ er one : If the universe la@@ sts for 10 to the 10 to the 1@@ 20 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the war@@ m , com@@ for@@ table af@@ ter@@ g@@ low of the Big Bang ?"
Why are@@ n &apos;t we in emp@@ ty space ?
"You might say , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be li@@ ving , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right ."
You could be a ran@@ dom fluctua@@ tion out of the no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness .
Why are@@ n &apos;t you ?
M@@ ore hom@@ e@@ work as@@ sig@@ nment for you .
"So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer ."
I &apos;m going to give you my fav@@ or@@ ite sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o .
E@@ i@@ ther it &apos;s just like that . There is no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
This is a b@@ ru@@ te fact about the universe that you should learn to ac@@ cept and stop asking questions .
O@@ r maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
"A@@ n e@@ g@@ g , an un@@ brok@@ en e@@ g@@ g , is a low entropy con@@ figu@@ ration , and yet , when we open our re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or , we do not go , &quot; &quot; H@@ a@@ h , how surpri@@ sing to find this low entropy con@@ figu@@ ration in our re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s because an e@@ g@@ g is not a cl@@ osed system ; it comes out of a chi@@ ck@@ en ."
Maybe the universe comes out of a univer@@ sa@@ l chi@@ ck@@ en .
"@@ Maybe there is something that natu@@ ra@@ lly , through the growth of the la@@ ws of physics , gi@@ ves ri@@ se to universe like ours in low entropy con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions ."
"If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bi@@ gg@@ er multi@@ verse ."
That &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o .
So the organiz@@ ers asked me to end with a bo@@ ld sp@@ ecu@@ lation .
M@@ y bo@@ ld sp@@ ecu@@ lation is that I will be ab@@ solutely v@@ in@@ dic@@ ated by history .
"And 50 years from now , all of my curr@@ ent wi@@ ld ideas will be ac@@ cep@@ ted as tru@@ ths by the scienti@@ fi@@ c and ex@@ ter@@ nal commun@@ ities ."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much lar@@ ger multi@@ verse .
"And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to comp@@ are to observ@@ ations ."
This is a predic@@ tion . I might be wrong .
"But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human ra@@ ce about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years ."
It &apos;s exc@@ iting to think we may finally know the answer some@@ day .
Thank you .
( Applause )
The in@@ du@@ stri@@ al era started two secon@@ ds ago .
S@@ ome people would say it &apos;s technology .
"Now it &apos;s true , technology has accu@@ mu@@ lated through human history , and right now , technology adv@@ an@@ ces extre@@ m@@ ely rap@@ i@@ dly — that is the pro@@ x@@ i@@ mate cause , that &apos;s why we are curr@@ ently so very produc@@ tive ."
"If we look under the ho@@ od , this is what we find : basically the same thing ."
"One is a little lar@@ ger , it maybe also has a few tri@@ cks in the ex@@ act way it &apos;s wi@@ red ."
"@@ These in@@ vi@@ sible differences cannot be too comp@@ lic@@ ated , ho@@ w@@ ever , because there have only been 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 gener@@ ations since our last common an@@ c@@ est@@ or ."
We know that comp@@ lic@@ ated mechan@@ is@@ ms take a long time to evol@@ ve .
"So this then seems pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous that everything we &apos;ve achiev@@ ed , and everything we care about , depen@@ ds c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally on some relati@@ vely min@@ or changes that made the human mind ."
You would have human pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ers that would pa@@ in@@ s@@ tak@@ ing@@ ly han@@ d@@ cra@@ ft kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge it@@ ems .
"But since then , a pa@@ radi@@ g@@ m shi@@ ft has taken place in the field of ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial intelligence ."
"T@@ o@@ day , the action is really around machine learning ."
"So rather than han@@ d@@ cra@@ f@@ ting kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ta@@ tions and fe@@ atures , we create al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that learn , of@@ ten from ra@@ w perc@@ ep@@ tual data ."
B@@ a@@ sically the same thing that the human inf@@ ant does .
"Now of course , A@@ .@@ I@@ . is still no@@ where ne@@ ar having the same power@@ ful , c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ do@@ main ab@@ il@@ ity to learn and pla@@ n as a human being has ."
"Now , it could happen much , much later , or so@@ on@@ er , the tru@@ th is no@@ body really kno@@ ws ."
This comes down to physics .
"A bio@@ logical neur@@ on fi@@ res , maybe , at 200 h@@ er@@ t@@ z , 200 times a second ."
But even a pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day tran@@ sist@@ or oper@@ ates at the G@@ i@@ ga@@ h@@ er@@ t@@ z .
"@@ Ne@@ ur@@ ons prop@@ ag@@ ate s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly in a@@ x@@ ons , 100 met@@ ers per second , top@@ s ."
"But in comp@@ uters , sig@@ nals can tra@@ v@@ el at the spe@@ ed of light ."
"So the potenti@@ al for super@@ intelligence lies d@@ or@@ man@@ t in matter , much like the power of the atom la@@ y d@@ or@@ man@@ t throu@@ gh@@ out human history , pati@@ ently wa@@ iting there until 19@@ 45 ."
And I think we might then see an intelligence ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on .
"And then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of inv@@ est@@ ment , maybe even@@ tually we get to ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e-@@ level ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial intelligence ."
"And then , after even more years of really , really hard work , we get to village i@@ di@@ ot ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial intelligence ."
"And a few mom@@ ents later , we are be@@ yon@@ d E@@ d W@@ itt@@ en ."
The tra@@ in doesn &apos;t stop at H@@ u@@ man@@ vil@@ le S@@ tation .
"It &apos;s lik@@ ely , rather , to s@@ wo@@ os@@ h right by ."
"Now this has pro@@ found im@@ plic@@ ations , particu@@ larly when it comes to questions of power ."
"O@@ n@@ ce there is super@@ intelligence , the f@@ ate of human@@ ity may depen@@ d on what the super@@ intelligence does ."
Th@@ ink about it : Ma@@ chine intelligence is the last inv@@ ention that human@@ ity will ever need to make .
"@@ Ma@@ chin@@ es will then be better at inv@@ ent@@ ing than we are , and they &apos;ll be doing so on di@@ g@@ ital tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es ."
What this means is basically a tel@@ es@@ cop@@ ing of the future .
"All of this super@@ intelligence could devel@@ op , and possi@@ bly quite rap@@ i@@ dly ."
"Now , a super@@ intelligence with such techno@@ logical ma@@ tur@@ ity would be extre@@ m@@ ely power@@ ful , and at lea@@ st in some sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ os , it would be able to get what it want@@ s ."
We would then have a future that would be sha@@ ped by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of this A@@ .@@ I@@ .
Here it gets tri@@ ck@@ i@@ er .
"T@@ o make any he@@ ad@@ way with this , we must first of all av@@ oi@@ d an@@ th@@ rop@@ om@@ or@@ phi@@ zing ."
"And this is i@@ ron@@ ic because every ne@@ w@@ spap@@ er ar@@ ti@@ cle about the future of A@@ .@@ I@@ . has a picture of this : So I think what we need to do is to con@@ c@@ ei@@ ve of the issue more ab@@ st@@ rac@@ tly , not in terms of vi@@ vi@@ d H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ wo@@ od sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ os ."
"We need to think of intelligence as an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zation process , a process that ste@@ ers the future into a particular set of con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions ."
A super@@ intelligence is a really strong op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zation process .
"This means that there is no nec@@ ess@@ ary connec@@ tion between being high@@ ly intellig@@ ent in this sense , and having an ob@@ jec@@ tive that we humans would find wor@@ th@@ while or mean@@ ing@@ ful ."
Su@@ pp@@ ose we give an A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to make humans s@@ mi@@ le .
"When the A@@ .@@ I@@ . becomes super@@ intellig@@ ent , it realiz@@ es that there is a more eff@@ ec@@ tive way to achi@@ e@@ ve this go@@ al : take control of the world and sti@@ ck elec@@ tro@@ des into the fac@@ i@@ al mu@@ sc@@ les of humans to cause con@@ st@@ ant , be@@ am@@ ing gr@@ ins ."
"A@@ no@@ ther example , supp@@ ose we give A@@ .@@ I@@ . the go@@ al to sol@@ ve a difficult ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal problem ."
This is a le@@ s@@ son that &apos;s also ta@@ u@@ ght in many a my@@ th .
"He tou@@ ches his daughter , she turns into go@@ ld ."
"Now you might say , if a computer star@@ ts sti@@ cking elec@@ tro@@ des into people &apos;s fac@@ es , we &apos;d just sh@@ ut it off ."
"A , this is not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly so easy to do if we &apos;ve gro@@ wn depen@@ dent on the system — like , where is the off s@@ wit@@ ch to the Internet ?"
They cer@@ tain@@ ly had reas@@ ons .
"The point is , we should not be con@@ fi@@ dent that we have this under control here ."
"So we dis@@ con@@ n@@ ect the e@@ ther@@ net c@@ able to create an air ga@@ p , but again , like m@@ er@@ ely human ha@@ ck@@ ers rou@@ tin@@ ely trans@@ gre@@ ss air g@@ ap@@ s using social engine@@ ering ."
"M@@ ore cre@@ ative sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ os are also possible , like if you &apos;re the A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can imagine wi@@ gg@@ ling elec@@ tro@@ des around in your inter@@ nal circu@@ it@@ ry to create radi@@ o wa@@ ves that you can use to comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate ."
"S@@ o@@ on@@ er or later , it will out ."
I see no way around this difficult problem .
"Now , I &apos;m actually fai@@ r@@ ly op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic that this problem can be sol@@ ved ."
"In@@ stead , we would create an A@@ .@@ I@@ . that u@@ ses its intelligence to learn what we val@@ ue , and its moti@@ v@@ ation system is con@@ struc@@ ted in such a way that it is moti@@ v@@ ated to pur@@ sue our val@@ ues or to per@@ form ac@@ tions that it predic@@ ts we would appro@@ ve of ."
We would th@@ us le@@ verage its intelligence as much as possible to sol@@ ve the problem of val@@ ue@@ -@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing .
The in@@ iti@@ al conditions for the intelligence ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a contro@@ l@@ led det@@ ona@@ tion .
Here is the wor@@ ry : M@@ ak@@ ing super@@ intellig@@ ent A@@ .@@ I@@ . is a really hard challenge .
"So I think that we should work out a sol@@ ution to the control problem in adv@@ ance , so that we have it av@@ ai@@ la@@ ble by the time it is needed ."
"This to me looks like a thing that is well wor@@ th doing and I can imagine that if things turn out ok@@ ay , that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mat@@ ter@@ ed was to get this thing right ."
"@@ Not your@@ s , of course — other people &apos;s ."
So I decided to try and writ@@ e something more fu@@ n .
And I came up with an idea that I would writ@@ e a co@@ ok@@ book .
Can any@@ body see anything but the left one being longer ?
"If I co@@ ver the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are i@@ d@@ enti@@ cal ."
Vi@@ sion is one of the best things we do .
"So I want to show you some cogn@@ itive il@@ lu@@ sions , or deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making il@@ lu@@ sions , in the same way ."
"@@ G@@ er@@ many is on the left , and Au@@ stri@@ a is on the right ."
"The Ne@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds is on the left , and B@@ el@@ gi@@ um is on the right ."
"P@@ eople don &apos;t ch@@ ec@@ k , and they don &apos;t jo@@ in ."
"( Laughter ) Now , think about what this means ."
"All these medic@@ ations , nothing seems to be working ."
What do you do ? Do you pull the pati@@ ent back and try i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more exam@@ pl@@ es on ir@@ ra@@ ti@@ onal deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ making .
"Now , we@@ ek@@ end in P@@ ar@@ is , we@@ ek@@ end in R@@ ome — these are different things ."
"If you want co@@ ff@@ e@@ e , you have to pay for it yourself , it &apos;s two e@@ u@@ ro@@ s 50 ."
This is why we have these f@@ our@@ -@@ min@@ ute dat@@ es .
"I &apos;ll show you imag@@ es here , no real people , but the experiment was with people ."
"I showed some people a picture of T@@ om , and a picture of J@@ er@@ ry ."
"@@ and I said , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o do you want to d@@ ate ?"
"And the question was , will u@@ g@@ ly J@@ er@@ ry and u@@ g@@ ly T@@ om help their resp@@ ec@@ tive , more att@@ rac@@ tive bro@@ thers ?"
Now you get it .
&quot; What a piece of work is a man ! How no@@ ble in reason ! &quot;
"A@@ re we Su@@ per@@ man , or are we H@@ om@@ er S@@ im@@ p@@ son ?"
( Applause )
But they didn &apos;t re@@ lease their energy in light .
"Now , most people thought they were nu@@ ts ."
And they pas@@ sed through you and me .
And they pas@@ sed through the det@@ ec@@ tor .
"You know , it was the pa@@ yo@@ ff of my care@@ er , basically ."
That &apos;s why everyone thought the L@@ I@@ G@@ O people were nu@@ ts .
Au@@ di@@ ble sound has a wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th that can be up to 50 fe@@ et long .
That &apos;s A@@ li@@ ce talking .
That &apos;s B@@ o@@ b inter@@ rup@@ ting .

"So , the same is true of gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal wa@@ ves ."
We can &apos;t use them to make simple imag@@ es of things out in the Uni@@ verse .
It &apos;s sort of the v@@ oc@@ ab@@ u@@ la@@ ry of sp@@ in im@@ pr@@ int@@ ed on this wa@@ ve@@ form .
It &apos;s f@@ anta@@ stic .
And we know it because we heard it .
That &apos;s the la@@ st@@ ing im@@ por@@ tan@@ ce of L@@ I@@ G@@ O .
"W@@ ith gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal wa@@ ves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning ."
"P@@ lan@@ e@@ ta@@ ry systems outside our own are like dist@@ ant c@@ ities wh@@ ose li@@ ghts we can see t@@ win@@ k@@ ling , but wh@@ ose stre@@ ets we can &apos;t wal@@ k ."
"B@@ y stud@@ ying those t@@ win@@ k@@ ling li@@ ghts though , we can learn about how stars and planets inter@@ act to form their own ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem and make ha@@ bit@@ at@@ s that are am@@ ena@@ ble to life ."

Can you see it ?
There we go .
"This is just a tiny part of the sk@@ y the K@@ ep@@ ler sta@@ res at , where it sear@@ ches for planets by measu@@ ring the light from over 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half h@@ our , and very preci@@ sel@@ y ."
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny di@@ m@@ ming of light that is cau@@ sed by a planet pas@@ sing in front of one of these stars and blo@@ cking some of that star@@ light from getting to us .
"In just over two years of oper@@ ations , we &apos;ve found over 1@@ ,@@ 200 potenti@@ al new plan@@ e@@ ta@@ ry systems around other stars ."
"T@@ o give you some per@@ spec@@ tive , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous two dec@@ ad@@ es of sear@@ ching , we had only known about 4@@ 00 pri@@ or to K@@ ep@@ ler ."
"When we see these little di@@ ps in the light , we can det@@ er@@ m@@ ine a number of things ."
"For one thing , we can det@@ er@@ m@@ ine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its par@@ ent star ."
That di@@ stance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet rec@@ ei@@ ves o@@ ver@@ all .
"And that di@@ stance and kno@@ wing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I s@@ itt@@ ing around a cam@@ p@@ fire : You want to be cl@@ ose enough to the cam@@ p@@ fire so that you &apos;re war@@ m , but not so cl@@ ose that you &apos;re too to@@ ast@@ y and you get bur@@ ned ."
"H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , there &apos;s more to know about your par@@ ent star than just how much light you rec@@ ei@@ ve o@@ ver@@ all ."
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s sho@@ wn here in vi@@ sible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human ey@@ es .
You &apos;ll noti@@ ce that it looks pretty much like the i@@ con@@ ic y@@ el@@ low b@@ all — that Sun that we all d@@ ra@@ w when we &apos;re children .
"But you &apos;ll noti@@ ce something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has fre@@ ck@@ les ."
"@@ These fre@@ ck@@ les are called sun@@ sp@@ ots , and they are just one of the man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ta@@ tions of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field ."
They also cause the light from the star to v@@ ary .
"And we can measure this very , very preci@@ sel@@ y with K@@ ep@@ ler and tra@@ ce their eff@@ ec@@ ts ."
"H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , these are just the tip of the i@@ c@@ eb@@ er@@ g ."
"If we had U@@ V ey@@ es or X@@ -@@ ra@@ y ey@@ es , we would really see the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic and d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c eff@@ ec@@ ts of our Sun &apos;s magnetic acti@@ vity — the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well ."
"@@ Just think , even when it &apos;s cl@@ ou@@ dy outside , these kind of ev@@ ents are happening in the sk@@ y ab@@ ove you all the time ."
"So when we want to learn whether a planet is ha@@ bit@@ able , whether it might be am@@ ena@@ ble to life , we want to know not only how much to@@ tal light it rec@@ ei@@ ves and how war@@ m it is , but we want to know about its space w@@ ea@@ ther — this high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation , the U@@ V and the X@@ -@@ ra@@ ys that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this b@@ ath of high@@ -@@ energy radi@@ ation ."
"And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of de@@ tai@@ l that we can look at planets in our own solar system ."
"I &apos;m sho@@ wing here V@@ en@@ us , Earth and Mar@@ s — three planets in our own solar system that are rou@@ gh@@ ly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live ."
But what we can do in the mean@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relation@@ ship between the planets and their par@@ ent stars to su@@ ss out c@@ lue@@ s about which planets might be good pla@@ ces to look for life in the universe .
K@@ ep@@ ler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
"But really , every measu@@ re@@ ment it makes is preci@@ ous , because it &apos;s teach@@ ing us about the relation@@ ship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the star@@ light that s@@ ets the sta@@ ge for the formation of life in the universe ."
"W@@ hi@@ le it &apos;s K@@ ep@@ ler the tel@@ es@@ co@@ pe , the in@@ stru@@ ment that sta@@ res , it &apos;s we , life , who are sear@@ ching ."
Thank you .

"A human child is born , and for quite a long time is a con@@ su@@ mer ."
It cannot be con@@ sci@@ ously a con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or .
It is hel@@ p@@ less .
"It doesn &apos;t know how to survi@@ ve , even though it is en@@ do@@ wed with an in@@ st@@ in@@ ct to survi@@ ve ."
"It needs the help of mother , or a f@@ os@@ ter mother , to survi@@ ve ."
It can &apos;t aff@@ or@@ d to d@@ ou@@ b@@ t the person who ten@@ ds the child .
"It has to to@@ tally sur@@ ren@@ der , as one sur@@ ren@@ ders to an an@@ es@@ the@@ sio@@ logi@@ st ."
It has to to@@ tally sur@@ ren@@ der .
That im@@ p@@ lies a lot of trust .
That im@@ p@@ lies the tru@@ sted person won &apos;t vi@@ o@@ late the trust .
"As the child gro@@ ws , it beg@@ ins to disco@@ ver that the person tru@@ sted is vi@@ o@@ la@@ ting the trust ."
"It doesn &apos;t know even the word &quot; &quot; vi@@ o@@ lation . &quot; &quot; Th@@ er@@ e@@ fore , it has to bl@@ ame itself , a wor@@ d@@ less bl@@ ame , which is more difficult to really re@@ sol@@ ve — the wor@@ d@@ less self-@@ bl@@ ame ."
"As the child gro@@ ws to become an a@@ du@@ l@@ t : so far , it has been a con@@ su@@ mer , but the growth of a human being lies in his or her cap@@ ac@@ ity to con@@ tri@@ b@@ ute , to be a con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or ."
"One cannot con@@ tri@@ b@@ ute un@@ less one fe@@ els s@@ ecu@@ re , one fe@@ els big , one fe@@ els : I have enough ."
T@@ o be compas@@ sio@@ nate is not a j@@ oke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
One has to disco@@ ver a certain bi@@ g@@ ness in on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
"That bi@@ g@@ ness should be cent@@ ered on on@@ es@@ el@@ f , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wi@@ el@@ d , not in terms of any sta@@ tu@@ s that you can comm@@ and in the society , but it should be cent@@ ered on on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
The self : you are self-@@ a@@ ware .
"O@@ n that self , it should be cent@@ ered — a bi@@ g@@ ness , a wh@@ ol@@ eness ."
"O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , compassion is just a word and a dre@@ am ."
"You can be compas@@ sio@@ nate o@@ cc@@ a@@ si@@ ona@@ lly , more mo@@ ved by empa@@ thy than by compassion ."
Thank G@@ od we are empa@@ the@@ tic .
"When somebody &apos;s in pain , we pi@@ ck up the pain ."
"In a W@@ im@@ ble@@ don fi@@ nal mat@@ ch , these two gu@@ ys fi@@ ght it out ."
E@@ ach one has got two g@@ am@@ es .
It can be any@@ body &apos;s game .
What they have swe@@ ated so far has no mean@@ ing .
One person w@@ ins .
"The ten@@ n@@ is eti@@ qu@@ et@@ te is , both the play@@ ers have to come to the net and sha@@ ke hands ."
"The win@@ ner bo@@ x@@ es the air and k@@ is@@ ses the ground , th@@ ro@@ ws his shi@@ r@@ t as though somebody is wa@@ iting for it ."
( Laughter ) And this guy has to come to the net .
"When he comes to the net , you see , his whole face changes ."
It looks as though he &apos;s wi@@ shing that he didn &apos;t win .
Why ? E@@ m@@ pa@@ thy .
That &apos;s human heart .
No human heart is d@@ eni@@ ed of that empa@@ thy .
No religi@@ on can demo@@ lish that by in@@ doc@@ tri@@ nation .
"@@ No culture , no nation and nati@@ ona@@ li@@ s@@ m — nothing can tou@@ ch it because it is empa@@ thy ."
"And that cap@@ ac@@ ity to empa@@ thi@@ ze is the win@@ do@@ w through which you reach out to people , you do something that makes a difference in somebody &apos;s life — even words , even time ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is not defin@@ ed in one form .
There &apos;s no Indi@@ an compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
"It tran@@ sc@@ ends nation , the gen@@ der , the age ."
Why ? Because it is there in everybody .
It &apos;s experienc@@ ed by people o@@ cc@@ a@@ si@@ ona@@ lly .
"Th@@ en this o@@ cc@@ a@@ sional compassion , we are not talking about — it will never re@@ main o@@ cc@@ a@@ sional ."
"B@@ y man@@ d@@ ate , you cannot make a person compas@@ sio@@ nate ."
"You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease love me . &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ve is something you disco@@ ver ."
"It &apos;s not an action , but in the English language , it is also an action ."
I will come to it later .
So one has got to disco@@ ver a certain wh@@ ol@@ eness .
"I am going to c@@ ite the possi@@ bility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience ."
"In sp@@ ite of a very tra@@ gi@@ c life , one is happy in mom@@ ents which are very few and far between ."
"And the one who is happy , even for a s@@ lap@@ sti@@ ck j@@ oke , ac@@ cep@@ ts h@@ im@@ self and also the s@@ che@@ me of things in which one fin@@ ds on@@ es@@ el@@ f ."
"That means the whole universe , known things and un@@ known things ."
A@@ ll of them are to@@ tally ac@@ cep@@ ted because you disco@@ ver your wh@@ ol@@ eness in yourself .
"The sub@@ ject — &quot; &quot; me &quot; &quot; — and the ob@@ ject — the s@@ che@@ me of things — fu@@ se into on@@ eness , an experience no@@ body can say , &quot; &quot; I am d@@ eni@@ ed of , &quot; &quot; an experience common to all and s@@ und@@ ry ."
"That experience con@@ fi@@ r@@ ms that , in sp@@ ite of all your limit@@ ations — all your want@@ s , de@@ si@@ res , un@@ fu@@ l@@ fil@@ led , and the cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds and la@@ yo@@ ff@@ s and , finally , bal@@ d@@ ness — you can be happy ."
But the ex@@ ten@@ sion of the logi@@ c is that you don &apos;t need to fu@@ l@@ f@@ ill your de@@ si@@ re to be happy .
"You are the very happiness , the wh@@ ol@@ eness that you want to be ."
"There &apos;s no cho@@ ice in this : that only con@@ fi@@ r@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ eness cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you ."
It has got to be you .
You cannot be a part of wh@@ ol@@ eness and still be whole .
"Y@@ our moment of happiness re@@ ve@@ als that reality , that realiz@@ ation , that re@@ cognition : &quot; &quot; Maybe I am the whole ."
Maybe the s@@ wam@@ i is right .
Maybe the s@@ wam@@ i is right . &quot; &quot; You start your new life .
Th@@ en everything becomes mean@@ ing@@ ful .
I have no more reason to bl@@ ame myself .
"If one has to bl@@ ame on@@ es@@ el@@ f , one has a million reas@@ ons pl@@ us many ."
"But if I say , in sp@@ ite of my body being limit@@ ed — if it is black it is not white , if it is white it is not black : body is limit@@ ed any which way you look at it . L@@ im@@ ited ."
"Y@@ our kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge is limit@@ ed , health is limit@@ ed , and power is ther@@ e@@ fore limit@@ ed , and the che@@ er@@ fu@@ l@@ ness is going to be limit@@ ed ."
C@@ om@@ pas@@ sion is going to be limit@@ ed .
E@@ very@@ thing is going to be limit@@ less .
"You cannot comm@@ and compassion un@@ less you become limit@@ less , and no@@ body can become limit@@ less , ei@@ ther you are or you are not . P@@ eri@@ od ."
And there is no way of your being not limit@@ less too .
"Y@@ our own experience re@@ ve@@ als , in sp@@ ite of all limit@@ ations , you are the whole ."
And the wh@@ ol@@ eness is the reality of you when you rela@@ te to the world .
It is love first .
"When you rela@@ te to the world , the d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tation of the wh@@ ol@@ eness is , what we say , love ."
And itself becomes compassion if the ob@@ ject that you rela@@ te to ev@@ ok@@ es that em@@ oti@@ on .
"Th@@ en that again trans@@ for@@ ms into giving , into sha@@ ring ."
You ex@@ pre@@ ss yourself because you have compassion .
"T@@ o disco@@ ver compassion , you need to be compas@@ sio@@ nate ."
"T@@ o disco@@ ver the cap@@ ac@@ ity to give and share , you need to be giving and sha@@ ring ."
There is no sh@@ or@@ t@@ c@@ ut : it is like s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming .
You cannot learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming on a fo@@ am mat@@ tre@@ ss and en@@ ter into water .
( Laughter ) You learn s@@ w@@ im@@ ming by s@@ w@@ im@@ ming . You learn c@@ y@@ c@@ ling by c@@ y@@ c@@ ling .
"You learn co@@ ok@@ ing by co@@ ok@@ ing , having some sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic people around you to e@@ at what you co@@ ok ."
"( Laughter ) And , ther@@ e@@ fore , what I say , you have to f@@ ake it and make it . ( Laughter )"
You need to .
M@@ y pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or me@@ ant that .
You have to act it out .
You have to act compas@@ sio@@ nately .
"There is no ver@@ b for compassion , but you have an ad@@ ver@@ b for compassion ."
That &apos;s interesting to me .
You act compas@@ sio@@ nately .
"But then , how to act compas@@ sio@@ nately if you don &apos;t have compassion ?"
That is where you f@@ ake .
You f@@ ake it and make it . This is the man@@ tra of the United States of America .
( Laughter ) You f@@ ake it and make it .
"You act compas@@ sio@@ nately as though you have compassion : gr@@ ind your te@@ et@@ h , take all the supp@@ ort system ."
"If you know how to p@@ ra@@ y , p@@ ra@@ y ."
A@@ s@@ k for compassion .
Let me act compas@@ sio@@ nately .
Do it .
"You &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion and also s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly a rela@@ tive compassion , and s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , perhaps if you get the right teach@@ ing , you &apos;ll disco@@ ver compassion is a d@@ y@@ na@@ mic man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tation of the reality of yourself , which is on@@ eness , wh@@ ol@@ eness , and that &apos;s what you are ."
"W@@ ith these words , than@@ k you very much ."

How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks — based on lan@@ d@@ ma@@ ss .
And here &apos;s how news sha@@ p@@ es what Americ@@ ans see .
"This map — ( Applause ) — this map sho@@ ws the number of secon@@ ds that American n@@ et@@ work and c@@ able news organiz@@ ations de@@ dic@@ ated to news stories , by country , in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 200@@ 7 — just one year ago ."
"Now , this was a mon@@ th when Nor@@ th K@@ ore@@ a ag@@ re@@ ed to dis@@ man@@ t@@ le its nu@@ clear fac@@ il@@ ities ."
There was mas@@ sive flo@@ o@@ ding in In@@ don@@ e@@ sia .
"And in P@@ ar@@ is , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ le@@ as@@ ed its study con@@ fi@@ r@@ ming man &apos;s im@@ pa@@ ct on global war@@ ming ."
The U.S. ac@@ count@@ ed for 7@@ 9 percent of to@@ tal news co@@ verage .
"And when we take out the U.S. and look at the re@@ ma@@ ining 2@@ 1 percent , we see a lot of I@@ ra@@ q — that &apos;s that big gre@@ en thing there — and little else ."
"The com@@ b@@ ined co@@ verage of R@@ us@@ sia , China and India , for example , rea@@ ched just one percent ."
"When we anal@@ y@@ zed all the news stories and re@@ mo@@ ved just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked ."
What was that story ? The death of A@@ nna N@@ i@@ co@@ le S@@ mit@@ h .
"This story ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed every country ex@@ cept I@@ ra@@ q , and rec@@ ei@@ ved 10 times the co@@ verage of the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ por@@ t ."
"And the c@@ y@@ cle contin@@ ues ; as we all know , B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y has lo@@ om@@ ed pretty large lat@@ ely ."
"So , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?"
One reason is that news n@@ et@@ works have re@@ duc@@ ed the number of their fore@@ ig@@ n bu@@ re@@ au@@ s by half .
"A@@ side from on@@ e-@@ person A@@ B@@ C mini@@ -@@ bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in N@@ ai@@ ro@@ bi , New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and M@@ u@@ mb@@ ai , there are no n@@ et@@ work news bu@@ re@@ au@@ s in all of A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , India or S@@ ou@@ th America — pla@@ ces that are home to more than two billion people ."
The reality is that co@@ ver@@ ing B@@ rit@@ ne@@ y is che@@ ap@@ er .
And this lack of global co@@ verage is all the more di@@ stu@@ r@@ b@@ ing when we see where people go for news .
"@@ Lo@@ cal T@@ V news lo@@ om@@ s large , and un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately only de@@ dic@@ ates 12 percent of its co@@ verage to inter@@ national news ."
And what about the we@@ b ?
The most popu@@ lar news sit@@ es don &apos;t do much better .
"@@ L@@ a@@ st year , P@@ ew and the C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a J@@ -@@ S@@ cho@@ ol anal@@ y@@ zed the 1@@ 4@@ ,000 stories that app@@ ea@@ red on Google Ne@@ ws &apos; front pa@@ ge ."
"And they , in fact , co@@ vered the same 2@@ 4 news ev@@ ents ."
"S@@ i@@ mi@@ larly , a study in e-@@ con@@ t@@ ent showed that much of global news from U.S. news cre@@ at@@ ors is rec@@ y@@ c@@ led stories from the A@@ P wi@@ re ser@@ vi@@ ces and R@@ e@@ uters , and don &apos;t put things into a con@@ t@@ ex@@ t that people can understand their connec@@ tion to it ."
"So , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college gra@@ du@@ ates , as well as less educ@@ ated Americ@@ ans , know less about the world than their count@@ er@@ parts did 20 years ago ."
"And if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interest@@ ed , you would be wrong ."
"In rec@@ ent years , Americ@@ ans who say they cl@@ os@@ ely fol@@ low global news most of the time gre@@ w to over 50 percent ."
The real question : is this dist@@ or@@ ted wor@@ l@@ d@@ view what we want for Americ@@ ans in our incre@@ a@@ sing@@ ly inter@@ connec@@ ted world ?
I know we can do better .
And can we aff@@ or@@ d not to ? Thank you .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
The dom@@ in@@ ant kind of s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y that exi@@ sts no@@ wa@@ days is job s@@ no@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
I don &apos;t think we are particu@@ larly materi@@ al@@ is@@ tic .
So that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a na@@ st@@ y ki@@ ck@@ back .
"And it &apos;s , again , lin@@ ked to something ni@@ ce ."
And that makes fai@@ lu@@ re seem much more c@@ ru@@ shing .
"That &apos;s ex@@ hi@@ la@@ rating if you &apos;re doing well , and very c@@ ru@@ shing if you &apos;re not ."
"This idea that everybody de@@ ser@@ ves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a cra@@ z@@ y idea , completely cra@@ z@@ y ."
"There are simply too many ran@@ dom fac@@ tors : ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of bir@@ th , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents of things drop@@ ping on people &apos;s he@@ a@@ ds , il@@ l@@ ne@@ s@@ ses , et@@ c ."
"That is an un@@ known part of them , and we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ have as though it is known ."
I gave them the pl@@ ot@@ line of M@@ ad@@ ame B@@ o@@ v@@ ary .
"( Applause ) In a way , if you like , at one end of the spec@@ tru@@ m of sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy , you &apos;ve got the ta@@ blo@@ id ne@@ w@@ spap@@ er ."
"The other thing about modern society and why it cau@@ ses this an@@ x@@ i@@ ety , is that we have nothing at its center that is non@@ -@@ human ."
"It &apos;s an es@@ cap@@ e from our own comp@@ et@@ ition , and our own d@@ ram@@ as ."
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and fai@@ lu@@ re .
"When we &apos;re told that ban@@ king is a very resp@@ ec@@ table profes@@ sion , a lot of us want to go into ban@@ king ."
"When ban@@ king is no longer so resp@@ ec@@ table , we l@@ ose inter@@ est in ban@@ king ."
"But what I really want to stress is : by all means , success , y@@ es ."
But let &apos;s ac@@ cept the st@@ rang@@ eness of some of our ideas .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
"Now I know we learned that in ma@@ th cla@@ ss , but now it &apos;s every@@ where in the culture — The X pri@@ ze , the X@@ -@@ F@@ il@@ es , P@@ ro@@ ject X , TE@@ D@@ x ."
W@@ here &apos;d that come from ?
"A@@ b@@ out six years ago I decided that I would learn Ara@@ bic , which turns out to be a su@@ pre@@ m@@ ely logical language ."
"T@@ o writ@@ e a word or a ph@@ ra@@ se or a sent@@ ence in Ara@@ bic is like cra@@ f@@ ting an equ@@ ation , because every part is extre@@ m@@ ely preci@@ se and car@@ ries a lot of information ."
That &apos;s one of the reas@@ ons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as W@@ est@@ ern science and ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cs and engine@@ ering was really worked out in the first few centu@@ ries of the C@@ om@@ mon E@@ ra by the P@@ er@@ si@@ ans and the Ara@@ b@@ s and the T@@ ur@@ ks .
This inclu@@ des the little system in Ara@@ bic called al@@ -@@ j@@ eb@@ ra .
And al@@ -@@ j@@ eb@@ r rou@@ gh@@ ly trans@@ lat@@ es to &quot; the system for re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing di@@ spa@@ rate parts . &quot;
A@@ l-@@ j@@ eb@@ r finally came into English as al@@ g@@ eb@@ ra .
One example am@@ ong many .
The Ara@@ bic t@@ ex@@ ts con@@ ta@@ ining this ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cal wi@@ s@@ dom finally made their way to Eu@@ ro@@ pe — which is to say S@@ pain — in the 1@@ 1@@ th and 1@@ 2@@ th centu@@ ries .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some s@@ oun@@ ds in Ara@@ bic that just don &apos;t make it through a Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an v@@ oi@@ ce bo@@ x without lots of p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce .
T@@ ru@@ st me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the cul@@ p@@ rit@@ s .
"This is the l@@ et@@ ter S@@ H@@ e@@ en , and it makes the sound we think of as S@@ H — &quot; &quot; sh . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also the very first l@@ et@@ ter of the word sha@@ la@@ n , which means &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; just like the the English word &quot; &quot; something &quot; &quot; — some un@@ defin@@ ed , un@@ known thing ."
"Now in Ara@@ bic , we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite ar@@ ti@@ cle &quot; &quot; al . &quot; &quot; So this is al@@ -@@ sha@@ la@@ n — the un@@ known thing ."
"And this is a word that ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s throu@@ gh@@ out early ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cs , such as this 10@@ th century d@@ eri@@ v@@ ation of pro@@ of@@ s ."
"The problem for the M@@ e@@ di@@ ev@@ al S@@ pan@@ ish scho@@ lars who were ta@@ s@@ ked with trans@@ la@@ ting this material is that the l@@ et@@ ter S@@ H@@ e@@ en and the word sha@@ la@@ n can &apos;t be ren@@ der@@ ed into S@@ pan@@ ish because S@@ pan@@ ish doesn &apos;t have that S@@ H , that &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; sound ."
"So by con@@ v@@ ention , they created a ru@@ le in which they bor@@ ro@@ wed the C@@ K sound , &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; sound , from the cla@@ ssi@@ cal G@@ re@@ ek in the form of the l@@ et@@ ter K@@ ai ."
"@@ L@@ at@@ er when this material was trans@@ lated into a common Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an language , which is to say L@@ ati@@ n , they simply re@@ pla@@ ced the G@@ re@@ ek K@@ ai with the L@@ ati@@ n X@@ ."
"And once that happened , once this material was in L@@ ati@@ n , it for@@ m@@ ed the ba@@ sis for ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cs t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ ok@@ s for almost 6@@ 00 years ."
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the un@@ known ? X is the un@@ known
because you can &apos;t say &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; in S@@ pan@@ ish .
( Laughter ) And I thought that was wor@@ th sha@@ ring .

"&quot; + 2 &quot; said , &quot; I ain &apos;t all bad . &quot;"

It &apos;s the connec@@ tion . It &apos;s the relation@@ shi@@ ps .

We &apos;re born to make a difference .

D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t it feel good to say it out l@@ ou@@ d ?
"I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the ro@@ le of social mov@@ ements in cre@@ ating change in M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ ority societies ."
"So let me beg@@ in by first of all giving a very , very bri@@ e@@ f history of time , if I may in@@ du@@ l@@ ge ."
In medi@@ ev@@ al societies there were defin@@ ed al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces .
A@@ n i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity was defin@@ ed pri@@ ma@@ ri@@ ly by religi@@ on .
"In the age of globaliz@@ ation , we mo@@ ved on ."
"But I believe now that we &apos;re moving into a new age , and that age The New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es du@@ b@@ bed rec@@ ently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavior . &quot; &quot; How I de@@ f@@ ine the age of behavior is a per@@ i@@ od of trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , where i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity is defin@@ ed more so by ideas and na@@ r@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves ."
"But actually it &apos;s my belie@@ f that the people who &apos;ve been truly cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until rec@@ ent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been cap@@ it@@ aliz@@ ing most on the age of behavior and the trans@@ national al@@ le@@ gi@@ an@@ ces , using di@@ g@@ ital acti@@ vi@@ s@@ m and other sor@@ ts of bor@@ der@@ less techno@@ logi@@ es , those who &apos;ve been bene@@ f@@ iting from this have been extre@@ mi@@ sts ."
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to e@@ la@@ bo@@ rate on .
"Now I should know , because for 1@@ 3 years of my life , I was inv@@ ol@@ ved in an extre@@ me I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ st organiz@@ ation ."
"And my story , my perso@@ nal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I &apos;m att@@ emp@@ ting to e@@ la@@ bo@@ rate up@@ on here ."
"I was , by the way — I &apos;m an E@@ s@@ sex la@@ d , born and ra@@ ised in E@@ s@@ sex in the U.@@ K@@ ."
"A@@ t the age of 1@@ 7 , I was rec@@ ru@@ iting people from C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge Uni@@ ver@@ sity to this organiz@@ ation ."
"Now that jour@@ ne@@ y , and what took me from E@@ s@@ sex all the way across the world — by the way , we were la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing at democra@@ tic acti@@ vi@@ sts ."
We f@@ el@@ t they were from the age of y@@ est@@ er@@ year .
I learned how to use e@@ mai@@ l from the extre@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation that I used .
"E@@ v@@ en@@ tually I was det@@ ected , of course , in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt ."
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my adv@@ anta@@ ge was because I was within an extre@@ mi@@ st organiz@@ ation that was for@@ ced to think be@@ yon@@ d the con@@ fin@@ es of the nati@@ on@@ -@@ state .
"So as I said , we looked to the sta@@ tu@@ s qu@@ o and ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led it ."
And it &apos;s not just I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ st extre@@ mi@@ sts that did this .
A form of anti@@ -@@ I@@ s@@ la@@ m r@@ h@@ et@@ ori@@ c is also on the ri@@ se and it &apos;s trans@@ national .
And the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences that this is having is that it &apos;s aff@@ ec@@ ting the political cli@@ mate across Eu@@ ro@@ pe .
Because the Internet and connec@@ tion techno@@ logi@@ es are connec@@ ting them across the world .
"In certain countries , m@@ os@@ qu@@ e mi@@ na@@ re@@ ts are being ban@@ ned ."
"In others , k@@ os@@ her and ha@@ la@@ l me@@ at are being ban@@ ned , as we speak ."
"And on the f@@ li@@ p side , we have trans@@ national I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ st extre@@ mi@@ sts doing the same thing across their own societies ."
And so they are po@@ ck@@ ets of par@@ o@@ chi@@ al@@ ism that are being connec@@ ted in a way that makes them feel like they are main@@ stre@@ am .
Now that never would have been possible before .
"They would have f@@ el@@ t i@@ so@@ lated , until these sor@@ ts of techno@@ logi@@ es came around and connec@@ ted them in a way that made them feel part of a lar@@ ger phenomen@@ on ."
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
And I &apos;ll give you an example here at this sta@@ ge .
If any of you remem@@ b@@ ers the Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s D@@ ay bom@@ b p@@ lot : there &apos;s a man called A@@ n@@ war al@@ -@@ A@@ w@@ lak@@ i .
"As an American c@@ iti@@ z@@ en , e@@ th@@ ni@@ cally a Y@@ em@@ en@@ i , in hi@@ ding curr@@ ently in Y@@ em@@ en , who in@@ spi@@ red a N@@ ig@@ eri@@ an , son of the head of N@@ ig@@ eria &apos;s national b@@ ank ."
"This N@@ ig@@ eri@@ an student studi@@ ed in L@@ on@@ don , tra@@ ined in Y@@ em@@ en , bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light in Am@@ st@@ er@@ dam to atta@@ ck America ."
"The O@@ ld men@@ tal@@ ity with a cap@@ ital O , as re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed by the nati@@ on@@ -@@ state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recogni@@ zing the power of trans@@ national social mov@@ ements , got left behind ."
And the Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s D@@ ay bomb@@ er almost succ@@ ee@@ ded in atta@@ cking the United States of America .
"A@@ g@@ ain with the example of the far right : that we find , i@@ ron@@ i@@ cally , x@@ en@@ o@@ pho@@ bic nati@@ ona@@ li@@ sts are u@@ ti@@ li@@ zing the bene@@ f@@ its of globaliz@@ ation ."
So why are they succ@@ ee@@ ding ?
And why are demo@@ c@@ racy as@@ pi@@ r@@ ants f@@ al@@ ling behind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social mov@@ ements who understand this .
"And a social movement is com@@ pri@@ sed , in my view , it &apos;s com@@ pri@@ sed of four main charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ cs ."
It &apos;s com@@ pri@@ sed of ideas and na@@ r@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and sy@@ mb@@ ols and lead@@ ers .
"I &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be a@@ ware of , and that &apos;s the example of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a ."
"If I asked you to think of the ideas of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely ."
"In@@ ci@@ d@@ en@@ tally , the difference between ideas and na@@ r@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves : the idea is the cause that one beli@@ ev@@ es in ; and the na@@ r@@ ra@@ tive is the way to sel@@ l that cause — the prop@@ ag@@ an@@ da , if you like , of the cause ."
So the ideas and the na@@ r@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves of A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a come to your mind im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely .
One of their lead@@ ers was k@@ il@@ led in P@@ ak@@ istan rec@@ ently .
And that &apos;s the power of social mov@@ ements .
"H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , if I ask your min@@ ds to focu@@ s curr@@ ently on P@@ ak@@ istan , and I ask you to think of the sy@@ mb@@ ols and the lead@@ ers for demo@@ c@@ racy in P@@ ak@@ istan today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think be@@ yon@@ d perhaps the as@@ sa@@ ssi@@ nation of B@@ ena@@ z@@ ir B@@ h@@ ut@@ to ."
"W@@ hi@@ ch means , by defin@@ ition , that particular lead@@ er no longer exi@@ sts ."
"One of the problems we &apos;re fac@@ ing is , in my view , that there are no globaliz@@ ed , you@@ th@@ -@@ led , gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots social mov@@ ements adv@@ oc@@ ating for democra@@ tic culture across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ ority societies ."
"There is no equi@@ val@@ ent of the A@@ l-@@ Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a , without the ter@@ ror@@ ism , for demo@@ c@@ racy across M@@ us@@ lim@@ -@@ maj@@ ority societies ."
So that beg@@ s the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reas@@ ons .
"I believe , number one , it &apos;s com@@ pla@@ c@@ enc@@ y ."
And that level of com@@ pla@@ c@@ enc@@ y means they don &apos;t feel the need to adv@@ oc@@ ate for that culture .
"The second , I believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ tn@@ ess ."
That we have a he@@ sit@@ ation in es@@ p@@ ou@@ sing the univer@@ s@@ ality of democra@@ tic culture because we are as@@ soci@@ ating that — we as@@ soci@@ ate beli@@ ev@@ ing in the univer@@ s@@ ality of our val@@ ues — with extre@@ mi@@ sts .
"Y@@ et actually , wh@@ en@@ ever we talk about human ri@@ ghts , we do say that human ri@@ ghts are univer@@ sa@@ l ."
But actually going out to prop@@ ag@@ ate that view is as@@ soci@@ ated with ei@@ ther ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ vi@@ s@@ m or with I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ st extre@@ mis@@ m .
T@@ o go around saying that I believe democra@@ tic culture is the best that we &apos;ve ar@@ ri@@ ved at as a form of political organiz@@ ing is as@@ soci@@ ated with extre@@ mis@@ m .
"And then you have a thir@@ d par@@ ty saying , &quot; V@@ ot@@ e for us ; we &apos;ll es@@ ta@@ bli@@ sh a the@@ oc@@ racy . &quot;"
"And what happens as a resul@@ t of this is , when those parti@@ es are elec@@ ted , and in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly they fai@@ l , or in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly they make political mis@@ takes , demo@@ c@@ racy takes the bl@@ ame for their political mis@@ takes ."
"And then people say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve tried demo@@ c@@ racy . It doesn &apos;t really work ."
"When talking about those reas@@ ons , let &apos;s b@@ rea@@ k down certain pre@@ con@@ cep@@ tions ."
"A@@ nec@@ do@@ tally , we can de@@ mon@@ st@@ rate that if po@@ ver@@ ty was the only fac@@ tor , well B@@ in L@@ ad@@ en is from one of the rich@@ est families in S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ bi@@ a ."
"H@@ is de@@ put@@ y , A@@ y@@ man al@@ -@@ Z@@ a@@ wa@@ hi@@ r@@ i , was a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ an — not an il@@ l-@@ educ@@ ated man ."
"And what I believe is mis@@ sing is gen@@ u@@ ine gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots acti@@ vi@@ s@@ m on the ground , in ad@@ dition to inter@@ national ai@@ d , in ad@@ dition to education , in ad@@ dition to health ."
"@@ Not ex@@ clu@@ sive to these things , but in ad@@ dition to them , is prop@@ ag@@ ating a gen@@ u@@ ine de@@ m@@ and for demo@@ c@@ racy on the ground ."
And this is where I believe ne@@ o@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ s@@ m had it up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down .
N@@ eo@@ con@@ serv@@ ati@@ s@@ m had the ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ y that you go in with a supp@@ l@@ y-@@ led approach to im@@ p@@ ose democra@@ tic val@@ ues from the top down .
"Wh@@ er@@ e@@ as I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ sts and far@@ -@@ right organiz@@ ations , for dec@@ ad@@ es , have been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the gra@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ ots ."
"M@@ as@@ s mov@@ ements in P@@ ak@@ istan have been re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ed after the Ara@@ b up@@ ri@@ si@@ ngs main@@ ly by organiz@@ ations cla@@ im@@ ing for some form of the@@ oc@@ racy , rather than for a democra@@ tic up@@ ri@@ sing ."
"Because since pre@@ -@@ par@@ t@@ ition , they &apos;ve been building de@@ m@@ and for their ide@@ o@@ logy on the ground ."
And what &apos;s needed is a gen@@ u@@ ine trans@@ national you@@ th@@ -@@ led movement that works to acti@@ vely adv@@ oc@@ ate for the democra@@ tic culture — which is nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly more than just elec@@ tions .
"What that will do is av@@ oi@@ d the problem I was talking about ear@@ li@@ er , where curr@@ ently we have political parti@@ es pres@@ ent@@ ing demo@@ c@@ racy as m@@ er@@ ely a political cho@@ ice in those societies al@@ ong@@ side other cho@@ i@@ ces such as mil@@ it@@ ary ru@@ le and the@@ oc@@ racy ."
"What we &apos;ll have in the end is this ide@@ al that you see on the sli@@ de here — the ide@@ al that people should v@@ ot@@ e in an exi@@ st@@ ing demo@@ c@@ racy , not for a demo@@ c@@ racy ."
"Now to con@@ clu@@ de , how does that happen ?"
"Well , E@@ g@@ y@@ pt is a good starting point ."
The Ara@@ b up@@ ri@@ si@@ ngs have de@@ mon@@ st@@ rat@@ ed that this is already beginning .
But what happened in the Ara@@ b up@@ ri@@ si@@ ngs and what happened in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt was particu@@ larly ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic for me .
We need to move one step be@@ yon@@ d that now .
Because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a lead@@ er or ru@@ ler or dic@@ tat@@ or .
"And we &apos;ve made a start for that in P@@ ak@@ istan with a movement called K@@ hu@@ di , where we are working on the ground to en@@ coura@@ ge the you@@ th to create gen@@ u@@ ine bu@@ y-@@ in for the democra@@ tic culture ."
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
"And my time is up , and than@@ k you for your time ."
"B@@ ac@@ k in New Y@@ or@@ k , I am the head of develop@@ ment for a non@@ -@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood ."
"When I &apos;m not fi@@ gh@@ ting po@@ ver@@ ty , I &apos;m fi@@ gh@@ ting fi@@ res as the as@@ sist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fire compan@@ y ."
"Now in our to@@ wn , where the vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a high@@ ly skil@@ led care@@ er sta@@ ff , you have to get to the fire sc@@ en@@ e pretty early to get in on any action ."
I remem@@ ber my first fire .
"I was the second vol@@ un@@ te@@ er on the sc@@ en@@ e , so there was a pretty good chan@@ ce I was going to get in ."
But still it was a real fo@@ ot@@ ra@@ ce against the other vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our as@@ sig@@ nm@@ ents would be .
"When I found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ ag@@ ing con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with the hom@@ eo@@ w@@ ner , who was su@@ rely having one of the wor@@ st days of her life ."
"@@ Here it was , the middle of the ni@@ ght , she was standing outside in the p@@ our@@ ing ra@@ in , under an u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ la , in her pa@@ j@@ am@@ as , ba@@ re@@ fo@@ ot , while her h@@ ouse was in fl@@ am@@ es ."
The other vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who had ar@@ ri@@ ved just before me — let &apos;s call him L@@ e@@ x L@@ u@@ ther — ( Laughter ) got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and sa@@ ve the hom@@ eo@@ w@@ ner &apos;s do@@ g .
The do@@ g ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with j@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
"@@ Here was some la@@ w@@ y@@ er or money man@@ ag@@ er who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to sa@@ ve a li@@ ving cre@@ ature , just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds ."
"Well , I was next ."
The cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
"He said , &quot; &quot; B@@ e@@ z@@ os , I need you to go into the h@@ ouse ."
"I need you to go up@@ stair@@ s , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pai@@ r of sh@@ oes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I s@@ w@@ ear ."
"So , not exactly what I was h@@ op@@ ing for , but off I went — up the stair@@ s , down the ha@@ ll , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , who were pretty much done put@@ ting out the fire at this point , into the ma@@ ster be@@ d@@ room to get a pai@@ r of sh@@ oes ."
"Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no h@@ ero ."
( Laughter ) I car@@ ried my pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad back do@@ w@@ n@@ stair@@ s where I m@@ et my ne@@ mes@@ is and the preci@@ ous do@@ g by the front door .
"We took our t@@ rea@@ su@@ res outside to the hom@@ eo@@ w@@ ner , where , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , his rec@@ ei@@ ved much more att@@ ention than did m@@ ine ."
"A few weeks later , the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment rec@@ ei@@ ved a l@@ et@@ ter from the hom@@ eo@@ w@@ ner than@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant eff@@ ort di@@ sp@@ lay@@ ed in sa@@ ving her home ."
The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she not@@ ed ab@@ ove all others : someone had even g@@ ot@@ ten her a pai@@ r of sh@@ oes .
"( Laughter ) In both my v@@ oc@@ ation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a vol@@ un@@ te@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ ghter , I am wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ u@@ mental scal@@ e , but I &apos;m also wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individu@@ al ba@@ sis ."
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
"So as I look around this room at people who ei@@ ther have achiev@@ ed , or are on their way to achiev@@ ing , re@@ mark@@ able lev@@ els of success , I would off@@ er this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wait ."
D@@ on &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
"If you have something to give , give it now ."
S@@ er@@ ve fo@@ od at a s@@ ou@@ p kit@@ ch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od par@@ k .
B@@ e a m@@ ent@@ or .
"@@ Not every day is going to off@@ er us a chan@@ ce to sa@@ ve somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to aff@@ ect one ."
So get in the game . S@@ a@@ ve the sh@@ oes .
Thank you .
"( Applause ) B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ san@@ i : Mar@@ k , Mar@@ k , come back . ( Applause )"
Mar@@ k B@@ e@@ z@@ os : Thank you .
"M@@ ar@@ k Z@@ u@@ ck@@ er@@ ber@@ g , a jour@@ na@@ li@@ st was asking him a question about the news fe@@ ed ."
"And the jour@@ na@@ li@@ st was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;"
"And Z@@ u@@ ck@@ er@@ ber@@ g said , &quot; &quot; A s@@ qui@@ r@@ re@@ l d@@ ying in your front y@@ ar@@ d may be more re@@ lev@@ ant to your interest@@ s right now than people d@@ ying in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a . &quot; &quot; And I want to talk about what a W@@ eb based on that idea of re@@ lev@@ ance might look like ."
"So when I was gro@@ wing up in a really ru@@ ral are@@ a in Ma@@ ine , the Internet me@@ ant something very different to me ."
It me@@ ant a connec@@ tion to the world .
It me@@ ant something that would con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for demo@@ c@@ racy and for our society .
"And if we don &apos;t pay att@@ ention to it , it could be a real problem ."
So I first noti@@ ced this in a place I sp@@ end a lot of time — my F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok pa@@ ge .
"I &apos;m progre@@ s@@ sive , politi@@ cally — big surpri@@ se — but I &apos;ve always gone out of my way to me@@ et con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves ."
I like hear@@ ing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like see@@ ing what they l@@ ink to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surpri@@ sed when I noti@@ ced one day that the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves had di@@ sap@@ p@@ ea@@ red from my F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok fe@@ ed .
"And what it turned out was going on was that F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok was looking at which lin@@ ks I cli@@ cked on , and it was noti@@ c@@ ing that , actually , I was c@@ lic@@ king more on my liber@@ al friends &apos; lin@@ ks than on my con@@ serv@@ ative friends &apos; lin@@ ks ."
"And without con@@ sul@@ ting me about it , it had e@@ dit@@ ed them out ."
They di@@ sap@@ p@@ ea@@ red .
"So F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of in@@ vi@@ sible , al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic e@@ dit@@ ing of the W@@ eb ."
Google &apos;s doing it too .
"If I sear@@ ch for something , and you sear@@ ch for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different sear@@ ch results ."
Th@@ ink about it for a second : there is no stan@@ dar@@ d Google any@@ more .
"And you know , the fun@@ ny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see ."
You can &apos;t see how different your sear@@ ch results are from any@@ one else &apos;s .
So here &apos;s my fri@@ end S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s scre@@ en sh@@ ot .
And here &apos;s my fri@@ end D@@ an@@ i@@ el &apos;s scre@@ en sh@@ ot .
"When you put them si@@ de@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ side , you don &apos;t even have to read the lin@@ ks to see how different these two pa@@ ges are ."
"But when you do read the lin@@ ks , it &apos;s really quite re@@ mark@@ able ."
D@@ an@@ i@@ el didn &apos;t get anything about the prot@@ est@@ s in E@@ g@@ y@@ pt at all in his first pa@@ ge of Google results .
S@@ c@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were fu@@ ll of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are becom@@ ing .
So it &apos;s not just Google and F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok ei@@ ther .
This is something that &apos;s swe@@ ep@@ ing the W@@ eb .
There are a whole h@@ ost of compan@@ ies that are doing this kind of perso@@ na@@ li@@ zation .
"Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o Ne@@ ws , the bi@@ ggest news sit@@ e on the Internet , is now perso@@ na@@ li@@ zed — different people get different things ."
"H@@ u@@ ffi@@ ng@@ ton P@@ ost , the W@@ a@@ sh@@ ing@@ ton P@@ ost , the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es — all f@@ li@@ r@@ ting with perso@@ na@@ li@@ zation in vari@@ ous ways ."
"And this mo@@ ves us very quickly to@@ ward a world in which the Internet is sho@@ wing us what it thin@@ ks we want to see , but not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly what we need to see ."
"And I think , if you take all of these fil@@ ters together , you take all these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms , you get what I call a fil@@ ter bubble ."
"And your fil@@ ter bubble is your own perso@@ nal , uni@@ qu@@ e universe of information that you live in on@@ line ."
"And what &apos;s in your fil@@ ter bubble depen@@ ds on who you are , and it depen@@ ds on what you do ."
But the thing is that you don &apos;t deci@@ de what gets in .
"And more import@@ antly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets e@@ dit@@ ed out ."
So one of the problems with the fil@@ ter bubble was disco@@ vered by some resear@@ chers at N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x .
"They en@@ ter the qu@@ e@@ ue , they just z@@ i@@ p right out ."
"So &quot; &quot; I@@ ron M@@ an &quot; &quot; z@@ i@@ ps right out , and &quot; &quot; W@@ a@@ iting for Su@@ per@@ man &quot; &quot; can wait for a really long time ."
What they disco@@ vered was that in our N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ ues there &apos;s this e@@ pi@@ c stru@@ gg@@ le going on between our future as@@ pi@@ ra@@ ti@@ onal selves and our more im@@ pul@@ sive present selves .
"You know we all want to be someone who has wat@@ ched &quot; &quot; R@@ a@@ sh@@ om@@ on , &quot; &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; &quot; A@@ ce V@@ en@@ tu@@ ra &quot; &quot; for the f@@ our@@ th time ."
It gi@@ ves us a little bit of Ju@@ sti@@ n Bi@@ eb@@ er and a little bit of Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
It gi@@ ves us some information ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les ; it gi@@ ves us some information de@@ s@@ ser@@ t .
"And the challenge with these kinds of al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic fil@@ ters , these perso@@ na@@ li@@ zed fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you cli@@ ck on first , it can th@@ row off that bal@@ ance ."
"And instead of a bal@@ an@@ ced information di@@ et , you can end up sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by information j@@ un@@ k fo@@ od ."
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re see@@ ing is more of a pas@@ sing of the t@@ or@@ ch from human g@@ at@@ ek@@ ee@@ per@@ s to al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic ones .
And the thing is that the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms don &apos;t yet have the kind of em@@ be@@ d@@ ded e@@ thi@@ cs that the e@@ dit@@ ors did .
"So if al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms are going to cu@@ rate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to deci@@ de what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just ke@@ y@@ ed to re@@ lev@@ ance ."
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are un@@ com@@ for@@ table or challeng@@ ing or important — this is what TED does — other point@@ s of view .
"And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society ."
"In 19@@ 15 , it &apos;s not like ne@@ w@@ spap@@ ers were swe@@ ating a lot about their civi@@ c respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ities ."
Th@@ en people noti@@ ced that they were doing something really important .
"That , in fact , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t have a fun@@ cti@@ oning demo@@ c@@ racy if c@@ iti@@ z@@ ens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the ne@@ w@@ spap@@ ers were c@@ riti@@ cal because they were ac@@ ting as the fil@@ ter , and then jour@@ na@@ li@@ stic e@@ thi@@ cs developed ."
"It wasn &apos;t perf@@ ect , but it got us through the last century ."
"And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 19@@ 15 on the W@@ eb ."
And we need the new g@@ at@@ ek@@ ee@@ per@@ s to en@@ co@@ de that kind of respon@@ si@@ bility into the co@@ de that they &apos;re writ@@ ing .
"I know that there are a lot of people here from F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok and from Google — L@@ ar@@ ry and S@@ er@@ ge@@ y — people who have hel@@ ped build the W@@ eb as it is , and I &apos;m g@@ rat@@ e@@ ful for that ."
"But we really need you to make sure that these al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have en@@ co@@ ded in them a sense of the publi@@ c life , a sense of civi@@ c respon@@ si@@ bility ."
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re tran@@ sp@@ ar@@ ent enough that we can see what the ru@@ les are that det@@ er@@ m@@ ine what gets through our fil@@ ters .
And we need you to give us some control so that we can deci@@ de what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dre@@ am@@ ed of it being .
We need it to con@@ n@@ ect us all together .
We need it to int@@ ro@@ duce us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ves .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it lea@@ ves us all i@@ so@@ lated in a W@@ eb of one .
Thank you .

"So instead of going to co@@ ff@@ e@@ e me@@ eti@@ ngs or flu@@ ore@@ sc@@ ent@@ -@@ l@@ it con@@ fer@@ ence room me@@ eti@@ ngs , I ask people to go on a walking me@@ eting , to the tun@@ e of 20 to 30 mi@@ les a week ."
It &apos;s changed my life .
"But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of ob@@ lig@@ ations , and one always came at the cost of the other ."
"So now , se@@ ver@@ al hundred of these walking me@@ eti@@ ngs later , I &apos;ve learned a few things ."
"F@@ irst , there &apos;s this ama@@ zing thing about actually getting out of the bo@@ x that lea@@ ds to out@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ x thinking ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s nature or the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se itself , it cer@@ tain@@ ly works ."
"And second , and probably the more re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in op@@ position when they &apos;re really not that way ."
"And if we &apos;re going to sol@@ ve problems and look at the world really differ@@ ently , whether it &apos;s in gover@@ nan@@ ce or bu@@ siness or environ@@ mental is@@ sue@@ s , job cre@@ ation , maybe we can think about how to re@@ f@@ r@@ ame those problems as having both things be true ."
Because it was when that happened with this wal@@ k@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ talk idea that things became do@@ able and su@@ sta@@ i@@ na@@ ble and vi@@ able .
"So I started this talk talking about the tu@@ sh , so I &apos;ll end with the bot@@ tom line , which is , wal@@ k and talk ."
W@@ al@@ k the talk .
"You &apos;ll be surpri@@ sed at how fre@@ sh air dri@@ ves fre@@ sh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an enti@@ rely new set of ideas ."
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
"And I &apos;d like to share a 45 year-@@ old love story with the poor , li@@ ving on less than one dol@@ lar a day ."
"I went to a very el@@ iti@@ st , s@@ no@@ b@@ bi@@ sh , ex@@ pen@@ sive education in India , and that almost dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed me ."
"I was all set to be a di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma@@ t , teacher , doc@@ tor — all lai@@ d out ."
"Th@@ en , I don &apos;t look it , but I was the Indi@@ an national squ@@ as@@ h cham@@ pi@@ on for three years ."
( Laughter ) The whole world was lai@@ d out for me .
E@@ very@@ thing was at my fe@@ et .
I could do nothing wrong .
And then I thought out of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity I &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
"So in 19@@ 6@@ 5 , I went to what was called the wor@@ st Bi@@ har fam@@ ine in India , and I saw star@@ v@@ ation , death , people d@@ ying of hu@@ ng@@ er , for the first time ."
It changed my life .
"I came back home , told my mother , &quot; I &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;"
M@@ other went into a com@@ a .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What is this ?
"The whole world is lai@@ d out for you , the best j@@ ob@@ s are lai@@ d out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?"
"I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best educ@@ tion ."
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
"@@ No job , no money , no sec@@ ur@@ ity , no p@@ ros@@ p@@ ect . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to live and di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ g wel@@ ls for five years ?"
"You went to the most ex@@ pen@@ sive school and college in India , and you want to di@@ g wel@@ ls for five years ? &quot; &quot; She didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought I &apos;d let my family down ."
"But then , I was ex@@ pos@@ ed to the most extra@@ ordinary kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and skil@@ ls that very poor people have , which are never brought into the main@@ stre@@ am — which is never i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied , resp@@ ected , app@@ li@@ ed on a large scal@@ e ."
And I thought I &apos;d start a B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge — college only for the poor .
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ected in the college .
I went to this village for the first time .
"E@@ l@@ ders came to me and said , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you run@@ ning from the po@@ li@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You fai@@ led in your ex@@ am ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot;"
"&quot; You didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
The education system in India makes you look at P@@ ar@@ is and New D@@ el@@ h@@ i and Z@@ u@@ rich ; what are you doing in this village ?
"I@@ s there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to actually start a college only for the poor ."
What the poor thought was important would be re@@ fl@@ ected in the college . &quot; &quot; So the el@@ ders gave me some very sound and pro@@ found ad@@ vice .
"They said , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease , don &apos;t bring any@@ one with a de@@ g@@ ree and qu@@ ali@@ fic@@ ation into your college . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s the only college in India where , if you should have a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . or a Ma@@ ster &apos;s , you are dis@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied to come ."
You have to be a cop@@ -@@ out or a wa@@ sh@@ -@@ out or a drop@@ out to come to our college .
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a di@@ g@@ n@@ ity of la@@ b@@ or .
You have to show that you have a sk@@ ill that you can off@@ er to the commun@@ ity and pro@@ vi@@ de a ser@@ vice to the commun@@ ity .
"So we started the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , and we re@@ defin@@ ed profes@@ si@@ ona@@ li@@ s@@ m ."
Wh@@ o is a profes@@ sional ?
"A profes@@ sional is someone who has a com@@ bi@@ nation of comp@@ et@@ ence , con@@ fi@@ dence and belie@@ f ."
A water di@@ v@@ in@@ er is a profes@@ sional .
A tra@@ diti@@ onal mi@@ d@@ wife is a profes@@ sional .
A tra@@ diti@@ onal b@@ one s@@ et@@ ter is a profes@@ sional .
These are profes@@ si@@ ona@@ ls all over the world .
You find them in any i@@ na@@ cc@@ es@@ sible village around the world .
And we thought that these people should come into the main@@ stre@@ am and show that the kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and skil@@ ls that they have is univer@@ sa@@ l .
"It needs to be used , needs to be app@@ li@@ ed , needs to be sho@@ wn to the world outside — that these kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and skil@@ ls are re@@ lev@@ ant even today ."
So the college works follo@@ wing the li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le and work@@ st@@ y@@ le of Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i .
"You e@@ at on the flo@@ or , you s@@ le@@ ep on the flo@@ or , you work on the flo@@ or ."
"There are no con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts , no w@@ r@@ itt@@ en con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts ."
"You can sta@@ y with me for 20 years , go tom@@ or@@ row ."
And no one can get more than $ 100 a mon@@ th .
"You come for the money , you don &apos;t come to B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
"You come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge ."
That is where we want you to try cra@@ z@@ y ideas .
"W@@ hat@@ ever idea you have , come and try it ."
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fai@@ l .
"B@@ att@@ ered , b@@ ru@@ ised , you start again ."
It &apos;s the only college where the teacher is the lear@@ ner and the lear@@ ner is the teacher .
And it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
You are cer@@ ti@@ fied by the commun@@ ity you serve .
You don &apos;t need a pap@@ er to h@@ ang on the w@@ all to show that you are an engine@@ er .
"So when I said that , they said , &quot; &quot; Well show us what is possible . What are you doing ?"
This is all mum@@ bo@@ -@@ ju@@ mb@@ o if you can &apos;t show it on the ground . &quot; &quot; So we built the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge in 198@@ 6 .
"It was built by 12 B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and writ@@ e , built on $ 1@@ .@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft ."
"@@ 150 people li@@ ved there , worked there ."
They got the A@@ g@@ a K@@ ha@@ n A@@ ward for A@@ r@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture in 200@@ 2 .
"But then they su@@ spec@@ ted , they thought there was an ar@@ chit@@ ect behind it ."
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , they made the b@@ lue@@ pr@@ int@@ s , but the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts actually con@@ struc@@ ted the college . &quot; &quot; We are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually c@@ ast@@ ing as@@ per@@ sions on the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ts of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia ."
"I asked a fore@@ ster — high@@ -@@ power@@ ed , pap@@ er@@ -@@ qu@@ ali@@ fied exper@@ t — I said , &quot; &quot; What can you build in this place ? &quot; &quot; He had one look at the so@@ i@@ l and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ or@@ get it . No way ."
Not even wor@@ th it .
"@@ No water , ro@@ ck@@ y so@@ i@@ l . &quot; &quot; I was in a bit of a sp@@ ot ."
"And I said , &quot; &quot; O@@ kay , I &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; What should I grow in this sp@@ ot ? &apos; &quot; &quot; He looked qui@@ et@@ ly at me and said , &quot; You build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;"
This is what it looks like today .
"W@@ ent to the ro@@ of , and all the women said , &quot; &quot; C@@ le@@ ar out ."
The men should clear out because we don &apos;t want to share this technology with the men .
"This is wat@@ er@@ pro@@ of@@ ing the ro@@ of . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It is a bit of j@@ ag@@ g@@ ery , a bit of ur@@ ens and a bit of other things I don &apos;t know ."
But it actually doesn &apos;t le@@ ak .
"S@@ in@@ ce 198@@ 6 , it ha@@ sn &apos;t le@@ ak@@ ed ."
"This technology , the women will not share with the men ."
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the only college which is fully so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied .
A@@ ll the power comes from the sun .
45 ki@@ lo@@ w@@ att@@ s of pan@@ els on the ro@@ of .
And everything works off the sun for the next 2@@ 5 years .
"So long as the sun sh@@ in@@ es , we &apos;ll have no problem with power ."
"But the beau@@ ty is that is was in@@ sta@@ l@@ led by a pri@@ est , a H@@ in@@ du pri@@ est , who &apos;s only done eight years of pri@@ ma@@ ry scho@@ ol@@ ing — never been to school , never been to college ."
He kno@@ ws more about solar than any@@ one I know any@@ where in the world gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ e@@ ed .
"F@@ ood , if you come to the B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge , is solar co@@ ok@@ ed ."
"But the people who f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ated that solar co@@ ok@@ er are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ate the most so@@ phi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated solar co@@ ok@@ er ."
It &apos;s a pa@@ ra@@ bo@@ li@@ c S@@ che@@ ff@@ ler solar co@@ ok@@ er .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , they &apos;re almost half G@@ er@@ man , they &apos;re so preci@@ se ."
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll never find Indi@@ an women so preci@@ se .
"A@@ b@@ solutely to the last in@@ ch , they can make that co@@ ok@@ er ."
And we have 60 me@@ als twi@@ ce a day of solar co@@ ok@@ ing .
"We have a d@@ enti@@ st — she &apos;s a grand@@ mother , il@@ liter@@ ate , who &apos;s a d@@ enti@@ st ."
"She actually looks after the te@@ et@@ h of 7@@ ,000 children ."
"B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot technology : this was 198@@ 6 — no engine@@ er , no ar@@ chit@@ ect thought of it — but we are col@@ lec@@ ting ra@@ in@@ water from the ro@@ of@@ s ."
V@@ ery little water is wa@@ sted .
"All the ro@@ of@@ s are connec@@ ted under@@ ground to a 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 lit@@ er t@@ ank , and no water is wa@@ sted ."
"If we have four years of d@@ rought , we still have water on the cam@@ p@@ us , because we col@@ l@@ ect ra@@ in@@ water ."
"@@ 60 percent of children don &apos;t go to school , because they have to look after an@@ ima@@ ls — s@@ he@@ ep , go@@ at@@ s — domestic cho@@ res ."
So we thought of starting a school at ni@@ ght for the children .
"Because the ni@@ ght schools of T@@ il@@ on@@ ia , over 7@@ 5,000 children have gone through these ni@@ ght schools ."
Because it &apos;s for the con@@ v@@ eni@@ ence of the child ; it &apos;s not for the con@@ v@@ eni@@ ence of the teacher .
And what do we tea@@ ch in these schools ?
"D@@ e@@ mo@@ c@@ racy , c@@ iti@@ z@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted , what you should do if your an@@ ima@@ l is si@@ ck ."
This is what we tea@@ ch in the ni@@ ght schools .
But all the schools are so@@ lar@@ -@@ l@@ it .
E@@ very five years we have an elec@@ tion .
"B@@ et@@ ween six to 14 year-@@ old children parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in a democra@@ tic process , and they el@@ ect a pri@@ me mini@@ ster ."
The pri@@ me mini@@ ster is 12 years old .
"She looks after 20 go@@ at@@ s in the morning , but she &apos;s pri@@ me mini@@ ster in the even@@ ing ."
"She has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ et , a mini@@ ster of education , a mini@@ ster for energy , a mini@@ ster for health ."
"And they actually mon@@ it@@ or and super@@ vi@@ se 150 schools for 7@@ ,000 children ."
"She got the World &apos;s Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s P@@ ri@@ ze five years ago , and she went to Swe@@ den ."
F@@ irst time ever going out of her village .
N@@ ever seen Swe@@ den .
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t da@@ z@@ z@@ led at all by what was happening .
"And the Q@@ ue@@ en of Swe@@ den , who &apos;s there , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you ask this child where she got her con@@ fi@@ dence from ?"
"She &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not da@@ z@@ z@@ led by anything . &quot; &quot; And the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the qu@@ e@@ en st@@ rai@@ ght in the ey@@ e and said , &quot; &quot; P@@ lease tell her I &apos;m the pri@@ me mini@@ ster . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) W@@ here the perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y is very high , we use pu@@ pp@@ et@@ ry ."
P@@ u@@ pp@@ ets is the way we comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ate .
You have Jo@@ khi@@ m C@@ ha@@ cha who is 3@@ 00 years old .
He is my psycho@@ anal@@ y@@ st . He is my teacher .
He &apos;s my doc@@ tor . He &apos;s my la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
He &apos;s my don@@ or .
"He actually ra@@ is@@ es money , sol@@ ves my di@@ sp@@ utes ."
He sol@@ ves my problems in the village .
"If there &apos;s ten@@ sion in the village , if att@@ en@@ dan@@ ce at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a fri@@ ction between the teacher and the par@@ ent , the pu@@ pp@@ et cal@@ ls the teacher and the par@@ ent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; &quot; S@@ ha@@ ke hands ."
The att@@ en@@ dan@@ ce must not drop . &quot; &quot; These pu@@ pp@@ ets are made out of rec@@ y@@ c@@ led World B@@ ank re@@ por@@ ts .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this dec@@ ent@@ ra@@ li@@ zed , de@@ my@@ sti@@ fied approach of so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ f@@ ying villa@@ ges , we &apos;ve co@@ vered all over India from L@@ ad@@ akh up to B@@ hu@@ tan — all so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied villa@@ ges by people who have been tra@@ ined ."
"And we went to L@@ ad@@ akh , and we asked this woman — this , at min@@ us 40 , you have to come out of the ro@@ of , because there &apos;s no place , it was all s@@ no@@ wed up on both si@@ des — and we asked this woman , &quot; &quot; What was the bene@@ fit you had from solar electri@@ city ? &quot; &quot; And she thought for a min@@ ute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my hus@@ b@@ and &apos;s face in win@@ ter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) W@@ ent to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
One le@@ s@@ son we learned in India was men are un@@ tra@@ i@@ na@@ ble .
"( Laughter ) M@@ en are re@@ st@@ less , men are am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous , men are compu@@ l@@ si@@ vely mo@@ bi@@ le , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate . ( Laughter )"
"All across the glo@@ be , you have this ten@@ d@@ enc@@ y of men want@@ ing a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate ."
"Wh@@ y ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job ."
So we came up with a great sol@@ ution : tra@@ in grand@@ mothers .
What &apos;s the best way of comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ating in the world today ?
T@@ el@@ evi@@ sion ? No .
T@@ el@@ e@@ graph ? No .
T@@ el@@ e@@ phone ? No .
T@@ ell a woman .
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we went to Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the first time , and we pi@@ cked three women and said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I@@ m@@ possible . They don &apos;t even go out of their ro@@ om@@ s , and you want to take them to India . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a con@@ c@@ es@@ sion . I &apos;ll take the hus@@ ban@@ ds along as well . &quot; &quot; So I took the hus@@ ban@@ ds along ."
"O@@ f course , the women were much more intellig@@ ent than the men ."
"In six months , how do we tra@@ in these women ?"
S@@ ig@@ n language .
You don &apos;t choose the w@@ r@@ itt@@ en word .
You don &apos;t choose the sp@@ ok@@ en word .
You use sig@@ n language .
And in six months they can become solar engine@@ ers .
They go back and so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ f@@ y their own village .
"This woman went back and so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied the first village , set up a work@@ sh@@ op — the first village ever to be so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan &#91; was &#93; by the three women . This wom@@ an@@ "
is an extra@@ ordinary grand@@ mother .
"@@ 5@@ 5 years old , and she &apos;s so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied 200 h@@ ou@@ ses for me in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan ."
And they ha@@ ven &apos;t col@@ lap@@ sed .
She actually went and sp@@ oke to an engine@@ ering de@@ par@@ t@@ ment in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan and told the head of the de@@ par@@ t@@ ment the difference between A@@ C and D@@ C .
He didn &apos;t know .
Th@@ ose three women have tra@@ ined 2@@ 7 more women and so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied 100 villa@@ ges in Af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan .
"We went to A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , and we did the same thing ."
"All these women s@@ itt@@ ing at one table from eight , n@@ ine countries , all chat@@ ting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speak@@ ing a different language ."
But their body language is great .
They &apos;re speak@@ ing to each other and actually becom@@ ing solar engine@@ ers .
"I went to S@@ i@@ er@@ ra L@@ e@@ one , and there was this mini@@ ster dri@@ ving down in the de@@ ad of ni@@ ght — comes across this village ."
"C@@ om@@ es back , goes into the village , says , &quot; &quot; Well what &apos;s the story ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; These two grand@@ mothers ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ rand@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; The mini@@ ster cou@@ ldn &apos;t believe what was happening ."
&quot; W@@ here did they go ? &quot; &quot; W@@ ent to India and back . &quot;
W@@ ent st@@ rai@@ ght to the pre@@ si@@ dent .
"He said , &quot; &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a so@@ lar@@ -@@ electri@@ fied village in S@@ i@@ er@@ ra L@@ e@@ one ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; H@@ al@@ f the c@@ ab@@ in@@ et went to see the grand@@ mothers the next day ."
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
"So he sum@@ mon@@ ed me and said , &quot; &quot; Can you tra@@ in me 150 grand@@ mothers ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t , M@@ r@@ . P@@ re@@ si@@ dent ."
But they will . The grand@@ mothers will . &quot; &quot; So he built me the first B@@ are@@ fo@@ ot tra@@ ining center in S@@ i@@ er@@ ra L@@ e@@ one .
And 150 grand@@ mothers have been tra@@ ined in S@@ i@@ er@@ ra L@@ e@@ one .
G@@ am@@ bi@@ a : we went to sel@@ ect a grand@@ mother in G@@ am@@ bi@@ a .
W@@ ent to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
"The commun@@ ity got together and said , &quot; &quot; T@@ ake these two women . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Why ? She doesn &apos;t know the language . You don &apos;t know her . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I like the body language . I like the way she speak@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ i@@ fficul@@ t hus@@ b@@ and ; not possible . &quot;"
"C@@ al@@ led the hus@@ b@@ and , the hus@@ b@@ and came , s@@ wa@@ gg@@ ering , politi@@ ci@@ an , mo@@ bi@@ le in his hand . &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; The woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;"
"I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah , she is very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; What happens if she run@@ s off with an Indi@@ an man ? &quot;"
That was his bi@@ ggest fear .
"I said , &quot; &quot; She &apos;ll be happy . She &apos;ll ring you up on the mo@@ bi@@ le . &quot; &quot; She went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger ."
She wal@@ ked out of the plan@@ e and sp@@ oke to the whole pre@@ ss as if she was a v@@ et@@ er@@ an .
"She han@@ d@@ led the national pre@@ ss , and she was a star ."
"And when I went back six months later , I said , &quot; &quot; W@@ here &apos;s your hus@@ b@@ and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ h , some@@ where . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;"
( Laughter ) Su@@ cc@@ ess story . ( Laughter )
( Applause ) I &apos;ll just w@@ ind up by saying that I think you don &apos;t have to look for sol@@ u@@ tions outside .
Lo@@ ok for sol@@ u@@ tions within .
And li@@ st@@ en to people . They have the sol@@ u@@ tions in front of you .
They &apos;re all over the world .
D@@ on &apos;t even wor@@ ry .
"D@@ on &apos;t li@@ st@@ en to the World B@@ ank , li@@ st@@ en to the people on the ground ."
They have all the sol@@ u@@ tions in the world .
I &apos;ll end with a qu@@ o@@ tation by Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ an@@ d@@ h@@ i .
"&quot; &quot; F@@ irst they ig@@ n@@ ore you , then they la@@ u@@ gh at you , then they fi@@ ght you , and then you win . &quot; &quot; Thank you ."
( Applause )
B@@ .@@ J@@ . was one of many f@@ el@@ low in@@ mat@@ es who had big plan@@ s for the future .
"He had a vision . Wh@@ en he got out , he was going to leave the do@@ pe game for good and f@@ ly st@@ rai@@ ght , and he was actually working on m@@ er@@ g@@ ing his two pas@@ sions into one vision ."
"He &apos;d spent 1@@ 0,000 dollars to buy a w@@ eb@@ sit@@ e that ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely fe@@ atu@@ red women having sex on top of or inside of lu@@ x@@ u@@ ry sp@@ or@@ ts car@@ s . ( Laughter ) It was my first week in fe@@ der@@ al pri@@ son , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on T@@ V ."
"In fact , it was te@@ em@@ ing with smar@@ t , am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous men wh@@ ose bu@@ siness in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ ts were in many c@@ ases as sha@@ r@@ p as those of the C@@ E@@ O@@ s who had w@@ ined and d@@ ined me six months ear@@ li@@ er when I was a ri@@ sing star in the M@@ is@@ sour@@ i S@@ ena@@ te ."
"Now , 9@@ 5 percent of the gu@@ ys that I was lo@@ cked up with had been drug de@@ al@@ ers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , but the bu@@ siness con@@ cep@@ ts that they talked about wer@@ en &apos;t un@@ like those that you &apos;d learn in a first year M@@ B@@ A cla@@ ss at W@@ har@@ ton : pr@@ om@@ oti@@ onal in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves , you never char@@ ge a fi@@ r@@ st@@ -@@ time us@@ er , focu@@ s@@ -@@ grou@@ ping new produc@@ t la@@ un@@ ches , ter@@ rit@@ ori@@ al expan@@ sion ."
But they didn &apos;t sp@@ end a lot of time reli@@ ving the g@@ l@@ ory days .
"For the most part , everyone was just trying to survi@@ ve ."
It &apos;s a lot har@@ der than you might think .
"C@@ on@@ tra@@ ry to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in pri@@ son . You &apos;ve got to pay for your own life ."
"You &apos;ve got to pay for your so@@ ap , your de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ b@@ ru@@ sh , to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e , all of it ."
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reas@@ ons .
"F@@ irst , everything &apos;s mar@@ ked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d pay on the stre@@ et , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money ."
"I un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed tru@@ cks . That was my fu@@ l@@ l-@@ time job , un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing tru@@ cks at a fo@@ od wa@@ re@@ h@@ ouse , for $ 5@@ .@@ 2@@ 5 , not an h@@ our , but per mon@@ th ."
So how do you survi@@ ve ?
"Well , you learn to hu@@ st@@ le , all kinds of hu@@ st@@ les ."
There &apos;s le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les .
You pay everything in st@@ am@@ ps . Th@@ ose are the curr@@ enc@@ y .
You char@@ ge another in@@ mate to cle@@ an his cell .
"There &apos;s sort of il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , like you ru@@ n a bar@@ ber@@ sh@@ op out of your cell ."
There &apos;s pretty il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les : You ru@@ n a tat@@ too par@@ l@@ or out of your own cell .
"And there &apos;s very il@@ le@@ g@@ al hu@@ st@@ les , which you s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le in , you get s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led in , dru@@ gs , por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , cell phon@@ es , and just as in the ou@@ ter world , there &apos;s a ri@@ sk@@ -@@ re@@ ward tra@@ de@@ off , so the ris@@ ki@@ er the ent@@ er@@ pri@@ se , the more prof@@ it@@ able it can potenti@@ ally be ."
You want a ci@@ ga@@ re@@ t@@ te in pri@@ son ? Th@@ ree to five dollars .
You want an ol@@ d-@@ fa@@ shi@@ on@@ ed cell phone that you f@@ li@@ p open and is about as big as your head ? Th@@ ree hundred bu@@ cks .
You want a di@@ r@@ ty ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine ?
"Well , it can be as much as 1@@ ,000 dollars ."
"So as you can probably tell , one of the defin@@ ing as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of pri@@ son life is ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity ."
"W@@ he@@ ther it was con@@ co@@ c@@ ting d@@ eli@@ ci@@ ous me@@ als from st@@ ol@@ en sc@@ rap@@ s from the wa@@ re@@ h@@ ouse , s@@ cul@@ p@@ ting people &apos;s hair with t@@ oe@@ nai@@ l cli@@ pp@@ ers , or con@@ struc@@ ting we@@ i@@ ghts from b@@ ou@@ l@@ ders in la@@ und@@ ry ba@@ gs ti@@ ed on to tree li@@ mb@@ s , pri@@ son@@ ers learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ants , bar@@ ber sh@@ op@@ s , perso@@ nal tra@@ ining bu@@ sin@@ es@@ ses ."
"But there &apos;s no tra@@ ining , nothing to pre@@ p@@ are them for that , no re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation at all in pri@@ son , no one to help them writ@@ e a bu@@ siness pla@@ n , figure out a way to trans@@ late the bu@@ siness con@@ cep@@ ts they in@@ tu@@ iti@@ vely gra@@ s@@ p into le@@ g@@ al ent@@ er@@ pri@@ ses , no ac@@ c@@ ess to the Internet , even ."
"And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a la@@ w pro@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers from di@@ scri@@ mi@@ nat@@ ing against people with a ba@@ ck@@ ground ."
So n@@ one of us should be surpri@@ sed that two out of three ex@@ -@@ off@@ en@@ ders re@@ -@@ off@@ end within five years .
"@@ Lo@@ ok , I li@@ ed to the F@@ e@@ ds . I lost a year of my life from it ."
"But when I came out , I v@@ o@@ wed that I was going to do w@@ hat@@ ever I could to make sure that gu@@ ys like the ones I was lo@@ cked up with didn &apos;t have to wa@@ st@@ e any more of their life than they already had ."
So I ho@@ pe that you &apos;ll think about hel@@ ping in some way .
"The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nu@@ r@@ ture the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ u@@ ri@@ al spi@@ rit and the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous un@@ tap@@ ped potenti@@ al in our pri@@ s@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skil@@ ls that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back ."
A@@ ll they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hu@@ st@@ les .
Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important fac@@ tor for success .
"And it was found cl@@ ose to here , S@@ tan@@ for@@ d ."
"And he would tell the child , a f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ old ki@@ d , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ h@@ n@@ ny , I am going to leave you here with a mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low for 15 minutes ."
"If , after I come back , this mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; T@@ o tell a f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ old ki@@ d to wait 15 minutes for something that they like , is equi@@ val@@ ent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you co@@ ff@@ e@@ e in two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) E@@ x@@ act equi@@ val@@ ent ."
So what happened when the prof@@ ess@@ or left the room ?
A@@ s so@@ on as the door cl@@ osed ...
two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low .
"F@@ i@@ ve secon@@ ds , 10 secon@@ ds , 40 secon@@ ds , 50 secon@@ ds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes ."
S@@ ome la@@ sted 1@@ 4@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ half minutes .
( Laughter ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t do it . C@@ ould not wait .
What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low and go like this ...
W@@ ould look at it .
P@@ ut it back .
They would wal@@ k around . They would pla@@ y with their s@@ ki@@ r@@ ts and p@@ ants .
"That child already , at four , underst@@ ood the most important princi@@ ple for success , which is the ab@@ il@@ ity to de@@ la@@ y gra@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation ."
"@@ 15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follo@@ w@@ -@@ up study ."
What did they find ?
They went to look for these kids who were now 1@@ 8 and 1@@ 9 .
They were happy . They had their plan@@ s .
"They had good relation@@ shi@@ ps with the teachers , students ."
They were doing f@@ ine .
"A great perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of the kids that ate the mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low , they were in tr@@ ou@@ ble ."
They did not make it to univer@@ sity .
They had bad gra@@ des . S@@ ome of them drop@@ ped out .
And let me show you what happened .
"H@@ i@@ sp@@ an@@ ic kids , two out of three ate the mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low ; one out of three did not ."
This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low .
But she ate it .
"( Laughter ) She should not go into ban@@ king , for example , or work at a c@@ as@@ h regi@@ ster ."
But she will be successful .
And this app@@ lies for everything . E@@ ven in s@@ al@@ es .
"If the s@@ al@@ es person says , &quot; &quot; W@@ ai@@ t a second ."
I end with — the K@@ ore@@ ans did this .
You know what ? This is so good that we want a mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ low book for children .
We did one for children . And now it is all over K@@ ore@@ a .
They are teach@@ ing these kids exactly this princi@@ ple .
"And we need to learn that princi@@ ple here in the States , because we have a big de@@ b@@ t ."
We are e@@ ating more mar@@ sh@@ ma@@ l@@ lo@@ ws than we are produc@@ ing .
Thank you so much .
"And I think , j@@ ee@@ z , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !@@ "
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smar@@ t enough .
And there &apos;s no ma@@ gi@@ c to cre@@ ati@@ vity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
"M@@ ight fai@@ l , ki@@ d . D@@ on &apos;t make a lot of money at that , ki@@ d ."
"M@@ ar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing did not say , &quot; I have a ni@@ ght@@ mare , &quot; when he in@@ spi@@ red the civi@@ l ri@@ ghts mov@@ ements ."
"He said , &quot; &quot; I have a dre@@ am . &quot; &quot; And I have a dre@@ am ."
"I have a dre@@ am that we can stop thinking that the future will be a ni@@ ght@@ mare , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every maj@@ or blo@@ ck@@ bu@@ st@@ ing fil@@ m of rec@@ ent times , ne@@ ar@@ ly all of its vi@@ sions for human@@ ity are ap@@ o@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic ."
"I think this fil@@ m is one of the har@@ de@@ st wat@@ ches of modern times , &quot; &quot; The R@@ o@@ ad . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is de@@ so@@ late , everything is de@@ ad ."
"And just a father and son trying to survi@@ ve , walking along the ro@@ ad ."
And I think the environ@@ mental movement of which I am a part of has been comp@@ lic@@ it in cre@@ ating this vision of the future .
"For too long , we have pe@@ dd@@ led a ni@@ ght@@ ma@@ ri@@ sh vision of what &apos;s going to happen ."
We have focu@@ sed on the wor@@ st@@ -@@ case sc@@ ena@@ ri@@ o .
We have focu@@ sed on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the sol@@ u@@ tions .
"We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to gra@@ b people &apos;s att@@ ention ."
And any psycho@@ logi@@ st will tell you that fear in the organ@@ ism is lin@@ ked to f@@ light mechan@@ ism .
"It &apos;s part of the fi@@ ght and f@@ light mechan@@ ism , that when an an@@ ima@@ l is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed — think of a de@@ er ."
"A de@@ er fre@@ e@@ z@@ es very , very still , po@@ ised to ru@@ n away ."
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to eng@@ age with our ag@@ en@@ da around environ@@ mental de@@ gra@@ dation and cli@@ mate change .
P@@ eople are fre@@ e@@ zing and run@@ ning away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environ@@ mental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be im@@ pro@@ ving the human lot ?
"And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cor@@ ner@@ ed the market in terms of progress is a fin@@ an@@ cial defin@@ ition of what progress is , an economic defin@@ ition of what progress is — that some@@ how , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the st@@ o@@ ck market , whether that &apos;s with G@@ D@@ P and economic growth , that some@@ how life is going to get better ."
This is some@@ how ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to human gre@@ ed instead of fear — that more is better .
"C@@ ome on . In the W@@ est@@ ern world , we have enough ."
"@@ Maybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough ."
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the wel@@ f@@ are of na@@ tions .
"In fact , the ar@@ chit@@ ect of our national ac@@ count@@ ing system , S@@ im@@ on K@@ u@@ z@@ n@@ ets , in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , said that , &quot; &quot; A nation &apos;s wel@@ f@@ are can sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely be in@@ fer@@ red from their national income . &quot; &quot; But we &apos;ve created a national ac@@ count@@ ing system which is fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly based on produc@@ tion and produc@@ ing stuff ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , this is probably hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal , and it had its time ."
"In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff ."
"And in@@ de@@ ed , we were so successful at produc@@ ing certain ty@@ p@@ es of stuff that we dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed a lot of Eu@@ ro@@ pe , and we had to re@@ build it af@@ ter@@ wards ."
And so our national ac@@ count@@ ing system became fi@@ x@@ ated on what we can produce .
"But as early as 19@@ 6@@ 8 , this vi@@ si@@ ona@@ ry man , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy , at the start of his il@@ l-@@ f@@ ated pre@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al cam@@ pai@@ g@@ n , gave the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent d@@ econ@@ struc@@ tion of g@@ ross national produc@@ t that ever has been ."
"And he fin@@ i@@ shed his talk with the ph@@ ra@@ se , that , &quot; &quot; The g@@ ross national produc@@ t measu@@ res everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while . &quot; &quot; How cra@@ z@@ y is that ? That our measure of progress , our dom@@ in@@ ant measure of progress in society , is measu@@ ring everything ex@@ cept that which makes life wor@@ th@@ while ?"
"I believe , if K@@ en@@ ne@@ dy was ali@@ ve today , he would be asking sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while ."
"He &apos;d be asking us to re@@ desig@@ n our national ac@@ count@@ ing system to be based up@@ on such important things as social ju@@ stice , su@@ sta@@ i@@ na@@ bility and people &apos;s well-being ."
"And actually , social scienti@@ sts have already gone out and asked these questions around the world ."
This is from a global sur@@ v@@ ey .
"It &apos;s asking people , what do they want ."
"And un@@ surpri@@ sing@@ ly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their families , their children , their commun@@ ities ."
"O@@ kay , they think money is sli@@ ghtly important ."
"It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not ne@@ ar@@ ly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not ne@@ ar@@ ly as important as love ."
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not ne@@ ar@@ ly as important as health .
We want to be heal@@ thy and live a fu@@ ll life .
These seem to be natural human as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
Why are sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans not measu@@ ring these ?
"Wh@@ y are we not thinking of the progress of na@@ tions in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?"
"And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my a@@ du@@ l@@ t life — is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environ@@ mental limit@@ s ."
"And we created , at the organiz@@ ation that I work for , the New E@@ con@@ omi@@ cs F@@ oun@@ dation , something we call the H@@ app@@ y P@@ lan@@ et In@@ de@@ x , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy ."
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that sho@@ ws that ?
"And what we do , is we say that the ul@@ ti@@ mate out@@ come of a nation is how successful is it at cre@@ ating happy and heal@@ thy lives for its c@@ iti@@ z@@ ens ."
That should be the go@@ al of every nation on the planet .
"But we have to remem@@ ber that there &apos;s a fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal in@@ put to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resour@@ ces we use ."
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
"It is the ul@@ ti@@ mate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce , the one planet that we share ."
And economi@@ cs is very interest@@ ed in sc@@ ar@@ city .
"When it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce that it want@@ s to turn into a de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble out@@ come , it thin@@ ks in terms of e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ enc@@ y ."
It thin@@ ks in terms of how much b@@ ang do we get for our bu@@ ck .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our plan@@ e@@ ta@@ ry resour@@ ce use .
It is an e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ enc@@ y measure .
"And probably the ea@@ si@@ est way to show you that , is to show you this graph ."
"R@@ un@@ ning h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resour@@ ces we use and how much pres@@ sure we put on the planet ."
M@@ ore is bad .
"R@@ un@@ ning ver@@ ti@@ cally up@@ wards , is a measure called &quot; &quot; happy life years . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the well-being of na@@ tions ."
It &apos;s like a happiness ad@@ ju@@ sted li@@ fe@@ -@@ exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y .
It &apos;s like qu@@ ality and qu@@ ant@@ ity of life in na@@ tions .
"And the y@@ el@@ low d@@ ot there you see , is the global average ."
"Now , there &apos;s a hu@@ ge ar@@ ra@@ y of na@@ tions around that global average ."
"T@@ o the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reas@@ ona@@ bly well and produc@@ ing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there ."
"They are the U.S@@ .@@ A@@ . , other W@@ est@@ ern countries going across in those tri@@ ang@@ les and a few G@@ ul@@ f states in there actually ."
"C@@ on@@ ver@@ sel@@ y , at the bot@@ tom left of the graph , are countries that are not produc@@ ing much well-being — ty@@ pic@@ ally , sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ ha@@ ran A@@ fri@@ c@@ a ."
"In H@@ ob@@ be@@ si@@ an terms , life is sh@@ ort and b@@ ru@@ ti@@ sh there ."
The average life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y in many of these countries is only 40 years .
"@@ Ma@@ la@@ ri@@ a , H@@ I@@ V / A@@ I@@ D@@ S are k@@ il@@ ling a lot of people in these regi@@ ons of the world ."
But now for the good news !
"There are some countries up there , y@@ el@@ low tri@@ ang@@ les , that are doing better than global average , that are he@@ ad@@ ing up to@@ wards the top left of the graph ."
This is an as@@ pi@@ ra@@ ti@@ onal graph .
"We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the ear@@ th ."
They &apos;re L@@ ati@@ n American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I ha@@ ven &apos;t been to .
Maybe some of you have .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ i@@ c@@ a .
C@@ os@@ ta R@@ i@@ c@@ a — average life exp@@ ec@@ tan@@ c@@ y is 7@@ 8@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ half years .
That is longer than in the U@@ S@@ A .
"They are , ac@@ cor@@ ding to the la@@ test G@@ al@@ l@@ up world pol@@ l , the happ@@ i@@ est nation on the planet — than any@@ body ; more than S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k ."
They are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
They are doing that on a quar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces that are used ty@@ pic@@ ally in &#91; the &#93; W@@ est@@ ern world — a quar@@ ter of the resour@@ ces .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in C@@ os@@ ta R@@ i@@ c@@ a ?
We can look at some of the data .
9@@ 9 percent of their electri@@ city comes from r@@ ene@@ w@@ able resour@@ ces .
The@@ ir government is one of the first to com@@ mit to be car@@ bon ne@@ ut@@ ral by 20@@ 2@@ 1 .
They ab@@ o@@ li@@ shed the ar@@ my in 19@@ 4@@ 9 — 19@@ 4@@ 9 .
And they inv@@ est@@ ed in social pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s — health and education .
They have one of the high@@ est liter@@ ac@@ y rat@@ es in L@@ ati@@ n America and in the world .
"And they have that L@@ ati@@ n vi@@ be , don &apos;t they ."
They have the social connec@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
"( Laughter ) The challenge is , that possi@@ bly — and the thing we might have to think about — is that the future might not be Nor@@ th American , might not be W@@ est@@ ern Eu@@ rop@@ e@@ an ."
It might be L@@ ati@@ n American .
"And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here ."
That &apos;s what we need to do .
"And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pull countries from the bot@@ tom , and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph ."
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
A@@ no@@ ther way of looking at it is looking at time tr@@ ends .
"We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the rich@@ est countries , the O@@ E@@ C@@ D group , we do ."
"And this is the tr@@ end in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the tr@@ end in ec@@ o@@ logical fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int ."
"And so in stri@@ ct happ@@ y-@@ planet me@@ tho@@ do@@ logy , we &apos;ve become less e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent at tur@@ ning our ul@@ ti@@ mate sc@@ ar@@ ce resour@@ ce into the out@@ come we want to ."
"And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an ap@@ o@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic something happening ."
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human li@@ fe@@ time away .
A child ent@@ ering school today will be my age in 20@@ 50 .
This is not the very dist@@ ant future .
This is what the U.@@ K@@ . government tar@@ get on car@@ bon and gre@@ en@@ h@@ ouse e@@ mis@@ sions looks like .
"And I put it to you , that is not bu@@ siness as u@@ su@@ al ."
That is chang@@ ing our bu@@ siness .
"That is chang@@ ing the way we create our organiz@@ ations , we do our government po@@ lic@@ y and we live our lives ."
"And the point is , we need to car@@ ry on increas@@ ing well-being ."
No one can go to the pol@@ ls and say that qu@@ ality of life is going to re@@ duce .
"@@ N@@ one of us , I think , want human progress to stop ."
I think we want it to car@@ ry on .
I think we want the lot of human@@ ity to keep on increas@@ ing .
And I think this is where cli@@ mate change sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cs and d@@ eni@@ ers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want qu@@ ality of life to keep increas@@ ing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
"And if we &apos;re going to eng@@ age them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do ."
And that means we have to really increase e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ enc@@ y even more .
"Now that &apos;s all very easy to d@@ ra@@ w gra@@ ph@@ s and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those cur@@ ves ."
"And this is where I think we can take a lea@@ f out of systems theory , systems engine@@ ers , where they create fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s , put the right information at the right point of time ."
"H@@ u@@ man beings are very moti@@ v@@ ated by the &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; You put a smar@@ t met@@ er in your home , and you see how much electri@@ city you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s cos@@ ting you , your kids go around and turn the li@@ ghts off pretty quickly ."
What would that look like for society ?
"Wh@@ y is it , on the radi@@ o news every even@@ ing , I hear the F@@ T@@ S@@ E 100 , the D@@ ow J@@ ones , the dol@@ lar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o — I don &apos;t even know which way the dol@@ lar p@@ ound ra@@ ti@@ o should go to be good news ."
And why do I hear that ?
"Wh@@ y don &apos;t I hear how much energy B@@ rit@@ ain used y@@ est@@ er@@ day , or American used y@@ est@@ er@@ day ?"
D@@ id we me@@ et our three percent an@@ nu@@ al tar@@ get on re@@ duc@@ ing car@@ bon e@@ mis@@ sions ?
That &apos;s how you create a col@@ lec@@ tive go@@ al .
You put it out there into the medi@@ a and start thinking about it .
"And we need positive fe@@ ed@@ back lo@@ op@@ s for increas@@ ing well-being A@@ t a government level , they might create national ac@@ count@@ s of well-being ."
"A@@ t a bu@@ siness level , you might look at the well-being of your emp@@ lo@@ y@@ e@@ es , which we know is really lin@@ ked to cre@@ ati@@ vity , which is lin@@ ked to in@@ nov@@ ation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of in@@ nov@@ ation to de@@ al with those environ@@ mental is@@ sue@@ s ."
"A@@ t a perso@@ nal level , we need these nu@@ d@@ ges too ."
"@@ Maybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need re@@ min@@ ders ."
"In the U.@@ K@@ . , we have a strong publi@@ c health message on five f@@ ru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ ta@@ b@@ les a day and how much ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se we should do — never my best thing ."
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happ@@ i@@ er ?
"We did a project for the Go@@ ver@@ nment O@@ ffi@@ ce of S@@ ci@@ ence a couple of years ago , a big pro@@ gra@@ m called the F@@ ore@@ sight pro@@ gra@@ m — lots and lots of people — inv@@ ol@@ ved lots of exper@@ ts — everything evidence based — a hu@@ ge t@@ ome ."
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive ac@@ tions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?
"And the point of these is they are , not quite , the secre@@ ts of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from ."
"And the first of these is to con@@ n@@ ect , is that your social relation@@ shi@@ ps are the most important cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of your life ."
"@@ Do you inv@@ est the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?"
K@@ e@@ ep building them .
The second one is be ac@@ tive .
"The fa@@ ste@@ st way out of a bad mo@@ od : step outside , go for a wal@@ k , turn the radi@@ o on and dan@@ ce ."
B@@ e@@ ing ac@@ tive is great for our positive mo@@ od .
The thir@@ d one is take noti@@ ce .
"@@ How a@@ ware are you of things going on around the world , the se@@ as@@ ons chang@@ ing , people around you ?"
Do you noti@@ ce what &apos;s bub@@ b@@ ling up for you and trying to emer@@ ge ?
"B@@ as@@ ed on a lot of evidence for min@@ d@@ fu@@ l@@ ness , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ o@@ ral ther@@ ap@@ y , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being ."
The f@@ our@@ th is keep learning and keep is important — learning throu@@ gh@@ out the whole life course .
"O@@ l@@ der people who keep learning and are cu@@ ri@@ ous , they have much better health out@@ comes than those who start to cl@@ ose down ."
But it doesn &apos;t have to be forma@@ l learning ; it &apos;s not kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge based .
It &apos;s more cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
"It can be learning to co@@ ok a new di@@ sh , pic@@ king up an in@@ stru@@ ment you for@@ got as a child ."
K@@ e@@ ep learning .
"And the fi@@ nal one is that most anti@@ -@@ economic of acti@@ v@@ ities , but give ."
"O@@ ur gener@@ os@@ ity , our al@@ tru@@ ism , our compassion , are all har@@ d@@ wi@@ red to the re@@ ward mechan@@ ism in our brain ."
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
You tell one of them to sp@@ end it on themselves and one on other people .
"You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much happ@@ i@@ er that those that spent it on themselves ."
"And these five ways , which we put on@@ to these han@@ dy pos@@ t@@ car@@ ds , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the ear@@ th ."
They don &apos;t have any car@@ bon con@@ t@@ ent .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material go@@ o@@ ds to be sa@@ tis@@ fied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite f@@ ea@@ sible that happiness does not cost the ear@@ th .
"Now , Mar@@ tin L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing , on the e@@ ve of his death , gave an incredible spe@@ ec@@ h ."

A few months ago the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in physics was a@@ war@@ ded to two te@@ am@@ s of astron@@ om@@ ers for a disco@@ very that has been ha@@ il@@ ed as one of the most important astron@@ omi@@ cal observ@@ ations ever .
"And today , after bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly descri@@ b@@ ing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al f@@ ram@@ e@@ work for expla@@ ining their disco@@ very , nam@@ ely the possi@@ bility that way be@@ yon@@ d the Earth , the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay and other dist@@ ant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a v@@ a@@ st comp@@ le@@ x of universes that we call the multi@@ verse ."
Now the idea of a multi@@ verse is a strange one .
"I mean , most of us were ra@@ ised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything ."
"And I say most of us with fore@@ thought , as my f@@ our@@ -@@ year-@@ old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born ."
"And last year I was h@@ ol@@ ding her and I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ o@@ phi@@ a , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot; &quot; And she turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad@@ dy , universe or multi@@ verse ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But bar@@ ring such an an@@ o@@ ma@@ l@@ ous up@@ bri@@ ng@@ ing , it is strange to imagine other re@@ al@@ ms se@@ pa@@ rate from ours , most with fund@@ am@@ en@@ tally different fe@@ atures , that would ri@@ ghtly be called universes of their own ."
"And yet , sp@@ ecu@@ la@@ tive though the idea su@@ rely is , I aim to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seri@@ ously , as it just might be right ."
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multi@@ verse in three parts .
"In part one , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be those No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e-@@ win@@ ning results and to high@@ light a pro@@ found my@@ st@@ ery which those results re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed ."
"In part two , I &apos;ll off@@ er a sol@@ ution to that my@@ st@@ ery ."
"It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multi@@ verse will come into the story ."
"F@@ i@@ nally , in part three , I &apos;m going to descri@@ be a cosmo@@ logical theory called inf@@ lation , which will pull all the piec@@ es of the story together ."
"O@@ kay , part one star@@ ts back in 19@@ 2@@ 9 when the great astron@@ om@@ er E@@ d@@ win H@@ u@@ b@@ ble realiz@@ ed that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all ru@@ shing away from us , es@@ ta@@ bli@@ shing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ching , it &apos;s expan@@ ding ."
Now this was re@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary .
The pre@@ v@@ ai@@ ling wi@@ s@@ dom was that on the lar@@ gest of scal@@ es the universe was sta@@ tic .
"But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expan@@ sion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down ."
"That , much as the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pull of the Earth s@@ lo@@ ws the as@@ c@@ ent of an ap@@ ple t@@ os@@ sed up@@ ward , the gra@@ v@@ it@@ ati@@ onal pull of each galaxy on every other must be s@@ lo@@ wing the expan@@ sion of space ."
Now let &apos;s fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward to the 19@@ 9@@ 0s when those two te@@ am@@ s of astron@@ om@@ ers I men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed at the out@@ set were in@@ spi@@ red by this reas@@ oning to measure the rate at which the expan@@ sion has been s@@ lo@@ wing .
"And they did this by pa@@ in@@ s@@ taking observ@@ ations of nu@@ m@@ er@@ ous dist@@ ant galaxies , allo@@ wing them to char@@ t how the expan@@ sion rate has changed over time ."
Here &apos;s the surpri@@ se : They found that the expan@@ sion is not s@@ lo@@ wing down .
"In@@ stead they found that it &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding up , going fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster ."
That &apos;s like t@@ os@@ sing an ap@@ ple up@@ ward and it goes up fa@@ ster and fa@@ ster .
"Now if you saw an ap@@ ple do that , you &apos;d want to know why ."
What &apos;s pu@@ shing on it ?
"S@@ i@@ mi@@ larly , the astron@@ om@@ ers &apos; results are su@@ rely well-@@ de@@ ser@@ ving of the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze , but they ra@@ ised an anal@@ og@@ ous question ."
What force is dri@@ ving all galaxies to ru@@ sh away from every other at an e@@ ver@@ -@@ quick@@ en@@ ing spe@@ ed ?
Well the most pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
"You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pul@@ ls ob@@ jects together ."
"But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his gener@@ al theory of relati@@ vity , gravity can also pu@@ sh things ap@@ art ."
"@@ How ? Well ac@@ cor@@ ding to Einstein &apos;s ma@@ th , if space is uni@@ for@@ m@@ ly fil@@ led with an in@@ vi@@ sible energy , sort of like a uni@@ form , in@@ vi@@ sible mi@@ st , then the gravity gener@@ ated by that mi@@ st would be re@@ pul@@ sive , re@@ pul@@ sive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observ@@ ations ."
"Because the re@@ pul@@ sive gravity of an in@@ vi@@ sible energy in space — we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it sm@@ ok@@ ey white here so you can see it — its re@@ pul@@ sive gravity would cause each galaxy to pu@@ sh against every other , dri@@ ving expan@@ sion to spe@@ ed up , not s@@ low down ."
And this ex@@ plan@@ ation re@@ pres@@ ents great progress .
But I pr@@ om@@ ised you a my@@ st@@ ery here in part one .
Here it is .
"When the astron@@ om@@ ers worked out how much of this dark energy must be in@@ fu@@ sing space to ac@@ cou@@ nt for the cos@@ mic spe@@ ed up , look at what they found ."
This number is small .
"E@@ x@@ pres@@ sed in the re@@ lev@@ ant un@@ it , it is spec@@ ta@@ cu@@ larly small ."
And the my@@ st@@ ery is to explain this p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar number .
"We want this number to emer@@ ge from the la@@ ws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that ."
"Now you might won@@ der , should you care ?"
"@@ Maybe expla@@ ining this number is just a te@@ chni@@ cal issue , a te@@ chni@@ cal de@@ tai@@ l of inter@@ est to exper@@ ts , but of no re@@ lev@@ ance to any@@ body else ."
"Well it su@@ rely is a te@@ chni@@ cal de@@ tai@@ l , but some de@@ tail@@ s really matter ."
"S@@ ome de@@ tail@@ s pro@@ vi@@ de win@@ do@@ ws into un@@ char@@ ted re@@ al@@ ms of reality , and this p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made he@@ ad@@ way to explain it inv@@ ok@@ es the possi@@ bility of other universes — an idea that natu@@ ra@@ lly emer@@ ges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory ."
So hold the my@@ st@@ ery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three k@@ ey things about string theory .
"F@@ irst off , what is it ?"
"Well it &apos;s an approach to realiz@@ e Einstein &apos;s dre@@ am of a uni@@ fied theory of physics , a single o@@ ver@@ ar@@ ching f@@ ram@@ e@@ work that would be able to descri@@ be all the for@@ ces at work in the universe ."
And the cent@@ ral idea of string theory is quite st@@ rai@@ ght@@ for@@ ward .
"It says that if you exam@@ ine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you &apos;ll find molecules and then you &apos;ll find atoms and su@@ bat@@ omi@@ c particles ."
"But the theory says that if you could pro@@ be sma@@ l@@ ler , much sma@@ l@@ ler than we can with exi@@ st@@ ing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vib@@ rating fil@@ am@@ ent of energy , a little tiny vib@@ rating string ."
"And just like the stri@@ ngs on a viol@@ in , they can vib@@ rate in different patt@@ er@@ ns produc@@ ing different mu@@ si@@ cal not@@ es ."
"@@ These little fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal stri@@ ngs , when they vib@@ rate in different patt@@ er@@ ns , they produce different kinds of particles — so electr@@ ons , quar@@ ks , ne@@ ut@@ r@@ in@@ os , phot@@ ons , all other particles would be un@@ ited into a single f@@ ram@@ e@@ work , as they would all ari@@ se from vib@@ rating stri@@ ngs ."
"It &apos;s a comp@@ el@@ ling picture , a kind of cos@@ mic sy@@ m@@ phon@@ y , where all the rich@@ ness that we see in the world around us emer@@ ges from the music that these little , tiny stri@@ ngs can pla@@ y ."
"But there &apos;s a cost to this el@@ e@@ g@@ ant uni@@ fic@@ ation , because years of research have sho@@ wn that the ma@@ th of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work ."
"It has inter@@ nal in@@ con@@ sist@@ en@@ ci@@ es , un@@ less we al@@ low for something wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar — extra dimensions of space ."
"That is , we all know about the u@@ su@@ al three dimensions of space ."
"And you can think about those as he@@ ight , wi@@ d@@ th and de@@ p@@ th ."
"But string theory says that , on f@@ anta@@ sti@@ cally small scal@@ es , there are ad@@ diti@@ onal dimensions c@@ ru@@ m@@ pl@@ ed to a tiny size so small that we have not det@@ ected them ."
"But even though the dimensions are hi@@ d@@ den , they would have an im@@ pa@@ ct on things that we can ob@@ serve because the shape of the extra dimensions con@@ st@@ ra@@ ins how the stri@@ ngs can vib@@ rate ."
"And in string theory , vi@@ bra@@ tion det@@ er@@ min@@ es everything ."
"So partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the stre@@ ng@@ ths of for@@ ces , and most import@@ antly , the amount of dark energy would be det@@ er@@ min@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions ."
"So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late these fe@@ atures , cal@@ cu@@ late the amount of dark energy ."
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
A@@ ll we have is a li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate sha@@ p@@ es allowed by the ma@@ th .
"Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different can@@ di@@ d@@ ate sha@@ p@@ es , so you can imagine anal@@ y@@ zing them on@@ e-@@ b@@ y-@@ one to det@@ er@@ m@@ ine if any yi@@ el@@ d the physical fe@@ atures we ob@@ serve ."
But over time the li@@ st gre@@ w as resear@@ chers found other can@@ di@@ d@@ ate sha@@ p@@ es .
"F@@ rom five , the number gre@@ w into the hund@@ re@@ ds and then the thousands — A large , but still man@@ ag@@ e@@ able , col@@ lec@@ tion to anal@@ y@@ ze , since after all , gra@@ du@@ ate students need something to do ."
"But then the li@@ st contin@@ ue@@ d to grow into the mil@@ lions and the bil@@ lions , until today ."
The li@@ st of can@@ di@@ d@@ ate sha@@ p@@ es has so@@ a@@ red to about 10 to the 5@@ 00 .
"So , what to do ?"
"Well some resear@@ chers lost heart , con@@ clu@@ ding that was so many can@@ di@@ d@@ ate sha@@ p@@ es for the extra dimensions , each giving ri@@ se to different physical fe@@ atures , string theory would never make defin@@ itive , t@@ es@@ table predic@@ tions ."
"But others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possi@@ bility of a multi@@ verse ."
Here &apos;s the idea .
Maybe each of these sha@@ p@@ es is on an equal fo@@ ot@@ ing with every other .
"E@@ ach is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions ."
And this radi@@ cal prop@@ os@@ al has a pro@@ found im@@ pa@@ ct on this my@@ st@@ ery : the amount of dark energy re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the No@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ z@@ e-@@ win@@ ning results .
"Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical fe@@ atures of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different ."
W@@ hi@@ ch means that the my@@ st@@ ery of expla@@ ining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measu@@ red would take on a wh@@ ol@@ ly different charac@@ ter .
"In this con@@ t@@ ex@@ t , the la@@ ws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers ."
W@@ hi@@ ch means we have been asking the wrong question .
"It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red instead of any of the other possi@@ bil@@ ities that are out there ?"
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make he@@ ad@@ way .
"Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , wh@@ en@@ ever matter tri@@ es to clu@@ m@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive pu@@ sh of the dark energy is so strong that it blo@@ ws the clu@@ m@@ p ap@@ art and galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they col@@ lap@@ se back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form ."
"And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chan@@ ce for our form of life to exi@@ st in those other universes ."
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red simply because our universe has conditions h@@ os@@ pit@@ able to our form of life .
And that would be that .
"M@@ y@@ st@@ ery sol@@ ved , multi@@ verse found ."
Now some find this ex@@ plan@@ ation un@@ sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us defin@@ itive ex@@ plan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ serve .
"But the point is , if the fe@@ ature you &apos;re ob@@ ser@@ ving can and does take on a wi@@ de vari@@ ety of different val@@ ues across the wi@@ der lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape of reality , then thinking one ex@@ plan@@ ation for a particular val@@ ue is simply mis@@ gu@@ i@@ ded ."
A@@ n early example comes from the great astron@@ om@@ er Jo@@ han@@ n@@ es K@@ ep@@ ler who was ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with understanding a different number — why the Sun is 9@@ 3 million mi@@ les away from the Earth .
"And he worked for dec@@ ad@@ es trying to explain this number , but he never succ@@ ee@@ ded , and we know why ."
K@@ ep@@ ler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wi@@ de vari@@ ety of different di@@ stan@@ ces from their h@@ ost stars .
"So h@@ op@@ ing that the la@@ ws of physics will explain one particular number , 9@@ 3 million mi@@ les , well that is simply w@@ rong@@ he@@ ad@@ ed ."
"In@@ stead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular di@@ stance , instead of any of the other possi@@ bil@@ ities ?"
"And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer ."
Th@@ ose planets which are much cl@@ os@@ er to a star like the Sun would be so h@@ ot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exi@@ st .
"And those planets that are much far@@ ther away from the star , well they &apos;re so co@@ ld that , again , our form of life would not take hold ."
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular di@@ stance simply because it yi@@ el@@ ds conditions v@@ ital to our form of life .
"And when it comes to planets and their di@@ stan@@ ces , this c@@ lear@@ ly is the right kind of reas@@ oning ."
"The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they con@@ tain , it may also be the right kind of reas@@ oning ."
"One k@@ ey difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only sp@@ ecu@@ lated on the possi@@ bility that there might be other universes ."
"So to pull it all together , we need a mechan@@ ism that can actually gener@@ ate other universes ."
"And that takes me to my fi@@ nal part , part three ."
Because such a mechan@@ ism has been found by cosmo@@ logi@@ sts trying to understand the Big Bang .
"You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we of@@ ten have an ima@@ ge of a kind of cos@@ mic ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on that created our universe and set space ru@@ shing out@@ ward ."
But there &apos;s a little secre@@ t .
"The Big Bang lea@@ ves out something pretty important , the Bang ."
"It tells us how the universe evol@@ ved after the Bang , but gi@@ ves us no in@@ sight into what would have power@@ ed the Bang itself ."
And this ga@@ p was finally fil@@ led by an en@@ han@@ ced ver@@ sion of the Big Bang theory .
"It &apos;s called inf@@ la@@ tionary cosmo@@ logy , which i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied a particular kind of f@@ ue@@ l that would natu@@ ra@@ lly gener@@ ate an out@@ ward ru@@ sh of space ."
"The f@@ ue@@ l is based on something called a quantum field , but the only de@@ tai@@ l that mat@@ ters for us is that this f@@ ue@@ l pro@@ ves to be so e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent that it &apos;s vi@@ r@@ tually im@@ possible to use it all up , which means in the inf@@ la@@ tionary theory , the Big Bang giving ri@@ se to our universe is lik@@ ely not a on@@ e-@@ time ev@@ ent ."
"In@@ stead the f@@ ue@@ l not only gener@@ ated our Big Bang , but it would also gener@@ ate count@@ less other Big B@@ ang@@ s , each giving ri@@ se to its own se@@ pa@@ rate universe with our universe becom@@ ing but one bubble in a gr@@ and cos@@ mic bubble b@@ ath of universes ."
"And now , when we m@@ el@@ d this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to ."
E@@ ach of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wi@@ de vari@@ ety of different sha@@ p@@ es .
The different sha@@ p@@ es yi@@ el@@ d different physical fe@@ atures .
"And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical fe@@ atures , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold ."
And this is the comp@@ el@@ ling but high@@ ly contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al picture of the wi@@ der cosmo@@ s that c@@ ut@@ ti@@ ng@@ -@@ ed@@ ge observ@@ ation and theory have now led us to seri@@ ously con@@ sider .
"One big re@@ ma@@ ining question , of course , is , could we ever con@@ fi@@ r@@ m the exi@@ st@@ ence of other universes ?"
Well let me descri@@ be one way that might one day happen .
The inf@@ la@@ tionary theory already has strong observ@@ ati@@ onal supp@@ ort .
"Because the theory predic@@ ts that the Big Bang would have been so int@@ en@@ se that as space rap@@ i@@ dly expan@@ ded , tiny quantum j@@ itt@@ ers from the mi@@ c@@ ro world would have been stre@@ t@@ ched out to the ma@@ c@@ ro world , yi@@ el@@ ding a dist@@ in@@ c@@ tive fi@@ ng@@ er@@ pr@@ int , a patt@@ ern of sli@@ ghtly h@@ ot@@ ter sp@@ ots and sli@@ ghtly col@@ der sp@@ ots , across space , which power@@ ful tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have now ob@@ ser@@ ved ."
"@@ Go@@ ing fu@@ r@@ ther , if there are other universes , the theory predic@@ ts that every so of@@ ten those universes can col@@ li@@ de ."
"And if our universe got h@@ it by another , that col@@ li@@ sion would gener@@ ate an ad@@ diti@@ onal su@@ bt@@ le patt@@ ern of tem@@ per@@ ature vari@@ ations across space that we might one day be able to det@@ ect ."
"And so ex@@ oti@@ c as this picture is , it may one day be grou@@ n@@ ded in observ@@ ations , es@@ ta@@ bli@@ shing the exi@@ st@@ ence of other universes ."
I &apos;ll con@@ clu@@ de with a stri@@ king im@@ plic@@ ation of all these ideas for the very far future .
"You see , we learned that our universe is not sta@@ tic , that space is expan@@ ding , that that expan@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up and that there might be other universes all by care@@ fully exam@@ ining fa@@ int p@@ in@@ point@@ s of star@@ light coming to us from dist@@ ant galaxies ."
"But because the expan@@ sion is spe@@ e@@ ding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will ru@@ sh away so far and so fa@@ st that we won &apos;t be able to see them — not because of techno@@ logical limit@@ ations , but because of the la@@ ws of physics ."
"The light those galaxies e@@ mit , even tra@@ vel@@ ing at the fa@@ ste@@ st spe@@ ed , the spe@@ ed of light , will not be able to o@@ ver@@ come the e@@ ver@@ -@@ wi@@ d@@ en@@ ing gu@@ l@@ f between us ."
"So astron@@ om@@ ers in the far future looking out into de@@ ep space will see nothing but an en@@ d@@ less stre@@ t@@ ch of sta@@ tic , in@@ k@@ y , black sti@@ ll@@ ness ."
And they will con@@ clu@@ de that the universe is sta@@ tic and un@@ chang@@ ing and popu@@ lated by a single cent@@ ral o@@ as@@ is of matter that they in@@ ha@@ bit — a picture of the cosmo@@ s that we defin@@ iti@@ vely know to be wrong .
"Now maybe those future astron@@ om@@ ers will have rec@@ or@@ ds han@@ ded down from an ear@@ li@@ er era , like ours , att@@ est@@ ing to an expan@@ ding cosmo@@ s te@@ em@@ ing with galaxies ."
But would those future astron@@ om@@ ers believe such an@@ ci@@ ent kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge ?
"O@@ r would they believe in the black , sta@@ tic emp@@ ty universe that their own sta@@ te@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art observ@@ ations re@@ ve@@ al ?"
I su@@ sp@@ ect the lat@@ ter .
W@@ hi@@ ch means that we are li@@ ving through a re@@ mark@@ ab@@ ly pri@@ vi@@ le@@ g@@ ed era when certain de@@ ep tru@@ ths about the cosmo@@ s are still within reach of the human spi@@ rit of explo@@ ration .
It ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s that it may not always be that way .
"Because today &apos;s astron@@ om@@ ers , by tur@@ ning power@@ ful tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es to the sk@@ y , have cap@@ tured a han@@ d@@ ful of star@@ k@@ ly in@@ forma@@ tive phot@@ ons — a kind of cos@@ mic tel@@ e@@ gra@@ m bil@@ lions of years in trans@@ it ."
and the message e@@ cho@@ ing across the ag@@ es is clear .
S@@ om@@ e@@ times nature gu@@ ar@@ ds her secre@@ ts with the un@@ b@@ re@@ ak@@ able g@@ ri@@ p of physical la@@ w .
S@@ om@@ e@@ times the true nature of reality bec@@ k@@ ons from just be@@ yon@@ d the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on .
Thank you very much .
"( Applause ) Ch@@ ris A@@ n@@ der@@ son : B@@ rian , than@@ k you ."
"The range of ideas you &apos;ve just sp@@ ok@@ en about are di@@ z@@ z@@ ying , ex@@ hi@@ la@@ rating , incredible ."
"@@ How do you think of where cosmo@@ logy is now , in a sort of hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cal side ?"
A@@ re we in the middle of something un@@ u@@ su@@ al hi@@ st@@ ori@@ cally in your op@@ ini@@ on ?
B@@ G : Well it &apos;s hard to say .
"When we learn that astron@@ om@@ ers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain de@@ ep , c@@ riti@@ cal fe@@ atures of the universe already have es@@ cap@@ ed our ab@@ il@@ ity to understand because of how cosmo@@ logy evol@@ ves ."
"So from that per@@ spec@@ tive , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them ."
"O@@ n the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is ."
"We can understand how to understand the data from the mi@@ c@@ ro@@ wa@@ ve ba@@ ck@@ ground radi@@ ation that was set down 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago — and yet , we can do cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions today to predic@@ t how it will look and it mat@@ ches ."
H@@ o@@ ly c@@ ow ! That &apos;s just ama@@ zing .
"So on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve g@@ ot@@ ten , but who kno@@ ws what sort of blo@@ cks we may find in the future ."
C@@ A : You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions can contin@@ ue .
"@@ Thank you . Thank you , B@@ rian . ( B@@ G : M@@ y plea@@ sure . ) ( Applause )"
"In the year 19@@ 1@@ 9 , a vi@@ r@@ tually un@@ known G@@ er@@ man ma@@ the@@ mati@@ ci@@ an , nam@@ ed The@@ od@@ or K@@ alu@@ za su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted a very bo@@ ld and , in some ways , a very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea ."
"That is in ad@@ dition to left , right , back , for@@ th and up , down , K@@ alu@@ za prop@@ osed that there might be ad@@ diti@@ onal dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see ."
"Now , when someone makes a bo@@ ld and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re idea , some@@ times that &apos;s all it is — bo@@ ld and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re , but it has nothing to do with the world around us ."
"This particular idea , ho@@ w@@ ever — al@@ though we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end I &apos;ll dis@@ cu@@ ss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a maj@@ or im@@ pa@@ ct on physics in the last century and contin@@ ues to in@@ form a lot of c@@ ut@@ ti@@ ng@@ -@@ ed@@ ge research ."
"So , I &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions ."
So where do we go ?
"This is a year when Einstein is ba@@ s@@ king in the g@@ low of having disco@@ vered the speci@@ al theory of relati@@ vity and deci@@ des to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the gr@@ and , per@@ v@@ a@@ sive force of gravity ."
"And in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been re@@ sol@@ ved ."
"@@ Ne@@ w@@ ton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0s that works well , descri@@ b@@ es the moti@@ on of planets , the moti@@ on of the moon and so for@@ th , the moti@@ on of ap@@ oc@@ r@@ y@@ pha@@ l of ap@@ pl@@ es f@@ al@@ ling from tre@@ es , h@@ itt@@ ing people on the head ."
A@@ ll of that could be descri@@ bed using Ne@@ w@@ ton &apos;s work .
"But Einstein realiz@@ ed that Ne@@ w@@ ton had left something out of the story , because even Ne@@ w@@ ton had w@@ r@@ itt@@ en that al@@ though he underst@@ ood how to cal@@ cu@@ late the eff@@ ect of gravity , he &apos;d been u@@ na@@ ble to figure out how it really works ."
"@@ How is it that the Sun , 9@@ 3 million mi@@ les away , &#91; that &#93; some@@ how it aff@@ ec@@ ts the moti@@ on of the Earth ?"
How does the Sun reach out across emp@@ ty in@@ er@@ t space and ex@@ er@@ t in@@ flu@@ ence ?
And that is a ta@@ s@@ k to which Einstein set h@@ im@@ self — to figure out how gravity works .
And let me show you what it is that he found .
So Einstein found that the medi@@ um that tran@@ sm@@ its gravity is space itself .
The idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ st@@ rate of all there is .
"E@@ instein said space is ni@@ ce and f@@ la@@ t , if there &apos;s no matter present ."
"But if there is matter in the environment , such as the Sun , it cau@@ ses the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space to war@@ p , to cur@@ ve ."
And that comm@@ uni@@ cat@@ es the force of gravity .
E@@ ven the Earth war@@ ps space around it .
Now look at the M@@ o@@ on .
"The M@@ o@@ on is k@@ ep@@ t in or@@ bit , ac@@ cor@@ ding to these ideas , because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ ley in the cur@@ ved environment that the Sun and the M@@ o@@ on and the Earth can all create by vi@@ r@@ tue of their pres@@ ence ."
We go to a fu@@ l@@ l-@@ f@@ r@@ ame view of this .
The Earth itself is k@@ ep@@ t in or@@ bit because it ro@@ l@@ ls along a val@@ ley in the environment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the Sun &apos;s pres@@ ence .
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
"Now , this idea was te@@ sted in 19@@ 1@@ 9 through astron@@ omi@@ cal observ@@ ations ."
It really works . It descri@@ b@@ es the data .
And this ga@@ ined Einstein pr@@ om@@ in@@ ence around the world .
And that is what got K@@ alu@@ za thinking .
"He , like Einstein , was in sear@@ ch of what we call a uni@@ fied theory ."
"That &apos;s one theory that might be able to descri@@ be all of nature &apos;s for@@ ces from one set of ideas , one set of princi@@ pl@@ es , one ma@@ ster equ@@ ation , if you will ."
"So K@@ alu@@ za said to h@@ im@@ self , Einstein has been able to descri@@ be gravity in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in space — in fact , space and time , to be more preci@@ se ."
"You know , the force respon@@ sible for electri@@ city and magnetic att@@ rac@@ tion and so for@@ th ."
"So K@@ alu@@ za says , maybe I can pla@@ y the same game and descri@@ be elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force in terms of war@@ ps and cur@@ ves ."
That ra@@ ised a question : war@@ ps and cur@@ ves in what ?
"E@@ instein had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to descri@@ be gravity ."
There didn &apos;t seem to be anything else to war@@ p or cur@@ ve .
"So K@@ alu@@ za said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space ."
"He said , if I want to descri@@ be one more force , maybe I need one more dimen@@ sion ."
"And when he looked at that equ@@ ation , it was n@@ one other than the equ@@ ation that scienti@@ sts had long known to descri@@ be the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force ."
A@@ ma@@ zing — it just pop@@ ped out .
"He was so exc@@ ited by this realiz@@ ation that he ran around his h@@ ouse scre@@ am@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Vi@@ ct@@ ory ! &quot; &quot; — that he had found the uni@@ fied theory ."
"Now c@@ lear@@ ly , K@@ alu@@ za was a man who took theory very seri@@ ously ."
"He , in fact — there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to s@@ wi@@ m , he read a book , a tre@@ ati@@ se on s@@ w@@ im@@ ming — ( Laughter ) — then do@@ ve into the oc@@ e@@ an ."
This is a man who would ris@@ k his life on theory .
"Now , but for those of us who are a little bit more p@@ rac@@ ti@@ cally min@@ ded , two questions im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely ari@@ se from his observ@@ ation ."
"@@ N@@ u@@ mb@@ er one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?"
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
"And number two : does this theory really work in de@@ tai@@ l , when you try to app@@ ly it to the world around us ?"
"Now , the first question was ans@@ wer@@ ed in 19@@ 2@@ 6 by a f@@ el@@ low nam@@ ed O@@ s@@ ka@@ r K@@ le@@ in ."
"So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a c@@ able supp@@ or@@ ting a tra@@ ffi@@ c light ."
"It &apos;s in M@@ an@@ hat@@ tan . You &apos;re in C@@ ent@@ ral P@@ ar@@ k — it &apos;s kind of ir@@ re@@ lev@@ ant — but the c@@ able looks on@@ e-@@ dimen@@ sional from a dist@@ ant vie@@ w@@ point , but you and I all know that it does have some thi@@ ck@@ ness ."
"It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away ."
"But if we z@@ o@@ om in and take the per@@ spec@@ tive of , say , a little ant walking around — little ants are so small that they can ac@@ c@@ ess all of the dimensions — the long dimen@@ sion , but also this c@@ lo@@ ck@@ wi@@ se , count@@ er@@ -@@ c@@ lo@@ ck@@ wi@@ se direc@@ tion ."
And I ho@@ pe you ap@@ preci@@ ate this .
It took so long to get these ants to do this .
"( Laughter ) But this il@@ lu@@ st@@ rat@@ es the fact that dimensions can be of two sor@@ ts : big and small . And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can ea@@ si@@ ly see , but there might be ad@@ diti@@ onal dimensions cur@@ led up , sort of like the circu@@ lar part of that c@@ able , so small that they have so far re@@ ma@@ ined in@@ vi@@ sible ."
Let me show you what that would look like .
"S@@ ome of you gu@@ ys will fi@@ x that one day , but anything that &apos;s not f@@ la@@ t on a scre@@ en is a new dimen@@ sion , goes sma@@ l@@ ler , sma@@ l@@ ler , sma@@ l@@ ler , and way down in the mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic de@@ p@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have ad@@ diti@@ onal cur@@ led up dimensions — here is a little shape of a cir@@ cle — so small that we don &apos;t see them ."
"But if you were a little ul@@ tra mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic ant walking around , you could wal@@ k in the big dimensions that we all know about — that &apos;s like the g@@ ri@@ d part — but you could also ac@@ c@@ ess the tiny cur@@ le@@ d-@@ up dimen@@ sion that &apos;s so small that we can &apos;t see it with the nak@@ ed ey@@ e or even with any of our most re@@ fin@@ ed equi@@ pm@@ ent ."
"But de@@ ep@@ ly tu@@ cked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there ."
But what about the second question that I asked : does the theory actually work when you try to app@@ ly it to the real world ?
"Well , it turns out that Einstein and K@@ alu@@ za and many others worked on trying to re@@ f@@ ine this f@@ ram@@ e@@ work and app@@ ly it to the physics of the universe as was underst@@ ood at the time , and , in de@@ tai@@ l , it didn &apos;t work ."
"In de@@ tai@@ l , for in@@ stance , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t get the ma@@ ss of the electr@@ on to work out cor@@ rec@@ tly in this theory ."
"So many people worked on it , but by the &apos; 4@@ 0s , cer@@ tain@@ ly by the &apos; 5@@ 0s , this strange but very comp@@ el@@ ling idea of how to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics had gone away ."
U@@ n@@ ti@@ l something wonderful happened in our age .
"In our era , a new approach to uni@@ f@@ y the la@@ ws of physics is being pur@@ sue@@ d by physi@@ ci@@ sts such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called super@@ string theory , as you were in@@ dic@@ ating ."
"And the wonderful thing is that super@@ string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study super@@ string theory , we find that it re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ts the idea in a sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ling , new form ."
"So , let me just tell you how that goes ."
Su@@ per@@ string theory — what is it ?
"Well , it &apos;s a theory that tri@@ es to answer the question : what are the basic , fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal , indivi@@ sible , un@@ c@@ ut@@ table con@@ stit@@ u@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?"
The idea is like this .
"So , imagine we look at a fami@@ li@@ ar ob@@ ject , just a can@@ d@@ le in a h@@ older , and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of ."
So we go on a jour@@ ne@@ y de@@ ep inside the ob@@ ject and exam@@ ine the con@@ stit@@ u@@ ents .
"So de@@ ep inside — we all know , you go su@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ently far down , you have atoms ."
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story .
They have little electr@@ ons that s@@ war@@ m around a cent@@ ral nu@@ cle@@ us with ne@@ ut@@ r@@ ons and prot@@ ons .
E@@ ven the ne@@ ut@@ r@@ ons and prot@@ ons have sma@@ l@@ ler particles inside of them known as quar@@ ks .
That is where con@@ v@@ enti@@ onal ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
"D@@ e@@ ep inside any of these particles , there is something else ."
This something else is this dan@@ c@@ ing fil@@ am@@ ent of energy .
"It looks like a vib@@ rating string — that &apos;s where the idea , string theory comes from ."
"And just like the vib@@ rating stri@@ ngs that you just saw in a cel@@ l@@ o can vib@@ rate in different patt@@ er@@ ns , these can also vib@@ rate in different patt@@ er@@ ns ."
They don &apos;t produce different mu@@ si@@ cal not@@ es .
"R@@ a@@ ther , they produce the different particles making up the world around us ."
"So if these ideas are cor@@ rec@@ t , this is what the ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape of the universe looks like ."
"It &apos;s built up of a hu@@ ge number of these little tiny fil@@ am@@ ents of vib@@ rating energy , vib@@ rating in different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es ."
The different fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es produce the different particles .
The different particles are respon@@ sible for all the rich@@ ness in the world around us .
"And there you see uni@@ fic@@ ation , because matter particles , electr@@ ons and quar@@ ks , radi@@ ation particles , phot@@ ons , gra@@ v@@ it@@ ons , are all built up from one ent@@ ity ."
So matter and the for@@ ces of nature all are put together under the ru@@ bri@@ c of vib@@ rating stri@@ ngs .
And that &apos;s what we mean by a uni@@ fied theory .
Now here is the cat@@ ch .
"When you study the ma@@ the@@ mati@@ cs of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space ."
"It doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six ."
"F@@ i@@ nally , you can study the equ@@ ations , and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimen@@ sion of time ."
"It lea@@ ds us right back to this idea of K@@ alu@@ za and K@@ le@@ in — that our world , when app@@ rop@@ ri@@ at@@ ely descri@@ bed , has more dimensions than the ones that we see ."
"Now you might think about that and say , well , O@@ K , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really ti@@ ghtly cur@@ led up , y@@ eah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough ."
"But if there &apos;s a little tiny civi@@ li@@ zation of gre@@ en people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them ei@@ ther . That is true ."
"One of the other predic@@ tions of string theory — no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of string theory ."
"( Laughter ) But it ra@@ is@@ es the question : are we just trying to hi@@ de away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?"
"In the re@@ ma@@ ining time , I &apos;d like to tell you two fe@@ atures of them ."
"F@@ irst is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the de@@ e@@ pe@@ st question in the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal physics , the@@ ore@@ ti@@ cal science ."
"And that question is this : when we look around the world , as scienti@@ sts have done for the last hundred years , there app@@ ear to be about 20 numbers that really descri@@ be our universe ."
"@@ These are numbers like the ma@@ ss of the particles , like electr@@ ons and quar@@ ks , the stre@@ ng@@ th of gravity , the stre@@ ng@@ th of the elec@@ tro@@ magnetic force — a li@@ st of about 20 numbers that have been measu@@ red with incredible preci@@ sion , but no@@ body has an ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the numbers have the particular val@@ ues that they do ."
"Now , does string theory off@@ er an answer ?"
Not yet .
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the val@@ ues they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .
"And the wonderful thing is , if those numbers had any other val@@ ues than the known ones , the universe , as we know it , wouldn &apos;t exi@@ st ."
This is a de@@ ep question .
"Wh@@ y are those numbers so fin@@ ely tun@@ ed to al@@ low stars to sh@@ ine and planets to form , when we recogni@@ ze that if you fi@@ ddle with those numbers — if I had 20 di@@ als up here and I let you come up and fi@@ ddle with those numbers , almost any fi@@ dd@@ ling makes the universe di@@ sap@@ p@@ ear ."
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
And string theory su@@ g@@ ge@@ sts that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
Let me show you how .
"So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory , it &apos;s not one extra dimen@@ sion , as in the older ideas of K@@ alu@@ za and K@@ le@@ in ."
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
"They have a very rich , inter@@ t@@ w@@ ined ge@@ omet@@ ry ."
This is an example of something known as a C@@ a@@ la@@ bi@@ -@@ Y@@ a@@ u shape — na@@ me isn &apos;t all that important .
"But , as you can see , the extra dimensions fo@@ ld in on themselves and inter@@ t@@ w@@ ine in a very interesting shape , interesting struc@@ ture ."
"And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the mi@@ c@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tin@@ i@@ est of scal@@ es ."
"When you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it ."
"So what is the physical im@@ plic@@ ation , though , re@@ lev@@ ant to those 20 numbers ?"
"C@@ on@@ sider this . If you look at the in@@ stru@@ ment , a F@@ ren@@ ch h@@ or@@ n , noti@@ ce that the vi@@ bra@@ tions of the ai@@ r@@ stre@@ am@@ s are aff@@ ected by the shape of the in@@ stru@@ ment ."
"Now in string theory , all the numbers are re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tions of the way stri@@ ngs can vib@@ rate ."
"So just as those ai@@ r@@ stre@@ am@@ s are aff@@ ected by the twi@@ sts and turns in the in@@ stru@@ ment , stri@@ ngs themselves will be aff@@ ected by the vi@@ bra@@ ti@@ onal patt@@ er@@ ns in the ge@@ omet@@ ry within which they are moving ."
So let me bring some stri@@ ngs into the story .
"And if you watch these little f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws vib@@ rating around — they &apos;ll be there in a second — right there , noti@@ ce that they way they vib@@ rate is aff@@ ected by the ge@@ omet@@ ry of the extra dimensions ."
"So , if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like — we don &apos;t yet , but if we did — we should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late the allowed not@@ es , the allowed vi@@ bra@@ ti@@ onal patt@@ er@@ ns ."
"And if we could cal@@ cu@@ late the allowed vi@@ bra@@ ti@@ onal patt@@ er@@ ns , we should be able to cal@@ cu@@ late those 20 numbers ."
"And if the answer that we get from our cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions ag@@ re@@ es with the val@@ ues of those numbers that have been det@@ er@@ min@@ ed through de@@ tail@@ ed and preci@@ se experim@@ en@@ tation , this in many ways would be the first fund@@ am@@ en@@ tal ex@@ plan@@ ation for why the struc@@ ture of the universe is the way it is ."
"Now , the second issue that I want to fin@@ ish up with is : how might we test for these extra dimensions more direc@@ tly ?"
"It &apos;s a machine that will sen@@ d particles around a tun@@ ne@@ l , op@@ pos@@ ite direc@@ tions , ne@@ ar the spe@@ ed of light ."
"E@@ very so of@@ ten those particles will be ai@@ m@@ ed at each other , so there &apos;s a he@@ ad@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion ."
"The ho@@ pe is that if the col@@ li@@ sion has enough energy , it may e@@ ject some of the de@@ b@@ ris from the col@@ li@@ sion from our dimensions , for@@ c@@ ing it to en@@ ter into the other dimensions ."
How would we know it ?
"Well , we &apos;ll measure the amount of energy after the col@@ li@@ sion , comp@@ are it to the amount of energy before , and if there &apos;s less energy after the col@@ li@@ sion than before , this will be evidence that the energy has dri@@ f@@ ted away ."
"And if it dri@@ f@@ ts away in the right patt@@ ern that we can cal@@ cu@@ late , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there ."
Let me show you that idea vi@@ su@@ ally .
"So , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a gra@@ v@@ it@@ on — that &apos;s the kind of de@@ b@@ ris we exp@@ ect to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real ."
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
You take these particles . You s@@ la@@ m them together .
"You s@@ la@@ m them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that col@@ li@@ sion will go into de@@ b@@ ris that f@@ lies off into these extra dimensions ."
"So this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so ."
"And if this experiment be@@ ar@@ s f@@ ru@@ it , if we see that kind of partic@@ le e@@ jec@@ ted by noti@@ c@@ ing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we beg@@ an , this will show that the extra dimensions are real ."
"E@@ instein comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve — that &apos;s what gravity is ."
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our li@@ fe@@ time .
A@@ ma@@ zing possi@@ bility .
"E@@ very one of you kno@@ ws that the rate of change s@@ lo@@ ws over the human li@@ f@@ es@@ pan , that your children seem to change by the min@@ ute but your par@@ ents seem to change by the year ."
But what is the na@@ me of this ma@@ gi@@ cal point in life where change su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly goes from a g@@ allo@@ p to a cra@@ w@@ l ?
I@@ s it te@@ ena@@ ge years ? I@@ s it middle age ?
D@@ oes any of this matter ?
They need to be part of the pa@@ ck .
"I still remem@@ ber the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 ."
"I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use di@@ g@@ ital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TE@@ D@@ T@@ al@@ ks ."
"In@@ stead , I have progre@@ s@@ sed , and I am , today , la@@ un@@ ching a brand new anal@@ o@@ g teach@@ ing technology that I pi@@ cked up from I@@ K@@ E@@ A : this bo@@ x ."
This bo@@ x con@@ ta@@ ins one billion people .
"And our teacher told us that the in@@ du@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed world , 1960 , had one billion people ."
"In the develop@@ ing world , she said , they had two billion people ."
And they li@@ ved away then .
There was a big ga@@ p between the one billion in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed world and the two billion in the develop@@ ing world .
"In the in@@ du@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed world , people were heal@@ thy , educ@@ ated , rich , and they had small families ."
And their as@@ pi@@ ration was to buy a c@@ ar .
"And in 1960 , all Swe@@ des were sa@@ ving to try to buy a V@@ ol@@ v@@ o like this ."
This was the economic level at which Swe@@ den was .
"But in con@@ tra@@ st to this , in the develop@@ ing world , far away , the as@@ pi@@ ration of the average family there was to have fo@@ od for the day ."
They were sa@@ ving to be able to buy a pai@@ r of sh@@ oes .
There was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ga@@ p in the world when I gre@@ w up .
"And this ga@@ p between the W@@ est and the rest has created a min@@ d@@ set of the world , which we still use li@@ ng@@ u@@ is@@ ti@@ cally when we talk about &quot; &quot; the W@@ est &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing World . &quot; &quot; But the world has changed , and it &apos;s o@@ ver@@ due to up@@ gra@@ de that min@@ d@@ set and that ta@@ x@@ on@@ omy of the world , and to understand it ."
"And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 20@@ 10 is that a sta@@ gg@@ ering four billion people have been ad@@ ded to the world population ."
Just look how many .
The world population has d@@ ou@@ b@@ led since I went to school .
"And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the W@@ est ."
"A lot of compan@@ ies have happened to grow the econ@@ omy , so the W@@ est@@ ern population mo@@ ved over to here ."
And now their as@@ pi@@ ration is not only to have a c@@ ar .
Now they want to have a ho@@ li@@ day on a very re@@ mot@@ e de@@ sti@@ nation and they want to f@@ ly .
So this is where they are today .
"And the most successful of the develop@@ ing countries , they have mo@@ ved on , you know , and they have become emer@@ g@@ ing economi@@ es , we call them ."
They are now bu@@ ying car@@ s .
"And what happened a mon@@ th ago was that the Ch@@ ine@@ se compan@@ y , G@@ e@@ ely , they ac@@ qui@@ red the V@@ ol@@ v@@ o compan@@ y , and then finally the Swe@@ des underst@@ ood that something big had happened in the world ."
( Laughter ) So there they are .
"And the tra@@ ge@@ dy is that the two billion over here that is stru@@ gg@@ ling for fo@@ od and sh@@ oes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago ."
"The new thing is that we have the bi@@ ggest pi@@ le of bil@@ lions , the three bil@@ lions here , which are also becom@@ ing emer@@ g@@ ing economi@@ es , because they are quite heal@@ thy , relati@@ vely well-@@ educ@@ ated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; rich@@ er also &#93; have ."
"And their as@@ pi@@ ration now is , of course , to buy a bi@@ c@@ y@@ cle , and then later on they would like to have a mot@@ or@@ b@@ ik@@ e also ."
"But this is the world we have today , no longer any ga@@ p ."
"But the di@@ stance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very rich@@ est over here is wi@@ der than ever ."
"But there is a contin@@ u@@ ous world from walking , b@@ ik@@ ing , dri@@ ving , fl@@ ying — there are people on all lev@@ els , and most people t@@ end to be some@@ where in the middle ."
This is the new world we have today in 20@@ 10 .
And what will happen in the future ?
"Well , I &apos;m going to project into 20@@ 50 ."
"I was in S@@ h@@ ang@@ hai rec@@ ently , and I li@@ st@@ en@@ ed to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will cat@@ ch up , just as Japan did ."
A@@ ll the pro@@ jec@@ tions &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
"@@ &#91; But this second &#93; gro@@ ws with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here ."
They will start fl@@ ying .
"And these lower or middle income countries , the emer@@ g@@ ing income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards economi@@ cally ."
"And if , but only if , we inv@@ est in the right gre@@ en technology — so that we can av@@ oi@@ d se@@ v@@ ere cli@@ mate change , and energy can still be relati@@ vely ch@@ ea@@ p — then they will move all the way up here ."
And they will start to buy electri@@ c car@@ s .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
W@@ ill they move on ?
"Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; am@@ ong emer@@ g@@ ing economi@@ es &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family plan@@ ning is wi@@ d@@ ely used , and population growth is coming to an end ."
"@@ Here &#91; am@@ ong the poorest &#93; , population is gro@@ wing ."
"So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next dec@@ ad@@ es , increase to three billion , and they will ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter increase to four billion ."
There is nothing — but a nu@@ clear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
"But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of po@@ ver@@ ty , they get education , they get im@@ pro@@ ved child survival , they can buy a bi@@ c@@ y@@ cle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 20@@ 50 ."
We cannot have people on this level looking for fo@@ od and sh@@ oes because then we get contin@@ ue@@ d population growth .
And let me show you why by con@@ ver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d-@@ time di@@ g@@ ital technology .
Here I have on the scre@@ en my country bub@@ b@@ les .
E@@ very bubble is a country . The size is population .
The col@@ ors show the contin@@ ent .
The y@@ el@@ low on there is the Americ@@ as ; dark bl@@ ue is A@@ fri@@ c@@ a ; bro@@ wn is Eu@@ ro@@ pe ; gre@@ en is the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ a@@ st and this light bl@@ ue is S@@ ou@@ th A@@ sia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . S@@ iz@@ e is population .
"@@ Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children — big families , small families ."
The year is 1960 .
"And down here , child survival , the perc@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of children survi@@ ving chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 8@@ 0 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est and heal@@ thi@@ est countries ."
"But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion W@@ est@@ ern world here — high chil@@ d-@@ survival , small families — and all the rest , the ra@@ in@@ b@@ ow of develop@@ ing countries , with very large families and poor child survival ."
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
"C@@ an you see , as the years pa@@ ss by , child survival is increas@@ ing ?"
"They get so@@ ap , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , education , vac@@ ci@@ nation , peni@@ c@@ il@@ l@@ in and then family plan@@ ning . F@@ ami@@ ly size is dec@@ reas@@ ing ."
"@@ &#91; Wh@@ en &#93; they get up to 9@@ 0@@ -@@ percent child survival , then families dec@@ rea@@ se , and most of the Ara@@ b countries in the M@@ i@@ ddle E@@ a@@ st is f@@ al@@ ling down there &#91; to small families &#93; ."
"@@ Lo@@ ok , B@@ ang@@ la@@ de@@ sh cat@@ ching up with India ."
"The whole emer@@ g@@ ing world jo@@ ins the W@@ est@@ ern world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion ."
"C@@ an you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; bo@@ x@@ es I had over here ?"
They are still up here .
"And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 8@@ 0 percent , mean@@ ing that if you have six children born , there will be at lea@@ st four who survi@@ ve to the next generation ."
And the population will d@@ ou@@ ble in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to contin@@ ue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
"That &apos;s why inv@@ est@@ ments by G@@ ates F@@ oun@@ dation , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and ai@@ d organiz@@ ations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually hel@@ ping us to reach a su@@ sta@@ i@@ na@@ ble population size of the world ."
We can stop at n@@ ine billion if we do the right things .
C@@ hi@@ ld survival is the new gre@@ en .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
"Well , I &apos;m not an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st , ne@@ i@@ ther am I a p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ st ."
"I &apos;m a very seri@@ ous &quot; &quot; possi@@ bi@@ li@@ st . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a new cat@@ e@@ g@@ ory where we take em@@ oti@@ on ap@@ art , and we just work anal@@ y@@ ti@@ cally with the world ."
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
"W@@ ith gre@@ en technology and with inv@@ est@@ ments to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty , and global gover@@ nan@@ ce , the world can become like this ."
And look at the position of the old W@@ est .
"R@@ em@@ em@@ ber when this bl@@ ue bo@@ x was all alone , lead@@ ing the world , li@@ ving its own life ."
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
"The ro@@ le of the old W@@ est in the new world is to become the f@@ oun@@ dation of the modern world — nothing more , nothing less ."
But it &apos;s a very important ro@@ le .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

"So here &apos;s my question for you : which one of these two gu@@ ys was more lik@@ ely to have v@@ ot@@ ed for G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ u@@ sh , which for A@@ l G@@ ore ?"
"And in this case , the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pe cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality ."
It really is a fact that liber@@ als are much high@@ er than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves on a maj@@ or perso@@ na@@ lity tra@@ it called op@@ en@@ ness to experience .
"P@@ eople low on it like things that are fami@@ li@@ ar , that are sa@@ fe and depen@@ d@@ able ."
"O@@ n@@ ce you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why any@@ body would e@@ at at App@@ le@@ be@@ e &apos;s , but not any@@ body that you know ."
( Laughter ) This tra@@ it also tells us a lot about politi@@ cs .
This tra@@ it also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people jo@@ in .
So here &apos;s the descri@@ p@@ tion of a group I found on the W@@ eb .
Let &apos;s find out .
"I &apos;m going to ask you to rai@@ se your hand , whether you are liber@@ al , left of center — on social is@@ sue@@ s , we &apos;re talking about , pri@@ ma@@ ri@@ ly — or con@@ serv@@ ative , and I &apos;ll give a thir@@ d op@@ tion , because I know there are a number of liber@@ ta@@ rian@@ s in the au@@ dience ."
P@@ lease rai@@ se your hand high right now . O@@ K .
P@@ lease rai@@ se your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re liber@@ ta@@ rian .
"O@@ K , about a — two do@@ z@@ en ."
And p@@ lease rai@@ se your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or con@@ serv@@ ative .
O@@ K . This is a bit of a problem .
"Because if our go@@ al is to understand the world , to se@@ ek a de@@ ep@@ er understanding of the world , our gener@@ al lack of moral di@@ ver@@ sity here is going to make it har@@ der ."
"Because when people all share val@@ ues , when people all share mora@@ ls , they become a tea@@ m , and once you eng@@ age the psycho@@ logy of te@@ am@@ s , it sh@@ ut@@ s down op@@ en@@ -@@ min@@ ded thinking ."
"When the liber@@ al tea@@ m l@@ os@@ es , as it did in 200@@ 4 , and as it almost did in 2@@ 000 , we com@@ for@@ t ourselves ."
( Laughter ) We try to explain why half of America v@@ ot@@ ed for the other tea@@ m .
"We think they must be bl@@ in@@ ded by religi@@ on , or by simple stu@@ pi@@ d@@ ity ."
"( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , if you think that half of America v@@ ot@@ es R@@ ep@@ u@@ bli@@ can because they are bl@@ in@@ ded in this way , then my message to you is that you &apos;re t@@ rapp@@ ed in a moral mat@@ ri@@ x , in a particular moral mat@@ ri@@ x ."
"I was going to ask you which one you pi@@ cked , but no need ."
Let &apos;s study some moral psycho@@ logy and see where it takes us .
What is morality and where does it come from ?
The wor@@ st idea in all of psycho@@ logy is the idea that the mind is a bl@@ ank s@@ late at bir@@ th .
"He says , &quot; &quot; The in@@ iti@@ al organiz@@ ation of the brain does not depen@@ d that much on experience ."
It gi@@ ves us very strong feel@@ ings about those who cause har@@ m .
This moral f@@ oun@@ dation under@@ lies about 70 percent of the moral sta@@ tem@@ ents I &apos;ve heard here at TED .
The thir@@ d f@@ oun@@ dation is in@@ -@@ group / lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
You do find groups in the an@@ ima@@ l k@@ ing@@ dom — you do find co@@ oper@@ ative groups — but these groups are always ei@@ ther very small or they &apos;re all si@@ bli@@ ngs .
"It &apos;s only am@@ ong humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to co@@ oper@@ ate , jo@@ in together into groups , but in this case , groups that are un@@ ited to fi@@ ght other groups ."
"This probably comes from our long history of tri@@ bal li@@ ving , of tri@@ bal psycho@@ logy ."
( Laughter ) S@@ por@@ ts is to war as por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y is to sex .
"We get to ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se some an@@ ci@@ ent , an@@ ci@@ ent dri@@ ves ."
The f@@ our@@ th f@@ oun@@ dation is au@@ th@@ ority / resp@@ ect .
Here you see sub@@ mis@@ sive g@@ es@@ tures from two mem@@ b@@ ers of very cl@@ os@@ ely rela@@ ted speci@@ es .
"It &apos;s based on more vol@@ un@@ ta@@ ry de@@ fer@@ ence , and even el@@ ements of love , at times ."
The fi@@ f@@ th f@@ oun@@ dation is pur@@ ity / san@@ ct@@ ity .
"This pa@@ int@@ ing is called &quot; &quot; The A@@ lle@@ g@@ ory O@@ f C@@ ha@@ st@@ ity , &quot; &quot; but pur@@ ity &apos;s not just about supp@@ re@@ s@@ sing fe@@ ma@@ le se@@ x@@ u@@ ality ."
"And so far , 3@@ 0,000 people have taken this ques@@ ti@@ on@@ nai@@ re , and you can too ."
Here are the results .
"@@ Here are the results from about 2@@ 3@@ ,000 American c@@ iti@@ z@@ ens ."
"They give high en@@ d@@ or@@ se@@ ment of these sor@@ ts of sta@@ tem@@ ents all across the bo@@ ar@@ d , but as you also see , liber@@ als care about it a little more than con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves — the line s@@ l@@ op@@ es down ."
We find this in every country we look at .
I &apos;ll just f@@ li@@ p through a few other sli@@ des .
"@@ N@@ oti@@ ce also that on all of these gra@@ ph@@ s , the s@@ lo@@ pe is ste@@ ep@@ er on in@@ -@@ group , au@@ th@@ ority , pur@@ ity ."
"W@@ hi@@ ch sho@@ ws that within any country , the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement isn &apos;t over har@@ m and fai@@ r@@ ness ."
What makes them moral ?
"In the first pan@@ el , we see the moment of cre@@ ation ."
"All is or@@ der@@ ed , all is beautiful , all the people and an@@ ima@@ ls are doing what they &apos;re supp@@ osed to be doing , where they &apos;re supp@@ osed to be ."
"But then , given the way of the world , things change ."
"We get every person doing w@@ hat@@ ever he want@@ s , with every ap@@ er@@ ture of every other person and every other an@@ ima@@ l ."
S@@ ome of you might recogni@@ ze this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
"( Laughter ) But the &apos; 6@@ 0s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ab@@ ly gi@@ ves way to the &apos; 7@@ 0s , where the c@@ ut@@ ti@@ ngs of the ap@@ er@@ tures hu@@ r@@ t a little bit more ."
"O@@ f course , B@@ os@@ ch called this h@@ ell ."
"So this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three pan@@ els por@@ tra@@ y the tim@@ el@@ ess tru@@ th that order ten@@ ds to dec@@ ay ."
The tru@@ th of social entropy .
"O@@ n the first r@@ ound , people give about half of the money that they can ."
"But they quickly see , &quot; &quot; You know what , other people are@@ n &apos;t doing so much though ."
"I don &apos;t want to be a su@@ ck@@ er . I &apos;m not going to co@@ oper@@ ate . &quot; &quot; And so co@@ oper@@ ation quickly dec@@ a@@ ys from reas@@ ona@@ bly good , down to cl@@ ose to z@@ ero ."
"But then — and here &apos;s the tri@@ ck — F@@ e@@ h@@ r and G@@ a@@ ch@@ ter said , on the se@@ v@@ en@@ th r@@ ound , they told people , &quot; &quot; You know what ? New ru@@ le ."
Because I think that the great@@ est won@@ der in the world is not the G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on .
The G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on is really simple .
"It &apos;s just a lot of ro@@ ck , and then a lot of water and w@@ ind , and a lot of time , and you get the G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on ."
It &apos;s not that comp@@ lic@@ ated .
"This is an ab@@ sol@@ ute mi@@ rac@@ le , much har@@ der to explain than the G@@ rand C@@ any@@ on ."
And now we get to the c@@ ru@@ x of the di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ement between liber@@ als and con@@ serv@@ ati@@ ves .
This is the great in@@ sight that all the A@@ si@@ an religi@@ ons have atta@@ ined .
Th@@ ink about y@@ in and y@@ ang .
You find the same thing in H@@ in@@ du@@ ism .
There are many high go@@ ds in H@@ in@@ du@@ ism .
"T@@ wo of them are Vi@@ sh@@ nu , the pre@@ ser@@ ver , and S@@ hi@@ v@@ a , the dest@@ ro@@ y@@ er ."
This ima@@ ge actually is both of those go@@ ds sha@@ ring the same body .
"You have the mark@@ ings of Vi@@ sh@@ nu on the left , so we could think of Vi@@ sh@@ nu as the con@@ serv@@ ative go@@ d ."
"You have the mark@@ ings of S@@ hi@@ v@@ a on the right , S@@ hi@@ v@@ a &apos;s the liber@@ al go@@ d . And they work together ."
"@@ These two stan@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , I think , the de@@ e@@ pe@@ st in@@ si@@ ghts that have ever been atta@@ ined into moral psycho@@ logy ."
"F@@ rom the Z@@ en ma@@ ster S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an : &quot; &quot; If you want the tru@@ th to st@@ and clear before you , never be for or against ."
"The stru@@ gg@@ le between for and against is the mind &apos;s wor@@ st disease . &quot; &quot; Now un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , it &apos;s a disease that has been cau@@ ght by many of the world &apos;s lead@@ ers ."
"But before you feel super@@ i@@ or to G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ u@@ sh , before you th@@ row a st@@ one , ask yourself , do you ac@@ cept this ?"
Do you ac@@ cept ste@@ pp@@ ing out of the b@@ att@@ le of good and evi@@ l ?
Can you be not for or against anything ?
"So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?"
So what should you do ? A@@ m I telling you to not stri@@ ve ?
"A@@ m I telling you to em@@ bra@@ ce S@@ eng@@ -@@ ts &apos;@@ an and stop , stop with this stru@@ gg@@ le of for and against ?"
"@@ No , ab@@ solutely not . I &apos;m not saying that ."
"But as we learned from S@@ am@@ an@@ tha P@@ o@@ wer , in her story about S@@ er@@ gi@@ o Vi@@ ei@@ ra de M@@ el@@ l@@ o , you can &apos;t just go char@@ g@@ ing in , saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re wrong , and I &apos;m right . &quot; &quot; Because , as we just heard , everybody thin@@ ks they are right ."
A lot of the problems we have to sol@@ ve are problems that requi@@ re us to change other people .
Th@@ ink about the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous moral au@@ th@@ ority of the D@@ a@@ lai L@@ am@@ a — and it comes from his moral hu@@ mil@@ ity .
"So I think the point — the point of my talk , and I think the point of TED — is that this is a group that is pas@@ sio@@ nately eng@@ ag@@ ed in the pur@@ su@@ it of chang@@ ing the world for the better ."
P@@ eople here are pas@@ sio@@ nately eng@@ ag@@ ed in trying to make the world a better place .
But there is also a pas@@ sio@@ nate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tru@@ th .
And so I think that the answer is to use that pas@@ sio@@ nate com@@ mit@@ ment to the tru@@ th to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I@@ s there anything uni@@ qu@@ e about human beings ?
There is .
We &apos;re the only cre@@ atures with fully developed moral sen@@ tim@@ ents .
We &apos;re ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with morality as social cre@@ atures .
We need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
And I perso@@ nally am ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with morality .
"It was all due to this woman , S@@ i@@ ster M@@ ary Ma@@ ra@@ st@@ ela , also known as my mo@@ m ."
"As an al@@ ta@@ r bo@@ y , I b@@ rea@@ th@@ ed in a lot of in@@ cen@@ se , and I learned to say ph@@ ra@@ ses in L@@ ati@@ n , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top@@ -@@ down morality app@@ li@@ ed to everybody ."
I saw that people who were religi@@ ous and non@@ -@@ religi@@ ous were equ@@ ally ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with morality .
"I thought , maybe there &apos;s some ear@@ th@@ ly ba@@ sis for moral deci@@ sions ."
But I wanted to go fu@@ r@@ ther than to say our bra@@ ins make us moral .
I want to know if there &apos;s a che@@ mi@@ st@@ ry of morality . I want to know
if there was a moral molecu@@ le .
"A@@ f@@ ter 10 years of experiments , I found it ."
W@@ ould you like to see it ? I brought some with me .
This little sy@@ ri@@ ng@@ e con@@ ta@@ ins the moral molecu@@ le .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So oxytocin is a simple and an@@ ci@@ ent molecu@@ le found only in m@@ am@@ ma@@ ls .
"In ro@@ d@@ ents , it was known to make mothers care for their off@@ sp@@ ring , and in some cre@@ atures , allowed for t@@ ol@@ er@@ ation of bur@@ ro@@ w@@ mat@@ es ."
"But in humans , it was only known to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate bir@@ th and b@@ rea@@ st@@ fe@@ e@@ ding in women , and is re@@ le@@ as@@ ed by both se@@ x@@ es during sex ."
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecu@@ le .
I did what most of us do — I tried it on some colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"One of them told me , &quot; &quot; P@@ au@@ l , that is the world &apos;s stu@@ pi@@ di@@ st idea ."
"It is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; only a fe@@ ma@@ le molecu@@ le ."
"It can &apos;t be that important . &quot; &quot; But I count@@ ered , &quot; &quot; Well men &apos;s bra@@ ins make this too ."
"There must be a reason why . &quot; &quot; But he was right , it was a stu@@ pi@@ d idea ."
But it was t@@ es@@ ta@@ bly stu@@ pi@@ d .
"In other words , I thought I could desig@@ n an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral ."
T@@ ur@@ ns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
"F@@ irst of all , oxytocin is a sh@@ y molecu@@ le ."
"B@@ as@@ el@@ ine lev@@ els are ne@@ ar z@@ ero , without some sti@@ mul@@ us to cause its re@@ lease ."
"And when it &apos;s produc@@ ed , it has a thre@@ e-@@ min@@ ute hal@@ f-@@ life , and de@@ gra@@ des rap@@ i@@ dly at room tem@@ per@@ ature ."
"So this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytocin , have to gra@@ b it fa@@ st and keep it co@@ ld ."
I think I can do that .
"Now lu@@ ck@@ i@@ ly , oxytocin is produc@@ ed both in the brain and in the blo@@ od , so I could do this experiment without learning neur@@ os@@ ur@@ g@@ ery ."
Th@@ en I had to measure morality .
So taking on M@@ o@@ ra@@ lity with a cap@@ ital M is a hu@@ ge project .
So I started sma@@ l@@ ler .
I studi@@ ed one single vi@@ r@@ tue : tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
Why ? I had sho@@ wn in the early 200@@ 0s that countries with a high@@ er prop@@ or@@ tion of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy people are more p@@ ros@@ per@@ ous .
"So in these countries , more economic tran@@ sa@@ c@@ tions oc@@ cu@@ r and more we@@ al@@ th is created , al@@ le@@ vi@@ ating po@@ ver@@ ty ."
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
"So if I underst@@ ood the che@@ mi@@ st@@ ry of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , I might help al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate po@@ ver@@ ty ."
But I &apos;m also a sk@@ ep@@ tic .
"I don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; &quot; A@@ re you tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy ? &quot; &quot; So instead I use the J@@ er@@ ry M@@ ag@@ u@@ i@@ re approach to research ."
"If you &apos;re so vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous , show me the money ."
So what we do in my la@@ b is we t@@ emp@@ t people with vi@@ r@@ tue and vice by using money .
Let me show you how we do that .
So we rec@@ ru@@ it some people for an experiment .
They all get $ 10 if they ag@@ ree to show up .
"We give them lots of in@@ struc@@ tion , and we never ever dec@@ ei@@ ve them ."
Th@@ en we mat@@ ch them in pai@@ r@@ s by computer .
"And in that pai@@ r , one person gets a message saying , &quot; &quot; Do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the la@@ b ? &quot; &quot; The tri@@ ck is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them ."
You only do it one time .
Now w@@ hat@@ ever you give up gets tri@@ pl@@ ed in the other person &apos;s ac@@ cou@@ nt .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot we@@ al@@ thi@@ er .
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
"@@ Do you want to keep it all , or do you want to sen@@ d some amount back ?"
So think about this experiment for min@@ ute .
You &apos;re going to sit on these hard chai@@ r@@ s for an h@@ our and a half .
S@@ ome ma@@ d scienti@@ st is going to j@@ a@@ b your ar@@ m with a ne@@ ed@@ le and take four tu@@ b@@ es of blo@@ od .
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a st@@ rang@@ er ?
So this was the bir@@ th of v@@ am@@ pi@@ re economi@@ cs .
M@@ ake a deci@@ sion and give me some blo@@ od .
"So in fact , experim@@ en@@ tal economi@@ sts had ru@@ n this test around the world , and for much high@@ er s@@ takes , and the con@@ sen@@ su@@ s view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the trans@@ f@@ er from the second person back to the first measu@@ red tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ."
"But in fact , economi@@ sts were flu@@ m@@ mo@@ x@@ ed on why the second person would ever re@@ turn any money ."
"They as@@ sum@@ ed money is good , why not keep it all ?"
That &apos;s not what we found .
"We found 90 percent of the first deci@@ si@@ on@@ -@@ mak@@ ers sent money , and of those who rec@@ ei@@ ved money , 9@@ 5 percent re@@ turned some of it ."
But why ?
"Well by measu@@ ring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person rec@@ ei@@ ved , the more their brain produc@@ ed oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on bo@@ ar@@ d , the more money they re@@ turned ."
So we have a bio@@ logy of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
But wait . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
T@@ wo things .
One is that nothing in the body happens in i@@ so@@ lation .
"So we measu@@ red n@@ ine other molecules that inter@@ act with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any eff@@ ect ."
But the second is that I still only had this in@@ direc@@ t relation@@ ship between oxytocin and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
I didn &apos;t know for sure oxytocin cau@@ sed tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
"So to make the experiment , I knew I &apos;d have to go into the brain and man@@ i@@ pu@@ late oxytocin direc@@ tly ."
I used everything sh@@ ort of a dri@@ ll to get oxytocin into my own brain .
And I found I could do it with a na@@ sa@@ l in@@ hal@@ er .
"So along with colle@@ ag@@ ues in Z@@ u@@ rich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or pla@@ c@@ eb@@ o , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than d@@ ou@@ ble the number of people who sent all their money to a st@@ rang@@ er — all without al@@ ter@@ ing mo@@ od or cognition ."
"So oxytocin is the trust molecu@@ le , but is it the moral molecu@@ le ?"
"@@ U@@ sing the oxytocin in@@ hal@@ er , we ran more studies ."
We showed that oxytocin in@@ fu@@ sion incre@@ ases gener@@ os@@ ity in uni@@ la@@ ter@@ al mon@@ e@@ ta@@ ry trans@@ f@@ ers by 8@@ 0 percent .
We showed it incre@@ ases do@@ na@@ tions to char@@ ity by 50 percent .
We &apos;ve also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated non@@ -@@ pha@@ r@@ ma@@ co@@ logi@@ c ways to rai@@ se oxytocin .
"@@ These inclu@@ de mas@@ sage , dan@@ c@@ ing and p@@ ra@@ ying ."
"Y@@ es , my mo@@ m was happy about that last one ."
"And wh@@ en@@ ever we rai@@ se oxytocin , people w@@ il@@ li@@ ng@@ ly open up their wal@@ l@@ ets and share money with st@@ rang@@ ers ."
But why do they do this ?
What does it feel like when your brain is flo@@ o@@ ded with oxytocin ?
"T@@ o inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a vi@@ de@@ o of a father and his four year-@@ old son , and his son has ter@@ mi@@ nal brain can@@ cer ."
"A@@ f@@ ter they wat@@ ched the vi@@ de@@ o , we had them rate their feel@@ ings and took blo@@ od before and after to measure oxytocin ."
The change in oxytocin predic@@ ted their feel@@ ings of empa@@ thy .
So it &apos;s empa@@ thy that makes us con@@ n@@ ect to other people .
It &apos;s empa@@ thy that makes us help other people .
It &apos;s empa@@ thy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
"A then un@@ known ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er nam@@ ed A@@ dam S@@ mit@@ h wrote a book in 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; &quot; The The@@ ory of M@@ o@@ ral S@@ enti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; In this book , S@@ mit@@ h ar@@ g@@ ue@@ d that we are moral cre@@ atures , not because of a top@@ -@@ down reason , but for a bot@@ tom@@ -@@ up reason ."
"He said we &apos;re social cre@@ atures , so we share the em@@ oti@@ ons of others ."
"So if I do something that hu@@ r@@ ts you , I feel that pain ."
So I t@@ end to av@@ oi@@ d that .
"If I do something that makes you happy , I get to share your jo@@ y ."
So I t@@ end to do those things .
"Now this is the same A@@ dam S@@ mit@@ h who , 1@@ 7 years later , would writ@@ e a little book called &quot; &quot; The W@@ e@@ al@@ th of N@@ ations &quot; &quot; — the f@@ oun@@ ding do@@ cu@@ ment of economi@@ cs ."
"But he was , in fact , a moral ph@@ il@@ os@@ o@@ ph@@ er , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral ."
I just found the molecu@@ le behind it .
"But kno@@ wing that molecu@@ le is val@@ u@@ able , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off ."
"In particular , it tells us why we see im@@ morality ."
"So to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate im@@ morality , let me bring you back now to 198@@ 0 ."
"I &apos;m working at a g@@ as sta@@ tion on the out@@ s@@ ki@@ r@@ ts of S@@ ant@@ a B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a ."
"You sit in a g@@ as sta@@ tion all day , you see lots of morality and im@@ morality , let me tell you ."
"So one S@@ un@@ day af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , a man wal@@ ks into my ca@@ shi@@ er &apos;s bo@@ ot@@ h with this beautiful j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry bo@@ x ."
O@@ pen@@ s it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ arl nec@@ k@@ la@@ ce inside .
"And he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , I was in the men &apos;s room ."
"I just found this . What do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;"
&quot; &quot; Well this is very val@@ u@@ able .
"We have to find the o@@ w@@ ner for this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ e@@ a . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re trying to deci@@ de what to do with this , and the phone ri@@ ngs ."
"And a man says very exc@@ it@@ ed@@ ly , &quot; &quot; I was in your g@@ as sta@@ tion a while ago , and I b@@ ou@@ ght this j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry for my wife , and I can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ l nec@@ k@@ la@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ eah . &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ey , a guy just found it . &quot;"
"&quot; &quot; O@@ h , you &apos;re sa@@ ving my life . Here &apos;s my phone number ."
T@@ ell that guy to wait half an h@@ our .
"I &apos;ll be there and I &apos;ll give him a $ 200 re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; G@@ re@@ at , so I tell the guy , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , rela@@ x ."
"@@ G@@ et yourself a f@@ at re@@ ward . L@@ i@@ fe &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do it ."
"I have this job inter@@ view in G@@ al@@ ena in 15 minutes , and I need this job , I &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; A@@ g@@ ain he asked me , &quot; &quot; What do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in high school . I have no idea ."
"So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been so ni@@ ce , let &apos;s sp@@ l@@ it the re@@ ward . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll give you the j@@ e@@ wel@@ ry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... &quot; &quot; You see it . I was con@@ ned ."
"So this is a cla@@ s@@ sic c@@ on called the pi@@ ge@@ on drop , and I was the pi@@ ge@@ on ."
"So the way many c@@ ons work is not that the con@@ man gets the victi@@ m to trust him , it &apos;s that he sho@@ ws he tru@@ sts the victi@@ m ."
Now we know what happens .
"The victi@@ m &apos;s brain re@@ le@@ ases oxytocin , and you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing up your wal@@ let or pur@@ se , giving away the money ."
So who are these people who man@@ i@@ pu@@ late our oxytocin systems ?
"We found , te@@ st@@ ing thousands of individu@@ als , that five percent of the population don &apos;t re@@ lease oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
"So if you trust them , their bra@@ ins don &apos;t re@@ lease oxytocin ."
"If there &apos;s money on the table , they keep it all ."
So there &apos;s a te@@ chni@@ cal word for these people in my la@@ b .
We call them ba@@ star@@ ds .
( Laughter ) These are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
They have many of the att@@ ri@@ b@@ utes of psy@@ chop@@ a@@ ths .
Now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ed .
One is through im@@ prop@@ er nu@@ r@@ tu@@ ring .
"So we &apos;ve studi@@ ed se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ab@@ used women , and about half those don &apos;t re@@ lease oxytocin on sti@@ mul@@ us ."
You need enough nu@@ r@@ tu@@ ring for this system to devel@@ op prop@@ er@@ ly .
"A@@ l@@ so , high stress in@@ hi@@ b@@ its oxytocin ."
"So we all know this , when we &apos;re really stre@@ s@@ sed out , we &apos;re not ac@@ ting our best ."
"There &apos;s another way oxytocin is in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ed , which is interesting — through the action of te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one ."
"So we , in experiments , have ad@@ mini@@ st@@ ered te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one to men ."
"And instead of sha@@ ring money , they become sel@@ fi@@ sh ."
"But inter@@ es@@ ti@@ ng@@ ly , high te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one ma@@ les are also more lik@@ ely to use their own money to p@@ uni@@ sh others for being sel@@ fi@@ sh ."
"( Laughter ) Now think about this . It means , within our own bio@@ logy , we have the y@@ in and y@@ ang of morality ."
"We have oxytocin that connec@@ ts us to others , makes us feel what they feel ."
And we have te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
"And men have 10 times the te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one as women , so men do this more than women — we have te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one that makes us want to p@@ uni@@ sh people who be@@ have im@@ mora@@ lly ."
We don &apos;t need G@@ od or government telling us what to do .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
"So you may be wonder@@ ing : these are beautiful la@@ bo@@ rat@@ ory experiments , do they really app@@ ly to real life ?"
"Y@@ eah , I &apos;ve been wor@@ r@@ ying about that too ."
So I &apos;ve gone out of the la@@ b to see if this really h@@ ol@@ ds in our dai@@ ly lives .
"So last sum@@ mer , I att@@ en@@ ded a we@@ d@@ ding in S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Eng@@ land ."
200 people in this beautiful Vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ an man@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And I d@@ ro@@ ve up in my r@@ ent@@ ed V@@ au@@ x@@ ha@@ ll .
And I took out a cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and d@@ ry ice and ne@@ ed@@ les and tu@@ b@@ es .
And I took blo@@ od from the bri@@ de and the gro@@ om and the we@@ d@@ ding par@@ ty and the family and the friends before and im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely after the v@@ o@@ ws .
( Laughter ) And g@@ ue@@ ss what ?
"W@@ ed@@ di@@ ngs cause a re@@ lease of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way ."
Wh@@ o is the center of the we@@ d@@ ding solar system ?
The bri@@ de .
She had the bi@@ ggest increase in oxytocin .
Wh@@ o lo@@ ves the we@@ d@@ ding almost as much as the bri@@ de ?
"H@@ er mother , that &apos;s right ."
H@@ er mother was number two .
"Th@@ en the gro@@ om &apos;s father , then the gro@@ om , then the family , then the friends — ar@@ ra@@ y@@ ed around the bri@@ de like planets around the Sun ."
"So I think it tells us that we &apos;ve desig@@ ned this rit@@ u@@ al to con@@ n@@ ect us to this new couple , con@@ n@@ ect us em@@ oti@@ ona@@ lly ."
Why ? Because we need them to be successful at re@@ produc@@ ing to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ate the speci@@ es .
I also wor@@ ried that my trust experiments with small amou@@ nt@@ s of money didn &apos;t really cap@@ ture how of@@ ten we actually trust our lives to st@@ rang@@ ers .
"So even though I have a fear of he@@ i@@ ghts , I rec@@ ently st@@ rapp@@ ed myself to another human being and ste@@ pp@@ ed out of an ai@@ r@@ plan@@ e at 1@@ 2@@ ,000 ft ."
"I took my blo@@ od before and after , and I had a hu@@ ge sp@@ ik@@ e of oxytocin ."
And there are so many ways we can con@@ n@@ ect to people .
"For example , through social medi@@ a ."
M@@ any people are T@@ we@@ eting right now .
So we inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ated the ro@@ le of social medi@@ a and found the using social medi@@ a produc@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d d@@ ou@@ ble@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it increase in oxytocin .
So I ran this experiment rec@@ ently for the K@@ ore@@ an B@@ ro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing S@@ y@@ stem .
And they had the re@@ port@@ ers and their produc@@ ers parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
"And one of these gu@@ ys , he must have been 2@@ 2 , he had 150 percent sp@@ ik@@ e in oxytocin ."
"I mean , ast@@ oun@@ ding ; no one has this ."
So he was using social medi@@ a in pri@@ v@@ ate .
"When I wrote my re@@ por@@ t to the K@@ ore@@ ans , I said , &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ok , I don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my g@@ ue@@ ss was inter@@ ac@@ ting with his mother or his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end ."
They ch@@ ec@@ ked .
He was inter@@ ac@@ ting on his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ end &apos;s F@@ ac@@ ebo@@ ok pa@@ ge .
There you go . That &apos;s connec@@ tion .
"So there &apos;s t@@ ons of ways that we can con@@ n@@ ect to other people , and it seems to be univer@@ sa@@ l ."
"T@@ wo weeks ago , I just got back from P@@ ap@@ ua New G@@ u@@ ine@@ a where I went up to the high@@ lan@@ ds — very i@@ so@@ lated tri@@ b@@ es of sub@@ sist@@ ence far@@ m@@ ers li@@ ving as they have li@@ ved for mil@@ l@@ en@@ ia ."
There are 8@@ 00 different lang@@ u@@ ag@@ es in the high@@ lan@@ ds .
These are the most pri@@ miti@@ ve people in the world .
And they in@@ de@@ ed also re@@ lease oxytocin .
So oxytocin connec@@ ts us to other people .
O@@ xy@@ tocin makes us feel what other people feel .
And it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s bra@@ ins to re@@ lease oxytocin .
"I know how to do it , and my fav@@ or@@ ite way to do it is , in fact , the ea@@ si@@ est ."
Let me show it to you .
C@@ ome here . G@@ i@@ ve me a hu@@ g .
( Laughter ) There you go .
( Applause ) So my pen@@ chant for hu@@ gg@@ ing other people has ear@@ ned me the ni@@ c@@ kna@@ me D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve .
"I &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion from D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve : eight hu@@ gs a day ."
We have found that people who re@@ lease more oxytocin are happ@@ i@@ er .
And they &apos;re happ@@ i@@ er because they have better relation@@ shi@@ ps of all ty@@ p@@ es .
D@@ r@@ . Lo@@ ve says eight hu@@ gs a day .
E@@ ight hu@@ gs a day — you &apos;ll be happ@@ i@@ er and the world will be a better place .
"O@@ f course , if you don &apos;t like to tou@@ ch people , I can always sho@@ ve this up your n@@ ose ."
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
"When I was n@@ ine years old , I went off to sum@@ mer cam@@ p for the first time ."
C@@ am@@ p was more like a ke@@ g par@@ ty without any al@@ co@@ h@@ ol .
And I just wa@@ ited for the time that I could go off and read my bo@@ ok@@ s .
It &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
S@@ hy@@ ness is about fear of social ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
"We sat in ro@@ ws of de@@ s@@ ks like this , and we did most of our work pretty au@@ ton@@ om@@ ously ."
"So , quite under@@ stan@@ d@@ ab@@ ly , qu@@ al@@ ities like magne@@ tis@@ m and cha@@ ris@@ ma su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly come to seem really important ."
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my su@@ it@@ case today .
It &apos;s great for int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ts and it &apos;s great for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
"H@@ i , my na@@ me is Mar@@ cin — far@@ mer , techno@@ logi@@ st ."
"I was born in P@@ ol@@ and , now in the U.S@@ ."
I started a group called O@@ pen S@@ our@@ ce E@@ co@@ logy .
"We &apos;ve i@@ d@@ enti@@ fied the 50 most important ma@@ chin@@ es that we think it takes for modern life to exi@@ st — things from tra@@ ct@@ ors , b@@ read o@@ v@@ ens , circu@@ it mak@@ ers ."
"Th@@ en we set out to create an open sour@@ ce , D@@ I@@ Y , do it yourself ver@@ sion that any@@ one can build and main@@ tain at a f@@ rac@@ tion of the cost ."
We call this the G@@ lo@@ bal V@@ il@@ la@@ ge Con@@ struc@@ tion S@@ et .
So let me tell you a story .
"So I fin@@ i@@ shed my 20@@ s with a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . in fu@@ sion energy , and I disco@@ vered I was u@@ sel@@ ess ."
I had no p@@ rac@@ ti@@ cal skil@@ ls .
"The world pres@@ ent@@ ed me with op@@ tions , and I took them ."
I g@@ ue@@ ss you can call it the con@@ su@@ mer li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
So I started a far@@ m in M@@ is@@ sour@@ i and learned about the economi@@ cs of far@@ ming .
I b@@ ou@@ ght a tra@@ c@@ tor — then it brok@@ e .
I paid to get it re@@ pai@@ red — then it brok@@ e again .
"Th@@ en pretty so@@ on , I was brok@@ e too ."
"I realiz@@ ed that the truly app@@ rop@@ ri@@ ate , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost to@@ ols that I needed to start a su@@ sta@@ i@@ na@@ ble far@@ m and s@@ et@@ t@@ le@@ ment just didn &apos;t exi@@ st yet ."
"I needed to@@ ols that were ro@@ bu@@ st , mo@@ du@@ lar , high@@ ly e@@ ffi@@ ci@@ ent and op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed , lo@@ w@@ -@@ cost , made from lo@@ cal and rec@@ y@@ c@@ led materi@@ als that would last a li@@ fe@@ time , not desig@@ ned for ob@@ so@@ le@@ sc@@ ence ."
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I te@@ sted them .
And I found that in@@ du@@ stri@@ al produc@@ ti@@ vity can be achiev@@ ed on a small scal@@ e .
"So then I published the 3@@ D desig@@ ns , s@@ che@@ mati@@ cs , in@@ stru@@ cti@@ onal vi@@ de@@ os and bu@@ d@@ gets on a wik@@ i ."
"Th@@ en con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ors from all over the world beg@@ an sho@@ wing up , prot@@ ot@@ y@@ ping new ma@@ chin@@ es during de@@ dic@@ ated project vi@@ sit@@ s ."
"So far , we have prot@@ ot@@ y@@ ped eight of the 50 ma@@ chin@@ es ."
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that open sour@@ ce has succ@@ ee@@ ded with to@@ ols for man@@ ag@@ ing kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge and cre@@ ati@@ vity .
And the same is starting to happen with har@@ d@@ ware too .
We &apos;re focu@@ sing on har@@ d@@ ware because it is har@@ d@@ ware that can change people &apos;s lives in such t@@ ang@@ i@@ ble material ways .
"If we can lower the bar@@ ri@@ ers to far@@ ming , building , man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ ring , then we can un@@ le@@ as@@ h just mas@@ sive amou@@ nt@@ s of human potenti@@ al ."
That &apos;s not only in the develop@@ ing world .
"O@@ ur to@@ ols are being made for the American far@@ mer , buil@@ der , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur , mak@@ er ."
"We &apos;ve seen lots of exc@@ it@@ ement from these people , who can now start a con@@ struc@@ tion bu@@ siness , parts man@@ u@@ fac@@ tu@@ ring , organ@@ ic C@@ S@@ A or just sel@@ ling power back to the g@@ ri@@ d ."
"O@@ ur go@@ al is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published desig@@ ns so clear , so complet@@ e , that a single bur@@ ned D@@ V@@ D is eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely a civi@@ li@@ zation star@@ ter kit ."
I &apos;ve pl@@ ant@@ ed a hundred tre@@ es in a day .
"I &apos;ve pres@@ sed 5,000 bri@@ cks in one day from the di@@ r@@ t bene@@ ath my fe@@ et and built a tra@@ c@@ tor in six days ."
"F@@ rom what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning ."
"If this idea is truly sound , then the im@@ plic@@ ations are sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ."
"A great@@ er di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion of the means of produc@@ tion , environ@@ men@@ tally sound supp@@ ly cha@@ ins , and a ne@@ w@@ ly re@@ lev@@ ant D@@ I@@ Y mak@@ er culture can ho@@ pe to tran@@ sc@@ end ar@@ ti@@ fi@@ cial sc@@ ar@@ city ."
We &apos;re ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the limit@@ s of what we all can do to make a better world with open har@@ d@@ ware technology .
Thank you .
( Applause )
"A thou@@ s@@ and years later , a m@@ am@@ mot@@ h di@@ ed in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n G@@ er@@ many ."
"A few centu@@ ries after that , a g@@ ri@@ ff@@ on v@@ ul@@ ture also di@@ ed in the same vi@@ c@@ in@@ ity ."
"And we know almost nothing about how these an@@ ima@@ ls m@@ et their de@@ a@@ ths , but these different cre@@ atures dis@@ per@@ sed across both time and space did share one re@@ mark@@ able f@@ ate ."
Th@@ ink about that for a second .
"It seems pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that you would inv@@ ent the fl@@ ute , a to@@ ol that created u@@ sel@@ ess vi@@ bra@@ tions in air molecules ."
But that is exactly what our an@@ c@@ est@@ ors did .
Now this turns out to be surpri@@ sing@@ ly common in the history of in@@ nov@@ ation .
"But just as of@@ ten , new ideas come into the world simply because they &apos;re fu@@ n ."
T@@ ake what may be the most important inv@@ ention of modern times : pro@@ gr@@ am@@ ma@@ ble comp@@ uters .
"S@@ om@@ e@@ one came up with the bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant idea of tri@@ gg@@ ering s@@ oun@@ ds by pres@@ sing small le@@ ver@@ s with our fi@@ ng@@ ers , inv@@ ent@@ ing the first mu@@ si@@ cal ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ d ."
"In fact , the very first ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er was ori@@ gi@@ nally called &quot; &quot; the writ@@ ing har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d . &quot; &quot; F@@ l@@ utes and music led to even more power@@ ful b@@ re@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s ."
"A@@ b@@ out a thou@@ s@@ and years ago , at the he@@ ight of the I@@ s@@ l@@ ami@@ c R@@ e@@ nai@@ s@@ san@@ ce , three bro@@ thers in B@@ a@@ gh@@ da@@ d desig@@ ned a de@@ vice that was an au@@ to@@ mat@@ ed org@@ an ."
"They called it &quot; &quot; the in@@ stru@@ ment that pla@@ ys itself . &quot; &quot; Now , the in@@ stru@@ ment was basically a gi@@ ant music bo@@ x ."
This in@@ stru@@ ment was the first of its kind .
It was pro@@ gr@@ am@@ ma@@ ble .
"Now , con@@ cep@@ tually , this was a mas@@ sive le@@ ap for@@ ward ."
The whole idea of har@@ d@@ ware and sof@@ t@@ ware becomes thin@@ k@@ able for the first time with this inv@@ ention .
It came from the strange d@@ eli@@ ght of wat@@ ching a machine pla@@ y music .
"In fact , the idea of pro@@ gr@@ am@@ ma@@ ble ma@@ chin@@ es was ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely k@@ ep@@ t ali@@ ve by music for about 7@@ 00 years ."
"In the 1@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0s , mu@@ si@@ c@@ -@@ making ma@@ chin@@ es became the play@@ things of the P@@ ari@@ si@@ an el@@ ite ."
"And as de V@@ au@@ can@@ son was desig@@ ning his ro@@ b@@ ot mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , he had another idea ."
"If you could pro@@ gra@@ m a machine to make p@@ le@@ as@@ ing s@@ oun@@ ds , why not pro@@ gra@@ m it to w@@ ea@@ ve d@@ eli@@ ght@@ ful patt@@ er@@ ns of col@@ or out of cl@@ ot@@ h ?"
"If you wanted a new patt@@ ern for your f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , you just pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ed a new c@@ y@@ lin@@ der ."
This was the first pro@@ gr@@ am@@ ma@@ ble lo@@ om .
So ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
"Y@@ es , the mil@@ it@@ ary inv@@ ol@@ v@@ ement is an important part of the story , but inv@@ ent@@ ing a computer also requi@@ red other building blo@@ cks : music bo@@ x@@ es , to@@ y ro@@ b@@ ot fl@@ ute play@@ ers , har@@ p@@ si@@ ch@@ or@@ d ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds , col@@ or@@ ful patt@@ er@@ ns wo@@ ven into f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , and that &apos;s just a small part of the story ."
N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ity isn &apos;t always the mother of inv@@ ention .
"The play@@ ful state of mind is fund@@ am@@ en@@ tally explo@@ rat@@ ory , se@@ ek@@ ing out new possi@@ bil@@ ities in the world around us ."
And that se@@ ek@@ ing is why so many experi@@ ences that started with simple d@@ eli@@ ght and am@@ u@@ se@@ ment even@@ tually led us to pro@@ found b@@ re@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
E@@ very@@ one needs a co@@ ach .
"It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a ba@@ sk@@ et@@ b@@ all play@@ er , a ten@@ n@@ is play@@ er , a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ st or a bri@@ dge play@@ er ."
We all need people who will give us fe@@ ed@@ back .
That &apos;s how we improve .
"@@ U@@ n@@ for@@ tu@@ nately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic fe@@ ed@@ back to help them do their j@@ ob@@ s better , and these people have one of the most important j@@ ob@@ s in the world ."
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
"When M@@ el@@ in@@ da and I learned how little u@@ se@@ ful fe@@ ed@@ back most teachers get , we were blo@@ wn away ."
"@@ U@@ n@@ ti@@ l rec@@ ently , over 9@@ 8 percent of teachers just got one word of fe@@ ed@@ back : S@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ t@@ ory ."
"If all my bri@@ dge co@@ ach ever told me was that I was &quot; &quot; sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory , &quot; &quot; I would have no ho@@ pe of ever getting better ."
How would I know who was the best ?
How would I know what I was doing differ@@ ently ?
"T@@ o@@ day , di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts are re@@ v@@ am@@ ping the way they ev@@ alu@@ ate teachers , but we still give them almost no fe@@ ed@@ back that actually hel@@ ps them improve their p@@ rac@@ ti@@ ce ."
O@@ ur teachers de@@ serve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fai@@ r to them .
"It &apos;s not fai@@ r to students , and it &apos;s put@@ ting America &apos;s global lead@@ er@@ ship at ris@@ k ."
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the to@@ ols for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement they want and de@@ serve .
Let &apos;s start by asking who &apos;s doing well .
"Well , un@@ for@@ tu@@ nately there &apos;s no inter@@ national ran@@ king ta@@ b@@ les for teacher fe@@ ed@@ back systems ."
Con@@ sider the ran@@ k@@ ings for read@@ ing pro@@ fi@@ ci@@ enc@@ y .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th with I@@ cel@@ and and P@@ ol@@ and .
"Now , out of all the pla@@ ces that do better than the U.S. in read@@ ing , how many of them have a forma@@ l system for hel@@ ping teachers improve ?"
E@@ lev@@ en out of 14 .
"The U.S. is ti@@ ed for 1@@ 5@@ th in read@@ ing , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in ma@@ th ."
"So there &apos;s really only one are@@ a where we &apos;re ne@@ ar the top , and that &apos;s in fai@@ ling to give our teachers the help they need to devel@@ op their skil@@ ls ."
"@@ Let &apos;s look at the best acade@@ mic perfor@@ mer : the pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of S@@ h@@ ang@@ hai , China ."
"Now , they r@@ ank number one across the bo@@ ar@@ d , in read@@ ing , ma@@ th and science , and one of the ke@@ ys to S@@ h@@ ang@@ hai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep im@@ pro@@ ving ."
They made sure that you@@ ng@@ er teachers get a chan@@ ce to watch ma@@ ster teachers at work .
"They have we@@ ek@@ ly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working ."
They even requi@@ re each teacher to ob@@ serve and give fe@@ ed@@ back to their colle@@ ag@@ ues .
"You might ask , why is a system like this so important ?"
It &apos;s because there &apos;s so much vari@@ ation in the teach@@ ing profes@@ sion .
S@@ ome teachers are far more eff@@ ec@@ tive than others .
"In fact , there are teachers throu@@ gh@@ out the country who are hel@@ ping their students make extra@@ ordinary ga@@ ins ."
"If today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blo@@ wing away the rest of the world ."
So we need a system that hel@@ ps all our teachers be as good as the best .
What would that system look like ?
"Well , to find out , our f@@ oun@@ dation has been working with 3@@ ,000 teachers in di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts across the country on a project called M@@ ea@@ su@@ res of E@@ ff@@ ec@@ tive T@@ ea@@ ching ."
